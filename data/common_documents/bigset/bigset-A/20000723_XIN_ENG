BERLIN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Gaston Gaudio set up an all-
Argentine final against Franco Squillari at Stuttgart Open men's
tennis tournament after outlasting Australian Andrew Ilie 6-2, 6-4
in the semi-finals on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Squillari topped Daniel Elsner 7-6, 7-6 in the other semifinal
to end the unheralded German Wild Card's run.
</P>
<P>
It took Gaudio just over an hour to sail past a clumsy Ilie for
his first final at a major tournament.
</P>
<P>
Fifth seed Squillari, the only seed alive in the tournament,
showed more composure when it mattered to win his match.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Elsner, who had never reached the second round
of a major tournament before, had his chances, wasting a set point
in the first tie-break before losing it 8-6.
</P>
<P>
Elsner saved two match points in the ninth game of the second
set but, in the ensuing tie-break, the 24-year-old Squillari
squandered his first match point before his opponent hit a
backhand long to lose it 7-5.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- After being relegated for the
first time ever last year from the World Group, Sweden regained
its place among the 16 top nations in Bastad, Sweden on Saturday
by taking a 3-0 lead over India in their qualifier.
</P>
<P>
The experienced Nicklas Kulti teamed with Mikael Tillstrom for
the clinching point, outlasting Mahesh Bhupathi and Syed
Fazzaluddin in the doubles 6-3, 3-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 in more than
three hours, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Sweden won the opening singles Friday on the slow red clay for
a 2-0 lead, rookie Andreas Vinciguerra and Tillstrom both scoring
straight-set wins.
</P>
<P>
Reverse singles, expected to be shortened to best-of-three
sets, are Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sweden prevailed despite missing two of its highest-ranked
players, Magnus Norman and Thomas Enqvist. Norman, who moved atop
the Champions Race by winning the Swedish Open final last Sunday
against Vinciguerra, decided to play this week's tournament in
Stuttgart, Germany, where he was the defending champion. Enqvist
injured his right shoulder in practice and withdrew Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Swedes suffered a shocking setback at home to
Slovakia in the first round that eliminated them from the World
Group.
</P>
<P>
India will drop to zonal play next year.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Needs New Cadre System to Achieve Total Emancipation: Zuma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG , July 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa must build a
new, dedicated, unselfish and determined cadre system so as to
achieve total emancipation,, Deputy President Jacob Zuma said on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Zuma was speaking at the Lingelihle community hall in Cradock,
Eastern Cape Province -- ahead of the unveiling of a monument and
launch of a trust fund for slain ANC activists from the town known
as the "Cradock Four".
</P>
<P>
"This new cadre must be ready to serve the nation at all times,
" Zuma said in remarks published by the South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
 The activists -- Matthew Goniwe, Fort Calata, Sparrow Mkhonto
and Sicelo Mhlauli -- were killed while travelling between Cradock
and Port Elizabeth in June 1985 during the apartheid rule.
</P>
<P>
Their stabbed and burnt bodies were found in the dunes on a
vacant stretch of coast and police at first claimed that they had
been victims of vigilante killings.
</P>
<P>
However years later seven apartheid security policemen
confirmed the suspicions of many of the locals of the time, and
admitted carrying out the killings.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Zuma said that honoring the Cradock and other
fallen heroes of the struggle would strengthen the link between
fighting for freedom and the democracy South Africans enjoyed
since 1994 when a black government took power.
</P>
<P>
"Let's remember them for the sacrifices they made for the
freedom we have today. People were arrested....others were
imprisoned for long, some died in the hands of the apartheid
agents. Many people paid the supreme price for this democracy we
have today.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said although Cradock was a small town, it responded
positively to the African National Congress' call to supply cadres
who would join the fight against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
The death of Goniwe and many other fallen heroes, the deputy
president said, should strengthen the resolve of South Africans to
defend the country's young democracy.
</P>
<P>
He said there was need to acknowledge that it took long to end
apartheid, and therefore it would also take long to correct the
wrongs of the white minority rule of more than four decades.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Warns Against Lawlessness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Saturday warned Zimbabweans against lawless activities that can
lead the country into chaos.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks at the National Consultative Assembly
meeting of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front (Zanu-pf) in Harare, Mugabe said his government did not want
to be pushed into a situation it would apply the full weight of
its security agents.
</P>
<P>
"Democracy yes, but chaos no," declared Mugabe in apparent
reference to tendencies by mostly member of the opposition
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) rowdily denounce him and his
party.
</P>
<P>
In his wide ranging speech, Mugabe welcomed Zanu-pf's narrow
victory in the June parliamentary election but stressed the need
to rejuvenate the party with special emphasis on grassroots
structures.
</P>
<P>
He attacked factionalism which has rocked the party's top
leadership and said Zanu-pf's greatest challenge is to keep in
touch with people's aspirations.
</P>
<P>
"We need to re-establish genuine bonds with the grassroots
membership of the party as this is the only way we can keep in
touch with the always changing needs of the majority," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said people blamed his party for the present economic
hardships ignoring the reality of a skewed international trading
system which continued to cause problems for the local economy.
</P>
<P>
The long search for a new international order, Mugabe said, had
proved elusive and there is need for the party to consider home
grown solutions to some of the poverty and destitution experienced
by people.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the accelerated land distribution
exercise launched last week would resolve the twin evils of
poverty and overcrowding in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland to Return Part of Looted Money to Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government has agreed to
hand over to Nigeria some of the money held in bank accounts
linked to the late Nigerian military ruler, General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcast Corporation (BBC) Saturday quoted a
judicial official in Geneva as saying on Friday that 66 million U.
S. dollars was being returned to the Nigerian authorities.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 million dollars is still frozen in Swiss accounts
said to belong to the general, his family and associates.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's yera-old democratic government is keen to retrieve
the millions that were embezzled by the general, who died in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In May, Luxembourg announced it had frozen bank accounts
associated with the late Nigerian ruler containing a total of 600
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo believes General Abacha
siphoned off a total of 3 billion dollars, of which about two
thirds has been traced to bank accounts in various European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's administration says General Abacha used a circle of
family members, close aides and business associates to dispose of
the cash which he plundered from the state.
</P>
<P>
It was amassed by awarding contracts to front companies,
accepting massive bribes, and by siphoning money directly from the
Nigerian treasury.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Coffee Prices Boosted by Brazil Frost Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan coffee prices climbed
across the board at this week auction, boosted by speculation that
frost could hamper crop production in Brazil, the East African
Standard newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The overall sale average climbed to 110 U.S. dollars per 50-kg
bag from 84 dollars per bag at last week's auction, the Nairobi
Coffee Exchange said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rise in the average price was the highest for the past five
months.
</P>
<P>
"The dual combination of good weather here and bad weather in
Brazil has been a real boom for the market," one trader said.
</P>
<P>
Major coffee growing areas in Brazil, the world's largest
producer, have been hit by successive blasts of cold winter air
last week.
</P>
<P>
The traders said prices could hold steady in coming weeks as
Kenyan weather improves.
</P>
<P>
But some traders said the fears of major damage to Brazil's
crop appear to have been exaggerated and suggested prices could
fall next week as the market takes its lead from a slide in London
coffee futures Thursday after another frost-free morning in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
However, some forecasts suggest there could be a new cold wave
through Brazil's coffee belt next week.
</P>
<P>
All 32,679 bags offered at this week's auction was sold, the
Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda on Priority List of Debt Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and eight other countries
have qualified for debt reduction that would eventually exceed 15
billion U.S. dollars, said the Group of seven industrial nations
at the G8 summit in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The other countries are Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Honduras,
Mauritania, Mozambique, Senegal and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Leading industrial countries admitted they must breathe life
into a stalled initiative to reduce the debts of the world's
poorest states but refused to ease the strict conditions on the
scheme, said the New Vision daily Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As many as 11 more countries could become eligible for debt
reduction by the end of this year, according to a communique
issued after the first session of talks at the summit.
</P>
<P>
The relief is a far cry, however, from the ambitious target of
100 billion dollars that the leaders trumpeted when they drew up
the plan at last year's summit in Cologne.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Enact Laws to Protect AIDS Orphans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will set up
legal structure to protect AIDS orphans from abuse by relatives,
according to a Kenyan official.
</P>
<P>
The rights of AIDS orphans are often violated when relatives
divide properties left behind by their parents, Kenya's Attorney
General Amos Wako was quoted by Saturday's East African Standard
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new laws will ensure the orphans benefit from the
properties of their parents or guardians, Wako said on Friday when
launching a book entitled AIDS Education for Children.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will also publish a Children's Bill
which will guarantee the children's right to education.
</P>
<P>
Wako said that the law on confidentiality between doctors and
patients should be amended to ensure that relatives of the AIDS
victims were informed of the cause of deaths.
</P>
<P>
Since the first AIDS case was detected in the east African
country in 1984, about 2 million Kenyans have been infected with
the epidemic and about 900,000 children orphaned by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that if the trend is not checked, the number
for orphans caused by the AIDS scourge will soar to 1.5 million by
the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Hails Uganda's Replacement of Army Commander in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
welcomed the appointment in Uganda of a new commander to replace
Brigadier James Kazini, overall commander of its army forces in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the replacement of Kazini in the Congo is in the
interest of both Uganda and Rwanda," the New Vision daily quoted
Rwandan presidential adviser on security Emmanuel Ndahiro as
saying on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We only wait to see how the situation evolves. We both pledged
to work more closely and sort out the problems that had arisen in
the past. The new players in the Congo signify a new chapter in
our relationship in the Congo intervention," Ndahiro said.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier Edward Katumba Wamala, the former commander of the
4th Division of the Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF) based in
the northern Ugandan district Gulu, has been appointed to replace
Kazini as overall UPDF commander in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Katumba has just returned from the United States where he
completed a one-year military course, attaining a diploma in
strategic leadership at the Army War College in Carlisle,
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan officials have in the past accused Kazini of
exacerbating tension between the UPDF and the Rwanda Patriotic
Army after the two armies clashed last year and this year in the
Congolese city of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
However, Uganda has not linked Kazini's recall to his role in
Kisangani. Army Spokesman Phinehas Katirima told Xinhua Friday
that there was no case against Kazini. Kazini remains the UPDF's
Chief of Staff.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no speculations. The Commander-in-Chief
appoints his officers and commanders the best way he sees fit,"
said Katirima.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals to Rise in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is expecting a 25-percent
increase in tourist arrivals by the end of this year, said the
country's tourism minister.
</P>
<P>
"The tourist sector is on a recovery path," Kenyan Minister for
Tourism, Trade and Industry Nicholas Biwott was quoted as saying
by Saturday's East African Standard newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Biwott said that the county received a total of 969,300
visitors last year compared with 834,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the slight increase in tourist arrivals did not mean
the sector's problems were over, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"The increase does not mean that we are out of the woods but
can serve as a spur to promote and market Kenya as a tourist
destination," he told the stake-holders in the field in the Indian
Ocean resort Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
The tourism ministry has embarked on an ambitious policy aimed
at providing the industry with a business-friendly environment,
according to Biwott.
</P>
<P>
With its unique tropical wildlife parks and good hotels, Kenyan
has been a popular destination in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is the third biggest foreign exchange earner after
coffee and tea for the east African country. However, the sector
has suffered a slump due to insecurity and violence in the
previous general elections since mid-1990s.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Prevent Energy Shortage in Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government is taking
steps to prevent an energy shortage in this winter, reported the
Anatolia News Agency on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that the water levels have recently dropped to
critically low points in Keban, Karakaya and Ataturk dams as a
result of severe drought in the southeast, where most of the
country's electricity are generated, the Ministry of Energy and
Natural Resources has started operating thermic power plants in
full capacity and set up floating power plants.
</P>
<P>
Other measures have been taken to encourage auto-producing
facilities to produce their own energy and keep a spare tanker in
full load with liquid natural gas (LNG) at Marmara Ereglisi, west
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from the Energy and Natural Resources Ministry
told reporters that all thermic power plants will have to work in
full capacity this winter.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Finance Ministry is considering to
exempt auto-producers from fuel consumption tax so that they can
achieve their own power self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
The state-run power supply company TEAS is getting ready to
operate floating power plants in case of a power shortage, he said.
The Prime Ministry has also issued a circular to all public offices
asking them to use energy economically.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry official said that due to the bad weather, tankers
carrying imported liquefied natural gas arrived at Marmara Ereglisi
with an average delay of 8 to 10 days recently, which had resulted
in a short supply of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Months of frequent power cuts last winter still remain fresh in
people's memory. The country's natural gas-fired power plants
operated in low capacity due to an irregular supply of the fuels
from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, poor in carbon fuels, largely relies on oil- and natural
gas- producing countries for its ever-increasing domestic demands
for energy.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak will consider
forming an emergency national unity government with the Likud
opposition if the Camp David summit ends in failure, Yisrael
Ba'aliya Party leader Natan Sharansky said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky said, in a release to the media, that Barak told him
this by phone Saturday night from Camp David in Maryland, the
United States, where he is holding a crucial summit with
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat in a bid to
hammer out a peace deal to end the half-century Israeli-Palestinian
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky, the former interior minister who quit the government
on the eve of Barak's departure for the summit together with the
two religious parties in the coalition -- the National Religious
Party (NRP) and the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, told Barak that if
he agrees to share sovereignty over Jerusalem with the
Palestinians, he would be "the first Jewish leader in 3,000 years
to divide Jerusalem." (Israel-Politics-Barak)

<P>
BAGHDAD, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraq repeated its rejection of the
United Nations Resolution 1284 on Sunday, citing that the
resolution aims to prolong the U.N. sanctions on Iraq, the official
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The latest refusal of the U.N. resolution was made during a
symposium held by the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party and
attended by President Saddam Hussein and Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi people refuse to accept the resolution because it aims to
keep the decade-old sanctions on Iraq in place, Saddam was quoted
by the INA as saying.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the Iraqi president to speak out
against the U.N. resolution after it was passed by the U.N.
Security Council last December.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were echoed by Ramadan, who said the sanctions will
never be lifted by a U.N. resolution, but by the steadfastness of
the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has intensified its rhetoric against the U.N. resolution
recently.
</P>
<P>
In an interview by the official Jumhuriya newspaper on July 16,
Ramadan said the U.N. resolution is "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"This resolution aims at making our country a U.S.-British
protectorate. We totally reject the resolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan is just one of the senior Iraqi officials who have
expressed rejection of the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
The arms inspection group, called the U.N. Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), was set up by the
U.N. following the adoption of the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution offers to ease sanctions on Iraq if it allows the
UNMOVIC to verify its destruction of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has insisted the total lifting of sanctions is a
precondition for the return of U.N. arms inspectors.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Not to Seek UN Permanent Seat Alone </HEADLINE>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma on Sunday denied that her ministry
had sent a memorandum proposing that South Africa should go it
alone for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Zuma was responding to a report in the Sunday Independent
newspaper which claimed that the cabinet was considering a request
from the UN division in her ministry to pursue permanent
membership of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
According to Zuma's spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa, no such
memorandum was sent to the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that South Africa was becoming more open
about its ambitions for the seat. However, it is a move that would
put it on a collision course with other ambitious African
countries, especially Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The minister would like to stress that the relations between
South Africa, Nigeria and Egypt remain on sound footing, Mamoepa
was quoted by the South African Press Association as saying.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Gives Burundi Parties Two Weeks to Study Draft Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Burundian peace mediator and
former South African President Nelson Mandela has given two weeks
to the parties attending peace talks in northern Tanzanian town of
Arusha to study the final draft peace agreement before its
scheduled signing on August 28.
</P>
<P>
Head of Mandela's facilitation team, Judge Mark Bomani, said
over the weekend that Mandela had agreed to the request from
delegates to give them some time to study the revised version of
the peace accord, adding however that there has to be a sense of
urgency.
</P>
<P>
He told leaders of the parties that the peace mediator does not
expect "reopening of the negotiations when the delegates reconvene
here on August 7".
</P>
<P>
"It has taken two years to prepare the draft agreement and
reopening negotiations on the agreement means that it will take
much longer to reach peace accord," Bomani explained.
</P>
<P>
But Bomani said if there was consensus of all parties on
certain aspect of the draft peace agreement, that aspect will be
entertained.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was in Arusha earlier this week to brief regional
leaders on the outstanding issues of the two-year peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Burundian delegation heads and six
Great Lakes region leaders, Mandela said he was confident an
accord could be signed on August 28, and that only the issues of
who should lead a transitional government before elections and the
timing of cessation of hostilities were yet to be settled.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian conflict between the minority Tutsi dominated
government and Hutu rebels broke out in October 1993, when Tutsi
paratroopers assassinated Melchior Ndadaye, who was from the
majority Hutu group and won Burundi's first democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who was appointed mediator last December after the
death of former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, has been
trying to speed up the talks, which have made little progress
since July 1998, and invited all Hutu rebel groups that had been
previously excluded to take part in the peace talks in Arusha.

<HEADLINE> EU Considers Anti-Trust Ruling on B2B Joint Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Sunday that it is considering a key anti-trust ruling on business-
to-business (B2B) marketplace.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation bloc, is in
the final stage of a preliminary review of MyAircraft.com to see
whether the deal of the joint venture is compatible with the EU
competition rules.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, an online B2B vendor of aircraft spare parts
and engines, combines Honey International Inc., United
Technologies Corp. and i2 Technologies Inc..
</P>
<P>
It will be the first commission ruling on a B2B case and is
expected to set precedents if the commission rules off the joint
venture. The commission has until August 7 to rule whether it has
approved MyAircraft.com or has decided to launch an in-depth, four-
month probe into the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
The commission is against one potential violation of the EU
competition rules and that violation is when the companies in the
B2B joint venture exchange price or other sensitive information
via the net that will be viewed by the EU as carteling and the
European Union will not authorize the practice.
</P>
<P>
Other companies in the aircraft industry have also pronounced
their interest in joining hands to form online sales platforms.
Boeing Co., Lockheed Martin Corp. both of the United States and
Britain's BAe Systems Plc. have unveiled their plan for a Global
Aerospace and Defense Trading Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Develop Gas Field with Foreign Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Oil Ministry will soon sign a
contract with a foreign firm to develop the fourth and fifth stages
of the South Pars gas field in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The foreign firm will provide 60 percent of the investments
while an Iranian company provides the rest, according to the deal
to be signed shortly, Mohammad Sohfi, public relations director of
the Oil Ministry, was quoted on Sunday by the Islamic Republic News
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The South Pars gas field has 10 trillion cubic meters of gas
reserves worth 300 billion U.S. dollars at the current market
price, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign firm has undertaken to transfer advanced
technology and skilled workforce to implement the project, adding
the firm will receive the returns and interests from the output of
the project in a 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
Once completed, the project will yield 50 million cubic meters
of refined gas per day and 80,000 barrels of gas fluid per day for
export. It will also produce 40,000 tons of sulfur and over one
billion tons of liquefied natural gas annually.
</P>
<P>
A consortium of Total Sa of France, Gazprom of Russia and
Petronas of Malaysia are now working on the second and third stages
of South Pars gas field.
</P>
<P>
Sohfi declined to give the foreign firm's name, but a report
carried Sunday by the Persian daily "Iran" said Italy's Eni will be
the choice.
</P>
<P>
The report said Iran's Petro-Pars company will also participate
in the contract to be signed this week, which is valued at over 4.3
billion dollars.

NICOSIA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
Sunday departed for Geneva to attend the second phase of the third
round of the U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides, Attorney General Alecos
Markides and government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou have already
arrived in Geneva for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Some parties' leaders, including right-wing Democratic Rally

Demetris Christofias, Movement of Social Democrats President Vassos
Lyssarides and United Democrats President George Vassiliou, also

</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of proximity talks, separate meetings of the U.N.
with either side in Cyprus, have been held since December 1999. The
talks aim at preparing the ground for substantive negotiations
leading to a comprehensive settlement.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks, which began on July 5 in Geneva, will
resume on July 24.
</P>
<P>
According to a CNA (Cyprus News Agency) report from Geneva,
Clerides will repeat the Greek Cyrpiot side's position on the
Cyprus issue on July 24, when the two sides will be asked to
comment on the ideas put forward by Alvaro de Soto, the U.N.
chief's special adviser who is conducting the meetings.
</P>
<P>
De Soto had verbally submitted a set of ideas to Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash during the first phase of the
third round of proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks beginning Monday will continue until August 4.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that de Soto will give the two sides more
detailed ideas so that negotiations could begin in the meetings
scheduled to take place in September in New York.

Hasikos Sunday said he will express to the Europe the will of the
Cyprus government to contribute in the whole effort of the European
Union (EU) for common security policy and other issues related to
defense.
</P>
<P>
He noted Cyprus' contribution can be in the form of providing
facilities, such as ports and airports, as well as staff at the
EU's request.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency, Hasikos Sunday departed for
Brussels, where he will meet with Western European Union (WEU)
General Secretary and EU high representative for Common Foreign
Policy and Security Policy, Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before his departure from Larnaca Airport, Cyprus'
southern coast, Hasikos said he will discuss with Solana the latest
developments in the Cyprus issue, the island's EU accession course,
and issues concerning European defense and security.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the eastern Mediterranean island after a failed
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Since then, a 180-kilometer-long buffer zone across the island
has divided the two rival sides.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side took measures in early July to restrict
UNFICYP's (the U.N. peacekeeping force in Cyprus) movement in
northern Cyprus to retaliate the Security Council's renewal of the
mandate of UNFICYP without asking for their prior approval.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Turkish troops stationed in Turkish Cypriot area
have set up a new checkpoint in Strovilia inhabited by some 15
Greek Cypriots, thus changing the military status quo in the area.
</P>
<P>
The setting up of a checkpoint in Strovilia is the first
military advance by Turkish troops since 1974.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Launches Website for Information Technology Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- An official and special internet
website for Jordan's information technology (IT) experts was
inaugurated on Sunday to serve as a bridge between the kingdom's IT
talents and the lucrative job markets at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration of the website was aimed at building an
accurate and comprehensive database on Jordanian talents in the IT
sector, including working professionals, students at universities,
institutes, community colleges that are eligable to enter the IT
market, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
They said a promotion campaign will soon be launched in the
kingdom to attract IT experts to register at the website, including
their personal information, education, certificate, language
proficiency and work experience.
</P>
<P>
The website, or www. it.jo, is jointly launched by the Jordanian
government and the powerful Economic Consultative Council, headed
by King Abdullah Bin Hussein and mainly grouping government
officials, experts and business tycoons of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old monarch has called for all-out efforts in
building the kingdom into an IT center in the Middle East as part
of its efforts to trim the soaring unemployment rate, which stands
at over 14 percent by official statistics, if not at 27 percent by
independent research institutions.

<P>
Public and private universities and colleges in the kingdom
turned out some 2,300 graduates every year in various IT fields,
including computer softwares, hardwares and telecommunications.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zambia's New Opposition Leader Urged to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Wang Nengbiao
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's new opposition United
National Independence Party (UNIP) leader Francis Nkhoma is under
increasing pressure to step down.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday UNIP youth even barred the new leader, who was
elected two months ago to replace former leader Kenneth Kaunda,
from addressing a meeting held here, demanding his immediate
resignation because he had called for cooperation with the ruling
Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD).
</P>
<P>
Some Copperbelt University students said to be UNIP members
were quoted on Saturday as saying that Nkhoma should step down for
failing to unite the party two months after being elected new
leader.
</P>
<P>
One of them called for intervention of retired former Zambian
President Kaunda to reunite the party.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday over 50 enraged UNIP cadres converged at the
party headquarters here demanding immediate resignation of Nkhoma
for what they called "too many slip-ups".
</P>
<P>
They said Nkhoma, who was Eastern provincial chairman of MMD,
had one foot in UNIP and another in MMD as he allegedly does not
formally renounce his membership of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Ndola district chairman of UNIP James Chasaya said the district
leadership had called for impeachment of the new leader for
failing to reorganize the party to win the 2001 elections.
</P>
<P>
George Zulua, former adviser to UNIP Vice-President Inyamo Yeta,
said under the leadership of Nkhoma UNIP risks remaining a
perpetual opposition party after next year's elections and urged
UNIP cadres to step up their resistance to Nkhoma.
</P>
<P>
UNIP Mazabuka district leadership has passed a vote of no
confidence in Nkhoma.
</P>
<P>
But Nkhoma said there was no justification to press for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Nkhoma said, "our party is in tatters and is dormant in most
parts of the country and must be brought to life very urgently."
</P>
<P>
Last Monday The Post newspaper reported that Nkhoma has advised
UNIP central committee members to maintain good relationship with
MMD leadership.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the change of attitude toward the MMD government,
UNIP Vice-President Rabbison Chongo said they can't continue
pretending that they don't recognize the MMD government when it
has members of parliament and councilors within its institutions.

</P>
<P>
More than 2.8 million birr (about 340,000 U.S. dollars) were

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Greece to Enhance Agricultural Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Minister of Agriculture and
Rural Affairs Husnu Yusuf Gokalp said Sunday that development of
Turco-Greek relations could start with agricultural cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the first meeting of the Turco-Greek Joint

Agriculture Executive Committee, which was held in Greece's capital
Athens, Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed an agreement to increase mutual exchanges,
according to which, Greece will hold education programs and
seminars for Turkish experts and the two countries will carry out
joint studies in such fields as animal and plant health.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Gokalp said that an "atmosphere of
goodwill and dialogue" had been created by the Foreign Minsters of
the two countries, within which the agriculture ministers of the
two
countries paid mutual visits and agreed to carry out bilateral
agricultural cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that within the cooperation framework, Turkey can learn
from experience of Greece, a European Union (EU) member, in its
process of harmonization with EU agricultural standards.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a EU candidate, was stepping up its efforts to join the
European club through full-scale reforms in every field, including
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece are traditional regional rivals.
</P>
<P>
Ankara insists that there are several problems in the Aegean
Sea, such as the boundaries of each countries' territorial waters
and air space, but supports dialogue between the two countries as
the means of resolving the disputes.
</P>
<P>
Greece, on the other hand, maintains that the only dispute in
the Aegean is that of continental shelf rights. Athens wants the
International Court of Justice in The Hague to arbitrate.
</P>
<P>
The two North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members almost
went to war in 1996 over rival claims to rocky islets in the Aegean
called Imia in Greek and Kardak in Turkish. Tension was defused
after the mediation by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus question also remains as a major sticking point in
relations between Ankara and Athens.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two Aegean rivals have improved
significantly since last year, following a diplomatic rapprochement
and a burst of cooperation in the wake of devastating earthquakes
in both countries.
</P>
<P>
In last December, Greece backed an EU statement declaring Turkey
an official candidate for the EU membership at the Union's summit
in
Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
With the cooling of the longstanding tension between the two
neighboring rivals, the two sides have initiated dialogue and inked
several accords during mutual visits of foreign ministers in early
February, covering tourism, economic, agricultural, scientific and
technical cooperation.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Globalization presents the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members with
challenges as well as chances, said a high-ranking ASEAN official
Sunday here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on the eve of the 33rd ASEAN
ministerial meeting and other related meetings, Rodolfo Severino,
secretary-general of ASEAN, said ASEAN members are responding to
this rapid process with closer regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He added along with the globalization process, technology,
particularly information and communications, is also advancing
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN members have the capacity to use and enhance the
technology. Therefore, he said, globalization will be one of the
major topics the ASEAN members and their partners will review in
the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Only by this, he stressed, they will be able to maintain high
competitiveness in the world and achieve faster economic recovery
in the whole region.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The SAARC (South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation) Cardiological Conference
kicked off here Sunday with the aim to reduce the cases of
cardiovascular diseases through exchange of experiences and
transfer of technology among South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, president of the SAARC
Cardiac Society Satyavan Sharma said as all the nations in the
region have similar heart problems, transfer of technology will
help lower the number of cardiac patients.
</P>
<P>
"Since the heart treatment technology is highly expensive and
is beyond the reach of the poor, the conference is important in
bringing the technology with the reach of the people of the region
through sharing of experiences," Sharma said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, heart patients account for 10 percent
of the total population in the SAARC countries which groups Nepal,
India, Pakistan, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
About 150 cardiologists from SAARC countries are participating
in the three-day conference co-organized by the SAARC Cardiac
Society and the Cardiac Society of Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Stock Market Keeps Low Key for Mid-Year Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The price index of Jordan's Amman
Financial Market fell by 1.3 percent during the past week as the
selling pressure persisted and traders expected that most of the
listed companies would publish poor mid-year results.
</P>
<P>
The index closed at 135.18 points at the week ending on
Thursday, the lowest level since 1993, board sources said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 91 stocks traded during the week, the share prices of
38 companies fell while 33 made gains, with the price of the
flagship stock Arab Bank sinking by another 1.89 percent to close
at 156 Jordanian dinars (218.4 U.S. dollars) per share at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The turnover for the week totalled at 3.9 million dinars (5.46
million dollars) with a total of 3.4 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Virtually all the heavyweight companies listed on the market,
including the Arab Bank, the Housing Bank, Cairo Amman Bank, and
Jordan Phosphate Mines Company, suffered price losses in the week.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe the no-gain momentum and selling pressure will
persist in the market as most traders painted a gloomy picture for
poor mid-year results of the companies despite a better national
economic performance of the kingdom in this year.
</P>
<P>
The government has predicted a 3-percent economic growth in the
year 2000 from the 1.5 percent in 1999, which is rare and amazing
since the 1990 Gulf crisis.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Farmer Sentenced to 15 Years in Jail for Killing Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian farmer has been sentenced
to 15 years in jail with hard labor for striking his wife to death
with an axe just because she bought a 14-dollar dress.
</P>
<P>
The sentence was handed down on Saturday by Judge Mohammed Ahmed
Abu Hamid of the criminal court in the city of Suhag, 400
kilometers south of Cairo, the Middle East News Agency reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Mustafa, 45, has been described as a miser who neglected
his family's basic needs. He repeatedly hit his 31-year-old wife on
the head with an axe last November after he found her wearing a new
14-dollar dress, the news agency quoted court officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear how much the family earned in a month, but a
recent government report said the average annual income among
agricultural families in southern Egypt is about 600 U.S. dollars.
Egypt's per capita gross domestic product is estimated at 1,400
dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Michael Skibbe will become the
assistant coach on the rebuilding German national soccer team,
reported the weekly newspaper Bild am Sonntag on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Skibbe, fired by Borussia Dortmund last season,
will assist interim coach Rudi Voeller until June 30th when Bayer
Leverkusen's Christoph Daum takes over the German squad. The
announcement is expected to be made in the next few days, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Skibbe has earned a reputation for working well with the youth
at Dortmund. He is expected to take a similar post with the German
Soccer Federation when his stint as assistant coach ends.
</P>
<P>
The hiring of Skibbe would continue the trend of turning over
the national team over to a younger generation after its dismal
first-round ousting at Euro 2000.

<HEADLINE> Policeman Killed at Beijing's Summer Palace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A police officer was fatally
stabbed and two civilians injured this morning by two armed men in
a square at the Summer Palace, a famous tourist spot in the
Chinese capital, a spokesman with the Beijing Public Security
Bureau (BPSB) said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, 34-year-old officer Yuan Shiguang
with the Donggongmen Station of the BPSB's Haidian Branch, was on
patrol at 8:15 a.m. at the Summer Palace when he noticed two young
men acting suspiciously in the already huge crowd of visitors.
</P>
<P>
Yuan approached the pair at Donggongmen Square and began
talking to them, when one drew a knife from his belt and stabbed
Yuan in the stomach. Bystanders Zhang Lin and He Qi, who are not
from Beijing, ran to help Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The man who stabbed Yuan also knifed the two samaritans, one in
the arm and the other in the chest.
</P>
<P>
Despite their injuries, Yuan, Zhang and He ran after the
fleeing suspects. Yuan ran for about 70 meters before he fell to
the ground and died, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang and He caught one of the suspects about a kilometer into
the chase. The suspect was turned over to the police.
</P>
<P>
Both men were hospitalized but their wounds are not life-
threatening, sources with the BPSB said.
</P>
<P>
Haidian police who were on the lookout for the second suspect
caught him in western Beijing five hours after he fled the murder
scene.
</P>
<P>
Both suspects, who are migrants, are in police custody in
Beijing, the spokesman said, adding that the two have confessed to
the murder.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the past 20 years show that more than 5,000
Chinese police have died in the line of duty and 100,000 more were
injured. Some 533 policemen lost their lives and 5,885 were
wounded last year while on the job.

<HEADLINE> Qinghua Aims to Become Elite University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China's prestigious Qinghua
University will join the ranks of the world's elite universities
upon its 100th birthday in 2011, Beijing-based Guangming Daily
quoted the university president Wang Dazhong as pledging.
</P>
<P>
Though plagued by a money shortage, the university that
developed China's first silicon transistor and first atomic
reactor in the 1950s decided to set the goal and has stirred up
school spirit for the effort.
</P>
<P>
"It took international big-name universities hundreds of years
to emerge," Chinese President Jiang Zemin said in 1998. "But
besides the governmental support, what's more important is how
university leaders, teaching staff and students work together."
</P>
<P>
Gene scientist Cheng Jing, who owned several patents in the
United States, Britain and other European countries, decided to
work at Qinghua as it was the only university that allowed him to
choose his own research assistants.
</P>
<P>
Cheng's friends from Yale and Oxford and other international
experts soon joined him. The university now has 43 academicians
both from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Academy of
Engineering, more than any other university in the country.
</P>
<P>
Qinghua often invites alumnus such as those who contributed to
the country's development of atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb and
satellite, to give lectures to students.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the China Youth Daily showed that 36.22
percent of the 7,000 students who took this year's college
entrance examination thought Qinghua University is the best school
in the country, regardless of whether or not they could enroll
there.

<HEADLINE> Chief of Iran's Official News Agency Summoned to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Fereydoun Verdinejad, chief of
Iran's government-owned Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA),
appeared before Branch 1410 of Tehran's public court Sunday on
various charges.
</P>
<P>
Verdinejad told IRNA that he had been summoned for a lot of
charges, including old ones and news ones. Some charges were filed
against him when he was head of the government daily "Iran" months
ago.
</P>
<P>
The prominent journalist did not disclose the details of the
charges against him, but said that his accusers include the
conservative-controlled security forces, the hardline Islamic
vigilantes of Ansar-e Hezbollah, the Basij (volunteer forces
safeguarding Islamic values) and some individuals.
</P>
<P>
Verdinejad, an advocate of independent press, has guided IRNA
toward supporting President Mohammad Khatami's reform programs. He
has been frequently criticized for his views by opponents of the
reformist movement.
</P>
<P>
Since Khatami's reformist allies won an overwhelming victory in
February's parliamentary election, Iran's conservative
establishment has stepped up their efforts to crack down on the
reformist movement which had been growing stronger and stronger in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Using their powerful tool of the judiciary, the conservatives
have ordered the closure of some 18 reformist papers and journals
in the past few months. A number of reformist journalists were also
imprisoned on charges of libels, defamation and violating Islamic
principles.

CAIRO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel Meguid on Sunday called for development of the Arab-Chinese
relations through joint institutions.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Meguid told Egypt's Middle East News Agency that necessary
steps will be taken to implement a resolution adopted by the
league's Foreign Ministers Council on setting up an Arab-Chinese
forum grouping intellectuals and senior officials from both sides.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the pan-Arab forum said he will raise with the
Chinese side Arab ideas on creating the forum during his planned
visit to Beijing in November.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mohamad el-Saket, head of the Arab League's mission
in Beijing, told the news agency that Abdel Meguid will meet with
officials and intellectuals during his Chinese trip to discuss the
relations between Arab countries and China, and issues of mutual
concern.
</P>
<P>
El-Saket said all Arab countries have diplomatic relations with
China and the trade volume between the two sides stood at nine
billion U.S. dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also set up several joint projects in
different domains, he added.
</P>
<P>
Arab and Chinese leaderships are demonstrating increasing
interest in rendering bilateral economic relations on a par with
their distinguished political ties, el-Saket said.

NEW DELHI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- President K. R. Narayanan Sunday
accepted the resignation of Minister of Law, Justice and Company
Affairs Ram Jethmalani on the recommendation of Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
His resignation was asked for by the Prime Minister Saturday in

time-barred."

<P>
Jethmalani faxed his resignation Saturday night to Vajpayee who
forwarded it to the President.

<P>
The Supreme Court Friday made certain adverse remarks against
the government, saying that ministers should speak in one voice
and asked the government to file a fresh affidavit clarifying its
stand on report of the Srikrishna committee which probed the 1993
Mumbai riots.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Jethmalani indicated that the central government had
power under the constitution to direct the Maharashtra government

<HEADLINE> Visit to Uzbekistan Productive: Bangladeshi FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad Sunday at a press conference described his five-day
visit to Uzbekistan last week as productive, which ended up in the
signing of a protocol on annual consultations for boosting trade.
</P>
<P>
The Protocol signed by Azad and his Uzbek counterpart Abdul
Aziz Kamilov on July 20 would facilitate review of bilateral
relations and coordination of common position on major issues of
mutual interest, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen on his visit, Azad said trade and economic
cooperation dominated the official talks with Kamilov.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh made a five-point proposal during the talks, which
includes seeking most-favored nation treatment to exports from
Bangladesh, special facilities to Bangladeshi investors,
particularly allocation of U.S. dollar quotas to enable them to
purchase raw materials, capital equipment, machinery, and
repatriation of profits to Bangladesh as well, Azad said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also includes allowing Bangladeshi businessmen to
buy Uzbek cotton directly from the government of Uzbekistan at
mutually beneficial prices, increasing import of tea, medicines,
jute and jute goods, leather products, ready-made garments and
other consumer items from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
He also requested his counterpart to upgrade the Uzbek Consular
Agency in Dhaka and abolish visa fees between the two countries to
facilitate business and people-to-people contact.
</P>
<P>
Azad said the Uzbek Foreign Minister assured that his
government would favorably consider all the proposals of the
Bangladesh side.
</P>
<P>
Kamilov sought to develop cooperation between the Ministries of
Civil Aviation. Uzbekistan manufactures IL 114 passenger and cargo
aircraft and smaller aircraft for use in domestic sector. He
suggested that Bangladesh government might send a technical team
to Uzbekistan to study aircraft for eventual purchase.
</P>
<P>
The two-way trade between Dhaka and Taskent in the first four
months of 2000 was around 3 million U.S. dollars.

BANGKOK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) fully supports the territorial integrity of
Indonesia, Rodolfo Severino, secretary-general of ASEAN, said here
Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on the eve of the 33rd ASEAN
ministerial meeting, Severino said that "Indonesia is a very
important component of ASEAN, and any threat to the territorial
integrity of Indonesia has to be taken very seriously by ASEAN as
a whole."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question concerning the U.S. Theater Missile
Defense (TMD) program, the ASEAN official said that "ASEAN is
against any development that will tend to destabilize the
situation."
</P>
<P>
To another query about Pakistan's intention to establish
dialogue partnership with ASEAN, Severino said some countries, not
just Pakistan, are seeking dialogue partnership with ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
"But ASEAN decided some time ago it would rather consolidate
the dialogue system at this time because the system is overloaded,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no plan to expand the (ASEAN) dialogue system at this
time," Severino added.
</P>
<P>
On the question of the establishment of Southeast Asian nuclear-
free zone, Severino said that the Treaty on the Southeast Asia
Nuclear Weapons-Free Zone "is in force".

The Treaty was signed by seven ASEAN member countries and
Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar in Bangkok in 1995, and went into force
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Severino said that the "10 ASEAN countries are committed not to
produce, not to import, not to use, not to deploy nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Filipino Consumers Urged to Buy Local Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government urged its
people over the weekend to play an active role in boosting the
country's agriculture sector by patronizing local instead of
imported produce.
</P>
<P>
"Let's support our own farmers and our own products. Instead of
buying imported fruits, let's buy our own mangoes and bananas.
They are good," Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara said in an
interview on government radio.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's agriculture sector is slowly recovering
from a recent slump and needs the people's support to bounce back.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the agriculture sector is important as it
accounts for a big part of job opportunities in the country, he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to provisional data issued Friday by the Department
of Agriculture, agricultural production is expected to have grown
4.8 percent in the second quarter of this year, a marked
improvement from first quarter's mere 0.11 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Our agriculture sector is recovering. It was down in 1998, but
started to bounce back in 1999," Angara said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said the government will continue to focus
its efforts on the marketing and promotion of Philippine produce
abroad.
</P>
<P>
At present, Angara said the government is promoting local
fruits in the country, urging Filipinos to buy their own fruits
instead of imported fruits.
</P>
<P>
His department is also training local food exporters to make
their products more attractive, he added.

<HEADLINE> Investment in Bangladeshi EPZs Faces Major Setbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Investment in Bangladesh's two
export processing zones (EPZs) faced major setbacks in the wake of
raging trade union campaign, plummeting 52 percent in last fiscal
year (1999-2000) from previous mark, Bangladesh Export Processing
Zones Authority (BEPZA) announced here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to official publications, investment in Chittagong
EPZ and Dhaka EPZ dropped to 35 million U.S. dollars in fiscal
1999-2000 from 71.60 million dollars in fiscal 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is well informed about the (trade union) campaign.
Entrepreneurs show less confidence in their investment prospect
and opt for wait-and-see strategy till the eventuality," a high
official of the BEPZA said.
</P>
<P>
The situation is unlikely to improve unless the trade union
pressure exerted by the United States is reduced, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Under the strong pressure of the American Federation of Labor
and Congress for Industrial Organization, the U.S. government has
long been pressing Bangladesh to allow trade union activities in
the EPZs, even threatening to cancel the Generalized System of
Preference facilities on Bangladesh exports.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the trade union issue, officials cited another
reason for recession in investment. They said the BEPZA
discouraged the investors to set up ready-made garment (RMG) units
under quota category in the EPZs for the last one year following
objection from local RMG entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association is
against sharing the country's apparel export quota facilities with
the foreign entrepreneurs in the EPZs.
</P>
<P>
In the last fiscal, entrepreneurs remained reluctant to
implement their respective projects. Only seven industrial units
went into operation in Chittagong EPZ during last fiscal while not
a single one in Dhaka EPZ.
</P>
<P>
With a small number of industries in operation, employment of
local labor in last fiscal also dropped to 9,890 from 14,069 in
the previous fiscal.

<HEADLINE> Residents' Savings Deposits Flow to Bonds, Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese financial experts here
believe that the money not going into savings accounts has instead
flowed into treasury bonds, stocks, and consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Bureau of the Statistics, the savings
deposits of urban and rural residents at the end of June stood at
6.2 trillion yuan, up 348.7 billion yuan from the beginning of
this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the increase was 231.7 billion yuan less than that of
the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts pointed out that seven successive interest
rate cuts for deposits has prompted some Chinese to invest in
treasury bonds and stocks, and others to withdraw their money from
accounts to buy housing or consumer products.
</P>
<P>
Historically, most Chinese have tucked their earnings into
savings accounts on a regular basis, partly due to a lack of
investment channels.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey of the People's Bank of China indicated that
the number of urban residents who choose to demand deposit
increased from 56.3 percent in the first three months of this year
to 58 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 10.9 percent and 9.2 percent of the
depositors invested in treasury bonds and stocks respectively.
</P>
<P>
The numbers indicated 2.6 percentage and 1.6 percentage rises
over the first three months.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the issuing of 50 billion yuan and 60 billion yuan in
treasury bonds in March and May was warmly welcomed by investors,
and 90 percent of the treasury bonds were sold out within two
weeks because of the higher interest rate than that of savings
deposits.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Environmental Protection Stressed in Tapping Mineral Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China needs to adopt a more
conservative approach when exploiting mineral resources, as nearly
20,000 square kilometers of land have been destroyed from years of
mining, the vice minister of land and resources, Sun Wensheng,
said here today.
</P>
<P>
At the just-concluded fourth seminar for land and resources
management attended by mayors, Sun Wensheng warned that every year,
200 more square kilometers of land are threatened by mining. He
urged that a complete set of regulations be formed and that mining
companies bear the responsibility to protect the environment at
the sites where they are working.
</P>
<P>
He said that to ensure sustainable development, local
governments should be prepared to help mining companies to go in
for other business when mines are closed for preservation, and
offer more channels for re-employment of laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Sun also addressed several other problems in the mineral
industry that are in dire need of attention.
</P>
<P>
Any mines that are unlicensed, serious polluters or operating
without adequate safety precautions should be closed, he said.
</P>
<P>
More foreign capital should be introduced to the mining
industry, he said, adding that his ministry will soon adopt new
polices to facilitate foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Treasured Porcelain Pieces to be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A descendant from the royal family
of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) recently authorized a Shanghai
auction house to sell 100 treasured porcelain pieces believed to
have been made in court kilns of the Qing Dynasty and the Ming
Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
News of the auction, which will be organized by Shanghai New
Century Auction Company on September 10, has caught the attention
of collectors and auctioneers worldwide, Wenhui Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that only limited number of porcelain items of the
kind remain in the world, the Shanghai-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
They also said that if the pieces prove to be authentic, they
were most likely made in an ancient official kiln in Jingdezhen, a
city in east Jiangxi Province which is famous for porcelain
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Many noted collectors and auctioneers have gone to Shanghai to
get a close-up look at the auction lots, and some have cast doubts
on their authenticity, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Shanghai auction house invited Xue Guisheng,
member of the National Committee for Cultural Relics
Authentication and Preservation, and Liu Xinyuan, director of
Jingdezhen Ceramics Research Institute, to appraise the items.

<HEADLINE> Barak Mulls Forming National Unity Government If Summit Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
will consider forming an emergency national unity government with
the Likud opposition if the Camp David summit ends in failure,
Yisrael Ba'aliya Party leader Natan Sharansky said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky said, in a release to the media, that Barak told him
this by phone Saturday night from Camp David in Maryland, the
United States, where he is holding a crucial summit with
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat in a bid to
hammer out a peace deal to end the half-century Israeli-Palestinian
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky, the former interior minister who quit the government
on the eve of Barak's departure for the summit together with the
two religious parties in the coalition -- the National Religious
Party (NRP) and the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, told Barak that if
he agrees to share sovereignty over Jerusalem with the
Palestinians, he would be "the first Jewish leader in 3,000 years
to divide Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
This was their first phone conversation since Barak left for the
summit on July 10. Following his withdrawal from the government,
Sharansky has set up a "protest tent" outside the prime minister's
office in Jerusalem, calling for the establishment of a national
unity government when the country is to make fateful decisions with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
NRP Chair and former Minister of Construction and Housing
Yitzhak Levy said that Barak is preparing the public in Israel for
his return from Camp David without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
During a telephone conversation, Levy told Barak that
compromises on Jerusalem would tear the country apart.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli and Palestinian negotiation teams at Camp David have
been engaged in tense negotiations under the direct involvement of
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who was replaced by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright over the weekend while attending a G-8 summit in
Okinawa in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The issues at stake include the status of Jerusalem, borders,
water resources, the future of Jewish settlements and the
Palestinian refugees. While significant progress has reportedly
been made on most issues, the status of Jerusalem remains the
sticking point which brought the summit to the verge of collapse
last week prior to Clinton's departure for the G-8 meeting.
</P>
<P>
Barak has vowed to keep a united Jerusalem under Israeli control
which is one of the "red lines" he took to Camp David, although
aides have hinted he could accept sharing sovereignty in some parts
of Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
There has also been strong opposition inside Israel against
attempts to divide Jerusalem, home to holy sites of Islam and
Christianity, as well as Judaism.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, on the other hand, have been demanding full
sovereignty over east Jerusalem which Israel captured during the
1967 Six-day War.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to press leaks that there have been U.S. bridging
proposals over Jerusalem, Asad Abdel Rahman, the Palestinian
Liberation Organization's Washington representative told Voice of
Palestine radio outside the West Bank city of Ramallah that no U.S.
proposals have been put forth at the summit.
</P>
<P>
He said that there would be no peace deal without full
Palestinian sovereignty over east Jerusalem and that the
Palestinian position at Camp David is well known to both Israel and
the U.S..
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a senior Israeli source at Camp David told the
media late Saturday that the mood in the Israeli delegation was
somber.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite Clinton's optimistic tone prior to his
departure from the three-day economic summit in Okinawa, chances
for a deal seemed to be diminishing.
</P>
<P>
The source predicted that Clinton would have just 24 hours from
the time he returns to take stock and try to turn things around.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said earlier that Barak's chief of staff
planned to leave on Sunday. About 20 of the 50 experts in Barak's
delegation had already gone home "because of a lack of progress in
the negotiations and a lack of work to do," Israeli officials said
late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The group of senior Israeli officials and technical experts were
standing by at a facility near Camp David to work out the nuts and
bolts of a final Middle East peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton left Okinawa early Sunday and was expected to return to
Andrews Air Force Base at 1950 GMT and go directly to Camp David.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president rescued the peace talks from the brink of
collapse Wednesday before heading for the G-8 summit in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Philippine IT Players Urged to Seize Opportunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Sunday urged his country's information technology (IT) players to
seize the opportunities available to them and help him turn the
country into an e-commerce power in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"There is no better time for the Philippines to be more
competitive in the information technology market than now,"
Estrada said, according to a press release from the Presidential
Palace.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippines' neighbors in Asia are revving up their
own incentives for IT and electronic commerce investors, citing
Malaysia's Super Multi-Media Corridor project and China's efforts
to develop Haidian District, Beijing, into its version of Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
As the Philippines has a large pool of knowledge workers with
world-class IT talent, the country must take full advantage of the
edge that Filipino IT workers have over their neighbors, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
"It is for this reason that we must mobilize our resource to
develop our facilities and resources towards enhancing our
capabilities in the field of IT," he said.
</P>
<P>
On July 14, President Estrada launched a new cyberzone in
southern Metro Manila, which he said would put the Philippines at
par with others in the region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he signed into law the e-commerce act of 2000, which
sets guidelines for electronic commerce, and penalties for
cybercrimes.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Raises Clove Purchasing Prices by 40 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar authorities
have increased clove prices by almost 40 percent on average to
enable farmers to recover costs they had incurred, Tanzanian
newspapers reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar State Trading Corporation announced on Saturday
that the new crop prices were also a result of the sharp increase
of clove prices in the world market.
</P>
<P>
In the world market, a ton of cloves now fetches 3,000 U.S.
dollars instead of 1,000 dollars previously, the corporation's
marketing manager Ali Shoka was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the price increase of the spice in the world
market was caused by a low production by major spice producers,
Brazil and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Raising clove prices was aimed to motivate farmers and check
against smuggling especially in Pemba Island where more than 80
percent of cloves are produced.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar recorded a bumper clove harvest of about 10,000 tons
in the last season, contributing heavily in the island's gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that a bumper harvest is expected after every three
years. The collapse of clove prices in the world market in early
1980s had forced Zanzibar to look for other economic options to
raise enough funds to meet its recurrent and development
expenditure.

the safe and solid in seeking a vice president, partly because the
job is increasingly seen as more than an understudy role.

<HEADLINE> American Teenagers Hurt in Road Accident in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- About 20 American Jewish
teenagers, on a tour in northern Israel, were injured Sunday
morning in a road accident.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted an unconfirmed report as saying that they
were part of a tour from the North American Federation of Temple
Youth.
</P>
<P>
Bus of the group of about 40 youngsters collided with a military
vehicle north of the Lake Kinneret (or Sea of Galilee).
</P>
<P>
Ambulances were called to the site and about 20 teens who were
slightly and moderately injured were taken to the Rebecca Sieff
hospital in the northern town of Safed and the others received
treatment on the spot for shock.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a man was killed in Ein-Hemed near
Jerusalem Sunday morning when his vehicle overturned and caught
fire, making the death toll in weekend traffic accidents around the
country rise to eight.
</P>
<P>
Police here have described it as a particularly bad weekend for
accidents and urged drivers to be calmer despite the heat.

<HEADLINE> Unidentified Gunmen Kill 7 People in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were killed Thursday
and Friday in northeastern Algeria by an unidentified armed group,
local press reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Al Sahafa daily said the tragedy took place in Azaba of
Skekdah state, about 510 kilometers east of the capital Algiers.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the newspaper said, a group of terrorists slained 4
civilians including a woman in Azaba in an armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
In an ambush on Friday in the same area, the mob shot dead three
soldiers and wounded six others. Government troops have sealed off
the area and hunted for the attackers.
</P>
<P>
The north African country has been torn by a civil war, murders
and massacres that started in early 1992 after the then military-
backed government cancelled elections in which the now-banned
Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win. So far, 100,000 people
have lost their lives in the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The security situation in Algeria has improved since l999 when
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced his national
reconciliation plan. But bloody attacks have been buoyant recently
that have claimed many civilians' lives nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Security Service Warns of Possible Right-wing Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel's General Security
Services (Shin Bet) warned Sunday that the lives of Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are under
threats from Israeli right-wing radical organizations.
</P>
<P>
The warning was issued by a senior official of Shin Bet while he
was briefing at the weekly cabinet meeting on the recent
developments due to the Camp David peace summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit, attended by Barak, Arafat, and U.S. President Bill
Clinton, began on July 11 at the American presidential retreat in
Maryland near Washington and is trying to resolve all the core
issues between Israel and the Palestinians, such as the fate of
Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements, borders,
security and water.
</P>
<P>
Environment Minister Dalia Itzik told Israel Radio after the
cabinet meeting that the GSS head warned that there were threats of
violence even if Barak and Arafat returned from Camp David without
a planned peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel's right-wing extremists are opposed to the Israeli-
Palestinian peace process, accusing Barak of conceding too much and
too soon to the Palestinians during the talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak's political mentor, former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin,
was assassinated in 1995 by a right-wing extremist because of his
efforts to reach an agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Due to Barak's absence for the summit, Sunday's cabinet meeting
was convened by Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, who now is
acting prime minister. Only nine ministers, out of possible 22
ministers, attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Some ministers are at Camp David, and some ministerial posts
were left vacant after three ruling partners resigned from the
government ahead of the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Israel Police are to hold a large-
scale maneuver in the next two weeks, preparing for possible
violence from Palestinians extremists, another side of the
political spectrum, in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Police Inspector-General Yehuda Wilk told Israel Radio Sunday
morning that it was conceivable that the worst-case scenarios would
not come to fruition, but the police want to be prepared for that.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian extremists had threatened to launch a new Intifada,
or uprising, in case that Israel meddles in the planned Palestinian
declaration of statehood this September.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis are also afraid that the Palestinians will march en
masse to Jewish settlements, which were built on the occupied
lands, in the same style as used by the Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas in forcing Israel soldiers out of south Lebanon in May
after a 22-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
Wilk stressed on Sunday that Palestinians should know that if
the current peace and tranquility in Israel are upset, they have a
lot to lose.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Cashewnut Production Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian cashewnut output
has increased from 16,829 tons in 1989/1990 to 121,207 tons in
1999/2000 in an increase of 620 percent, local newspapers reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cashewnut has emerged the leading foreign exchange earner in
the east African country for the first time since 1998, reports
quoted President Benjamin Mkapa as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who is on a tour of the crop production areas in the
southern regions, said on Saturday that the cash crop earned the
country 10 million U.S. dollars in 1990/1991 and 124 million
dollars in 1999/2000, an increase of 1,140 percent.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that cashewnut could play a major role in
boosting the nation's foreign exchange earnings and create
employment opportunities to people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that the government was making efforts aimed at
revamping production and quality of cashewnuts in order to pull
people in southern regions of Mtwara, Lindi and Ruvuma out of the
economic quagmire in a short time.
</P>
<P>
He directed the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives and
the Tanzania Investment Center to take urgent measures aimed at
providing handsome incentive packages to investors in processing
plants for cashewnuts to boost their price at world markets.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa made the remarks when opening the second cashewnut
meeting which attracted more than 200 stakeholders including the
Cashewnut Board of Tanzania, the Cashewnut Industry Development
Fund and buyers.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it was high time that processing of
agricultural products was accorded priority because exporting
unprocessed cashewnuts was denying 10,000 job opportunities for
local people which are otherwise taken by their counterparts in
India where the crop is processed.

</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish Mopak Group is planning a 100 million U.S.
dollars investment in the state-owned paper factory Dalaman to
modernize the establishment, reported Turkish Daily News on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With the investment, it is hoped that Dlaman will greatly
increase its productivity and capacity. Mopak is seeking young and
experienced staff to work with it in this new endeavor.
</P>
<P>
Mopak is one of the main paper product companies in Turkey and
has been around for 76 years in the paper sector of the Aegean

<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish tourism sector is arranging a "Wine from
the Holy Land" gift to attract Christian tourists to celebrate the
2000th anniversary of the birth of Jesus Christ in Turkey, reported
Turkish Daily News on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Tourism Ministry has planned to promote "faith
tourism" as part of a strategy to revitalize the country's tourism,
which was severely affected by earthquakes and economic crisis last
year.
</P>
<P>
The special wine will be sent to U.S. President Bill Clinton,
who previously made a visit to Ephesus, a Christian historic site;
to the people, who might come to Turkey at some time in the future
to visit religious sites; and to some 38 presidents who took part
in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe summit
in Istanbul last November.
</P>
<P>
It is presumed that millions of Christians will come to eight
regions of Turkey to join in celebration activities for the birth
of Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- British Airways (BA) has recently opened a so-called "
Terraces Lounge" in Ataturk Airport in Istanbul, Turkey's largest
city, reported Turkish Daily News on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
BA's Terraces Lounge is a cornerstone in the BA 600 million
pounds (900 million U.S. dollars) "Next Generation" investment to
improve its service and boost competition.
</P>
<P>
The lounge's evolution is mainly based on the "terraces"
concept, which is aimed at providing an open, airy and refreshing
atmosphere with the flexibility to be adapted to customer needs at
different times of the day and for different travel reasons.
</P>
<P>
RAMALLAH -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on Saturday
signed an agreement with German government for 35 million marks
(16.8 million U.S. dollars) in loans to fund the infrastructure
projects in the West Bank's Jenin Industrial zone.
</P>
<P>
According to Abdel-Malik al-gabir, head of the Palestinian
Industry Ministry's Free Industrial Zone Department, the loans
under the interest rate of 0.75 percent have a maturity of 40
years, with a 10-year grace period.
</P>
<P>
Jenin Industrial zone, an investment project that will cost 75
million U.S. dollars, would be ready to receive interested
entrepreneurs as of mid next year, he said, adding that it would
create about 12,000 direct jobs and more than 15,000 indirect ones.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Jiddah-based Egyptian Trade Representation Bureau urged
Egyptian computer set and program exporters to follow long term
strategies and avoid the short term ones in terms of dealing with
Saudi market.
</P>
<P>
A source with the bureau was quoted by Arabic daily Al-Alam Al-
Youm on Sunday as saying that there were many export opportunities
which should be seized by submitting competitive offers in price
and quality against other foreign bids.
</P>
<P>
With the start of the Saudi-Egyptian Free Trade Zone, computer
sets and programs to Saudi Arabia that are under a 12 percent
tariff will see a gradual tariff decline in the next five years
before it reaches zone.

<HEADLINE> Australia: Tougher Sanctions for Fiji if Speight in Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Fiji faces tougher Australian
sanctions if coup leader George Speight is given a cabinet
position in a new government, the Australian government said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Both Australian Prime Minister John Howard and Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer hinted Sunday that further sanctions would be
imposed if Speight gained more power.
</P>
<P>
A government with Speight as a member would be unacceptable to
Australia, Downer said in a TV interview.
</P>
<P>
"If Mr. Speight became a member of the new Cabinet, I think
Australia, New Zealand, Britain, the United States, Japan and
others would have to review the measures we've already taken," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It would be completely unacceptable for a terrorist to form
part of a government, we couldn't have any part of dealing with a
country that included terrorists in its government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he had seen no suggestions Speight would be given a
Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
"But if it does occur it'll be a further move away from
acceptability in the world community," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We support the democratically-elected government and (former)
Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and we condemn the abrogation of
democracy and we condemn the racially-based approach," he said
</P>
<P>
"We have imposed sanctions and there will be further
consequences if democracy is not restored," he added.
</P>
<P>
Australia introduced a series of sanctions against Fiji last
week in an effort to influence a return of the country's
democratically-elected government.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Establish Commercial Courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Congress will soon
pass a new legislation creating commercial courts that would hear
and decide on all cases previously handled by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC).
</P>
<P>
Renato Cayetano, chairman of the Senate committee on justice
and human rights, issued the statement over the weekend amid fears
that the transfer of the SEC's quasi-judicial powers to Regional
Trial Court (RTC) branches might only worsen docket congestion in
the judiciary and lead to the overall slower administration of
justice.
</P>
<P>
The Congress abolished the SEC's court-like powers when it
passed Republic Act 8799, the New Securities Regulation and
Enforcement Law last week.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, all cases previously brought before the SEC
must now be filed before existing RTC branches specially
designated by the Supreme Court to handle such lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to assure everyone concerned that we intend to pass
posthaste new legislation creating commercial courts, which will
eventually absorb all cases previously handled by the SEC,"
Cayetano said.
</P>
<P>
This was agreed upon at the bicameral conference committee when
it
finalized what is now the above-mentioned new securities law, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the new courts would have original and exclusive
jurisdiction over all cases involving fraudulent acts perpetrated
by corporations, intra-corporate disputes, controversies in the
election of directors or trustees and petitions for suspension of
debt payments.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, it is up to the High Court to determine which
RTC branches are in a position to take on the new cases that used
to be under jurisdiction of the SEC," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Host Major ASEAN Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will host three major
meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
from July 24 to 29, according to a press release of the Thai
foreign ministry Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 33rd ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) and the 7th ASEAN
Regional Forum (ARF) will be held on July 24 to 25 and July 27
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The other meeting is the annual post ministerial conferences (
PMC) between ASEAN and its dialogue partners and other countries
on July 28 to 29.
</P>
<P>
At the AMM, foreign ministers from all 10 member countries will
review ASEAN's activities and external relations over the past
year and lay down policy guidelines for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
At the ARF on July 27, the ministers are expected to have
candid and free-flowing discussions on regional and international
security issues.
</P>
<P>
The ARF, established in 1994, aims to promote confidence-
building, preventive diplomacy and conflict resolution in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is expected to attend
the forum for the first time.
</P>
<P>
At the PMC to be held on July 28 to 29, the ministers will
exchange views with their counterparts from the 10 dialogue
partner countries and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan was quoted by Thailand
News Agency as saying that the upcoming meeting of ASEAN foreign
ministers and their counterparts from China, Japan and South Korea,
which will be the first 10+3, will underline the power of the east
and southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 6th meeting of the 33rd ASEAN Standing Committee
(ASC) and ASEAN senior official meeting, both preparatory for the
AMM, ARF and PMC, were closed here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the ASC, Surin said, "Because ASEAN includes
both the more developed and the less developed countries, we are
better equipped to understand the varied need of the developing
nations."
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN has shown that its enlarged membership, rather
than losing a sense of purpose and focus, represents instead a
continued and enhanced determination to achieve even greater goals.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, established in 1967, groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam
and Cambodia. Thailand, which currently holds the chairmanship of
ASEAN, will preside over these meetings.
</P>
<P>
According to 1999 figures, the ASEAN region, with a total area
of 4.5 million square kilometers, had a population of about 500
million and a combined gross domestic product of 737 billion U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS: G-8 Tasks Do Not End in Okinawa  by Li Dawei and Ma Xinghua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OKINAWA, Japan, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from the Group of
Eight (G-8) nations Sunday concluded their three-day summit here
after adopting a joint communique aimed at charting a course to
allow all people to benefit from globalization in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
In the past three days, the G-8 leaders discussed the issues
which rose up to the priority list after the end of the Cold War,
including the scourge of diseases, such as AIDS, malaria and
tuberculosis, the threat of terrorism and environmental
degradation, regional conflicts and poverty reduction and, the
challenge of digital divide widened with the development of
information technology (IT).
</P>
<P>
Although the agenda seems so broad as to be vague, the summit,
which brought here leaders from the United States, Japan, Italy,
France, Britain, Canada, Germany and Russia, has proved to be
useful, or "a positive one" as characterized by French President
Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the G-8 leaders adopted a charter for
information technology, which was one of the hottest topics on the
agenda. The charter defines IT's purpose as being to support
sustained economic growth, and having the potential to foster
international peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
However, with the effects of IT development spreading to
politics, society and everyday life, the gap between the global
information haves and have-nots, or what was being called "the
digital divide," has been widening.
</P>
<P>
Observers here hold that the Okinawa charter does not clarify
how the G-8 leaders' proposals will be implemented by each G-8
country, and that the determination of the G-8 leaders has been
made clear, but no specific plan of action has been drawn up.
</P>
<P>
They also deem that the summit fell short in many ways. The G-8
has failed to set a date for a new round of trade liberalization
talks to make up for last November's failure in Seattle, and the
leaders have not narrowed their differences on genetically
modified foods, and in particular in the debt relief promises for
the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of poverty reduction, the industrialized nations
expressed their commitments in a statement issued at the end of a
G-7 summit, convened on the same day but a few hours before the G-
8 summit started, to help the poorest nations by writing off
billions of dollars in debt, but they fell short of coming up with
concrete steps on how to get the stalled debt relief initiative
moving.
</P>
<P>
Last year's Cologne summit produced an important accord on debt
relief for the world's poorest countries, known as the Highly
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs). The G-7 leaders at Okinawa summit
did not offer any specifics in relieving debt owed by some 40
poorest countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
On July 22, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed his
disappointment at G-7 leaders' failure to implement their pledge
of debt forgiveness for poorest countries, and some protesters in
Okinawa described the G-7 statement as "meaningless" because of
its failure to agree on a new deal on debt relief which would
cancel larger amounts of debt for more countries.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the summit, which was short of concrete action,
created an opportunity for the G-8 leaders to conduct informal
consultations on issues ranging from arms control and missile
defense to genome research, and it also committed the leading
economies to further progress in development.
</P>
<P>
But despite Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori's evaluation
of the Okinawa summit as "a fruitful one", the challenge of
poverty reduction remained a deeply-rooted subject for future G-8
summits.
</P>
<P>
On both humanitarian and national interest grounds, therefore,
the fight for development is one of the main tasks for the G-8,
and the endeavor for seeking debt relief for the HIPCs still has a
long way to go.
</P>
<P>
The success of the summit does not depend on what commitments
the G-8 has made in their Okinawa communique, it depends on what
really happens after the heads of state and government go home.

<HEADLINE> Samak Leads in Earlier Results of Bangkok Governor Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Prachakorn Thai Party Leader Samak
Sundaravej enjoys a comfortable lead against other 22 candidates
in the earlier results of Sunday's election of the new governor of
the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The former deputy prime minister got 537,042 votes, or 45.8% of
1.17 million votes that have been counted. His arch-rival,
Sudarat Keyuraphan of the Thai Rak Thai party, snapped 270,010
votes, followed by Thavatchai Sajjakul of the ruling Democrat
party with 128,142 votes.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60% of 3.8 million eligible voters cast their votes in
Sunday's voting, which ends at 3 PM local time (800 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Apparently admitting her failure, Sudarat, told local TV she
and her party have done their best in the race and had to face the
reality. She congratulated Samak through the TV, saying he will "
probably be the new governor."
</P>
<P>
Sudarat's failure will have certain political implications to
the upcoming general election, which is expected late this year.
The result of the governor race will suggest that the newly
emerging Thai Rai Thai Party lose its well-prepared first chance
to catch political power, local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Samak, a veteran politician, has showed his political
experience and "unique character" in this tough race for the post
of the new governor of Bangkok, according to local analysts.
</P>
<P>
The official results of the election is expected to be
announced at 10 PM local time 1500 GMT

<HEADLINE> Load-Shedding in Ethiopia Due to Untimely Dam Repair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The power crisis that
currently prevails in Ethiopia is caused by the untimely repair
work undertaken on some power generating dams rather than the
shortage of rainfall, the Ethiopian Herald revealed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The electric power rationing in the past few weeks could not
have been so serious had the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation
(EEPC) consulted concerned departments when deciding to undertake
repair work on the Fincha power dam, a senior official of the
Ministry of Water Resources was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Power disruption over Fincha, about 200 km west of Addis Ababa,
had brought pressure on Melka Wakena, which is another major power
source for central Ethiopia, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, another senior official with the National
Meteorological Services Agency was quoted as saying that the
prevailing power shortage in Ethiopia could have been averted had
the EEPC started repair work earlier.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, dependent on hydropower, has been bogged down in
power crisis since May.
</P>
<P>
Power failure, which normally lasts for about 15 hours, occurs
in different part of Addis Ababa every three days.
</P>
<P>
The power authorities said that the power shortage had been
caused purely by reduced amount of water in the dams.

<TEXT>
<P>
OKINAWA, Japan, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir
Putin will pay an official visit to Japan on September 3-5 for
talks with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori on bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president's trip was set during a meeting between
Putin and Mori following the conclusion of the three-day Group of
Eight major nations summit in Nago, Okinawa, Japanese officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said Japan hopes Putin's trip will boost the
stalled talks on a 1997 accord which calls for the two countries
to strive toward resolving their long-standing territorial dispute
and concluding a bilateral peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
The territorial dispute, which involves four Russian-held
islands off Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido, has
prevented Japan and Russia from concluding a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the two countries agreed to work toward resolving the
row and concluding the pact by the end of 2000, but negotiations
have reached a stalemate due to differences over how to resolve
the dispute.

<P>
OKINAWA, Japan, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister
Yoshiro Mori expressed his willingness Sunday to meet Kim Jong Il ,
leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), in
order to advance negotiations on the normalization of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
"It would be important for me to effectively communicate with
Kim Jong Il. I would like to consider the most effective ways to
communicate with each other, " Mori told reporters here after
closing the three-day summit of the Group of Eight (G-8).
</P>
<P>
Mori, who chaired the summit, refused to say whether he intends
to try and meet the DPRK leader during the U.N. Millennium Summit
this fall in New York. He said, "It will be some time ahead."
</P>
<P>
He said the G-8 countries want to deepen ties with developing
countries, international organizations and non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite clear that the G-8 cannot resolve many problems
facing the world," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that the G-8 will strengthen efforts to eliminate the
so-call "digital divide," the gap between developed and developing
countries in information technology (IT) accessibility, through
the proposed Digital Opportunities Task Force.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the task force was proposed in the "Okinawa
Charter on Global Information Society" adopted Saturday by the G-8
leaders to allow all people to enjoy the benefits of the IT
revolution.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 is consisted of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan,

<HEADLINE> Gosper to Go for IOC President if Supported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia's top Olympic official
Kevan Gosper has said he will stand for the presidency of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) if he has sufficient support
after the Sydney Games, the Sky TV reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Currently an IOC vice-president, Gosper said he could run for
the most powerful job in world sport.
</P>
<P>
"My focus is absolutely on a successful Games and we'll get one.
After that's over and all the dust has settled, if I think I have
the support I'll go for it," he told Sky TV.
</P>
<P>
But Gosper said two other IOC officials, Dick Pound and Jacques
Rogge, would also be very good contenders for the job currently
held by Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
"Of course I believe I could do the job and I suppose somebody
will say there he goes ... he's being arrogant again, which I'm
starting to think is almost a compliment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But you have to be confident about your own qualities and I
think I've been given the training and the experience and the
background to head up the International Olympics Committee," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure Dick Pound feels the same way and Jacques Rogge,
otherwise you shouldn't be in it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gosper, a former 400m runner, won a silver medal at the 1956
Melbourne Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Gosper, a senior member of the Sydney Organizing Committee for
the Olympic Games board, also said he would never be on another
Olympics organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
"I've found being on an organizing committee the toughest call
that I've been involved in and that includes being an Olympic
athlete," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cypriots for Holidays Abroad Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Tourism is particularly flourishing
this summer in Cyprus, with a 50 percent increase in demand for
package holidays abroad.
</P>
<P>
The most popular are direct-flight destinations with packages
fully booked especially to the Greek islands, like Corfu, Crete and
Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
Unusual destinations are also in high demand this summer, with a
demand from Cypriots for more faraway exotic destinations, such as
the Caribbean, North Africa, Northern Europe, the United States,
the Far East and Latin America, either by boat or by plane.
</P>
<P>
And Cypriots are already booking winter cruises to Israel and
Egypt, with long distance cruises to the Caribbean, Latin America,
and the Indian Ocean also popular.
</P>
<P>
According to local media, one of the reasons Cypriots are
increasingly spending their summer holidays abroad is the huge
gamut of competitive holiday packages on offer by the island's
travel agents.
</P>
<P>
Travelling abroad for the summer holidays is a new trend for
Cypriots who in the past would not dream of leaving Cyprus during
the August holidays, unless they had a specific reason to travel.
</P>
<P>
Last summer some 60,000 Cypriots spended their holiday abroad.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Authorities to Probe Disappearance of Paymaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The High Command of the Uganda
People's Defence Forces (UPDF) has appointed a four-member
commission to investigate the recent "disappearance" of the army's
paymaster Captain Dan Byakutaga.
</P>
<P>
Byakutaga, said to be on the run, reportedly disappeared with 1.
6 billion Uganda shillings (about 1 million U.S. dollars) meant
for salaries of UPDF officers and soldiers deployed for Operation
Safe Haven (OSH) in the war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
"The Army High Command has appointed a commission or a board of
inquiry consisting of four members to investigate how the
paymaster Byakutaga disappeared with salary for the army," the New
Vision daily quoted military sources as saying on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The board of inquiry is to consist of the Auditor General, a
representative from the Defence Ministry and two army officers,
and the four will report back in three weeks to the Army Commander,
said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni chaired the closed door
meeting of the UPDF's High Command. The agenda included the "
missing" of UPDF paymaster, the soldiers' salary, the welfare of
the army, the new command in DRC, the relationship between UPDF
and the Rwandan Patriotic Army, and the general security situation
in Uganda, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Calls for Launching of Regional Free Trade Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has called for the
launching f the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
Free Trade Area (FTA) in order to move forward the regional
economic integration, newspapers here reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a two-day SADC Industry and Trade Ministers' follow-
up meeting here on Saturday, Tanzanian Minister for Industry and
Commerce Iddi Simba advised SADC countries to pool their sub-
regional expertise in lobbying to influence the outcome of the
programmed negotiations, as September 1, the proposed launching
date of SADC Free Trade Area, is approaching.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of FTA is a culmination of intensive talks
for tariff reductions and elimination of non-tariff barriers
following the signing of the SADC trade protocol in Maseru,
Lesotho in 1996, the minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there are still pending issues to be resolved
before the SADC Summit Meeting scheduled to be held in Windhoek,
Namibia, next month, which will put the free trade area on the
top agenda.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the major outstanding ones as being tariff
reduction schedules, elimination of core non-tariff barriers,
institutional mechanism for coordinating the trade sector and
special agreements on textiles and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Simba further said the ideal situation was to finalize and
agree on all the outstanding issues instead of waiting for
agreement on every issue prior to the launching of a free trade
area.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the most important thing was to start
implementing decisions that have already been agreed upon in
order to move forward the economic integration program.

<HEADLINE> Load-Shedding in Ethiopia Due to Untimely Dam Repair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The power crisis that
currently prevails in Ethiopia is caused by the untimely repair
work undertaken on some power generating dams rather than the
shortage of rainfall, the Ethiopian Herald revealed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The electric power rationing in the past few weeks could not
have been so serious had the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation
(EEPC) consulted concerned departments when deciding to undertake
repair work on the Fincha power dam, a senior official of the
Ministry of Water Resources was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Power disruption over Fincha, about 200 km west of Addis Ababa,
had brought pressure on Melka Wakena, which is another major power
source for central Ethiopia, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, another senior official with the National
Meteorological Services Agency was quoted as saying that the
prevailing power shortage in Ethiopia could have been averted had
the EEPC started repair work earlier.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, dependent on hydropower, has been bogged down in
power crisis since May.
</P>
<P>
Power failure, which normally lasts for about 15 hours, occurs
in different part of Addis Ababa every three days.
</P>
<P>
The power authorities said that the power shortage had been
caused purely by reduced amount of water in the dams.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Calls for More Suppor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The envisaged African Union
calls for greater mobilization and involvement of the people
through the continent for it to have any meaning, the Secretary-
General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Salim Ahmed
Salim has said.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary people must play a part in the African Union which is
aimed at coordinating African efforts economically and politically,
the OAU chief told Tanzania's official Daily News here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Salim disclosed that a meeting to involve representatives of
African parliamentarians and legal experts to look into the system,
framework as well as terms of reference for a future African
Parliament will be held sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
He said it has been agreed that there should be greater
involvement of parliamentarians throughout the continent for the
establishment of the union.
</P>
<P>
The formal creation of the new union, which will replace the
OAU, will not start until two thirds of the OAU's 53 member
countries ratify the texts that envisage a transition period of up
to a year, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that one of the significant achievements at the
recent OAU annual summit in Lome, Togo was that not a single
African country opposed the idea of African Union.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, there were some who said we should move faster, and
others who raised a different view that we were moving too fast
and even those who said the present pace was right. But every
African leader saw the need for African Union and promotion of
economic integration," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The African Union takes into account the global challenges by
bringing together economic, political and security components of
the continent's aspirations.
</P>
<P>
"The union is in fact a higher stage of what is now OAU. It
will culminate in the amalgamation of the OAU and the African
Economic Community," Salim explained.
</P>
<P>
African leaders signed a draft treaty on July 12 at the OAU
summit, which is seen as a step toward a new African Union and an
eventual continent-wide partnership overseeing defense, foreign
affairs and the economy.
</P>
<P>
The draft provides for a council of African heads of states and
the eventual establishment of an African parliament, courts,
central bank and common currency.
</P>
<P>
The document also gives the Union the right to intervene in
affairs of member states to restore peace and security in extreme
cases like war or genocide.

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Camp David summit could end Monday if Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat fails to agree to discuss U.S. bridging proposals
about Jerusalem, an Israeli official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Based on an Israeli idea, the proposals call for giving the
Palestinians full control or authority over some Arab neighborhoods
in east Jerusalem, while Israel would remain sovereignty over the
entire city, including some Jewish communities in the West Bank
that would be annexed to the city.
</P>
<P>
According to one Israeli official, the summit could end
immediately if U.S. President Bill Clinton, back from the G-8
summit in Japan, does not receive positive answers from Arafat on
the Jerusalem proposals.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if Arafat tells Clinton Sunday that he is
willing to discuss the proposals, negotiations are expected to
continue, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- During the weekend, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has
isolated himself in his cabin at Camp David, in preparation for
difficult decisions. According to sources from the Israeli camp,
Barak feels that he is carrying "heavy responsibility" on his
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
His spokesman said that he spoke by telephone with several
people in Israel and read a lot about the effort for peace and
missed opportunities in past generations, such as the talks between
Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin at Camp David in 1978, as well as
that between Chaim Weizmann and the Emir Feisal in 1919.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who stayed with the
negotiators at Camp David over the weekend, hosted Arafat and Barak
for a meal Thursday, but did not set any official meetings.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinians are lobbying for full United Nations
membership for the future state of Palestine, regardless of whether
an accord is reached with Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior Palestinian source, the efforts to win
recognition by the U.N. and other international organizations, such
as the European Union, are intended to offset Barak's threats of
dire consequences in the event of a unilateral declaration of
independence by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine at the
U.N., Ambassador Nasser Al-Kidwa, has asked that Palestine be
permitted to participate in the upcoming General Assembly session
as a full member. Last week, Arafat spoke from Camp David with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Two teenage girls were killed early Saturday morning when
they were struck by a speeding car, as they walked home with
friends from a disco in Western Galilee. The deaths brought to
eight the number of people killed on roads in the black weekend.
</P>
<P>
"Dozens of people were killed on the roads in the north last
summer, 28 in August alone, and, sadly, the signs are that this
tragedy will be repeated this year," said Yoel Sadeh, head of the
police Northern Region Traffic Division.
</P>
<P>
"These accidents were not related to road conditions, the
weather or anything else, but to negligent and reckless driving,"
said Sadeh.

<HEADLINE> G-8 Summit Ends in Okinawa with Communique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OKINAWA, Japan, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Group of
Eight (G-8) major nations on Sunday concluded their annual summit
in Nago, Okinawa, after adopting a joint communique calling for
building a new world partnership which allows all people to
benefit from globalization.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
Russia and the United States discussed a host of issues ranging
from world economy to regional security during the three-day
summit held in this subtropical Japanese island city.
</P>
<P>
The leaders committed the G-8 to addressing persistent
problems and facing new challenges to pave the way for "greater
prosperity, deeper peace of mind and a more stable world" into the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the importance of establishing a "new
partnership" with non-G8 countries, particularly developing
countries, international institutions and civil society, including
the private sector and non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The communique sets out specific measures across a wide range
of areas, including information technology (IT), infectious
diseases, trade, cross-border crimes, drug trafficking, the aging
of society, food safety, the environment, the human genome,
conflict prevention, disarmament and nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the leaders lauded a brightening picture for
the global economy, and stressed the need to pursue structural
reforms through "appropriate" macroeconomic policies to cope with
the advancing globalization and IT-led structural changes.
</P>
<P>
On trade, the eight leaders agreed to set up cooperation
toward launching a new round of WTO trade negotiations this year
with an ambitious, balanced and inclusive agenda, reflecting the
interests of WTO members.
</P>
<P>
The communique set a 2010 target to combat infectious diseases,
reducing the number of AIDS and HIV cases in the 15-24 age bracket
by 25 percent and halving the number of infections and deaths
resulting from tuberculosis and malaria.
</P>
<P>
On food safety linked to genetically modified products, the
leaders agreed to work toward establishing a framework for open
and transparent discussions among all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
They also called for tightening international regulations on
drug trafficking and underlined the importance of fighting cyber
crimes.
</P>
<P>
On debt relief, the G-8 leaders vowed to step up their
undertaking as a total of nine countries will gain eligibility as
of July for a 100 percent debt cancellation initiative hammered
out for heavily indebted poor countries at the previous summit
held in Cologne, Germany, last year.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also endorsed a comprehensive strategy on conflict
prevention formulated by their foreign ministers last week.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the communique, the G-8 leaders issued three joint
statements over the past two days on two major issues -- regional
security and the rapidly advancing innovation of IT.
</P>
<P>
On the first day, they issued two special statements on
regional issues which underscored their commitment to supporting
last month's first-ever inter-Korean summit and the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
On the following day, the leaders endorsed the "Okinawa Charter
on Global Information Society" which hammered out a broad range of
measures to seize opportunities and bridge the "digital divide"
between rich and poor people and countries.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade in Chongqing up in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The total import and export
value of Chongqing, the largest metropolis in western China soared
70 percent to reach 783 million U.S. dollars in the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total foreign trade, import came to 397 million U.S.
dollars, up 50 percent, and export was 386 million U.S. dollars,
doubling the figure of last year's same period, according to
customs statistics available today.
</P>
<P>
The export of processed products was doubled to reach 40.85
million U.S. dollars. The export value of machinery and electronic
products was three times as much as in the same period of 1999.
And the exports of high-tech and new products increased by 29.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
A local trade official said the import of general trade
maintained a strong rising momentum while a multi-outlet trade
system has been formed with the state-owned enterprises still in a
dominate position. The export to Asian countries continued to rise
but the proportion of export to Europe and the United States
showed a decline.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the fast trade growth to the implementation of
the country's developing west China strategy and the preferential
policies offered by local authorities.

<HEADLINE> Oman Backs OPEC Move to Cool Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Oman will support any move of the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Country (OPEC) in order to
ensure a long-term stability in oil prices in the world market, the
non-OPEC country's Oil Minister Mohammed bin Hamad Al Romhi has
said.
</P>
<P>
"The main aim is market stability. That is also the aim of the
OPEC, that's why we would support any decision taken by the group,"
while "our aim as a oil-producer is stability of price on the
international market" too, Sunday's Dubai-based daily "Gulf News"
quoted Romhi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of the U.S. and other leading oil consuming
states, OPEC decided on June 21 to raise its 10 members' output by
710,000 barrels a day to tame buoyant oil prices. The cartel's deal
is effective on July 1.
</P>
<P>
But last month, Salim bin Mohammed Shaaban, undersecretary at
the Oman's Oil and Gas Ministry, said his country would not be able
to join OPEC's decision of June 21 to raise output due to "
technical reasons."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show Oman's output is around 900,000 barrels per
day.

TEHRAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The two reformist lawyers detained

bail late Saturday night, Iranian press reported on Sunday.

hard-line group Ansar-e Hezbollah (Friends of the God's Party),
against some senior Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
The conservative-dominated judiciary began closed-door trial on
them on July 15 and the two lawyers will appear before court on
Sunday morning again, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Rahami, a professor of law at Tehran University, and Ms. Ebadi,
a feminist pro-democracy lawyer, have represented various reformist
clients in high-profile cases.
</P>
<P>
Their detention and trial were condemned by the reformist
supporters of President Mohammad Khatami as a political move by the
conservative camp against the reformists.
</P>
<P>
Following their face-losing defeat in the February's
parliamentary election, the conservatives stepped up their
crackdown on the growing reformists by closing down reformist
newspapers, arresting reformist activists.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President Pays Private Visit to Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has left for Britain on a private visit, The Sunday
Times here reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Kumaratunga left for London on Saturday. However,
it did not say how long the president will stay in London.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that Kumaratunga has to come back before
next Tuesday when she will meet delegations from the ruling People
's Alliance, the main opposition United National Party and the
Tamil parties to finalize the proposed new constitution which is
due to be tabled before the parliament in early August.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution aims to end Sri Lanka's long-running
ethnic war by devolving powers to provinces, including one
administered by minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga had paid two private visits to Britain respectively
in April this year and last December to receive medical treatment
for her wounds sustained during a failed assassination bid by
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga, who is also minister of defense,
suffered injuries to her right eye when a suicide bomber blew
herself up at an election rally in Colombo on December 18 last
year. The attack has been blamed on the LTTE rebels who have been
fighting for a separate homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka'
s north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The president's private visit this time follows the departure
of Sri Lanka's new high commissioner (ambassador) to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Mangala Moonesinghe, who left Colombo Tuesday, is expected to
present his credentials to the British queen shortly. His
appointment to London comes at a time when Sri Lanka is making a
great effort in pressurizing the British government to close down
LTTE's overseas headquarters in London.

MANILA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen civilians were killed
Saturday in an ambush in Lanao del Sur province in the southern
Philippines by an estimated 20 armed men, Philippine Daily

</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted military sources as saying that 14 other
civilians were wounded in the same attack believed to be waged by
members of the secessionist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).

ambushed at around 2:50 p.m.
</P>
<P>
However, MILF spokesperson Edi Kabalu said Sunday in a

<HEADLINE> Most Indonesian House Factions Accept President's Apology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The major political factions in
Indonesia's House of Representatives (DPR) have accepted President
Abdurrahman Wahid's apology, but still insisted on an open
explanation about his decision to dismiss two ministers in April.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent effort to defuse political tensions, the largest
faction in the House, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle
said on Saturday it accepted the apology by the president over a
squabble with lawmakers earlier this week, local leading
newspapers reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Wahid has apologized, and we accepted the apology that he has
conveyed with sincerity," said Prapono Anung, deputy secretary
general of the party.
</P>
<P>
However, the party's faction chairman Arifin Panigoro said the
party still wanted the president to give the clarification over
the two ministers' dismissal.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the president refused to answer questions about
his decision to fire his two ministers, namely Minister of
Investment Laksamana Sukardi of the Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle and Minister of Trade and Industry Jusuf Kalla of the
Golkar Party
</P>
<P>
The president said the use of the interpellation motion,
submitted under a 1999 law, was a betrayal of the 1945
Constitution and that he was not under any obligation to answer
the House summons. The president refused to answer five questions
posed to him by the House.
</P>
<P>
Wahid's statement triggered angry and disappointments among
parliamentarians. Accusing of arrogant and not cooperative, some
parliamentarians demand the president to apologize to the House or
facing another motion.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, President Wahid offered his apology with the
legislative body to let the interpellation matter rest in order to
reduce political tension in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this (gesture) will be well received by all and marks
the start of an attempt to reduce tension and to build better
relations between us all," the president said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Golkar Party, the second largest faction in the
House and the Muslim-based Crescent Star Party (PBB) also accepted
the offer of apology but said that whether the House should put
the issue to rest would be discussed at a plenary meeting on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sutradara Ginting, the Indonesian Unity and Nationhood KKI)
faction chairman, said he hoped the president's apology would mend
the rift between the House and the president and reduce the
political tension.
</P>
<P>
Sutradara felt the apology was sufficient and the president did
not have to make a separate apology to the two sacked ministers
because he was only exercising his prerogative.
</P>
<P>
On April 24, Wahid fired the two ministers. But short after the
dismissal, the president told a closed-door meeting with the House
's leadership that he fired them because they were corrupt. When
news of the accusation leaked, the two sacked ministers promptly
denied it and their friends in the House began the interpellation
motion.

SHANGHAI: A total of 12,800 tons of imported newsprint entered
the Chinese market through the Shanghai Customs in the first half

arrived at this municipality on the upper reaches of China's
longest river Saturday, according to the municipal
Hydrometeorological Forecasting Center in western China.
</P>
<P>
Vegetation at the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the
longest in China, has increased since China banned the logging of
primitive forests there in 1998 following the devastating floods
downstream. The government has earmarked more than two billion
yuan (about 240 million U.S. dollars) for planting trees there and
more than 200,000 lumberjacks in the area have put down axes and
joined the army of tree planters.

WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Julie Foudy scored the lone
goal to pace the United States to a 1-0 victory over Germany, thus
winning the title of a four-nation women's soccer tournament in
Gottingen, Germany on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Foudy's left-footed goal in the 57th minute awarded the U.S.
women with two wins and a tie in the DFB Jubilaum Tournament,
marking German soccer's 100th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Norway finished second by defeating China 1-0 and the winless
Germany was last in the tournament which features the best women's
sides of the world.
</P>
<P>
The lone goal came when Foudy received a pass from Tiffeny
Millbrett and charged in from the left to beat goalie Silke
Rottenberg, a split second before Foudy was upended by a German
defender.
</P>
<P>
The United States squandered several chances before the break
with the best chance from Milbrett whose long roller ricocheted
off the left post.
</P>
<P>
Germany suffered the most at the tournament celebrating its
soccer heritage, with its defense riddled for seven goals in
losses against China and Norway.
</P>
<P>
China came into the final round of the tournament with a 1-0-1
record, leading the Americans on a goal difference of one. The
two World Cup finalists tied 1-1 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Norway finished with a record of 2-1, China was 1-1-1 and
Germany 0-3.

WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States was totally
destroyed by Spain as the latter achieved an unbeatable advantage
by winning the doubles on Saturday in the Davis Cup semi-final in
Santander, Spain.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Spain, a finalist only in 1965 and 1967, was
celebrating the end of more than three decades of Davis Cup
anguish.
</P>
<P>
Alex Corretja and Juan Balcells clinched the best-of-five semi-
final series with a 7-6 (8-6), 2-6, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3 doubles
victory over Todd Martin and Chris Woodruff that rendered Sunday's
reversed singles matches meaningless as Spain won the first two
singles days ago.
</P>
<P>
Spain will play for its first title against Australia in
Barcelona in December.
</P>
<P>
"If you reach the final, what is important is to win it,"
Corretja said. "We've started history, and we want to go on with
history."
</P>
<P>
For the United States, the loss was justified by the absence of
top players Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi who cited injuries as
the excuses.

<P>
HARARE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign and local investment in
Zimbabwe dropped drastically from January to May this year
compared with the same period in 1999, according to statistics
released Monday by the Zimbabwe Investment Center (ZIC).
</P>
<P>
The ZIC approved a total of 76 new projects during the period
under review, which were worth 39.4 million U.S. dollars,
shrinking 80 percent from the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
Among the new projects, 11 are foreign owned, which accounted
for 30.6 percent of the total, while 65 are joint ventures, which
constituted 69.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new projects are mainly involved in manufacturing, mining,
agriculture, tourism, construction, commercial and transport
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The approved projects would be implemented by investors from
Austria, China, France, India, Lebanon, Pakistan, South Africa,
the United Kingdom and the United States among other countries.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Vice President on Sharia Legal System  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Neither Muslims nor non-Muslims in
Nigeria can be forced under the controversial legal system of
Sharia to any specific way of life, Vice President Atiku Abubakar
has said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian press Monday quoted him as saying that the federal
government will not allow any state to supersede or subvert
federal laws and the Constitution of Nigeria which guarantee
individual rights and liberties.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sharia legal system, carried out in some northern
states since early this year, has absolutely nothing to do with
Christians and other non-Muslims. In fact, even a Muslim can
choose not to be educated under the Sharia system.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar made the remarks on Sunday in response to a recent
decision of the country's southern states, dominated by Christian
population, not to send college graduates to the north.
</P>
<P>
"Even I have decided to be non-Sharia compliant," said the vice
president, who is a Muslim from the north.
</P>
<P>
A proposal to introduce the Islamic law of Sharia in the State
of Kaduna early this year led to violent clashes between
Christians and Muslims in the state and throughout the country,
killing above 1,000.

KAMPALA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda People's Defense Forces
(UPDF) have shot dead the Chief of Intelligence of the Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA) and three other rebel officers in the
northern Ugandan district Kitgum, the Monitor daily reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rebel chief was only identified as Alimadi, while the
identities of the other three were not immediately established,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The four rebels were killed in a battle on July 21 between UPDF
and LRA at Onin Akwii near Goma Hills, more than 20 kilometers
south-west of Kitgum town, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group of LRA is based in the southern Sudan fighting
against the Ugandan government.

Meanwhile, five Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels have
surrendered in the western Ugandan districts Bundibugyo and Kasese
in the last four days, the New Vision daily quoted security
sources as saying on Monday.

rebellion against the government in the Rwenzori region to well
over 30 in the past couple of months, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>

jungles in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it added.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Stops Providing Aid to Kenyan Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) has stopped offering funds to help combat the spread of
HIV/AIDS in Kenya through its government, the East African
Standard newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lack of accountability by Kenya's Health Ministry officials has
forced UNICEF to suspend funding, the U.N. agency's HIV/AIDS
program director for Kenya Jane Mwita was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mwita said that the mistrust between the U.N. agency and the
ministry arose after the ministry's failure to account for 10
million shillings (around 133,000 U.S. dollars) allocated by the
agency.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF has changed the mode of funding for HIV/AIDS programs
and will give money directly to non-governmental organizations and
community-based organizations, said Mwita.
</P>
<P>
Since the first AIDS case in Kenya was detected in 1984, about
2 million people in the east African country with a population of
28 million have been infected.
</P>
<P>
The prevalence rate among people aged between 15 and 49 has
shot up from 3 percent in 1993 to the current 14 percent. Around
500 Kenyans die of the epidemic daily.

<P>
KAMPALA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from the
governments of Uganda and the Sudan made progress toward
restoring diplomatic relations during a meeting held in Atlanta
last week, the Monitor daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The envoys recommitted to peace and agreed to meet again," Ben
Hoffman, director of the Carter Center's Conflict Resolution
Program, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The center is named after former U.S. President Jimmy Carter,
who negotiated an agreement last year on the resumption of

Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir said last month that
in spite of efforts by Carter to mediate the talks between the two

Ugandan government.

session of the two countries to determine how to implement the

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland's Top Security Prison Scales Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's top security
Maze prison entered its final week as most of the remaining
paramilitary prisoners secure early release under the terms of the
1998 Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Convicted loyalist murderer Michael Stone is expected to leave
the prison Monday and a further 85 inmates will be freed by the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Stone was jailed for six murders, three of which were committed
during a lone gun and grenade attack on an Irish Republican Army (
IRA) funeral in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Also due to be freed is IRA bomber Sean Kelly, who was
imprisoned for planting the Shankill fish shop bomb which killed
10 people. Among the dead was Kelly's IRA colleague Thomas Begley.
</P>
<P>
The releases will all but empty the Maze, leaving fewer than 20
inside, including three republicans who murdered Loyalist
Volunteer Force leader Billy Wright inside the prison in December
1997.
</P>
<P>
Members of the main paramilitary groups on cease-fire will all
be released.
</P>
<P>
However, those ineligible for release include members of groups
still active such as the Real IRA, Continuity IRA, the Orange
Volunteers and the Red Hand Defenders, who are being held in
Maghaberry prison.
