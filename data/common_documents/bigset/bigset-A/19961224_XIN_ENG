<HEADLINE> Polish Trade Deficit With Germany Up in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Polish trade deficit with
Germany rose to 3 billion marks (about 2 billion U.S. dollars) in
1996 from 280 million marks in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two nations this year rocketed to
31 billion marks over last year's 25 billion marks, an increase of
six billion marks.
</P>
<P>
Polish exports to Germany dropped 2.5 percent in 1996 while its
imports from Germany surged 30 percent, according to the latest
statistics issued by the Polish commerce council in Cologne,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The council attributed the deficit to economic depression in
Germany and the appreciation of the Polish currency zloty, leading
to a sharp reduction of Poland's traditional exports of lumber,
rolled steel products, coal, cement and food.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there is a greater demand for capital and consumer
goods in the Polish domestic market, which fueled the increase of
the country's imports of German commodities.
</P>
<P>
Germany now is the biggest trade partner of Poland. In the past
few years, half of the 70 percent of Polish exports to EU
countries have gone to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that an anticipated better German economy in
1997 will help Poland increase its exports.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, U.S. Open Talks Amid Hopes of Hebron Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Mideast peace coordinator
Dennis Ross met here today with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa as the Palestinians and Israelis were reportedly close to a
deal on Hebron troop pullback.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived early today on the last leg of his Mideast tour to
speed up the long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment from the last
West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to brief Moussa on the outcome of the talks to
overcome the obstacles hindering the implementation of the
Palestinian-Israeli peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Arriving late on Saturday, Ross went straight into meetings
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Gaza City.
</P>
<P>
After the overnight meetings, the U.S. envoy said he hoped to
resuscitate talks faltering over Hebron and Jewish settlement. His
last mediation effort collapsed in October.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, calling the meeting "very constructive and fruitful" and
"important," said they discussed how to push the peace process
forward in all means.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's spokesman Nabil Abu Rhdainah said the U.S. envoy is
bringing several ideas aimed at closing a deal on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The four main points are Israel's demand to pursue suspects in
Palestinian areas, reopening Mrtyrs Street in the heart of town
that was closed to Palestinians, arming Palestinian police as
provided in the original accord, and joint Israeli-PLO patrols.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Israeli and Palestinian delegates negotiated
for six hours in a Jerusalem hotel.
</P>
<P>
The two sides accuse each other of foot-dragging in two months
of talks on the West Bank town, 80 percent of which was due to
have been handed over to the Palestinian Authority last March
under the 1995 Oslo II accord.
</P>
<P>
The date was missed following a wave of suicide bombing by
extremist militants in Israel in February and March. The accession
to power of Netanyahu's hardline government further complicated
the situation.
</P>
<P>
Israel calls for rewriting the redeployment deal to provide
better security for 500 Jews among 100,000 Arabs in the city,
while the Palestinians seek to link Hebron to further pullout
elsewhere in the West Bank under the Oslo autonomy accords.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who has won a second term, last
week criticized Israel's settlement expansion in occupied Arab
lands.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the diplomatic flurries, violence flared again when
three fire bombs landed near Jewish settler homes in the past two
days.
</P>
<P>
To top it all, media reports expect that a deal on Hebron is
to be signed later today or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
CNN, monitored here today, also raised the possibility of an
Arafat-Netanyahu summit to finalize arrangements for the
much-awaited accord.
</P>
<P>
It quoted high-ranking U.S. and Israeli sources as having
raised expectations on the would-be signing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Radio also reported progress after a night of
intensive talks between Israeli and Palestinian representatives.
</P>
<P>
Both Arafat and Ross expressed cautious optimism following
the talks, but Ross admitted that difference remained between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
PNA Finance Minister Mohammed Nashashibi said that there has
been progress in all directions in the night-long negotiations,
said the radio.

<HEADLINE> Public Security Organ Urged to Keep On "Strike Hard" (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking of the task facing public security forces next year,
Tao called on public security organs across the country to
implement the "Public Security Working Agenda During the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000)", in line with the arrangements worked
out in the Central Economic Working Conference and the National
Politics and Laws Working Conference.
</P>
<P>
Viewing maintenance of social stability as their highest
priority, public security organs should deepen the reforms,
improve law enforcement, strengthen basic work at grassroots
level, continue to prevent and crack down severely on various
kinds of major crimes, including economic ones.
</P>
<P>
Close attention should be paid to improvement of professional
ethics of police, he said, adding that police forces should help
ensure China's smooth resumption of exercising the sovereignty
over Hong Kong and the successful opening of the 15th National
Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be redoubled to adhere to the principle of
"strike hard," including strict prevention and control, Tao said.
</P>
<P>
An instant-reaction system should be established to speed up
the efficiency of the police, local police stations should be
reinforced, and the quality of the police should be improved, Tao
told the conference.

<HEADLINE> Italy Approves Budget But Challenges Lie Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 23 (Xinhua) -- With the Parliament's approval of
the 1997 budget, Italy still faces many challenges such as
economic reform and several other problems, local newspapers said
today.
</P>
<P>
While some media hailed the accomplishment of the government in
the past year, other major newspapers said the budget will lead to
"higher taxes, fewer hospital beds, more expensive petrol and
natural gas."
</P>
<P>
Italy's Freedom Front leader Silvio Berlusconi called for a new
political order that can facilitate reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that all reforms require an agreement among political
parties on modernizing the country and putting the budget into
reality.
</P>
<P>
The Italian parliament on Sunday overwhelmingly approved the
government's 1997 austerity budget, bringing a sigh of relief to
Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who is enthusiastically pushing for
Italy's entry into the single European currency in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The budget is designed to reduce the deficit to 3.1 percent of
the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997, approaching the 3
percent standard set by the Maastricht Treaty for the entry of the
European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The EMU plans to
launch the single European currency by the year 1999.
</P>
<P>
Italy, which successfully brought back its lira to the exchange
rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS) in November,
is eager to be among the first countries to join the EMU.

Procurators' Conference for examining this year's work and making
plans for the new year opened in the Chinese capital today.
</P>
<P>
The procurators will also discuss enforcement of amendments to
the Criminal Procedural Law and the Criminal Law.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of the Supreme People's
Procuratorate(SPP), sponsored the conference, in which Liang
Guoqing, deputy chief procurator of the SPP, delivered a work
report.
</P>

Liang said that China's procurators have focused attention on
major corruption cases involving government officials since the
beginning of the year, and have given a strong push to the

He said that procurators nationwide have participated in the
national anti-crime campaign, which started April 28, and have
contributed to halting the rising crime rate.

Liang listed three major tasks for procurators in
1997: continuing the investigation and prosecution of major
corruption cases involving government officials; hitting major
criminal activities hard; and carrying out their supervisory work
in a strict fashion.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that procurators across the country should make
every effort to improve their law-enforcement ability, to help

<HEADLINE> Russian FM Opposes NATO's Eastward Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeni Primakov today voiced his strong opposition to eastward
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Primakov said at a press conference that "the stance of the
Russian Federation has been negative toward the eastward
expansion of NATO."
</P>
<P>
"We don't care much for declarations. What is important is
our own interpretation based on which the expansion of NATO is
dangerous to Russia both geopolitically, politically and
militarily," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, he said, "the probable expansion of NATO can
give rise to a new division of Europe, which Russia absolutely
does not approve of."
</P>
<P>
On foreign military presence in the Persian Gulf, especially
the United States, he said, "definite measures should be
taken to resolve all crisis in the region."
</P>
<P>
"It is only then that the military presence of the foreign
powers in the region will be limited," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his arrival in Tehran Sunday, the Russia foreign
 minister said that Russia will expand bilateral ties with Iran,
adding that the cooperation between the two countries is not
against any other countries.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure to Moscow today, he said, "Russia and
Iran are two neighboring countries and the Moscow-Tehran
relations are both in the interests of the two countries and the
regional peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed a memorandum of understanding here today
to control export of weapons of mass destruction and missile
technology.
</P>
<P>
They also signed a memorandum of understanding on visa and
consular affairs and issued two joint communiques on Afghanistan
and Tajikistan.

billion U.S. dollars, or three percent of the GDP, to the state
treasury.

<HEADLINE> Nepali House Session on No-confidence Adjourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The special session of
Nepal's lower house turned into a confrontation between MPs of
ruling and opposition sides Monday mid-night before it was
adjourned at 1:30 a.m. Tuesday (GMT 19:15 Monday) till afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The stalemate began late Monday when lawmakers from the two
sides were shouting slogans against each other.
</P>
<P>
Earlier opposition lawmakers had staged a sit-in protest in
front of the speaker's rostrum for about three hours to block the
speaker to call for the voting on a no-confidence motion against
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his three-party coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
They alleged that some MPs of the ruling side have kidnapped
one MP who was supposed to vote in favor of the no-confidence
motion tabled by main opposition the Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML).
</P>
<P>
Bhakta Bahaur Rokaya of the Nepal Workers' and Peasants' Party
(NWPP) was abducted early Monday by Home Minister K. B. Khadka and
two MPs of the main ruling Nepali Congress (NC) party for fears of
the approval of the no-confidence motion, opposition MPs said.
</P>
<P>
They maintained that only after the "kidnapped MP" is sent back
to the house the no-confidence motion could be put to vote.
</P>
<P>
The NWPP party, with three MPs in the house, announced Monday
morning that it will support the no-confidence motion against the
NC-led government.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Deuba denied at the house meeting that
his government had arrested any MPs of the lower house.
</P>
<P>
Monday's house meeting, starting at 11:30, earlier was
adjourned twice as opposition MPs opposed the voting and blocked
Prime Minister Deuba to reply on the no-confidence motion.

<HEADLINE> Crackdown on Poor Health Food Planned Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A national crackdown on fake
and substandard health foods will begin early next year, reported
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Public Health, the action, which
runs from January to March, will start with an inspection of
manufacturers of health foods.
</P>
<P>
Publicity activities will also be organized to teach consumers
about nutrition and recommend high-quality products, said Su Zhi,
director of the Food Hygiene Inspection Division under the
Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers will be banned from marketing unregistered health
foods, and violators will be punished in line with the ministerial
regulation on the management of health foods that took effect in
June.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Health will provide guidance for those
who fail to meet State requirements, Su said.
</P>
<P>
Through the inspection, Su said, the ministry will gain a clear
understanding of the health food industry in the country and
gradually standardize production of health foods.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks yesterday in Beijing during a national
symposium on health foods jointly sponsored by the Ministry of
Health and Hong Kong Golden Sun investment Holdings Limited.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 experts and representatives from the health food
industry participated in the meeting to study the health food
situation in China and draw up plans for the future.
</P>
<P>
Su told the conference that there are approximately 3,000
enterprises producing health foods, and the Ministry has received
an increasing number of complaints about the quality of the
so-called health food products in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Some products have never been inspected by the Ministry of
Public Health and some have been found to lack the nutrients
described in their advertisements.
</P>
<P>
In line with the ministerial regulation on health foods,
enterprises and foreign companies wishing to export such products
to China will have to report to the top health authorities and
receive inspections of their products.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- According to a new regulation
from the Ministry of Public Health, urban health personnel will be
assigned to work in rural county or township medical institutes
from six months to one year, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The rule, which goes into effect on January 1, will enable more
young, experienced health workers to help alleviate the shortage
of high-quality medical personnel in the vast rural areas,
improving medical services for farmers, said Chen Minzhang,
Minister of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
The new rule is one of several measures that the central
government will introduce over the next few years to speed
development of health care in the countryside, Chen said, adding
that the State will re-establish a pooled medical insurance system
in most of the vast rural areas by the year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
Rural medical workers will be placed in training programs to
improve health care services, Chen said. Cities near rural areas
will be asked to continue to support their surrounding rural areas
by training medical personnel, providing technical guidance and
donating necessary medical equipment for local medical units.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Public Health investigations found that rural
inhabitants still suffer from shortages of medicine and physicians.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90 percent of all farmers have to pay all of their own
medical costs. About half of the rural working poor are reduced
to poverty by disease, ministry investigators found.
</P>
<P>
The pooled medical system that was popular in rural areas in
the late 1960s was largely abandoned in the 1980s. Only about one
of every 10 rural residents has joined a co-operative medical
system.
</P>
<P>
Under such a system, participants pay premiums and some of the
medical costs; the collective pays the rest.
</P>
<P>
Five State organs have worked out a joint plan to develop a
rural co-operative medical system.

telemetering system of a world advanced level for round-the-clock
monitoring of the content of sand in rivers.
</P>
<P>
The system will help deal with sands that grind the generating
units of hydro-electrical power stations, and regulate sand
silting in reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
The computer-controled system, invented by the Sanmenxia Water
Control Administration, will provide accurate data for technicians
to decide the best time for power generation in the sandy Yellow
River.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China has acquired high-yield
oil and gas from the country's deepest onshore horizontal well,
officials at the Shixi Oilfield have reported.
</P>
<P>
Shixi workers recently pumped a stream from the well with daily
output of 1,025 tons of crude oil and 272,000 cubic meters of gas.
</P>
<P>
The desert well is in the heart of the Junggar Basin in
northwest China. The horizontal well, almost 5,000 meters in
depth, is the deepest of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
Drilling of the well started in May, and was completed on
October 30 this year. During the period, workers have broken a
number of drilling records.
</P>
<P>
Development of horizontal wells involve new and efficient
technology. Sinking of the well has helped China win experience in
developing special oil and gas bearing structures in the desert of
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Talent Fair to Help College Graduates Find Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Although the job market in
Beijing is not at its best, college graduates will be given an
opportunity to meet potential employers at a "talent fair" to be
held here in January, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Li Chaogang, a senior official from the city's
personnel administration, as saying that an unprecedented 59,000
graduates in the capital were expected to be seeking jobs in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 4,000 more than in 1996, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that the job market should have openings
for about 57,000 graduates, thus the demand for and supply of
talent will be closely balanced this year, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The positions will require more talented individuals with
higher degrees. More than 7,000 college graduates with only two or
three years of college education, will have to compete for the
2,500 positions available to them, according to Han Qinglin,
another senior official from the city's personnel administration.
</P>
<P>
The fact that many graduates are exercising greater selectivity
in the job market has contributed to the more stringent demands of
the job market and of the higher expectations from college
graduates, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
As a result, employers frequently complain that they find it
hard to fill positions they have vacancies for, while job-seekers
often can not find suitable jobs.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 units, including Government departments,
state-owned and non state-owned enterprises, joint-ventures and
foreign firms in Beijing will enroll employees at the fair, which
is expected to attract 10,000 job-seekers.
</P>
<P>
Units from other provinces will also take part in the fair, Li
said.

PANAMA CITY, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Guatemalan government
is investigating properties of former President Jorge Serrano who
has been living in asylum in Panama for three years, Guatemalan
Ambassador to Panama Gisela Godinez Sazo said today.
</P>
<P>
The investigation will cover Panama and other countries where
Jorge Serrano could have investments so as to determine whether
his money came from Guatemala's public treasury, according to the
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Serrano ruled Guatemala from 1991 to 1993, and fled to

<HEADLINE> Measures For Improving Shanghai's Living Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Additions to existing houses
should go hand in hand with the rebuilding of apartments to
improve living conditions for Shanghai's residents, according to
an article in the latest issue of China's "Real Estate News".
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, China's largest city had a combined
residential floor space of 119.06 million sq m, but only 50.7
percent of that had proper facilities, and 58.7 million sq m
lacked necessities, such as kitchens or toilets.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that it would take 24 years to remove those
houses and to build standard flats at the current annual
construction rate of two to three million sq m of flats.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Zhong Yongjun, chief engineer with the
Shanghai Administration of Real Estate, said that additional
facilities are a must, and that 10 million sq m must be added
annually to meet the goal of giving 70 percent of Shanghai's
houses the necessary basic facilities by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said that close cooperation between departments,
preferential local government policies, various kinds of fund
raising, and the active participation of residents are
prerequisites for the success of the improvement campaign.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, a combined floor space of 35 million sq m of
flats was built in Shanghai, and dangerous or old housing with a
total floor space of 11.6 million sq m were demolished.
</P>
<P>
During that period, the city added facilities to 400,000 sq m
of substandard housing.

<HEADLINE> Wildlife Protection In China's Largest Nature Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, December 24 (Xinhua)-- The Antelopes of Hoh Xil, in
China's Qinghai Province, used to react in panic at the sound of
shots, but now graze and drink water in a carefree manner in the
largest uninhabited part of northwest China.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, illegal hunters slipped into the uninhabited zone, and
caught or killed rare animals, with more than 30,000 peasants
joining the activity, creating havoc.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands wild yaks, wild ass, antelopes, snow
leopards, and other rare animals were killed in the 90,000-sq-km
of the zone, which stretches across Qinghai, and the Tibet and
Xinjiang regions. The ecology and environment were devastated in
the process.
</P>
<P>
After that, a campaign was launched to rescue the zone, and
from October of last year to May this year, 12 groups of poachers,
involving 83 people, were caught, along with 1,000 antelope hides,
19 firearms, and more than 30,000 cartridges.
</P>
<P>
On January 18, 1994, Gyaisam Soinam Targyai, deputy party
secretary of Zhiduo county in Qinghai province, was shot dead
while trying to stop the killing of rare animals.
</P>
<P>
The crime shocked the people nationwide, and increasing numbers
of people, especially policemen and ex-servicemen, began to devote
their energies to the protection movement, and militiamen have
been sent to the zone seven times to crack down on illegal
activities over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The area was declared a nature reserve in 1995 by the Qinghai
provincial government, and seven members were added to the zone's
administration committee, along with 69 staff members.
</P>
<P>
An eight-man police patrol and ten ex-servicemen are now
responsible for making rounds 24 hours a day, and the wild animals
and mineral resources in the reserve at last have some more
effective protection.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 rare relics
have been found in an underground palace and a hidden chamber of a
pagoda in Shanghai's Jiading District.
</P>
<P>
The relics include Buddhist scripts, jade, coins, and gold and
silver sculptures from the Song (960-1279), Yuan (1271-1368), and
Ming (1368-1644) dynasties. The items were discovered during work
on the endangered pagoda.
</P>
<P>
The pagoda was started in 1205, and is one of Shanghai's
oldest. It was quite weather-beaten by the time repair work
started in 1995.
</P>
<P>
While technicians were digging a well to the northwest of the
pagoda, they discovered the underground palace and a great number
of relics. Further research led to more relics in a hidden chamber
at the top of the pagoda.
</P>
<P>
In response to the find, the district government put documents
on present local social development and models of high-tech
products into the underground palace and the top chamber.

<HEADLINE> Gaps Among Regions in Brazil Narrowed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The once wide economic
gaps among Brazil's different regions have been narrowed over the
past few years, according to the Institute of Applied Economic
Research (IIEA) today.
</P>
<P>
The institute said that in 1994, the real products of the
relatively poor northern and northeastern regions grew 7.7 and 6.6
percent respectively, higher than those of the rich southern and
southeastern zones of 5.6 and 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
And in 1995, although Brazil's economic indicator fell, the
northern region still enjoyed an unprecedented growth of 8.7
percent, while the northeast gained 4.5 percent, 0.3 percent over
the national average.
</P>
<P>
IIEA partially attributed the narrowing to the combination of
the inflation drop and thriving trade.
</P>
<P>
But the southeastern zone still brings out 57 percent of
Brazil's gross domestic production (GDP), the IIEA said.

<HEADLINE> Shandong to Export More Machinery by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
has set a target to export four billion US dollars worth of
machinery a year by the turn of the century, "China's Machinery
and Electronics News" reported.
</P>
<P>
The province intends to resort to exports to gear up
development of the local machine-building Industry, which won
nearly 1.4 billion US dollars in foreign exchange from exports in
1995, a big leap from 320 million US dollars in 1990.
</P>
<P>
This means that during the 1990-1995 period, the annual growth
rate of the local sector's foreign exchange from exports reached
34 percent, higher than the 30 percent national average.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve exports, the industry will give priority to
ten leading, technology-intensive and high-value-added products,
including numerically-controlled machine tools, forging equipment,
engineering machinery, tractors, diesel engines, freezing
equipment, ships, electrically-driven machines and vehicles for
farm use.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the industry will also increase exports of some
other products, such as grinding apparatus and abrasive, machine
tool parts, valves, cables, instruments and meters, bearings,
hardwares and fasteners.
</P>
<P>
By the turn of the century, the sector aims to build 55 key
export-oriented enterprises, including five with annual foreign
exchange income from exports surpassing 30 million US dollars, 10
with more than 10 million US dollars, and 10 with more than five
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the industry also plans to attract overseas investment
for processing projects and high-value-added items to speed up its
development.

UNITED NATIONS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Members of the
U.N. Security Council today agreed with Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali's report calling for the appointment of another
special envoy for the Great Lakes region in Africa instead of
deployment of a multi-national force.
</P>
<P>
Council President Paolo Fulci of Italy said that in light of
the new situation in the region, the Council members agreed that
the functions of the multi-national force will come to an end.
</P>
<P>
"The general feeling is that in the next few months, the
Council should take a more comprehensive and more integrated
approach to the issue."
</P>
<P>
He noted that suggestions of more involvement were made
following the debate of non-governmental organizations and other
humanitarian organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council shared the view that genocide
cannot remain unpunished and expressed their strong support for
the International Tribunal for Rwanda," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided to establish a multi-national
force for humanitarian purpose on November 15 when the situation
in the Great Lakes region, especially eastern Zaire, was
deteriorating with more than one million refugees starving.
</P>
<P>
Then in the following weeks, with the majority of refugees in
eastern Zaire returning to Rwanda, it became no longer necessary
to deploy the multi-national force there.

SHIJIAZHUANG, December 24 (Xinhua)-- More than 210 unmanned
power substations have been brought into use in China since 1994,
serving to upgrade power grids in the country's rural areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Beijing residents are now
enjoying a far more healthier life compared with several decades
ago, according to a report from the local health bureau.
</P>
<P>
The average life expectancy of the capital city's residents
reached 74 years last year, more than 30 years longer than that
before the foundation of new China in 1949, the report said.
</P>
<P>
An official at the bureau attributed the prolonged life
expectancy to fine economic growth, social progress and the
improved health care system in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said that the major health index of the city have already
reached or got close to that of the moderately-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of epidemic diseases has dropped dramatically in
the past dozen years. Compared with the figures of 1985, the
incidence of hepatitis has dropped by 67 percent to 55 per 100,000
in 1995, the incidence of dysentery, by 78 percent to 232 per
100,000, scarlet fever, by 90 percent to 7 per 100,000 and the
measles, by 96 percent to 37 per 10 million.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Takes Legal Action to Protect Wild Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China will extend legal
protection to selected wild plants as it has for endangered wild
animals, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Wild Plants Protection Regulations, ratified by the State
Council on September 30, will take effect on January 1, said Chen
Jianwei, deputy director of the Wild Animal and Forestry
Conservation Department, under the Ministry of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
The protected plants will be divided into two major categories,
Class One and Class Two, covering sub-divisions such as endangered
plants, and culturally and economically valuable plants. The list
will then be ratified by the State council, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
China is home to more than 30,000 kinds of plants, 12 percent
of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
The ministries of forestry and agriculture will enforce the new
protective regulations, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, precious plants, especially those with market
value, have been threatened by over-cutting, Chen explained.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations, together with the Wild Animal Protection
Regulations issued in 1988, are expected to help curb illegal
damage and trading of precious flora and fauna.
</P>
<P>
Violators of the plant preservation regulations will be fined
10 times the market value of the protected flora.
</P>
<P>
Criminal laws, reportedly, will impose still heavier
punishments for illegal activities involving protected flora and
fauna.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that in the past, because of light penalties, illegal
activities were rampant in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Chen also attributed the still-pervasive damage done to animal
and plant species to irresponsible local officials. He noted that
their awareness of their responsibilities towards protected plants
and animals should be raised.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the Ministry of Forestry regards flora and
fauna as a single, whole system to be preserved.
</P>
<P>
China has established 574 reserves for wild animals and
plants.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Liquidate Ailing Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia (BI), the
central bank, has set liquidation as the last option if certain
steps fail to save a bank facing financial trouble, a BI official
said.
</P>
<P>
Hendrobudyanto, director for banks development, told local
press Monday that the government has decided a legal basis to
liquidate an ailing bank if a number of steps like fresh capital
injection, merger and transfer of management, fail to recover its
financial trouble, newspapers here reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation, which aimed to complement the central
bank's efforts to cope with problem banks, provides better
protection for depositors, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said whenever a bank was liquidated, depositors must be paid
after an appointed liquidation team pays all salaries owed, court
fees, auction fees, taxes and administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
Before this regulation, a bank's depositors were considered a
company's non-preferred creditors.
</P>
<P>
The director said the regulation was timely. The previous rules
had often complicated bank liquidation.
</P>
<P>
Banking analysts often cite Bank Summa and Bank Umum Majapahit
which failed in 1992 as examples of this complexity. Their
liquidation is still proceeding.
</P>
<P>
Bank Summa was closed in 1992 because of bad loans worth around
500 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Before the new regulation, bank liquidation was based on the
1995 Companies Law, which stipulates that companies including
banks can be dissolved three ways: by resolution of the company's
shareholders, expiry of the company's operational life or by a
court decision.

WUHAN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 million flood
victims in central China's Hubei Province will have enough food
and housing against the cold this winter.

<HEADLINE> hke- Romania Warns Against Election in Separatist Region of Moldova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Romania said on Monday that
the "presidential election" on Sunday in a breakaway region of
neighboring Moldova would only increase the tensions there.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry statement reiterated Romania's continued
support for the stance held by the Moldovan government against the
election in the region east of the river Dnestr.
</P>
<P>
The election in the region, known as Transdnestr, would make
the negotiations between the Moldovan government and the regional
authorities more difficult, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Dominated by ethnic Russians and Ukrainians, Transdnestr
declared independence in 1991 from Moldova, a tiny former Soviet
republic sandwiched in between Romania and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The Moldovan authorities have promised "widest possible"
autonomy to Transdnestr under the precondition of a united Moldova.
</P>
<P>
Peru Lucinschi, who was elected Moldovan president in run-off
elections on December 1, said on Monday that the election in the
Transdnestr was only "local election within Moldova."
</P>
<P>
The Moldovan government has been negotiating with the
Transdnestr authorities for years but have failed to reach an
agreement on the region's status.

KIEV, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine will expand military
cooperation with its strategic partner, Russia, a defense ministry
official said today.

important buildings, participants of the coordination conference
said.
</P>
<P>
The size of the military maneuver has not been revealed.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Govt Dispatches Seeds To North Part </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 24 (Xinhua)-- The Sri Lankan government has
dispatched over 2,900 tons of paddy seed to the Jaffna Peninsula
over the past two months, according to official sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that more than 34,400 farming families in the
recaptured areas are now busy with their work and they have
prepared over 7,500 hectares to cultivate paddy in the coming
season.
</P>
<P>
The government has made arrangements to despatch another 1,500
tons of paddy seed to the peninsula as the target of 6,000
hectares set by the government earlier was surpassed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government has also made arrangements to
provide the farmers with 1,700 tons of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that 150 tons of seed potatoes, onion and
vegetable seeds will also be distributed among the farmers in the
areas.
</P>
<P>
Jaffna Peninsula was once the stronghold of the Tamil rebels
who have been waging a 13-year war for a separate state in the
north-east of the island country. The peninsula was recaptured by
the government troops last May.
</P>
<P>
All farming land on the peninsula had been abandoned for over a
decade as a result of the rebel activities in the areas, the
sources said. Since the recapture of these areas, the government
has been helping the farmers resume their day-to-day activities,
they added.

<HEADLINE> US Retailers Enjoy Brisk Sales During Christmas Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Retailers across the U.S.
have been enjoying better-than-expected sales as shoppers stepped
up their spending on the final weekend before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
Many merchants have been expecting sales increases to be up 4
percent to 9 percent this holiday season over last year, according
to a report of the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
The traditional holiday shopping season between Thanksgiving
and Christmas was five days shorter than last year, but spending
was up, particularly for jewelry, apparel and toys. A few of the
big chain stores reported double-digit sales increases.
</P>
<P>
Price cut is the universal tool used by retailers, some of whom
cut the prices of their goods up to 75 percent. Consumers thronged
to the well decorated stores and malls to make their last minute
rush to fill up their shopping lists.
</P>
<P>
The computer market saw a sales pick up during the holiday
shopping season, as more people took the benefit of price-cutting
by some big companies. At Circuit City, a major electronic gadget
seller, large-screen televisions are also selling well. Another
hot item is a new crop of hand-held computing devices.
</P>
<P>
Devices for connecting a television set to the Internet using a
service known as WebTV Networks have attracted a lot of interest,
but the attention has not yet translated into big sales.
</P>
<P>
According to analysts, consumers at this time last year
bought up home PC's based on Intel's Pentium processors in order
to run Windows 95, the new Microsoft operating system released then.
</P>
<P>
This year, the only thing driving purchases are prices that can
push unit sales up easily.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department said today that consumer spending
was up 0.5 percent in November. While that was down from a 0.7
percent gain in October, it was still slightly better than the 0.4
percent rise many analysts had been expecting.
</P>
<P>
An overall rise has been widely expected for the Christmas
sales, compared with that of last year, which was described by
many retailers as "terrible."

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government is
delaying the auction for its new inflation-adjusted bonds, an
official of the U.S. Treasury Department said today.
</P>
<P>
Roger Anderson, deputy assistant treasury secretary for federal
finance, said that final terms and conditions, which market
participants will also need to review, had not been finalized for
the new securities.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely unlikely that we will have an early January
auction date. We are looking at a slight delay," Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the size of the offering was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
announced the establishment of the new investment instruments last
May.
</P>
<P>
The new 10-year securities will offer protection against
inflation and pay a guaranteed real rate of return as the
inflation is eating into investors' returns.
</P>
<P>
The auction of the new bond had been set for January 15 and no
new date for the sale has been picked.

</P>
<P>
By medical area, nervous system drugs grew quickly, with sales
up 13 percent to 16.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sales of heart disease drugs amounted to 20.5 billion dollars,
an increase of only 3 percent. Heart drugs could soon be overtaken

<HEADLINE> UN Extends Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today decided to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) for a further
period ending June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously, the council deplored the
violent incidents of August 11 and 14, September 8 and October 15,
which resulted in deaths of three Greek Cypriot civilians and one
member of the Turkish Cypriot Security Forces, as well as injuries
to civilians and UNFICYP personnel.
</P>
<P>
While emphasizing the need to maintain law and order, the
Security Council demanded that both parties prevent unauthorized
incursions into the buffer zone, and respond immediately and
responsibly to any demonstrations which violate the buffer zone
and any demonstrations near the buffer zone that might lead to an
increase in tensions.
</P>
<P>
The council called on the parties to accept the following
reciprocal measures:
</P>
<P>
-- to extend the 1989 unmanning agreement to other areas where
the two sides remain in close proximity to each other;
</P>
<P>
-- to prohibit loaded weapons along the cease-fire lines; and
</P>
<P>
-- to adopt a code of conduct, based on the concept of minimal
force and proportional response, to be followed by troops on both
sides along the cease-fire lines.
</P>
<P>
The council also called on the military authorities on both
sides to clear all minefields and booby-trapped areas, to cease
military construction near the buffer zone, and to refrain from
any military exercises along the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
After the outbreak of violence between Greek Cypriot and
Turkish Cypriot communities in December 1963, the Security Council
decided to establish a peacekeeping force there on March 14, 1964.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the peacekeeping force includes using its best
efforts to prevent a recurrence of fighting, contributing to
maintenance and restoration of law and order and a return to
normal conditions.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the council has periodically extended the mandate
of the peacekeeping force.

<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China is yto strengthen checks
on the operation of state-owned assets, according to a national
conference held in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Youcai, director of the State Administration of State
Property, told the conference that in 1997, the maintenance and
increase of state-owned assets will be a major standard for the
government to judge the achievements of operators.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, also vice-minister of finance, said that it is necessary
to study links between workers' salaries, economic returns of
enterprises, and the maintenance and increase of the state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the scope of checks on increment of state-owned
assets should be exercised on all enterprises owned by governments
at provincial and prefecture level, and 80 percent of enterprises
owned by governments at county level.
</P>
<P>
The official also suggested sending more boards of supervisors
to enterprises, setting up modern enterprise systems in more
enterprises, and conducting experimental tests on the improvement
of capital structures.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also urged government officials to strengthen the
management of property registration and to improve handling of

<HEADLINE> US Personal Incomes, Spending Up in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Personal incomes in the
U.S. increased in November while consumer spending also went up,
the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that personal incomes rose by 0.5 percent
in the month after being flat in October.
</P>
<P>
The number of people employed, the average number of hours
worked and the average hourly earnings all showed increases. Wages
and salaries, the key part of incomes, were rising at a rate of
22.5 billion dollars, after having fallen by 4.9 billion in
October.
</P>
<P>
Americans' disposable income, the amount left after paying
taxes, rose by 0.5 percent in the month following a small 0.1
percent gain in October.
</P>
<P>
After adjusting for inflation, disposable income rose by 0.3
percent in November after declining 0.2 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
The personal savings rate in the U.S., savings as a percentage
of disposable income, held steady at 5 percent in November, the
same level as October.
</P>
<P>
The report said that U.S. Consumer spending was up by 0.5
percent in November, down from a 0.7 percent gain in October.
</P>
<P>
After inflation adjustments, consumer spending was up by 0.3
percent in November after a 0.4 percent October increase.
</P>
<P>
The big increase in personal consumption spending reflected
strength in purchases of services but sales of both durable and
nondurable goods also showed advances.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe consumer spending, which accounts for
two-thirds of total economic activity, holds the key to whether
the U.S. economy continues to grow at a modest rate through 1997
or whether slowdown snowballs into something worse such as an
outright recession.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government reported last week that nation's gross
domestic product rose at an annual rate of just 2.1 percent during
the third quarter of this year after a 4.7 percent surge in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
But the consumer spending rose a barely perceptible 0.5
percent, the poorest showing in nearly five years.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Arafat May Meet Tonight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat may meet tonight to conclude the Hebron
redeployment agreement, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic breakthrough in the talks between the Israelis
and Palestinians came this afternoon when Netanyahu joined the
negotiations held at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mahmoud Abbas, Arafat's deputy and Palestinian top
negotiator, came from the Gaza Strip to participate in the
talks, which were a continuation of Sunday night's Marathon
talks in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and visiting U.S. special Middle East coordinator
Dennis Ross took an active role in the night-long intensive
negotiations held at Arafat's Gaza office and lasted until
early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Both Arafat and Ross expressed cautious optimism following
the talks, but Ross admitted that difference remained between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
PNA Finance Minister Mohammed Nashashibi said today that
there has been progress in all directions in Sunday night's
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Nashashibi told reporters that the negotiators are working on
a package deal involving other issues in addition to Hebron, but
he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Sources in both delegations said that Netanyahu and Arafat
could meet as soon as tonight to conclude the agreement on the
Israeli army's redeployment in the disputed West Bank town.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Arafat told reporters in Gaza that a meeting
between himself and the Israeli prime minister could take place
"later today."
</P>
<P>
Progress in the negotiations was reported earlier today
before Netanyahu and Abbas joined in to make a final push to
conclude the agreement before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the breakthrough is a package deal Ross has
been working on, which includes Israel's commitment to further
redeploy its troops in the West Bank following the redeployment
in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Under the package deal, Israel also would agree to hold final
status talks on the West Bank and other issues a few weeks after
the conclusion of the Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Netanyahu is holding a special
cabinet meeting at this hour to brief cabinet ministers on the
outcome of the latest negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ross, who flew to Egypt today to brief Egyptian
officials on the latest development in Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations, is flying back to Israel, and is due to arrive
here in the coming hours.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Abbas returned to the Gaza Strip to report
to Arafat on the result of today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The report said that if Arafat accepts the package deal, a
meeting between the Palestinian leader and the Israeli premier
would take place tonight at the Erez Checkpoint between Israel
and the Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Pig Heart Transplant in India Turns Out to Be Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A recent controversial pig
heart transplant on a human being by an Indian doctor turned out
to be a case of fraud aimed at securing publicity for the doctor
himself, Press Trust of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old doctor, identified as Dhani Ram Baruah, had
claimed that he had successfully transplanted a pig heart to a
patient who suffered from incurable heart disease in a clinic in
India's Assam state earlier last week.
</P>
<P>
Kamala Kalita, Assam state health minister, today made a
statement to the state assembly, saying that it was a case of
fraud.
</P>
<P>
He said Baruah first claimed before the press, which was also
recorded on video, that he had performed the transplant and then
gave a written declaration to a government-appointed inquiry
committee that he did not performed the transplant.
</P>
<P>
This proved that the doctor "plotted to cheat," the minister
noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister assured the local house that necessary action
would be taken against Baruah "who wanted to get publicity by
spreading false news."
</P>
<P>
Kalita said in view of the news about the pig heart transplant
creating a worldwide sensation and raising controversy, the issue
was investigated by a government-appointed inquiry committee under
the health establishment act of the state.

<HEADLINE> Three Million Children Live in Jobless Homes in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Over three million children in
Britain live in a home where no one has a job, an increase of
400,000, 15 percent up since the last general election, the
opposition Labor Party says Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of jobless two-parent homes has remained almost
static since the 1992 election at 500,000 while the number of
unemployed single parents has gone up by 220,000, or 27 percent
and now stands close to one million.
</P>
<P>
There are 1.7 million children in single-parent jobless
households compared to 1.1 million children with two parents
without jobs.
</P>
<P>
Labor says that the increase of the number of children living
in jobless homes is mainly due to rising unemployment among single
mothers, and now more than half of lone mothers are out of work.
</P>
<P>
The figures were "a shocking indictment of failed Tory policies"
and "the best Christmas present ministers could give youngsters is
the chance of a job for their parents," said Labor employment
spokesman Peter Hain.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Makes Emergency Appeal for 1997 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) has made an emergency appeal for its 1997 budget
of 572 million U.S. dollars while it still lacks a total of 41
million dollars for 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to an ICRC press release issued here today, of the
total budget, 107 million dollars will be used for its
headquarters budget, 465 million dollars will go for the field
budget. The field budget shows an increase of eight percent
compared to the initial budget for 1996, without taking possible
operations in Zaire into account.
</P>
<P>
The largest proportion of the 1997 field budget is assigned to
Africa, with about 181.5 million dollars, accounting for over one
third of the field budget. 20 percent of the budget (about 98.5
million dollars) will go to Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The
operations in Rwanda alone will take nearly 52 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
As for a shortage of funds for the current year, the
Geneva-based ICRC says that a total of 41 million dollars is still
needed to close the 1996 accounts without a deficit. Moreover,
pledges amounting to 46 million dollars still have to be honored.
ICRC is concerned that it will probably face an unprecedented
financial situation at the end of 1996 if donors do not respond
immediately to close the gap.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Returned PAP Still Facing Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 23 (Xinhua) -- After being returned to
power as 47 of its candidates, already a majority in the 83-seat
Parliament, won their walkovers on the Nomination Day today, the
ruling People's Action Party (PAP) of Singapore is gearing itself
up to dampen the by-election strategy by the opposition camp and
expand its victory.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here pointed out, however, that although
there is no question about the PAP's overwhelming victory in the
eighth general election since the country's independence in 1965,
its battles against the opposition -- the Workers' Party (WP), the
Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), and the Singapore People's Party
(SPP) in particular -- in certain single-seat wards may not be as
easy as one imagines.
</P>
<P>
The opposition camp was believed to be again employing the
strategy of by-election effect this time, as it fielded a total of
only 39 candidates, with 38 from the five opposition parties and
one as an independent candidate.
</P>
<P>
With this tactics, the opposition is attempting to take
advantage of the logic by some voters that given the PAP enjoying
the majority in the legislature, maybe it's better to have one or
two more opposition members in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
In other words, by contesting fewer than half of the seats and
conceding government to the PAP on Nomination Day, the opposition
gave voters one reason fewer to vote for the PAP in their
respective constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The opposition used the strategy in the 1991 general election,
in which it won a record large number of four seats in the House,
while the PAP suffered a lowest support rate of 60.97 percent.
</P>
<P>
To defuse the opposition strategy, the PAP candidates, since
last year, have been presenting various estate improvement plans,
or housing upgrading plans as bottom-up initiatives and have made
these promises part of a job to be undertaken by the proposed
Community Development Councils (CDCs), or as is called, the local
government.
</P>
<P>
Some observers said that given the pragmatic attitude of the
voters, and now that the stakes in each constituency are higher
than ever before, it is obvious that the choice of a Member of
Parliament (MP) will have a direct impact on voters' life.
Therefore, they believe the PAP has found an effective counter to
the by-election strategy in this local-election effect.
</P>
<P>
However, some others pointed out that estate improvement,
redevelopment and upgrading programs might not benefit all voters
uniformly, as they might be irrelevant to people in private homes
or new estates.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the campaign strategies, the political analysts
said more attention should be paid to the fights in such
single-seat constituencies as Hougang, Potong Pasir, MacPherson,
and Bukit Gombak, where "close battles", as they described, could
be staged.

<TEXT>
<P>
They also noted to their surprise that the opposition should
manage to come up with six teams to rival the PAP in six of the
total of the 15 Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs).
</P>
<P>
The straight fight between the five-member team of the Workers'
Party led by Secretary-General J.B. Jeyaretnam against the PAP
team led by Education Minister Lee Yock Suan in the Cheng San GRC
would be something worth attention, they said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they were quick to add that since not a single
opposition team survived in the GRCs in the 1991 election, they
were not sure of the fate of these opposition team candidates this
time.
</P>
<P>
But it is true that this is the first time ever the opposition
managed to put up so many teams in the GRCs' fight. If, and only
if, one of the opposition teams should win, it would be something
of a decisive significance, though the chances of this happening
are not great, they said.
</P>
<P>
Some observers also noted that of the 24 new candidates fielded
by the PAP, all were well-educated with university degrees and
have an average age of 41, reflecting the PAP claim that this
would be the team to lead Singapore well into the 21st century,
while by comparison, none of the opposition parties comes up with
a comparable team as such.
</P>
<P>
Besides, although the opposition parties might launch attacks
on certain PAP policies, none of them offered any set of policies
as comprehensive and practical as those of the PAP to take
Singapore into the next century. This is a fatal wound for them,
the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said earlier today that voting
this time will have a deeper significance for everyone. This is
because the stakes are higher as the voters have to decide whether
the team voted in will be able to run the town council and work
with a Community Development Council.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he warned new voters, especially young voters, to
take their votes seriously, saying that more importantly, the
value of one's estate could be affected by a wrong vote or a
protest vote.

<P>
TOKYO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister
Yukihiko Ikeda returned to Tokyo from Peru tonight after four days
of hectic efforts to help end the hostage crisis at the Japanese
ambassador's residence in Lima.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda is scheduled to confer with Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto at the Foreign Ministry over the situation later in the
night, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto on Sunday ordered Ikeda to return home, believing
that the foreign minister had completed the desired goals of
acting as Japan's on-the-spot adviser in the initial stage of the
hostage saga.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Hashimoto reiterated Japan's position on helping
bring the hostage crisis to a peaceful conclusion in his meetings
with leaders of two smaller allies of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted he will think about what action to take next
after receiving the lastest report from Ikeda, said Kyodo News.

<HEADLINE> World Cotton Output Declines: Committee Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The world's cotton
production is estimated at 18.87 million tons in 1996/97, 1.2
million tons less than last season, said the Washington-based
International Cotton Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
In a monthly report issued here today, the committee noted that
the world cotton consumption for the year is estimated at 18.89
million tons, an increase of 400,000 tons over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The Cotlook A Index, an indicator of average world cotton
prices, rose from 75 cents per pound in mid-November to nearly 80
cents in mid-December, reflecting lower expectations for cotton
production in Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Greece, Paraguay, Turkmenstan
and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the increase in the past month, prices during
the current season are expected to be lower on average than during
1994/95 and 1995/96 which was about 94 cents and 85.6 cents per
pound separately, the report said.
</P>
<P>
World cotton production is expected to reach 19.65 million tons
and consumption 19.52 million tons in 1997/98, therefore, keeping
world supply and demand roughly in balance at the current price
level, indicating little pressure on cotton prices. Thanks to
China's lower net imports which are expected to remain at least as
low in 1997/98 as in 1996/97, the 1997/98 average Cotlook A Index
is estimated at 78 cents per pound, not statistically different
from the estimate of 77 cents for the current year.

<HEADLINE> (rpt with correction)ICRC Makes Emergency Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) has made an emergency appeal for its 1997
budget of 572 million U.S. dollars while it still lacks a total of
41 million dollars for 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to an ICRC press release issued here today, of the
total budget, 107 million dollars will be used for its
headquarters budget, 465 million dollars will go for the field
budget. The field budget shows an increase of eight percent
compared to the initial budget for 1996, without taking possible
operations in Zaire into account.
</P>
<P>
The largest proportion of the 1997 field budget is assigned to
Africa, with about 181.5 million dollars, accounting for over one
third of the field budget, 20 percent of the budget (about 98.5
million dollars) will go to Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The
operations in Rwanda alone will take nearly 52 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
As for a shortage of funds for the current year, the
Geneva-based ICRC says that a total of 41 million dollars is still
needed to close the 1996 accounts without a deficit. Moreover,
pledges amounting to 46 million dollars still have to be honored.
ICRC is concerned that it will probably face an unprecedented
financial situation at the end of 1996 if donors do not respond
immediately to close the gap.

<HEADLINE> Two Former South Korean Presidents Not to Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean Presidents
Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo decided today that they will not
make appeals to the Supreme Court against the Seoul High Court's
ruling over their respective sentences for the mutiny, treason and
bribery case.
</P>
<P>
So far, of the 15 defendants involved in the mutiny and treason
case, only Chun and Roh will not appeal to the country's highest
court.
</P>
<P>
However, since the South Korean prosecution decided to appeal
sentences, the Supreme Court is likely to start its deliberation
beginning early next year and is expected to make the final
judgment around April.
</P>
<P>
On December 16, the Seoul High court commuted the death
sentence to life imprisonment for Chun and 22 years and six months
in prison to 17 years in prison for Roh.
</P>
<P>
It also fined Chun 265.7 million U.S. dollars and Roh 316.6
million dollars, representing the bribes they allegedly received
while in office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Seoul High Court also commuted the prison terms
of 4-10 years to 3.5-8 years for the 13 former South Korean
officers, including former First Army Corps Commander Hwang
Young-si, who helped Chun and Roh in their quest for power.
</P>
<P>
In the first trial on August 26 this year, the Seoul District
Court sentenced Chun to death and Roh to 22 years and six months
in prison respectively on charges of mutiny, treason and bribery.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges stem from the roles played by
Chun and Roh as well as their cronies in the military coup on
December 12, 1979 and the suppression of the civil uprising in
Kwangju, capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province, on May
18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
The 15 defendants were arrested at the end of last year after
President Kim Young-sam called for the enactment of a special bill
paving the way to punish them for past wrongdoing without regard
for the statue of limitations.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980 and ruled the nation until
February 1988. He was followed by Roh who stepped down in February
1993.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Repeats Refusal of Israel's "Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
stressed here today a rejection of Israel's "Lebanon first"
proposal and its varieties, including the suggestion of deploying
Jordanian and Egyptian peacekeeping forces in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi made the remarks as receiving representatives of the
Arab News Agencies Union (ANAU), who ended a three-day annual
meeting in the Lebanese capital Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The president was quoted by Rafik Shlala, vice chairman of
the ANAU and director of the state-run Lebanese National News
Agency, as saying "We never accept these suggestions."
</P>
<P>
He said "the Lebanese army is present and it is ready to fully
play its role."
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that as soon as the Israeli occupation forces
withdraw from south Lebanon, the Lebanese army "guarantees the
tranquility and stability" on the Lebanese-Israeli border and
"prevents any shot and bombardment" at northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi repeated his country's refusal of stopping the
resistance against the Israeli occupation before the Jewish state
pulls its forces out of the Lebanese territories.
</P>
<P>
He said that Lebanon will be the last Arab country reaching
peace with Israel, noting that "this is not out of fear but faith."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani suggested
last week that a multinational peacekeeping force including
Egyptian and Jordanian contingents be deployed in the occupied
border enclave in south Lebanon after an Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Both Egypt and Jordan are bound to the Jewish state by
peace treaties, and Kahalani's exclusion of Damascus was
perceived by Beirut as an attempt to undercut Syria's role.
</P>
<P>
Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, has a 35,000-strong
force spreading over two thirds of Lebanon's lands.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied a border strip in south Lebanon in late 1970s
and unilaterally turned the 1,100-square-kilometer strip,
stretching from the Mediterranean coast to the west eastward to
Mount Hermon, into Israel's "security zone" in 1985.
</P>
<P>
After taking power last June, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu raised the "Lebanon first" proposal, under which the
Jewish state will pull its forces out of the buffer zone after a
security arrangement is mapped out with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon categorically refused the proposal, saying that it
was aimed at driving a wedge between Lebanon and Syria, the
last two Arab countries still in a state of war with the
Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> EC to Host Donor Info Meeting for Former Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
has said it would, together with the World Bank, co-host a Donor
Information Meeting here on January 9-10 to help donors prepare
for the next pledging conference for the former Yugoslavia
scheduled for early in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said that implementation of the 1996
reconstruction program in the former Yugoslavia was "progressing
well" and had accelerated in recent months.
</P>
<P>
It noted that about 1,200 million U.S. dollars of the 1996
donor pledges was currently under implementation, of which 720
million dollars had actually been disbursed to implementing
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"With a significant amount of 1996 pledges expected to be under
implementation or disbursed by year end, fresh money will be
needed in time to prevent implementation delays," the Commission
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commission, the Information Meeting will be
used to review the achievements and status of the 1996 program and
to discuss the sectoral priorities, objectives and financial needs
of the 1997 program.
</P>
<P>
The target for the full four-year (1996-1999) construction
program for the former Yugoslavia is 5.1 billion dollars.

WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A metal-fabricating factory
near southern U.S. city Houston exploded late Sunday, killing at
least five people, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said that the blast happened at the Wyman Gordon
Forging Co., a defense contractor in northwestern Harris County,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
Body parts were thrown as far as 100 yards outside the
building, Fire Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
Local TV reported five people were dead, two others injured and
two to three were missing.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred near a 30,000-ton press in the plant, which
produces extruded pipe used in power and chemical plants.
</P>
<P>
In addition to pipe made at the Houston plant, Wyman Gordon,
which employs 1,200 people, produces high-strength forged and cast
metal parts for a wide variety of applications.

It was not immediately known what caused the explosion and how

<HEADLINE> S. African Farmers Urged Not to Shoot Elephants, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Transvaal
Agricultural Union (TAU) has called on farmers not to shoot
elephants or hippos which damaged land and houses.
</P>
<P>
TAU official Gert Ehlers said in Pietersburg at the weekend
that complaints had been received from farmers along the Limpopo
River bordering Zimbabwe that elephants had been breaking through
dilapidated international fences, causing damage to farms and
sub-tropical fruits.
</P>
<P>
The elephants also caused damage to water tanks, and
surrounding villages were complaining that the jumbos were
endangering their lives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, large numbers of hippos restricted to isolated pools two
years ago, who were being fed during years of drought, had moved to
greener pastures after recent good rains and were now found in pools
they had inhabited more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
The wandering hippos posed a danger to uninformed people
visiting the region, and caused havoc on irrigated land on river
banks.
</P>
<P>
Nature conservationists recently claimed that farmers were allowed
to hunt hippos on their farms. However, Ehlers said he seriously
questioned these allegations because members of organized agriculture
fully supported the TAU's commitment to nature conservation and its
policy of farming in harmony with nature.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he called on farmers who were experiencing problems
with animals on their farms to contact the TAU's nature conservation
and game committees to solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Department of Environmental Affairs and
Tourism said earlier that the Department would give assistance to
farmers who preferred that the animals be removed and resettled
elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Egypt Affirm Progress on Hebron Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East mediator Dennis
Ross and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said today that a
deal on Hebron is near though the Palestinians and Israelis still
need to clear the way ahead.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy will return to Israel tonight after meeting with
Moussa and Osama el-Baz, the chief political adviser to President
Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Ross told reporters that Palestinian and
Israeli negotiators were trying hard to strike a deal on Hebron,
the last West Bank city from which Israel is supposed to pull out
troops last March under the autonomy accords.
</P>
<P>
"The negotiators, I think, are working hard. There is still
work to be done. But I think there is a new energy in the
negotiations," Ross said.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. envoy did not say if an agreement can be reached
before Christmas on Wednesday. His last mediation effort collapsed
in October.
</P>
<P>
"I am hopeful that we can see an agreement soon, but I am not
going to predict when."
</P>
<P>
Moussa also expressed optimism about the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that progress has been made on Israeli army
redeployment in Hebron and other topics," he told reporters,
adding that Egypt has contacted the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said there are some ideas "acceptable to the
Palestinians and Israelis" on this score, noting that all these
points are still under discussion.
</P>
<P>
Calling Egypt "a pillar of the peace process," Ross said he
came here to learn its opinion on the Hebron talks.
</P>
<P>
Ross had separate meetings with Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu Saturday and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
over the weekend, before his arrival here early today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt's Middle East News Agency learned from sources
close to the talks that Palestinian-Israeli agreement is likely
to be signed during the coming few hours on pending issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have so far reached agreement on two points, the
reopening of Shuhada Street and Hussein Market, and the formation
of joint Palestinian-Israeli patrols.
</P>
<P>
Contacts are taking place at present to bring closer
differences on the arming of Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the Palestinian insistence on a presence at the
Ibrahimi Mosque, it was suggested to set up a liaison office at
the mosque to regulate contacts between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In case a written agreement is reached, it will be supported by
an American or an American-Egyptian letter of guarantee to make
sure that Palestinians and Israelis live up to their word in
implementing the remaining part of the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
It is suggested that the agreement and annexed protocols be
signed at the Eretz check-point between Israel and Palestinian
self rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the implementation of the final stage
of the peace accords according to the previous timetable agreed

<HEADLINE> UN Appeals for 91.9 Million U.S. Dollars for Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations today
appealed for 91.9 million U.S. dollars for two linked initiatives
addressing urgent emergency and recovery activities for Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The UN joint inter-agency appeal for Liberia for the first half
of 1997 is coordinated by the Department of Humanitarian Affairs
(DHA) based in Geneva. According to DHA, this is the first part of
a common strategy to address the needs stemming from seven years
of civil war in Liberia. 31.2 million dollars is required to
continue relief activities for civilians and to meet the initial
basic needs of ex-combatants, internally displaced persons and
refugees during the initial reintegration phase. It will provide
initial basic food, health, water and sanitation, shelter and
infrastructure assistance. In addition, it seeks to address the
immediate needs of former child soldiers and abandoned children.
</P>
<P>
Another program coordinated by the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) seeks 60.7 million dollars for immediate
rehabilitation and peace building activities during the whole year
of 1997. The program will focus on community reintegration and
social and economic recovery, as well as job creation,
strengthening law enforcement institutions and other elements of
civil administration, and assisting in the management of
elections.
</P>
<P>
The international community is called upon to respond
generously to these initiatives, to support the people of Liberia
in their aspirations for a new life free of war and destruction.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today returned to the Kremlin and resumed his work after a
rehabilitation period following a heart by-pass surgery last month.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin arrived at his office in the Kremlin this morning at
about 09:40 Moscow time. Getting out from his car, he chatted
briefly with reporters, who had been waiting for him at the
entrance.
</P>
<P>
"I am in a good mood. I feel fine, and I am ready for battle,"
said the Russian president in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin listed the payment of long-delayed wages and pensions,
problems of the armed services and Chechen settlement as his
priorities back at work.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that 1997 would "without doubt be
better than the outgoing year."
</P>
<P>
According to his spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the president
will have working meetings with chief of the presidential
administration Anatoly Chubais and Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin later today and on Tuesday, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, in a televised interview, Yeltsin said he would
return to the Kremlin on December 23, because "the country needs
an active and energetic president, particularly now."
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old president had a heart bypass operation on
November 5, four months after his successful re-election.

<HEADLINE> Maputo to Improve Water Supply in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Water supply is expected to be
improved in Mozambique's capital of Maputo where only 60 percent
of its two million residents have access to tap water, an official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Miguel Alves, general manager of the Maputo Water Authority,
said he is optimistic about the prospect as his company
would make better use of the Umbeluzi River and the Pequenos
Libombos Dam.
</P>
<P>
He said a new water pipe, which supplies water from the
Umbeluzi River to Maputo, would be built.
</P>
<P>
Another 60-kilometer pipeline network would be repaired to
provide water to the city's drought areas which had not been able
to have access to water during the last 10 years, according to
Alves.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, 45 fountains have been built to benefit
about 22,000 people.
</P>
<P>
And with the help of Chinese companies, 11 wells have been
dug in 1996. Another 50 are expected to be sunk in the coming
year, said the general manager.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) will stop distributing food aid
to most of the 13,500 Liberian refugees in Ghana next year in a
bid to encourage the refugees to be self-reliant.
</P>
<P>
Chrysantus Ache, UNHCR Representative in Ghana, said in a
report reaching here today that the decision would be effective
starting January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, he explained that "vulnerable refugee groups" such as
the elderly, children and young mothers may continue to benefit
from free food assistance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, plans are under way for refugee repatriation on the
basis of willingness, said Ache. For example, plans of building
402 refugee homes in Krisan, Ghana, have been finalized, he said.
</P>
<P>
The refugees flooded into Ghana last May when renewed
factional fighting erupted in the Liberian capital of Monrovia
last April.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 13,500 registered Liberian refugees living
in a camp near the Ghanaian capital of Accra, there are another
5,700 unregistered Liberian refugees living in the camps.

<HEADLINE> Tajik President, Opposition Leader Sign Peace Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Tajik President Emomali
Rakhmonov and leader of the United Tajik Opposition Sayed Abdullo
Nuri signed two documents here today, which are expected to end
the over-four-year civil war in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The two documents, an agreement on the results of the Moscow
negotiations and a protocol on the functions and powers of the
National Reconciliation Commission, were signed at Moscow's
President-Hotel in the presence of Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the sides will finally settle their
conflict by way of negotiations within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a cease-fire will be announced for the period of the
talks. In addition, the document envisages a general amnesty and
exchange prisoners of war according to the principle "all for
all."
</P>
<P>
Under the protocol, the National Reconciliation Commission to
be established soon and headed by a representative of the
opposition will control the implementation of the agreement and
have some governmental powers.
</P>
<P>
The commission will have the right to participate in "reforming
the government" by way of incorporating its representatives into
the executive branch, including ministries, state agencies, local
government judicial and law enforcement bodies.
</P>
<P>
The commission will also take part in making amendments to the
existing constitution and in making preparations for the future
parliamentary elections in the Central Asian republic.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the commission membership will be discussed at the
next round of inter-Tajik talks scheduled for January 5 in Tehran,
Iran
</P>
<P>
Initially, the sides were expected to sign a final agreement on
Thursday, as the document had been initiated by Rakhmonov and Nuri
in Afghanistan on December 10 and 11.
</P>
<P>
But several days before the Moscow meeting scheduled to start
on Thursday, the opposition insisted on making some changes to the
already agreed text.
</P>
<P>
The opposition demanded that the commission should receive its
powers from the bodies of supreme power, including the Presidency
and legislature. The powers, according to them, should include
creation of a coalition government for the transitional period.
</P>
<P>
The government side made some compromise, agreeing, mainly, to
grant some governmental powers to the commission.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the sides finally reached agreement on signing of the two
documents.
</P>
<P>
Praising the accords after the signing ceremony, Chernomyrdin
said the agreements "reflect the wishes of the whole people of
Tajikistan, tired of war and internal feuds." He participated in
the Tajik talks as a mediator.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia will always do its best to secure steady
peace and national accord in Tajikistan, expressing confidence
that both sides would have "enough wisdom and will to implement
the important decisions."
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that Russia will continue
to provide assistance to the peace process in Tajikistan, hopes
that the Moscow accords "lay a form foundation for inter-Tajik
settlement."

PARIS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A powerful car bomb explosion
killed one and wounded 20 in central Algiers at 1145 GMT near one
of the principal coffee-shops on a main street of the city, the
Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted Algerian officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place after a series of clashes took place
between Algerian security forces and the Islamic extremists over
the past few days, in which 28 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
AFP said the bomb attack greatly jostled the center of Algiers,
where thousands of company employees, passers-by and pedlars are
gathering every day at the lunch-hour.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers and police, along with ambulances and staff of civil
protection organizations, were immediately dispatched to the scene
of the explosion on Rue d'Isly, near which the headquarters of the
private newspaper Liberte and the city hall are located, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
A witness said that the car was driven by a young man, who got
out of the vehicle and ran away before it blew up.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the Islamic extremists launched a series of bomb
attacks on coffee-shops and restaurants in Algiers and other
cities, killing about 15 people and wounding a dozen others.
</P>
<P>
A high school girl was killed and another wounded in a bomb
explosion which took place last Saturday near a high school in

<P>
NAIROBI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan minister today
assured people that Kenya is committed to eradicating the rapidly
spreading water hyacinth in Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Environment and Natural Resources Henry Kosgey
made the remarks today as he was touring beaches in Kisumu,
western Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan official said his government is concerned about the
weeds which have almost blocked the lake, adding that Lake
Victoria is "the lifeline" to about 37 million people living
around the region in the three East African countries --
Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He announced that Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI)
will start training 100 local people who will rear the weevils
currently being reared at KARI Kibos center.
</P>
<P>
Kosgey disclosed that the weevils, which are currently
breeding in their thousands and will soon multiply into millions,
will be introduced into the lake early next year.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the local people that the World Bank will
soon release 24 million U.S. Dollars for the Lake Victoria
Environmental Management.
</P>
<P>
The money is part of 70 million U.S. Dollars the bank pledged
to Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda to help eradicate the weeds in the
lake.

<HEADLINE> EU to Reconsider Ban on S. Africa's Ostrich Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
has reconsidered lifting the ban on imports of live ostriches and
ostrich meat from South Africa before February 15 next year.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the South African Press Association
today, the ban was imposed by EU's Standing Veterinary Committee
in early November after an outbreak of Congo fever at the
Oudtshoorn abattoir in Western Cape Province.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a South African delegation, led by Director of
Veterinary Public Health of the Agriculture Department Gedeon
Bruckner, visited Brussels to discuss the implications of the ban
with members of the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
In terms of a joint statement issued by the Department and the
National Ostrich Producers Association, the EU had been asked to
differentiate between the ban proposed for ostrich meat and that
for live ostriches because there was an immediate and urgent need
to resume the export of ostrich meat.
</P>
<P>
"It was also pointed out there was no scientific reason to
discriminate between ostrich meat, beef or mutton from South
Africa and (meat) from the rest of Africa or other parts of the
world where the disease occurs," said the statement.

WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed in
the Sunday crash of a U.S. DC-8 cargo plane when it was flying
through freezing rain and smashed into a mountain in southwest
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
The plane was on a test flight Sunday evening from Greensboro,
North Carolina, to Wilmington, Ohio, when it crashed and exploded
in a remote forest near the Virginia-West Virginia state line.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said three crew members and three mechanics on
board the plane were killed and rescue teams began removing the
bodies off the mountain today.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage was found scattered over 1,000 meters up the
mountain, about five kilometers northwest of Narrows.
</P>
<P>
Bob McIntosh, the lead investigator on the scene for the
National Transportation Safety Board, said the plane had made the
first leg of the test flight from Ohio to North Carolina on
Saturday. It was returning to Ohio when it crashed, he said.

<P>
Investigation was underway and investigators are trying to get
the flight recorder to help determine the cause of the crash.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Mideast Peace Process Deadlocked But </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Middle East peace process
became deadlocked in 1996 despite tremendous efforts to push it
ahead, but signs show that it is still on track.
</P>
<P>
At one stage, the peace train was gaining speed last
spring. The Palestinians held their first ever election to choose
the self-rule leadership in January.
</P>
<P>
And the then Israeli ruling Labor party dropped its opposition
to an independent Palestinian state in April, one day after the
Palestine National council revised its anti-Israeli
stand. Meanwhile, the Syrians and Israelis were also geared to
speed up their negotiations over the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
However, the tangible progress was mingled with stepped up
violence and terrorist activities designed to derail the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Four suicide bombings inside Israel in February and March and
Israeli military operations in south Lebanon in retaliation for
Hezbullah rocketing in April all served to brake the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, when the Likud-led hardline government regained
power in June, the future of the peace march became bleaker.
</P>
<P>
The new Israeli government headed by Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu has never hesitated to air its reluctance to go ahead
with the "land for peace" formula, which was internationally
recognized and accepted by the previous Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Nor has the government tried to hide its intention to change
the rule of the game. It blatantly said "no" to returning the
Golan to Syria, to negotiation over Jerusalem with the
Palestinians and to establishing an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
This came out as far more than a mere rhetoric. The new
government promptly lifted a freeze on Jewish settlement
expansion, confiscated more Arab lands and banned official
Palestinian activities in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Israeli troops redeployment from Hebron was
delayed, with other issues such as safe passage between Gaza and
the West Bank, the release of Palestinian prisoners and Israeli
pullout from rural areas of the West Bank, pending for
solution. All these are embodied in the Oslo II accord and
supposed to be solved ahead of the most thorny final status
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
There is no headway seen on the Syria and Lebanon tracks
either. Damascus made Israel's territorial concession a
precondition for the resumption of peace talks, while Lebanon
rejected outright the "Lebanon First Option" dished out by
Israel. Efforts were made to break the ice, but no progress was in
evidence.
</P>
<P>
Not only the Palestinians but also people in the Arab world as
a whole are disappointed or frustrated. They lost no opportunity
to warn Israel against any backoff, or to face icy ties with its
Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
They hope the United States would come to tame Israel, its
strategic alliance in the region, but Washington seems less
prepared to amend its bias toward Israel. The EU and Russia are
invited to play a greater role but neither admits intention to
challenge the U.S. leading position.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Mideast Peace Process Deadlocked But </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the stalemate in the peace process, no party concerned
has declared a dead end to it. Netanyahu even made promise to
implement the Oslo accords -- though reluctantly as they have
already passed the Knesset (parliament) and become binding law
with worldwide backing. Going back on his words not to meet Yasser
Arafat, he has so far shaken hands twice with the Palestinian
leader.
</P>
<P>
Following the bloody shootout in September between Israeli
soldiers and Palestinian police, the prime minister ordered the
Israeli team to negotiate redeployment from Hebron, the only West
Bank city still under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
Although these facts are insufficient to ease Arab mistrust and
suspicion, they might have proved that neither Israel nor the
Palestinians want to return to war and bloodshed. However, it is
naive to believe there would be a big jump forward, observers said.
</P>
<P>
It is well known that Netanyahu's Likud party has long been
advocating "peace for peace" instead of "land for peace." That
formula still seems to serve as a basis for Israel's policy, which
Netanyahu may not easily change, because he has to measure
carefully harsh responses from his far-right coalition partners,
even if he himself sees it necessary, observers noted.
</P>
<P>
With no date set for resuming Israeli-Syrian peace talks, the
on-and-off Israeli-Palestinian negotiations would take a time
longer than expected. Even if the Oslo accords remain valid, the
process of implementation would still be difficult. As for the
final status negotiations, scheduled to conclude in 1999, either
side sees no possible bound to the bargain over Jerusalem,
refugees, borders and Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
The most discouraging sign is the confidence-building process
suffered setbacks. The September bloody confrontation, which
killed dozens and wounded a thousand, rekindled the deeply rooted
hatred and distrust between Israelis and Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The border closure since March inflicted a loss of 6 million
U.S. dollars a day to the Palestinian self-rule areas and fueled
anti-Israeli sentiment in the occupied land and elsewhere in the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The Arab outcry and warning didn't work well as Israel refused
to bow to pressure. The Europeans, eager to have a bigger say in
the Middle East, have failed to corner Israel to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
Washington, reluctant to risk a rupture with Israel, has tried
carefully to avoid offending the Jewish state. President Bill
Clinton is expected to take concrete measures to salvage the
faltering peace process in his second term of office, but it
remains to be seen how the reshuffled U.S. administration will act.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab scholars believe that real changes, if any, will come
from within Israel. They pin hopes on a possible national unity
government in Israel involving the Labor party, or the next
nationwide election scheduled for the year 2000. But they cannot
tell for sure what is to happen next morning.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process may not go in reverse in 1997,
observers said, but the prospect for a quick breakthrough may be
dim as well. Continuing the peace march requires greater efforts,
patience and self-restraint, they added.

accusation by Zairean rebels that it has provided arms to Zairean
government troops for launching a counter-offensive against the
Tutsi Banyamulenges.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry vice-spokesman Yves Doutriaux said that
France is strictly observing an arms embargo against Zaire as
decided by the European Union in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"In consequence, the French authorities have neither provided
any military aid, nor authorized any export of war material,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Zairean rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila said that Zairean
government forces began a counter-offensive against the rebels in
the Bunia region near the Ugandan border in northeast Zaire last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He accused France of "preparing" for the counter-offensive,
saying that "Mobutu receives a military aid from France."
</P>
<P>
The rebels have been controlling a 500-kilometer-long strip
land bordering Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi for two months.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A Ukrainian diplomat was
declared persona non grata today and told to leave Canada by
midnight December 25.
</P>
<P>
Olexander Yushko, a vice-consul, claimed diplomatic immunity
after being accused of trying to lure young girls into his car,
the local media reported.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested on October 26 and charged with two counts of
drunk driving, possession of stolen license plates and attempting
to bribe an officer.
</P>
<P>
Since his arrest, there have been allegations in court that he
tried to entice two girls -- aged 12 and 14 -- into his car while
holding a handkerchief soaked with anesthetic.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government made the declaration forcing Yushko to
leave after it became clear that the Ukrainian government would
not consider waiving his diplomatic immunity, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Charges against Mr. Yushko have been held in abeyance," a
Foreign Affairs spokesman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Should he ever return to Canada, he will be subject to
prosecution on those charges," the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO's Supreme Allied
Commander in Europe (SACEUR), American General George Joulwan,
said today he would retire from the position in the spring of 1997.
</P>
<P>
A news release from NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers
Europe (SHAPE), based in Mons, Belgium, said that no date has yet
been set for a change of command and no replacement has been named
for the NATO top general.
</P>
<P>
It said that General Joulwan has notified the Secretary General
of NATO, the U.S. Secretary of Defense and the Chairman, Joint
Chiefs of Staff of his decision.
</P>
<P>
As SACEUR, General Joulwan has led the way in planning and
executing the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The press release said General would continue to serve as
SACEUR through the first six months of the Stabilization Force
(SFOR) mission in Bosnia, which started just a few days ago,
providing needed continuity until his replacement assumes command.
</P>
<P>
During his 36 years of active duty service to his country,
General Joulwan served at every level of command, platoon through
Army Corps, and served as Commander in Chief of two Unified

<HEADLINE> German Women Prone to Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- One in every three German women
have fallen victims to violence for at least once in their life
time, said a latest survey report.
</P>
<P>
The report, released recently by Allenbach Institute, a public
opinion survey organization, indicated that even the family
doesn't shelter women from violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
As married women are more likely to become targets of domestic
violence, it said, about 2.5 million German women are forced to
have sex with their husbands.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 12.5 percent of homicide cases in the
country take place between spouses, with women accounting for 67
percent of the total number of victims.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that at least 250,000 underaged girls are
sexually assaulted each year. But law enforcement authorities
could only handle 100,000 of such cases.
</P>
<P>
However, the pollster noted, the numbers revealed by survey
results are only "a tip of the iceberg" as many women victims are
reluctant to tell their stories.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Elects New Socialist Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Georgi Parvanov was elected
today new leader of the Socialist Party at its 42nd Special
Session in succession to Zhan Videnov who resigned on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Parvanov, a history major from Sofia University and former
deputy chairman of the highest committee of the ruling party,
called on his party to consolidate union and live up to social
expectations.
</P>
<P>
The session also adopted the party's action plan for next year
and promised to solve the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Zhan Videnov became prime minister after the Socialist Party
won the general election in December 1994. But criticism for his
failure to meet reform targets became more and more vocal, and a
recent party confidence vote gave him only narrow backing, leading
to his recent declaration of resignation after foreign minister
Georgi Pirinski quitted last month.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the National Assembly has decided to
suspend Christmas holiday to deal with the resignation issue.
</P>
<P>
Its chairman, Blagovest Sendov, said that a special meeting
will be held on December 28 to decide on the matter. If Videnov's
resignation is passed, Parvanov will become the new prime minister
and form a new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
According to Bulgarian law, the majority party forms a new
cabinet if the resignation of a government is approved by the
National Assembly.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Economy on Downslope in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's economy was on the
downslope in 1996 from the peak of growth it reached the previous
year, exposing the vulnerability of its high-cost and
low-efficiency industry in the rapidly growing world trade.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Korea, South Korea's central bank, estimated the
growth of gross domestic product (GDP) at 6.9 percent for the
year, down both from the previous year's 9 percent and the
projected 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's current account deficit is expected to hit an
all-time record high of 22 billion U.S. dollars, compared with the
deficit of 8.95 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Largely affected by the soaring current-account deficit, South
Korea's foreign exchange reserves declined from 32.71 billion
dollars at the end of last year to 32.23 billion dollars at the
end of October 1996.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the spiraling current account
deficit mainly to poor exports performance.
</P>
<P>
During the first 10 months of the year, South Korea's exports
totaled 106.47 billion dollars, while imports amounted to 123.28
billion dollars, for a deficit of 16.81 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Slowing export growth, primarily because of the weakened
international competitiveness of the country's major export
products, has led to increasing stockpiles of manufactured goods
in corporate warehouses, which in turn has caused companies to
postpone or discard plans for investment in new equipment and
plants.
</P>
<P>
The semiconductor industry, for instance, was sound in terms of
technology and production, but weak in terms of price
competitiveness and the situation was more or less the same in the
information-telecommunications and automobile industries which
were also important to the nation's export structure.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter of 1996, while the heavy industry grew
10.5 percent from a year earlier, the light industry, which was
once a growth leader, declined 3.7 percent from the same period
last year, expanding the bipolarization of industrial expansion.
</P>
<P>
The terms of trade have also worsened. While unit export prices
in the July-September period of the year fell 15.3 percent on
average from a year earlier, unit import prices only declined 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
High wages, prices and interest rates were the chief villains
of the high-cost and low-efficiency industrial structure. Over the
past 10 years, manufacturing labor costs have shot up 19.7 percent
per year on average whereas comparable wage increases in the
United States and Japan have shot up 2.8 percent and 14.1 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to figures provided by the National
Statistical Office (NSO), in the third quarter, South Korea's
manufacturing sector lost 84,000 jobs, raising the jobless rate
from 2 percent in 1995 to 2.1 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate, as measured by consumer prices,
will reach 5 percent in 1996, up from last year's 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government will put top priority on economic stability in
1997 to help reduce the snowballing current account shortfalls and
inflationary pressure, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kesri Builds up Lead in Race for CPP Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress party
President Sitaram Kesri, trying to install himself as the
consensus leader of the Congress parliamentary party (CPP), has
emerged as the front-runner in the race.
</P>
<P>
The race began after former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao
resigned from the powerful CPP leadership on December 19 under
huge pressure from his own party, especially Kesri.
</P>
<P>
A meeting to choose a new CPP chief was originally scheduled
for December 23 but was later postponed to January 3 because of
differences over how to choose a successor.
</P>
<P>
Kesri supporters advocate that the party president should
become the consensus leader of the CPP while some other party
leaders and members of parliament insist that a new CPP chief
should be chosen by an election.
</P>
<P>
As the January 3 meeting approaches, some senior party leaders
have begun to rally behind Kesri and established contact with
members of the CPP.
</P>
<P>
Party insiders said senior leaders A.K. Antony, K. Karunakaran,
Balram Jakhar and Vijaybhaskar Reddy have taken an active part in
the consensus-building exercise, trying to convince partymen that
only "a single center of power" can now take the Congress party
onward.
</P>
<P>
Karunakaran, who never failed to snipe at former party chief
Narasimha Rao for holding two party positions, has been singing a
different tune. He is a member of the Congress Working Committee
(CWC), the supreme decision-making body of the party.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that these were not normal
circumstances and, therefore, there should be no talks at this
stage of "one man-one post."
</P>
<P>
The senior Congress party leader has apparently been telling
partymen that Kesri's drive to rejuvenate the party had gathered
momentum and so he should be trusted with the controls of the
party.
</P>
<P>
"The fire-fighting is on. These leaders are confident they can
clinch the deal in Kesri's favor," another senior leader
commented.
</P>
<P>
Kesri's lieutenants such as Tariq Anwar, Ahmed Patel and Ghulam
Nabi Azad too have been on the move, enlisting support for a
consensus on Kesri. As part of their consensus-building exercise,
they have been releasing many statements to the media, calling for
the unanimous election of Kesri.
</P>
<P>
It seems that Kesri's supporters have been deliberately
painting visions of a split in the party if two or more centers of
power are allowed to emerge.
</P>
<P>
So far, only senior party leaders Sharad Pawar and Rajesh Pilot
have indicated their intention to run for the new CPP leadership.
</P>
<P>
Some other hopefuls are watching the development and would
throw their hat in the ring only if conditions are favorable.
</P>
<P>
However, a CWC member once close to Rao expressed the view that
the former prime minister was active in trying to prevent Kesri's
emergence as the consensus candidate.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Monday, Pilot, who is believed to enjoy support
among younger Congress partymen, insisted that he would be a
candidate for the election of CPP leader.
</P>
<P>
Kesri supporters have reportedly agreed that the intervening
period between now and January 3 should be fully utilized to mount
pressure on all those who want to contest.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Carrying Out Construction Supervision System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A construction unit carrying
out a major contract in Shanghai has been found to overcharge its
client by four million yuan (480,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The overcharge came to light when the Shanghai Shenhai
Construction Supervision Company was in the process of settling
the accounts for the project in the city's Fuxin Road. A
supervision report made by the company made the unit correct their
mistake.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the municipal infrastructure, the
system of supervision and management for construction in Shanghai,
China's largest industrial and financial center, has been fully
carried out.
</P>
<P>
The system focuses on the progress rate, cost, and quality
monitoring of projects. Since the system went into practice in
1988, the supervision industry in Shanghai has covered the fields
of petrochemistry, power, port, aviation, television and
residential development.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Shanghai has 300 supervision
organizations, with 7,000 employees. These organizations have
supervised 1,700 projects worth 170 billion yuan (20.5 billion US
dollars), with the overall construction coverage of 40 million
square meters.
</P>
<P>
Hu Renwei, general manager of Shenhai has disclosed that, in
the next five years or so, construction will become a pillar
industry in the city, and the supervision system will have a
brighter future.
</P>
<P>
To meet the need of the supervision market, China is regulating
a "Construction Law". Shanghai Municipal Government has already
issued the "Regulation on the Supervision over the Construction
Projects".
</P>
<P>
In addition, Shanghai has held over 50 training classes for
supervision personnel, and over 7,500 people have received
certificates issued by the Ministry of Construction and the
Municipal Construction Committee.

<HEADLINE> Linjiang Built into Base For Rhodiola Sachalinensis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Experts in China have
succeeded in artificially cultivating a mountain-side herb that
can treat heart diseases, TB and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
The success has been made in Linjiang City in North China's
Jilin Province, home of Rhodiola Sachalinensis, a traditional
Chinese herbaceous herb with the same curative effect as ginseng.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year the city was named "home of the Rhodiola
Sachalinensis" by the Agriculture Development Research Center
under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
At present, Linjiang is China's largest production and
processing base for Rhodiola Sachalinensis, which are scattered
across the Changbai Mountain, 1,700 to 2,300 meters above the sea
level.
</P>
<P>
As a combination of food and medicine, stems of the Rhodiola
Sachalinensis have curative effect for diabetes, TB and heart
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between Linjiang Forestry Bureau and Shenyang
Medical Institute in 1982 has resulted in the extension of an
artificial cultivation area for Rhodiola Sachalinensis, which has
spread down to 500 meters above the sea level.
</P>
<P>
Linjiang City has developed Rhodiola Sachalinensis production
by setting up 134 hectares of cultivation area, with a production
volume of 150 tons.
</P>
<P>
Tonics made of Rhodiola Sachalinensis have been exported to
more than 20 overseas countries and regions, including the United
States, Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Malaysia,
Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
An official at the city government said that Linjiang plans to
extend the plant base to 667 hectares.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The year 1996 has seen
political developments in Africa getting further for the better,
providing a prerequisite and chances for sustained development.
</P>
<P>
During the year, most of African countries have maintained
stability. General elections held in Benin, Uganda, Zambia, Ghana
and other countries have gone on fairly peacefully this year,
whereas large-scale clashes occurred in some countries during
elections in the late 1980s and early 1990s because western-style
''democracy''was practised there.
</P>
<P>
Hot spots in Africa, generally speaking, have died down or
are dying down although new strifes broke out in eastern Zaire.
Rival factions in Liberia agreed to cease-fire in July and
started disarming their forces in November.
</P>
<P>
Rebels in Sierra Leone have joined the government this month
after sealing a peaceful agreement earlier. Even in Somalia,
opposing factions began to sit down to work for peaceful
solutions to their conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Peace process in Angola has gone on quite well and a
government of national unity will be formed next January, ending
nearly 20 years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
In Algeria, north Africa, a national reconciliation program
was signed by 38 political parties and organizations for a
settlement of political crisis, restoration of national stability
and dispelling of terrorism in the country.
</P>
<P>
African countries, encouraged by economic progress in other
parts of the world, Southeast Asia in particular, are laying
emphasis on their economic development, and have reaped
successes.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Africa in 1995 reached 2.3
percent over the previous year and the growth rate is expected to
reach 4.5 percent in 1996. the World Bank predicted an annual
economic growth of 3.8 percent for Africa within the 10 coming
years.
</P>
<P>
The world community's awareness and recognition of Africa's
importance in the international arena will bring opportunity
for African development, observers here say.
</P>
<P>
In May, Chinese President Jiang Zemin's tour of six African
states further strengthened China's friendship, enhanced its
unity with African countries and laid foundations for cooperative
ties between China and Africa in a comprehensive way.

the mouth of the Yangtze River, as early as 6,000 years ago and
that they were living a comparatively stable life, thanks to the
favorable environment.
</P>

named a historic city, the city is staging an exhibition at the
History Museum of Shanghai, where visitors can see the cultural
relics that have been dug up.

One expert says that the objects on display reflect Shanghai's
prosperity and level of civilization during different historical
periods.
</P>

Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, and Zhou Enlai, all of whom left their mark

NEW DELHI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram has expressed optimism over the performance of the
economy despite the recent continued slowdown in economic growth,
the Times of India said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of businessmen here Monday, the minister
said the overall performance of the Indian economy this year (from
April 1996 to March 1997) will be as good as in 1995-96, with a
lower average rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Indian economy posted a 6.6 percent growth in the 1995-96

will remain strong, he said.
</P>

Referring to the recent slowdown in economic growth, the
minister said the performance of the economy in the first half of
the fiscal year should not be taken as benchmark as elections and

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the 450
Jewish settlers in the West Bank city of Hebron Monday night
lobbied legislators in the Knesset (parliament) in a desperate
attempt to block an army redeployment agreement which appears to
be just round the corner, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest reports today, Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat are scheduled to meet at Erez on the Israeli-Gaza border
this morning and sign the overdue agreement.
</P>
<P>
"If the agreement is signed as it is, it will be just a
matter of time before Jewish blood is spilled in the city," said
Moshe Ben-Zimra, a spokesman for the Hebron settlers, Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
None of the Hebron settlement activists had any information
on the agreement beyond what was reported in the media, but they
gave the impression that they thought the long-delayed agreement
would soon be signed.
</P>
<P>
"I feel that we have been deceived by (Prime Minister
Binyamin) Netanyahu," Ben-Zimra said. "He has not lived up to
his agreement with the voters."
</P>
<P>
Hebron settlement leader Noam Arnon said of the agreement,
"This is the first step toward the destruction of the Jewish
community in Hebron."
</P>
<P>
What particularly concerned Arnon were reports that Shuhada
Street, which goes from the Machpela Cave to Tel Rumeida, will
be open to Palestinian traffic. He said this will enable
drive-by shootings, attempts by Palestinian drivers to run over
Jews, and even the planting of car bombs on the main artery
serving what Arnon called the "Jewish ghetto."
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu will go down in history as the prime minister who
led to the destruction of the Jewish settlement in Hebron,"
Arnon said.

CHENGDU, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A number of ancient relics
dating back to the Warring States period (475-221 B.C.) have been
unearthed at a construction site in Chengdu, the capital of
Sichuan Province.

A total of 37 relics made of copper, iron, pottery, and wood,

A bronze sword and a spear found in the tomb are thought to be
in the style of the Qin Dynasty (221-207 b.c), while a dagger-axe
seems to belong to the Shu Kingdom (a small country in the Warring
States period), causing scholars to believe that the tomb was

To ensure the smooth progress of resettlement of around 1.2
million people and accelerate economic development of the
underdeveloped reservoir area in central-west China, the State
Council will soon implement a series of favorable policies to
encourage overseas businessmen to invest in the area, said Qi Lin,
director of the Resettlement Bureau under the Three Gorges Project
Construction Commission.
</P>
<P>
The country has intensified infrastructure construction in the
reservoir area since the world's largest water-control project
started in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Yichang Three Gorges Airport was completed in October, and
Wuhan-Yichang expressway has opened to traffic. The country also
prepares to expand Jiangbei Airport in Chongqing and build Wuqiao
Airport in Wanxian, and plans to build Yichang-Guangzhou and
Wanxian-Daxian railways.
</P>
<P>
Apart from transport facilities, telecommunications facilities
have also been upgraded. International phone services have been
provided, and new telecommunications network is being built in the
area.
</P>
<P>
At present, China is building a group of hydro-electrical and
thermal power plants to provide adequate power supplies to
industrial development and daily life of 16.6 million people in
the reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
In Yichang and Wanxian, customs offices have been established,
and technological development zones at provincial or city levels,
which have a whole set of facilities, have been set up. Yichang,
the construction site of the project, even has bonded warehouses.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Yichang, Wanxian and Fuling have worked out local
favorable policies for overseas investors, and various districts
in the area are also simplifying procedures of approving
overseas-funded projects.

<HEADLINE> Sampras, Graf Undisputed World No. Ones (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras and Steffi Graf,
who survived personal traumas in the past year, consolidated their
status as undisputed world number ones on the tennis court.
</P>
<P>
Sampras had to spend the year struggling to come to forms when
his coach and close friend Tim Gullikson died of a brain tumor.
The illness and loss affected him deeply: he was blasted out of
the Australian Open by local boy Mark Philippousis, went down to
eventual Dutch winner Richard Krajicek in the quarter-finals at
the Wimbledon and lost to French Open winner Yevbeny Kafelnikov in
the semi-finals on the clay.
</P>
<P>
However, his time came at the U.S. Open and the final
elite-eight world championships, which helped him to finish the
year at the top of the world and made him join Jimmy Connors and
John McEnroe as the only players to finish No. one for four
straight years.
</P>
<P>
Graf, who was troubled by persistent injuries, is not the
irresistible force in the passing year. But her competitive steel
shone through in a year in which her overwhelming concern remained
the fate of her father Peter, released on bail last month after 15
months in jail on charge of evading tax on his daughter's earnings.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old German successfully overcame strife in her
personal life to finish the year atop the world rankings for
fourth year in a row, with victories in every Grand Slam she
entered.
</P>
<P>
She missed out only the Australian Open after surgery on her
foot. All this went on while Peter languished in prison. "It has
been a really long, long year," she said after winning the
season-ending Chase Championships. She also won the German Open
as well as at Indian Wells and Key Biscayne.
</P>
<P>
Graf needs only four Grand Slam titles to pass Margaret Court's
record of 24. With Monica Seles still failing to recapture the
magic she displayed before her courtside knife attack in 1993,
Graf could polish those off in 1997. The German now has also won
five WTA Championships and 102 WTA crowns.
</P>
<P>
Her compatriot Boris Becker bounced back into the big time in
the men's court, ending the year as he began it with victory and
fat check. The 29-year-old veteran, who had spent 13 years in
pro tennis, won his first Grand Slam tournament for five years at
the Australian Open in January and earned him a cool 1.875 million
U.S. dollars with victory in the Grand Slam Cup in December.
</P>
<P>
However, it was not all roses in between. A pulled muscle kept
the powerful German out of the French Open and an agonizing wrist
injury forced him to quit Wimbledon mid-match just as he was
getting into his booming stride through a favorable draw.
</P>
<P>
Andre Agassi's year was characterized with fragility. The
popular and normally ebullient American finished 1996 with boos
and whistles of disappointed fans ringing in his ears after
miserable performances at the ATP World Championships and at the
Grand Slam Cup. An Olympic gold was the only comfort but Agassi
admitted he lacked motivation and needed a break from the game.

The men's tennis ended the year on a dramatic note when France
beat Sweden 3-2 in the Davis Cup final, the first final ever to be
decided in the fifth set of the fifth rubber in the Cup's 96-year
history.
</P>
<P>
The tie also features the last appearance of Sweden's Stefan
Edberg, a peerless serve-and-volley exponent and a fine
advertisement for his sport.
</P>
<P>
Edberg, who would retire at the end of this season, notched up
41 tournament victories and six Grand Slam titles in an exemplary
13-year career.
</P>
<P>
Monica Seles, who returned to WTA tennis last year, had a
disappointing season, which was ended in pain and frustration when
her sore left shoulder forced her to quit the Chase Championships
in November.
</P>
<P>
After winning the Australian Open to start the season, Seles
tore a muscle in her left, serving shoulder and has struggled to
maintain her form since.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Yugoslav-American lost in the quarter-finals at
the French Open and in the second round at the Wimbledon before
clawing her way to the U.S. Open where she lost to longtime rival
Graf.
</P>
<P>
Lindsay Davenport enjoyed a golden winning streak in the summer
with Olympic gold in Atlanta and a triumph in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Davenport also joined with Seles, Mary Joe Fernandez and Linda
Wild to win the Fed Cup for the United States in Atlantic City
with a 5-0 victory over Spain.
</P>
<P>
Spaniards Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and Conchita Martinez have
a disappointing year. Neither won a major title and both suffered
long periods of loss of form.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez-Vicario, who has grid, but not the array of the
strokes, finished the year twice the bridesmaid -- at the French
Open and Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
France's Mary Pierce, 1995 Australian Open champion and world
number three twelve months ago, had a free-fall and ended the year
down in 20th place in the rankings.
</P>
<P>
With the veteran struggling to keep their positions in the
rankings, players of the younger generation have appeared to be
impatient to catch up.
</P>
<P>
Martina Hingis, a 16-year-old Swiss school girl, has won two
WTA titles and finished the year at world No. 5. Described as the
"hottest property in tennis", Hingis also became the youngest
player to win the doubles at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
Russian Anna Kournikova made a sensational splash at the
U.S. Open by beating seeded Barbara Paulus of Austria. At the
European Indoor Championships in October, the 15-year-old beat
tough South African Amanda Coetzer.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1996 also saw the retirement of Japan's Kimiko Date
and Argentina's Gabriela Sabatini. The two players, both at 26,
left the tour with different reasons. Some think that with a new
ranking system for 1997, the two may consider that they have to
give ways to younger generation in the tour.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system which was unveiled by the WTA Tour in
November, Graf and Seles, who have been plagued by sustained
injuries, will have to work harder to maintain their places in the
rankings or move out of the way for others who play a greater
number of events and have higher rate of success in each.
</P>
<P>
"With next year's new ranking system, we will have to play more
tournaments," Seles said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets Azerbaijani Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Rong
Yiren met here this morning with a delegation from the National
Assembly of Azerbaijan, led by its chairman Murtuz Aleskerov.
</P>
<P>
Rong said this is the first high-level exchange between the
parliaments of the two countries and Aleskerov's first visit to
China after he was elected chairman of the Azerbaijani National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Rong said the current visit is bound to help increase mutual
understanding and friendship, and promote Sino-Azerbaijani
friendly cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Since China and Azerbaijani forged diplomatic ties in 1992,
Rong noted, there have been a frequent, high-level exchange of
visits, which have laid a sound basis for the development of
mutually beneficial and friendly cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that through joint efforts, bilateral
cooperation in politics, trade, science, technology and culture
can be further developed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China holds that all countries, big or small, are
equal, and state-to-state relations should be handled on the basis
of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence.
</P>
<P>
Aleskerov said that his visit to China is aimed at promoting
exchanges between the two parliaments, and to acquaint himself
with China's legislation during the reform and opening drive, as
well as the growth of China's agriculture and the construction of
special economic zones.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the constructive relations of cooperation
between the two countries and their parliaments can be further
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Aleskerov also gave an account of the domestic situations in
Azerbaijan and its foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the adherence of Azerbaijani government to a "one
China" stance, taking Taiwan as an inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
Rong expressed his appreciations over this.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Aleskerov conveyed Azerbaijani President
Geidar Aliev's greetings to Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Vice-President Rong.
</P>
<P>
Rong also asked Aleskerov to convey regards of Jiang and
himself to President Aliev.

LHASA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei and Hunan
provinces have made notable achievements in supporting the
development of the southwestern Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
So far, the provinces have poured a total of 26 million yuan of

<HEADLINE> Uygur Medicine Prospers in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A traditional system of
medicine in China dating back 2,000 years has been given a major
tonic.
</P>
<P>
It will ensure that traditional Uygur medicine will continue to
enjoy the vigorous growth in West China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region that it has witnessed in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
And after passing stringent state-level tests some of the
ancient medicines have been given the go-ahead for mass production.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the local government and health departments,
25 hospitals have been built with 1,200 beds and more than 1,600
medical staff - all applying the unique form of medicine for
patients.
</P>
<P>
Three pilot factories for traditional Uygur medicine production
have been built in Hotan area and Kashi city. Training schools and
research institutes have also been set up to spread and develop
Uygur medicine.
</P>
<P>
Uygur medicine, one of the four major Chinese medicine systems
along with Chinese, Tibetan and Mongolian traditional medicines,
originated in Xinjiang in Qin Dynasty (221-206 B.C), and developed
into a complete medical system with local and ethnical
characteristics in Song Dynasty (960-1279).
</P>
<P>
According to the theory of Uygur medicine, nature is composed
of water, fire, earth and air. Birth, aging, ailment and death of
people were closely related to the four elements of the nature and
to the temperament, fluid, spirit and various forces in their
bodies.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the government of Xinjiang, aware of the fact
that it is the only region in China that keeps the use of Uygur
medicine, decided to take effective measures to develop it.
</P>
<P>
Academic circles of Uygur medicine run training courses,
including courses on orthopedics, dermatology and medicine
preparations, and clinical training centers have been established
to pass on the professional knowledge of the Uygur medicine to
younger generations.
</P>
<P>
The circles have published more than 20 books and magazines,
among which the Encyclopaedia of the Traditional Uygur Medicine
and the Diagnostics of the Traditional Uygur Medicine were
rewarded first and second prizes for Chinese Ethnical Publications.
</P>
<P>
At present, Uygur medicines, produced with modern preparation
equipment, have increased to more than 200 types, and 17 Uygur
medicines have passed the state appraisal of new medicines and can
be put into mass production.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The past year also saw
western powers change their attitudes toward Africa. For example,
French President Jacques Chirac has come to visit African
countries three times since he was elected the head of state in
May, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's visits were to readjust French relations with African
countries, the French-speaking African countries in particular.
</P>
<P>
The United States also sent a trade mission headed by its then
Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown to Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya
and Uganda. Brown admitted that the United States had for long
neglected Africa and it was time for the U.S. to change and
scramble for the world's last undeveloped market in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, to show its confidence in Africa's
development, launched on March 15, 1996, a special initiative on
Africa, promising to grant it 25 billion U.S. Dollars over a span
of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is mobilizing its organizations to help African
countries expand basic education and health care, improve water
and food security and increase the continent's competitiveness in
world trade.
</P>
<P>
The rich resources of rare metals and strategic materials in
Africa are getting more and more attractive in the world
community alongside progress of advanced science and technology.
</P>
<P>
At present, many of the precious materials needed by western
countries for its industries come from Africa. In addition, the
potential market in Africa is also drawing attention from the
outside.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the African Development Bank,
African countries's total value of foreign trade in 1995 was
210.21 billion U.S. Dollars, of which, 98.48 billion Dollars went
to export and 111.73 billion Dollars to import, registering an
increase of 11.86 percent and 13.56 percent respectively over
those of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Seizing the chances for development, a number of African
countries are now carrying out economic reforms by opening to the
outside world, and creating suitable environment to attract
investment and develop market-oriented economies. This means that
their economic future, on the whole, will be rosy as they are
heading for prosperity and development in the 21st century.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Tea
production picked up to some 25,000 tons in 1995 from 16,000

<HEADLINE> IMF Holds Back Releasing of 216 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) held back releasing of 216 million U.S. Dollars in aid
to Kenya during the second phase of Kenya's Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility, the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a report compiled by the London-based
Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) as attributing the IMF's
holding back to Kenya's delays in carrying out reform pledges
promised in the Policy Framework paper (PFP).
</P>
<P>
The EIU report said that the Kenyan government "neither has
the skilled personnel nor the will to deliver on schedule the
many pledges made in the PFP."
</P>
<P>
The promise to split the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications
Corporation into three entities has not happened as promised by
the end of last October, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that while Kenya's economy is doing
reasonably well, economic growth is expected to slow down this
year due to weaker performances from agriculture and tourism.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that Kenya's GDP growth will fall from 4.9
percent in 1995 to 4.1 percent this year with a further fall to
3.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
While the manufacturing sector is constrained by an
over-strong currency of Shilling, the short-term outlook of the
tourism industry which is the main foreign exchange earner is
still not good, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 24 (Xinhua) --South Africa has seen an
alarming increase in sexual violence against women and children
in the past one year.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper "the Citizen" on Tuesday quoted Safety and
Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi as saying that in the period
between January and August this year, 31,085 cases of rape or
attempted rape had been reported, an increase of 19 percent from
the same period in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Of the reported cases, about one third of the victims are
teenagers, while one in every six women was regularly abused by a
male partner.
</P>
<P>
While the violence agaisnt women is remarkably up, Mufamadi
said, tens of thousands of children have also become victimes of
criminals. He said the police has got 32,889 reports of crimes
against children from January to Novemenber this year, which
represented an increase of 24 percent of the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Referring to measures combating the crimes, Mufamadi said
departments of Welfare, Safety and Security, Justice and
Correctional Services had been mobilized over the festive season
which will allow victims easier access to police, welfare
severices and the courts.
</P>
<P>
The Festive season in South Africa usually starts from early
December and ends in mid-January.

officers to deal sensitively with victimes and the child
protection unit was on 24-hour standby.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Arafat to Conclude Hebron Deal Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority (PA) President
Yasser Arafat are to hold a meeting today to conclude the
agreement on Israeli army's redeployment in Hebron, Israel Radio
reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross is also
expected to attend the session which is due to be held at 1100
a.m. local time (0900GMT) at the Erez checkpoint between Israel
and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from both sides said that the leaders have
to iron out some last minute's details before signing the accord
on the redeployment in the West Bank town.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic breakthrough in the talks between Israel and
Palestine came Monday afternoon, when Netanyahu joined the
negotiations held at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mahmoud Abbas, Arafat's deputy and Palestinian top
negotiator, came from the Gaza Strip to participate in the
talks, which were a continuation of Sunday night's Marathon
talks in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Ross, who arrived here earlier this week to push
forward the Hebron talks, took an active role in the night-long
intensive negotiations, held at Arafat's Gaza Office.
</P>
<P>
Both Arafat and Ross expressed cautious optimism following
the talks, but Ross admitted that difference remained between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Ross then paid a sudden visit to Egypt Monday afternoon,
which later he said was designed to obtain Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak's blessing on what has been obtained by Israeli
and Palestinian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, following his talks with Netanyahu, Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, Ross continued on to Gaza where he met Arafat again
until early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the breakthrough is a package deal, Ross has
been working on, which includes Israel's commitment to further
redeploy its troops in the West Bank following the redeployment
in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Under the package deal, Israel also would agree to hold final
status talks on the West Bank and other issues after the
conclusion of the Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In light of the development, Ross will not be back to
Washington for Christmas as previously expected. He told
reporters that a lot of work has to be done.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Cuts Bread Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has announced a cut of
nearly 10 percent in bread prices beginning in January 1997, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of Supply Muneer Suber made the announcement
Monday, according to English newspaper Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the announcement, a kilogram of high quality
bread will be sold at 200 fils (about 0.14 dollars) while bread
made of local flour will be offered at 170 fils (about 0.11
dollars) per kilogram, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has bought 150,000 tons of wheat at new global
market prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
In November, the Jordanian government made a decision to cut
bread prices by a narrow margin, but most of the bakeries did not
implement it because their bread was still made of the stored
flour purchased at a higher price.
</P>
<P>
In August, Jordan doubled the bread prices, which triggered
large-scale riots in the south of the kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Academy of Sciences to Aid Scientists in Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS) is to offer 10 million yuan (1.2 million
U.S. dollars) over the next few years to support science programs
launched by young scientists in western China.
</P>
<P>
Bai Chunli, Vice-President of the CAS, China's top scientific
research organ, said during the ninth Five-Year (1996-2000) Plan
period the academy is to fund 100 scientists below 40 years of age
in CAS branches in northwest China's Gansu Province, Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, and southwest China's Yunnan Province for
their economy-oriented science programs.
</P>
<P>
Bai explained that the CAS will annually offer 20 young
scientists 100,000 yuan (12,000 dollars) each by the end of 2000
for research programs for local economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said the special fund will be used to foster young
scientists who lead research programs, and will remain in the
developing western areas.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jianfa, 34, deputy head of the CAS Lanzhou Geology
Institute, said that 66 percent of scientists in his institute are
under 45. In the past, many research projects for local economic
development could not be launched because of lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
Chen said with the special fund, young scientists will be able
to apply their knowledge in pushing forward development of western
areas where there are big gaps with the developed coastal areas.

<HEADLINE> China, Japan Sign Exchange of Notes on 1996 Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China and Japan signed here
today an exchange of notes on the fourth batch of Japanese loan
in Japanese yen to China for the year 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the notes, the Japanese government is to provide a
loan totalled 170.511 billion yen to the Chinese government, on 22
projects covering the fields of transportation, energy,
environmental protection, agriculture, telecommunications and urban
infustructure, with a duration of 30 years (including a 10-year
grace) and a 2.3% annual interest rate for average projects, a
2.1% rate for environment projects.
</P>
<P>
Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and Japan's Ambassador to
China Yoshiyasu Sato signed the exchange of notes on behalf of
their respective governments.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, Japan has provided China with three
batches of loans in Japanese yen, amounting to 1,610 billion
yen. The loan, as a major part in Sino-Japanese trade and economic
cooperation, has helped China in its economic construction.
</P>
<P>
1996 is the first year to implement the fourth batch of loan
in the period of 1996 to 2000. Japan has promised in December 1994
to offer 580 billion yen for the first three years on 40 projects.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that An Min, assistant minister of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation, will sign an agreement on the 1996 loan
in Tokyo with head of Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund

<HEADLINE> Hebei Regulates Property Right Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 24 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province has issued a new regulation to ensure the supervision of
property right transfer of fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
Cong Fukui, deputy governor of Hebei said that, since 1988, six
cities, including Baoding, have set up organizations for property
right transfers, with a total trade volume of 310 million yuan
(about 31.3 million US dollars) to October. The transfers have
been greatly conducive to the mobility of fixed assets of
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, some problems occured in the process of property right
transfers due to the lack of regulations, such as the devaluation
of the fixed assets in the trade, and the irregular operation of
the property right trade organization.
</P>
<P>
The newly issued "Regulations on Fixed Assets of the
State-Owned Enterprises in Hebei" stipulate the function, medium,
process and obligation of the property right transfers. It
includes the establishment of a management system, and punishment
for illegal actions in property right transfers.

<HEADLINE> Year of 1996 Worst Ever on Israel's Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 24 (Xinhua) -- There will have been some
24,830 traffic accidents by the end of the year, a 19.1 percent
increase over last year and the worst year ever, reported The
Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, quoting Elie Goldschmidt, chairman
of the Knesset (parliament) Economics Committee, as saying
Monday, the number of people injured in traffic accidents will
reach some 46,846, up 21.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
At that rate, Goldschmidt said, an astounding 600 out of
every 1,000 Israelis will be involved in a road accident
sometime in their lives, and one out of every 20 will be either
killed or seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Experts have attributed the worsening traffic safety situation
to the rapid increase of vehicles and less roads. The late prime
minister, Yitzhak Rabin, said that Israel's infrastructure was
poor and at least 25 years behind the most developed European
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Ministry plans a number of new traffic
safety programs in 1997, ranging from road-safety courses for
elderly pedestrians to increased lighting on busy roads,
Transportation Minister Yitzhak Levy told the Knesset committee.
</P>
<P>
Levy said he intends to make road safety his ministry's top
priority. As a first step, he said, he plans to make the Road
Safety Administration and other units dealing with road safety
directly responsible to him.
</P>
<P>
Levy plans to set up an authority to coordinate a war on
traffic accidents -- one of the measures included in a road
safety bill that has been stalled in the Knesset due to Treasury
opposition.
</P>
<P>
This authority would include a research institute to serve
all ministries that deal with road safety, a unit to promote
public awareness of road safety, and a program to train civilian
drivers through the military authorities. Also planned are
better lighting for busy roads, electronic road signs that will
be easier to read, the testing of a new material to reduce
skidding on roads and the computerization of traffic tickets.
</P>
<P>
Goldschmidt said that traffic accidents result not only in
loss of life, but also in economic losses. Accidents cost the
economy about 1.2 billion shekels (some 400 million
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> China's Courts Achieve Marked Successes in Judicial Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- People's courts across China
have achieved overall progress in their judicial work this year, a
Chinese top judge said here today.
</P>
<P>
People's courts around the country accepted and handled
more than 4.69 million cases in criminal, civil, economic,
administrative and maritime fields from January to November this
year, a rise of 16.33 percent over last year, according to Ren
Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Of these cases, more than 4.36 million were concluded, an
increase of 16 percent over the same period last year, Ren told
provincial Higher People's Courts presidents.
</P>
<P>
"Through their trials, the people's courts have made new
contributions to guaranteeing (China's) reform and opening-up and
promoting the smooth progress of socialist modernization drive,"
Ren said.
</P>
<P>
Since the central government made the strategic decision to
crackdown on crimes in April this year, the courts have mustered
their efforts to rein a number of criminals who pose serious
threats to the society, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November, he added, the courts dealt with some
358,000 criminal cases in the harsh crackdown campaign, over 85
percent of which were concluded.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the courts stepped up the trials in other
fields. During the first 11 months this year, the courts handled
4.14 million cases concerning economic disputes, approximately 16
percent over last year. And the cases involved a total of 207.2
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The trials played an important role in safeguarding the
country's macro-economic control and maintaining economic order,
and promoting socialist ethical and cultural progress," Ren said.
</P>
<P>
From January 1, next year, the revised Criminal Procedure Law
will go into effect.
</P>
<P>
At present, the courts throughout the country are going in to
study and promote the Criminal Procedure Law, training judicial
officials and experimenting with the reform in court procedures so
as to gain fresh experience, Ren said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Gansu Province in northwest
China has collected and republished ancient books of various
ethnic groups to ensure that old cultures survive in the future.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the province has compiled and published
52 books and translated four others, with another 26 edited and
due to come off the press soon.
</P>
<P>
Most of the books are written in Chinese and ethic minority
languages. Among them, those written in Tibetan language take up
the major part. Others feature Islamic and Mongolian cultures.
</P>
<P>
Some minor ethnic groups have no written records, so their
history and culture are preserved in ballads, epics, love songs
and folk tales.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the republished books are very helpful for
research on political, economic, cultural and religious affairs of
various ethnic groups.
</P>

In accordance with ancient records, new types of traditional
Chinese medicine have been developed.

<HEADLINE> Top Ten World News Events in 1996 (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Following are the top ten
world news events in 1996 selected by the Xinhua News Agency:
</P>
<P>
1. First Asia-Europe Summit Establishes New Type of Asia-Europe
</P>
<P>
Relations
</P>
<P>
The first ever Asia-Europe Summit meeting brought together 26
heads of government -- 10 from Asia and 15 from the European Union
-- and President of the European Commission Jacques Santer on
March 1-2 in Bangkok, Thailand. To strengthen political dialogue
and promote economic cooperation between the two continents were
the major topics at the meeting. The meeting, under the theme
"Towards A New Asia-Europe Partnership for Greater Growth,"
adopted a chairman's statement, which would help establish a
fundamental framework for new type of Asia-Europe relations. The
meeting, as a fresh starting point for cooperation between the two
continents, would exert a positive influence on the set-up of the
international political and economic system.
</P>
<P>
2. U.S. Tougher Sanctions Against Cuba, Iran and Libya Incurs
</P>
<P>
Strong Condemnation from International Community
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives passed on
March 5 and 6 the Helms-Burton bill aiming to impose tougher
sanctions upon Cuba. The bill, sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms
and Representative Dan Burton, claims to punish foreign companies
and individuals doing business with Cuba. In July, the Senate and
House passed the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, claiming to apply
sanctions against companies with more than 40 million U.S. dollars
of investment in the two countries. The U.S. power politics and
hegemonism incurred condemnation from other countries, including
some U.S. allies.
</P>
<P>
3. China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan Sign
</P>
<P>
Border Agreement
</P>
<P>
The Presidents of China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan signed an agreement on confidence-building in the
military field in border areas on April 26 in Shanghai,
China. Under the agreement, the military forces of both sides
stationed along border areas would neither attack each other nor
conduct military exercises aimed at each other. The agreement also
specified that limits should be imposed on the scale, scope and
number of military exercises, and the concerned sides should
inform each other of any major military activities taking place in
any area within 100 kilometers of the borderline. The
multi-lateral political and military agreement has exerted deep
and far-reaching impact on maintaining peace, stability and
development in the Asia-Pacific region and the whole world as
well. On April 25, one day before the signing of the agreement,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his Russian counterpart, Boris
Yeltsin, met in Beijing and discussed the establishment of an
equal strategic partnership between the two countries to face
challenges of the coming 21st century.
</P>
<P>
4. Likud Leader Netanyahu Defeats Peres to Become New Israeli
</P>
<P>
PM; Middle East Peace Process Stalled
</P>
<P>
On May 31, Likud challenger Benjamin Netanyahu defeated Shimon
Peres and became the new Israeli prime minister. Netanyahu and his
cabinet pursued a hard line policy and refused to make any
concessions on security issues. Incessant bloodshed was triggered
by Israel's lifting a ban on Jewish settlement expansion in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, and opening an underground tunnel in
east Jerusalem, which Muslims accused of being a plot to undermine
their holy places above, the Al-Aqsa mosque. The Middle East peace
process was thus stalled.
</P>
<P>
5. Japanese PM Visits Yasukuni Shrine; Japan's Political
</P>
<P>
Orientation Tilts Toward Rightism
</P>
<P>
On July 29, Ryutaro Hashimoto became the first Japanese prime
minister since 1985 to visit the Tokyo-based Yasukuni Shrine
housing tablets of 14 class-A war criminals. In addition, Japanese
rightists kept provoking conflicts on China's Diaoyu Islands; the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) requested visiting foreign
heads of state and other political figures to visit the Yasukuni
Shrine; LDP parliament members made repeated efforts in
whitewashing Japan's history of invasion; and Japan and the
U.S. agreed to expand their security accord to cover the entire
Asia-Pacific region. Japan's political orientation has aroused
great concern and vigilance from neighboring Asian countries and
the whole international community as well.

6. Fightings in Eastern Zaire Drive Millions of Refugees Fleeing
</P>
<P>
Since early September, fierce fightings in eastern Zaire
between Zairean troops and the anti-government ethnic Tutsi people
as well as the neighboring Rwandan and Burundi troops have forced
millions of refugees, mainly from Rwanda and Burundi, to flee. In
mid-November, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution to
send multinational troops to eastern Zaire. With the help of the
international community, hundreds of thousands of refugees have
returned home.
</P>
<P>
7. U.N. General Assembly Approves Nuclear Test Ban Treaty
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly approved on September 10 the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Under the CTBT, all
signatory countries would be banned from conducting any nuclear
tests, and committed not to trigger, encourage or participate in
any nuclear tests. On September 24, the U.N. arranged open
signature for the CTBT, and China, France, Russia, Britain and the
U.S. were among the first signatories. So for, the treaty has
collected more than 130 signatory countries. It is an important
step forward the international community took to a final
elimination of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
8. Air Disasters Occur Frequently; Air Traffic Security to Be
</P>
<P>
Strengthened
</P>
<P>
On November 12, 349 passengers were killed when a Saudi Airway
Boeing 747 and a Kazakh Il-76 cargo plane collided in mid-air over
Haryana State, India, becoming the worst air collision in human
history. On July 17, a U.S. TWA (Trans World Airlines) 747 jet
with 230 aboard exploded in mid-air shortly after its takeoff from
New York JFK airport. No survivors have been found. Air accidents
occurred frequently in the world this year, which were attributed
to the fact that safety control technologies lag behind a rapidly
developing air transport industry.
</P>
<P>
9. U.S. Vetos Reelection of Boutros Boutros-Ghali; Kofi Annan
</P>
<P>
Elected New U.N. Secretary-General
</P>
<P>
After the November 19 veto by the U.S. of
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's reelection bid for
a second term, the Security Council recommended on December 13 to

United Nations for a term of office beginning on January 1, 1997
and ending on December 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
10. APEC Leaders Gather in Philippines Where Chinese and
</P>
<P>
 U.S. presidents meet
</P>
<P>
The fourth informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) was held on November 25 in
Subic, the Philippines. The meeting adopted a Manila Action Plan,
and passed a guideline document on closer economic and technical
cooperation among APEC members. On November 24, Chinese President
Jiang Zemin met his U.S. counterpart, Bill Clinton, in Manila,
which was seen as of great significance in improving and
developing Sino-U.S. relations.

<HEADLINE> Coordinator: Israeli-Palestinian Summit May Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special Middle East
coordinator Dennis Ross said today that he did not expect
differences between Israel and the Palestinians over Hebron
would be solved through one meeting, Israel Army Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Ross made the remarks before a summit meeting between
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat at the Erez checkpoint between
Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was planned to start at 1100 a.m. (0900 GMT)
as previously announced by the two sides, did not begin at this
hour, according to the Army Radio report.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who is also expected to attend the meeting aimed at
making a final push to conclude an agreement on Israeli army's
redeployment in Hebron, said today's summit meeting was a
beginning of long process of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that Ross' remarks indicated that
Netanyahu and Arafat may hold follow-up meetings, before they
could finally close the accord on the Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, senior officials from both sides said that
the leaders have to iron out some last minute's details
before signing the accord.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic breakthrough in the talks between Israel and
the Palestinians came Monday afternoon, when Netanyahu joined
the negotiations held at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mahmoud Abbas, Arafat's deputy and top Palestinian
negotiator, came from the Gaza Strip to participate in the
talks, which were a continuation of Sunday night's Marathon
talks in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Ross, who arrived here earlier this week to
push forward the Hebron talks, took an active role in the
night-long intensive negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Both Arafat and Ross expressed cautious optimism following
the talks, but Ross admitted that difference remained between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Ross then paid a sudden visit to Egypt Monday afternoon to
obtain Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's support for what has
been achieved by Israeli and Palestinian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, following his talks with Netanyahu, Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai as well as Ross went to Gaza to meet Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The cause behind the previously-made breakthrough is a package
deal Ross has been working on, which includes Israel's commitment
to further redeploy its troops in the West Bank following the
redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Under the package deal, Israel would also agree to hold
final status talks on the West Bank and other issues a few
weeks after the conclusion of the Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In light of the development, Ross will not be back to
Washington for Christmas as previously expected, and he told
reporters that a lot of work had to be done.

<HEADLINE> Famine Looms in Kenya's Lake Victoria Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Economic activity and food
production in Kenya's Lake Victoria Region are now threatened by
the rapidly-spreading water hyacinth in the Lake Victoria, said a
report compiled by the Kenyan Ministry of Environment and Natural
Resources.
</P>
<P>
Fish production is expected to fall by a big margin this
season and further in future if the weed is not controlled, the
report noted.
</P>
<P>
The report paints a bleak future for the fishing industry of
Nyanza Province along the lake which accounts for more than 50
percent of the fish consumed locally and exported.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of fishermen and middlemen who earned a living from
fishing related activities, are now rendered jobless.
</P>
<P>
Crop growing is alien to the communities living along the lake
as they have always depended on fishing as a source of money and
food.
</P>
<P>
A 65-year-old fisherman, Thomas Ogweno was quoted as saying:
"Once we stop fishing, there is no alternative. Our farms are
barren and we have to sell fish to buy maize meals and other
foodstuffs. No fish no food."
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government is concerned about the fast-growing weed
which had almost blocked the lake and committed to eradicating
the water hyacinth from the lake through biological methods.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has agreed to provide 70 million U.S. Dollars
to the three East African countries of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
to help fight the water hyacinth.

<HEADLINE> Courts in China to Continue Cracking down on Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- People's courts in China shall
continue to carry on the national crackdown on crimes next year in
a bid to safeguard social stability, Ren Jianxin, president of the
Supreme People's Court, said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The unified and intensified campaign on cracking down crimes
this year has beat down the arrogance of criminals, reversing poor
public security in some places," Ren told the presidents of
provincial Higher People's Courts.
</P>
<P>
"It is a long-term strategic task of the people's courts to
carry forward forceful crackdown on crimes that jeopardize public
security and undermine economy, and to go all out to safeguard
social stability with utmost efforts," Ren said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the courts to continue combating violent, gun-related
and organized crimes, pornography, gambling, and narcotics-related
crimes, prostitution, kidnaping of women, illegal publication,
which are all social evils.
</P>
<P>
The courts should carry on their powerful fight against various
violent and group crimes and vicious gangs of hooligans. Chief
criminals who are merciless and pose great harms to society must
be brought to justice according to law.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the courts should continue to deal serious blows
at embezzlement, bribery and other crimes disrupting economic
order, in order to ensure the sound development of market economy.
</P>
<P>
Such crimes are still serious in some places, and major cases
have occurred time and again, and the sum of money related to
the cases tends to grow.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he noted, the people's courts at all levels should
focus their emphasis on law-breakers in the country's Party and
government institutions and administrative departments in charge
of economic activities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the courts should step up crackdown on financial
fraud, smuggling, swindling, tax evasion, and making counterfeit
goods, Ren said.

<HEADLINE> China's Telephone Capacity to Top 100 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China's telephone capacity is
expected to top 100 million by the end of this year, pushing the
telephone penetration rate to 6,2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chunjiang, a spokesman for the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications, said today that in 1995 the two figures were
80 million and 4.66 percent.

In 1996, the first year of China's Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996--2000), China achieved a 34.5 percent increase in business
volume for posts and telecommunications service. The telephone
penetration rate in urban areas, Zhang said, has jumped from 17
percent in 1995 to 22 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China's mobile telecommunications service is now
nationwide and the global system for mobile communications (GSM)
business has extended to 261 prefectures or cities, covering over
1,000 counties, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China has invested 98 billion yuan in the posts and
telecommunications projects which included long-distance optical
fibre networks such as Beijing-Taiyuan-Xi'an, Wuhan-Chongqing,
Jinan-Qingdao and Nanjing-Hangzhou. A total of 31 ground satellite
 stations have been built or upgraded.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Arafat Start Summit Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat have just started a summit meeting, trying to
close an agreement on Israeli army's redeployment in the West
Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting started, U.S. special Middle East
coordinator Dennis Ross said that he did not expect
differences between Israel and the Palestinians over Hebron
would be solved through one meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ross made the remarks before the start of the meeting, which
was originally planned to begin at 1100 a.m. (0900 GMT) at the
Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip, was postponed
for about an hour.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who is also expected to join the meeting together with
other Israeli and Palestinian officials, said today's summit
meeting was a beginning of long process of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that Ross's remarks indicated that
Netanyahu and Arafat may hold follow-up meetings, before they
could finally close the accord on the Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, senior officials from both sides said that
the leaders have to iron out some last minute's details
before signing the accord.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic breakthrough in the talks between Israel and
the Palestinians came Monday afternoon, when Netanyahu joined
the negotiations held at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Abbas, Arafat's deputy and top Palestinian negotiator,
came from the Gaza Strip to participate in the talks, which were
a continuation of Sunday night's Marathon talks in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived here earlier this week to push forward the
Hebron talks, took an active role in the night-long intensive
negotiations held at Arafat's Gaza Office.
</P>
<P>
Both Arafat and Ross expressed cautious optimism following the
talks, Ross admitted that difference remained between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, following his talks with Netanyahu, Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, Ross went to Gaza where he met Arafat again until early
this morning.
</P>
<P>
In light of the development, Ross will not be back to
Washington for Christmas as previously expected, and he told
reporters that a lot of work had to be done.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Prosecutors Demand Life in Jail for U.S. Soldier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Seoul District
Public Prosecutor's Office (SDPPO) demanded life in jail for an
American soldier on murder charge here today.
</P>
<P>
Eric Munnich Stephen, serviceman of the second division of the
Eighth United States Army, was charged with killing a South Korean
woman, Lee Ki-soon, near a U.S. military base in Tongduchon, South
Korea's Kyonggi Province, on September 7 this year.
</P>
<P>
"Although the accused committed the crime while intoxicated, it
is requested that he be severely punished in view of the
horrendous nature of his offense, which was stabbing the victim's
throat several times with a deadly weapon," said SDPPO Prosecutor
Choi Kyo-il.
</P>
<P>
Stephen, 22, has admitted to prosecutors that he stabbed Lee, a
prostitute, to death in a brothel in Tongduchon.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. soldier has been detained at a U.S. military camp in
Kyonggi Province after he killed the South Korean woman.
</P>
<P>
On October 11, the South Korean prosecution requested the
transfer of the custody of the American serviceman before a
verdict is given, but the U.S. military authorities refused.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, some 40 murders have been linked to the
U.S. military presence in South Korea, where 37,000 American
troops are stationed.

DHAKA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Angered by sharp fall in stock
prices in the last few days, Dhaka's kerb market traders have
threatened to begin an indefinite sit-in from December 29, Dhaka
Stock Exchange (DSE) sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The kerb market traders also demanded the resignation of
Finance Minister S.A. Kibria, who was accused of making discursive
statements on the capital market, stock sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The DSE, center of all agitation, again witnessed a heavy sell
pressure Monday, pulling down the benchmark price index for the

<P>
The all shares price index of the country's premier bourse
plummeted by 82,28 points to 2375.38 points in Monday's brief

"If the situation continues, the index will go below the 2,000
point mark by this week," said a DSE official. "And the crash mark
of 1,500 points, set by the finance minister, is not far off."
</P>
<P>
The kerb market traders, who had successfully sieged the DSE
building for a few days earlier this month in the wake of

FUZHOU, December 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 carved Islamic
tombstones from the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127) have been
unearthed in Quanzhou, a port city in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say that the stones were discovered on Tumen
Street, the city's oldest.
</P>
<P>
The gravestones are engraved with cloud and flower patterns,
one archeologist says, and their carvings and shapes indicate that
Arab traders had residences and cemeteries on the street about
1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The discovery has also shown that Quanzhou was a prosperous
trade and religious center that attracted Chinese and other
businessmen and religious believers in ancient times.
</P>

The archaeologists said that the relics will be valuable for
research on Islamic practices in Quanzhou long ago.

<HEADLINE>   Roundup: Israelis, Palestinians Try to Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat are holding a summit meeting at present in an effort
to conclude an agreement on the Israeli army's redeployment in the
West Bank of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
There is cautious optimism, with doubts still lingering. Before
the meeting started, U.S. Middle East special coordinator Dennis
Ross said that he did not expect differences between Israel and
the Palestinians over Hebron would be solved through one meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was scheduled to start at 1100 a.m.
(0900 GMT) at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza
Strip, was postponed for almost an hour and started with a
one-to-one meeting between Netanyahu and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who is also expected to join the meeting later together
with other senior Israeli and Palestinian officials, said today's
summit meeting was a beginning of long process of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media pointed out that Ross's remarks indicated that
Netanyahu and Arafat may hold follow-up meetings, before they
could finally close the accord on the Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, senior officials from both sides said that
the leaders have to iron out some last minute's details
before signing the accord.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, Israeli army was originally
supposed to have completed its redeployment in the Hebron area by
March 28, a pull-back from approximately 80 percent of the town.
</P>
<P>
However, following a series of suicide bombing attacks in
Israel in February and March which killed 60 people and wounded
more than 100 others, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres delayed
the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Last May, the previous Israeli government announced that
the army's withdrawal from Hebron would be carried out after
the May 29 general elections, due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, who was defeated by Likud Party Chairman
Netanyahu in the elections, said afterwards that he would leave
the decision of the redeployment to the new prime minister and
his government.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers south of Jerusalem, is a place of
pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Moslems alike. Tradition has
it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives are all
buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 450 Jewish settlers now living in the
center of Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish
neighborhood after the 1967 War, during which Israel took over
the town from the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are some 200,000 Palestinians living in most
other parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Netanyahu said that he would like
Hebron to be part of the final status arrangements with the
Palestinians, but, at the same time, he also said he would stand
by the international agreements.
</P>
<P>
In October, Israel and the Palestinians started a new round
of continuous talks on the redeployment in Hebron, which had
already been delayed for more than half a year.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Where Does New Economic Growth Outlet Lie (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having analyzed market situations, economists believe urban
housing construction has great potentials. The conclusion has been
acknowledged by leading officials of the State Council, China's
top governing body.
</P>
<P>
The central government of China has listed housing construction
as new economic growth outlet and attached great importance to the
sector.
</P>
<P>
Though current real estate sector is still in a sluggish state,
experts say that housing becoming new consumption hit is a natural
trend, as housing sector does not so easily cause social problems
like automobiles, and on the other hand, it can recover investment
quickly and form a healthy cycle. Additionally there should be no
worries for marketing as every resident earnestly hopes to have
his own house.
</P>
<P>
At present, per capita living space in the Chinese cities is
7.9 sq m, and households with living space below four sq m in the
country's cities and towns total more than four million, and
dangerous houses with a combined floor space of 30 million sq m
are still waiting for rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
Real estate sector, especially housing sector can recover
capital in great amount and promote national economic development
by the means of consumption.
</P>
<P>
According to current selling prices for commodity houses in
urban areas, a standard flat will at least retrieve 100,000 yuan
of investment.
</P>
<P>
Because of its impact on more than 50 industrial sectors, one
Chinese yuan investment in real estate can create an additional
3.34 yuan of output value in related sectors.
</P>
<P>
However, prospects in real estate sector do not seem
encouraging. According to earlier reports, unsold commodity houses
across the country reach 30 million sq m, causing a serious
stockpiling of tens of hundreds of billion yuan of the investment
in real estate.
</P>
<P>
The main reason behind this lies in the fact that prices for
the country's commodity houses are too high, driving away a large
number of potential house buyers, and that most enterprises and
institutions are still building or buying their own apartments and
in turn distribute them among their employees by charging low
rents, thus preventing more consumers from entering the housing
market.
</P>
<P>
To vitalize China's housing market and cultivate new economic
growth outlets, China has been implementing housing reform with
earnest efforts and relevant departments have worked out policies
to reduce prices of commodity houses and to offer low-interest
loans to house purchasers and builders.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that with various effective measures, real
estate sector, which has remained sluggish for the past three
years and is still lacking of vitality, will pick up soon and
become once again a focus for domestic and overseas investors and
a growth outlet for China's economy.
</P>
<P>
The fact has testifies these experts' forecasting. In 1996,
China has experienced the fastest growth in real estate investment
except capital construction. The central government has arranged
10 billion yuan in loans for comfortable housing project alone.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Ministry of Construction shows that this
year, real estate indexes in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen,
Guangzhou and Dalian are climbing up. Experts say that in 1997,
following the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, China's real
estate market will further recover and develop into China's new
consumption focus.
</P>
<P>
Though real estate sector eventually becoming China's
consumption hit still needs certain environment, signs show that
the sector has owned conditions for supporting a sustainable and
rapid development of China's economy. As long as favorable
policies are available, real estate will surely become a new
growth outlet for China's economic development.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Where Does New Economic Growth Outlet Lie (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China has successfully
maintained a comparatively high economic growth while keeping
price increases at the lowest level in the passing 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, China still lacks forerunning industries in its
economic operations. Efforts have been made to probe new economic
growth outlets.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the country has formed a production capacity of 30
million color TV sets, contrasting 20 million sets of market
demands; while the country's textile sector has a production
capacity of 41 million spindles, with the market demands only
standing at 20 million.
</P>
<P>
One third of the state key construction projects which are
expected to bring forth bucks of profits after they go into
operation are actually starting losing money upon operation.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics released by the Ministry of Internal Trade
show that among the country's 443 kinds of industrial consumer
goods, only first-class cigarettes fall short of supply, and 99.8
percent of the commodities are either having a balance between
demand and supply or facing a state of supply exceeding demand.
</P>
<P>
Different people have different opinions as for what products
will become China's new consumption hits or what industries will
become China's new economic growth outlets.
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, experts and government officials first
thought of personal computers and telephones, while others put
forward tourism programs among common people. The fancy thinking
was later fixed on automobiles.
</P>
<P>
According to the "Outline of the Ninth Five-Year-Plan
(1996-2000) for National Economic and Social Development and
Long-Term Goals for the Year of 2010", China will make auto sector
into a pillar industry for the country's national economy in the
upcoming 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Geng Zhaojie, chairman of the board of the No.1 Automobile
Company Group based in Changchun, capital of Jilin Province, said
that making auto sector into the country's pillar industry should
have the following features: car production dominating the auto
industry; private uses of motor vehicles dominating the
consumption structure; an independent industrial network and
leading auto producers forming a certain production scale.
</P>
<P>
Families each with its annual income exceeding 30,000 yuan (one
U.S. dollar equals to 8.3 Chinese yuan) -- internationally
recognized income level for cars to enter the family -- now total
four million in China, but the auto market, with auto prices
plunging into the bottom in 1996, still have been operating at a
low speed for three years running.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, problems including traffic congestion and
environmental pollution are making experts worry about who favors
cars entering more families.

PARIS, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The Peruvian guerrillas of the Tupac-Amaru Revolutionary
Movement (MRTA) released 225 hostages on Monday as "a gesture for
Christmas," while detaining 140 state dignitaries, Japanese
businessmen, as well as Asian and Latin American diplomats. The
guerrillas have demanded that the Peruvian government free MRTA
members in prison as an exchange for the release of the remaining
hostages held in their hand. President Alberto Fujimori has
categorically rejected the demand.
</P>
<P>
-- Despite the worries of Washington, the reapproachment
between Turkey and Iran, which is sought by Turkish Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan, has been cemented after a four-day visit by
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to Turkish capital
Ankara. The United States has sent a "serious warning" to Turkey
over improving relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The settlement of the Paris Bourse for December was closed
on Monday with a gain of 1.42 percent, bringing the annual rise of
turnovers at the bourse to 24.7 percent in 1996, the best
performance since 1989.
</P>
<P>
-- The Peruvian MRTA guerrillas have hardened their position by
regarding five leading figures of the Peruvian security forces as
prisoners of war. Commander Evaristo, chief of the commandos who
have been occupying the residence of Japanese ambassador in Lima
for one week, said in a communique that if President Alberto
Fujimori chooses to use force, he will face a guerrilla force
which is "always determined and heroic."

<HEADLINE> NPC Secretary-General on Election of HK Deputies to Ninth National People's Congress (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statistics show that Hong Kong had a population of 6.31
million in 1995 (all the urban residents). According to the
above-mentioned proportion, it should elect 29 deputies to the NPC
(currently 28).
</P>
<P>
Taking full consideration of its special status, the number of
deputies of the Hong Kong SAR to the NPC should increase to 36.
</P>
<P>
On the election method, Cao said, in the light of the specific
conditions in Hong Kong and through repeated studies, a proposal
was raised for a meeting of electing deputies to the Ninth NPC in
the Hong Kong SAR under the sponsorship of the NPC Standing
Committee to be established, which is composed of members of the
Selection Committee for choosing the first government of the Hong
Kong SAR who are of the Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the election procedures, Cao said the election
meeting will select 11 members to form a presidium to preside over
the election meeting.
</P>
<P>
The election meeting will be responsible for formulating the
concrete election method. Those who are nominated by over 30
members of the election meeting will be candidates for the NPC
deputies.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the number of candidates will be
one-fifth to a half more than the number actually to be
elected. The election will be conducted by secret ballots, and
those who get the most votes will be elected.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the presidium will announce the outcome of the
election, which will subsequently be reported to the NPC Standing
Committee for qualification examination, Cao Zhi said.

<HEADLINE> NPC Secretary-General on Election of HK Deputies to Ninth National People's Congress (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Cao Zhi, secretary-general of
the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee,
today made an explanation on the draft method for electing the
deputies to the Ninth NPC by the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
His report mainly centered on the number of Hong Kong deputies
to be elected to the Ninth NPC and the election method and
procedures at the 23rd Session of the Eighth NPC Standing
Committee today.
</P>
<P>
Cao said Hong Kong will return to the motherland on July 1,
1997, and the present Hong Kong deputies to the NPC were elected
by the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Upon its return to the motherland, he said, the deputies of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to the NPC will be elected
by the Chinese citizens among the residents of the Hong Kong SAR
in accordance with the provisions of the Basic Law of the Hong
Kong SAR and the number of deputies and method for choosing them
defined by the NPC meeting to participate in the work of the
country's highest legislative organization.
</P>
<P>
Cao said the term of the Eighth NPC will expire in March 1998
while deputies to the Ninth NPC should be elected before the end
of January 1998.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the Fifth Session of the Eighth National
People's Congress, which is scheduled to be convened in March
1997, should formulate the method for electing the Deputies by the
Hong Kong SAR to the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
On number of deputies elected to the Ninth NPC, Cao noted that
according to the Election Law, the number of deputies to the NPC
elected by the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
will be allocated based on the principle of each deputy in rural
areas representing four times the number the each urban deputy
represents. That is to say that every 220,000 urban residents will
choose one NPC deputy, whereas one rural deputy should be chosen
from every 880,000 rural residents, Cao said.

<HEADLINE>   Roundup: Israelis, Palestinians Try to Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the talks, Israel insisted on changes in the security
arrangements agreed to under the Oslo accords, in light of
the violent confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip in September.
</P>
<P>
During the confrontations, triggered by the opening of
the Hasmonean Tunnel by Israel in Jerusalem's Old City, more
than 70 people were killed and hundreds of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the confrontations, which had included
exchanges of fire between Israeli troops and the Palestinian
police, U.S. President Bill Clinton called for an emergency
summit in Washington to resuscitate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
As one of the few results of the summit, Israel and the
Palestinians agreed to hold round-the-clock talks in a bid to
resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
However, after four weeks of continuous talks, with the
participation of Ross and other U.S. officials, Israel and the
Palestinians failed to complete a deal.
</P>
<P>
In November, Israel and Palestinians had once again tried to
close the Hebron deal through U.S. mediations, but again failed to
work out an agreement on the security arrangements and other
related issues.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media then reported that the main stumbling blocks
continued to be the right of "hot pursuit of terrorists" into the
Palestinian self-ruled areas, which was required by Israel, and
kinds of weapons to be used by Palestinian policemen in Hebron
after the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The latest dramatic breakthrough in the talks between Israel
and the Palestinians came Monday afternoon, when Netanyahu
joined the negotiations held at the King David Hotel in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mahmoud Abbas, Arafat's deputy and top Palestinian
negotiator, came from the Gaza Strip to participate in the
talks, which were the continuation of Sunday night's Marathon
talks in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived here earlier this week to push forward the
Hebron talks, took an active role in the night-long intensive
negotiations held at Arafat's Gaza Office.
</P>
<P>
Both Arafat and Ross expressed cautious optimism following the
talks, but Ross admitted that difference still remained between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Ross then paid a sudden visit to Egypt Monday afternoon,
which later he said was designed to obtain Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak's blessing on what has been achieved by Israeli
and Palestinian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, following their consultation with Netanyahu,
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, along with Ross, went to Gaza where they met Arafat
again until early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The cause behind the long-hoped breakthrough is a package
deal that Ross has been working on, which includes Israel's
commitment to further redeploy its troops in the West Bank
following the redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Under the package deal, Israel also would agree to hold
final status talks on the West Bank and other issues a few
weeks after the conclusion of the Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli relations are the core of the Middle
East conflict, without a solution to which there will be no real
peace in the Middle East. A long way still lies ahead concerning
the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on many issues such as the
final status of the West Bank and Jerusalem, even if the Hebron
issue is completely solved.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China has developed its first
world level annular laser device, an important step in China's
laser technology development.
</P>
<P>
The device was developed by Professor Gao Bolong from the
Changsha-based National Defense Science and Technology University,
after more than 20 years of effort.
</P>
<P>
The annular laser device has passed state appraisal.

early 1970s, and Gao has led annular laser device research since
then.
</P>
<P>
He has also supervised a number of students of post-graduate
and doctoral degrees for China's laser science in the past few
years.

<HEADLINE> NPC Law Committee Vice-Chairman on Draft Law on Stationing Troops in HK SAR (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wang said that the first clause of Article Seven of the draft
stipulates that the troops' facilities, such as aircraft and naval
vessels, materials, and military personnel on duty who have
certificates and documents issued by the garrison, as well as
vehicles, will be free from checks, search and detention by the
law-enforcers of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the first clause of Article 10 stipulates that the
Hong Kong SAR government shall provide necessary convenience to
the troops for the fulfillment of their duties, and guarantee the
legitimate rights and interests of the troops and military
personnel.
</P>
<P>
In order to clarify the relationship between the SAR government
and the troops, the Law Committee suggested the clause be revised
as follows: that the Hong Kong SAR government shall give support
to the troops to fulfil their obligations for defence purposes,
and guarantee the legitimate rights and interests of the troops
and military personnel, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Referring jurisdiction over criminal cases involving military
personnel, he said the Law Committee suggested adding a new clause
stipulating that the military judicial department and the court of
the Hong Kong SAR, as well as the relevant law-enforcement
departments, can hand such cases to their opposite side for
jurisdiction if they think it is more appropriate, and after they
reach a consensus through consultations.
</P>
<P>
The Law Committee also suggested that civil cases concerning
infringements upon rights by military personnel who are on duty,
be placed under the jurisdiction of the Supreme People's Court of
the People's Republic of China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Damage compensation resulting from infringement of rights
should be acted on in accordance with the law of the Hong Kong
SAR, he added.

He also outlined other opinions raised by the Law Committee for
revisions to the draft.

The draft stipulates that China's EEZs are maritime areas
within 200 nautical miles, beginning from boundary line of

The draft provides that overlap claims on EEZs and continental
shelves between China and other countries with bordering coasts,
or those standing opposite to China geographically, are to be
settled according to international law in the spirit of fairness.

cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Song urged personnel officials across the
country to work hard to improve their political quality, enhance
their awareness of serving the people, and try to grasp as much
knowledge of personnel management as possible.
</P>
<P>
"They should also be equipped with knowledge of law, market
economics, modern science and technology, and even foreign
languages, and computer skills," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that starting next year, personnel departments at
all levels will improve their work efficiency and quality of
service, and play an active and significant role in local economic
growth and social progress.

<HEADLINE> China to Make Large-Range Amendments to Criminal Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Draft amendments to China's
Criminal Law were sent today to the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), the country's highest
legislative body, for examination and deliberation.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hanbin, Vice Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, gave
an explanation of the amendments at the ongoing 23rd session of
the eighth NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said the amendments will adopt more definite and concrete
articles on the basic principles of the country's Criminal Law
that has been practiced for 17 years. He added that China is
striving for the making of "a unified and relatively complete
criminal code."
</P>
<P>
According to the draft amendments, "counter-revolutionary
offences" will be replaced by "jeopardizing state security
offences".
</P>
<P>
Wang explained that the amendment is being made to improve the
criminal law system, concerning the state system, and safeguarding
the overall interest of the country.
</P>
<P>
As for capital punishments stipulated by the Criminal Law, he
said, China will neither increase nor reduce articles on crimes
that carry death sentences.
</P>
<P>
Wang stressed that the amendments to the Criminal Law are
another important step forward in the improvement of the country's
criminal judicial system, after adoption of the amendments to the
Criminal Procedure Law in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Another important amendment suggested is that if an act is not
specifically covered by articles of the Criminal Law, it cannot
lead to a criminal conviction. According to the current law,
people can be convicted of a crime according to articles on a
similar crime.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments also include stricter rules on deduction
of penalties and release on parole in an effort to prevent
criminals from further endangering society, and their protection
offered by corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the amendments, punishments not covered by the
criminal law will need to be approved by the the Trial Committee
of the Supreme People's Court instead of by the trial committees
of local courts.
</P>
<P>
The amendments also widened the range of legitimate defenses,
to encourage the voluntary acts in security. Policemen acting in
the line of duty will have no criminal responsibility after
causing injury or death with their arms, the amendments suggested.
</P>
<P>
Those who surrender themselves to the police, or admit to other
crimes after their arrest will receive lower sentences.
</P>
<P>
The amendments also give a new list of crimes, including
organized crime, computer crime and abnormal security market acts.
</P>
<P>
The existing Criminal Law has 192 articles and 22 supplementary
regulations and the amended law will have 384 articles.

<HEADLINE> Draft Law on Blood Donation Submitted for Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China is to introduce a new
law to make illegal dealings in blood illegal. The law aims to
encourage more people to become voluntary blood donors to meet a
growing demand for blood and blood products.
</P>
<P>
A draft bill on the donation of blood has been submitted to the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
China's highest legislative body, for examination and discussion.
</P>
<P>
Public Health Minister Chen Minzhang explained the draft law to
the 23rd Session of the Eighth Standing Committee of the NPC,
which was held today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The law provides that every healthy Chinese citizen aged 18 to
55 has a duty to donate blood. Staff workers at government organs,
college and university students, and armymen are asked to play a
leading role in blood donation.
</P>
<P>
The draft law also stipulates that citizens have the right to
use blood freely. It encourages individuals, families and work
units to "deposit" blood for possible personal use.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent blood donation stations and medical
agencies from seeking exorbitant profits, the draft law prohibits
them from selling blood to blood product companies.
</P>
<P>
The law also formulates strict measures to guarantee the health
of blood donors and recipients of blood and blood products.
</P>
<P>
Minister Chen said the draft law on blood donating will help
satisfy increasing demands for blood, and halt illegal dealings in
blood, safeguarding the health of people.
</P>
<P>
The demand for blood in Chinese hospitals reached 800 tons last
year, with transfusions given to more than four million
people. And the demand is increasing at a rate of seven to ten
percent annually, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
However, paid blood donating dominated the method of blood
supply at present. Chen blamed paid blood donations and illegal
blood banks for contributing to poor quality of blood, and the
spread of diseases transmitted through transfused blood.
</P>
<P>
"It is an urgent task to formulate the law to improve the
backward conditions of blood donations in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 10 provincial and 11 city legislative bodies or
governments have issued local regulations on blood donations. The
Ministry of Public Health has published a series of rules to
regulate the work since 1990.
</P>
<P>
So far, 253 blood donation stations responsible for blood
collection, storage and transportation have been set up across the
country.

<HEADLINE> China Maps Out Plan for 1997 Personnel Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China will continue the reform
of its personnel system in 1997, giving priority to the civil
service system, personnel reform in social institutions, and the
comprehensive development of human resources.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national conference of senior personnel officials,
minister of Personnel Song Defu said here today that personnel
work in 1997 should conform to reforms of the agricultural sector
and state enterprises, to better serve the country's economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
In a letter of congratulation to the conference, Chinese
Premier Li Peng praised the achievements of personnel work in
1996. He expressed the hope that personnel departments can make
greater contributions to China's reform, opening up, and
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
"Personnel departments should further deepen internal reforms,
improve the civil service system, and strengthen the development
of human resources next year," the premier noted.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Song said that major tasks for personnel
departments across the country in 1997 should include spread of
the civil service system at county and township levels, and
introduction of a competitive mechanism into the employment system
of both the government and social institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, we should conduct general predictions and planning
for the development of human resources, and carry out reforms of
the social security system, especially reform of pension
insurance," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the reform of personnel systems is to some
extent "a readjustment of interests", which is inevitably
complicated and sensitive.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we should make progress in a safe and steady way,"
he asserted, adding that interests of various social groups, such
as civil servants, professionals and technicians, managers,
ordinary employees, and retired officials, must be taken into
account.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Party's control over officials, which he
described as the "root" of personnel work, must be maintained,
though the way of management could be improved.
</P>
<P>
"We should also strictly prevent the application of commercial
rules in personnel work, and resolutely object to any practice
of 'trading power for money'," he added.
</P>
<P>
Claiming major successes for personnel work in 1996, Song said
the number of provinces that adopted open exams in the recruiting
of new civil servants has surged from 10 to 25, while over 1,800
labor markets for skilled personnel have been established across
the country.
</P>
<P>
"The overall number of government employees is on the decline,
showing the effects of state streamlining efforts," he claimed.

<HEADLINE> Mitsubishi Invites Parts Makers in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A 60-member delegation from
the Mitsubishi Electric Corporation of Japan is in Shanghai to
seek Chinese manufacturers for fittings and parts.
</P>
<P>
It is Mitsubishi's first such move in China and so far over 700
Chinese firms have shown an interest in the business opportunity.
</P>
<P>
The Japan-headquartered firm has asked potential Chinese
partners to manufacture over 300 items for electricity generation
and telecommunications equipment, electronic elements and
apparatus, and such household appliances as air-conditioners and
refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi has chosen Shanghai to initiate such business in
view of east China's sound industrial foundation, and the large
number of local enterprises with a remarkable quality, technology
and viability level, said Shinmura Takuji, executive director of
the company.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident of China's economy and are willing to
cooperate with Chinese enterprises in the long term," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation began to export elevators and
escalators to China as early as the 1950s. Currently it has 12
solely-Mitsubishi-funded firms or joint ventures in China.

<HEADLINE> China to Rename Counterrevolutionary Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A draft amendment to China's
Criminal Law for the renaming of the Counter Revolutionary Crime
as jeopardizing state security crime, was today submitted to the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The proposed change will undergo examination and deliberation.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hanbin, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
NPC, explained the draft amendment to the committee, China's
highest legislative body, saying that the suggestion was made in
consideration of changed circumstances, and the overall interests
of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the stipulation about the counter-revolutionary
crime included in the Criminal law has played an important role in
safeguarding state security and socialist system and the
consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
However, political, economic and social development in recent
years has given birth to a series of new problems, Wand noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, counter-revoluntary activities
stipulated in the current Criminal Law are still all considered as
crime, with the exception that some of the activities will be
dealt as ordinary criminal acts.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Terrorist Group Makes New Threat to France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Algeria's militant movement, the
Armed Islamic Group (GIA), today made a new threat to France,
demanding French pressure for the release of its imprisoned
members in Algeria, Agence France Presse reported.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to French President Jacques Chirac, the group
threatened to "destroy your country" at all costs and asked him to
pressure Algiers for the release of imprisoned GIA members, who
have been given death sentences.
</P>
<P>
In the letter signed by the GIA's new leader Antar Zouari, the
GIA said it has chosen the path of killings. "We will do what we
say. The events of the past several days have proved it. We are
expecting some news in a brief time."
</P>
<P>
"The events of the past several days" may refer to the bombing
at the Port Royal subway station in downtown Paris on December 3,
but it didn't claim responsibility for the attack, in which four
people were killed and about 90 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
"You will certainly have some news about this in the near
future," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
In the undated letter, the GIA asked Chirac to intervene for
the release of its colleagues, including its chief Abu-Adlan
Abdelhaq Layada, who is jailed in Algiers.
</P>
<P>
The GIA put forward three conditions for the stop of killings:
the release of Layada and a number of other GIA members, stopping
support for the Algerian government, and paying a "tribute" for
"saving the lives of your people," referring to the French
nationals living in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The French Interior Ministry said it is studying the letter,
but refused to make further comment.
</P>
<P>
The GIA claimed responsibility for a wave of terrorist bombings
in France last summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
The new threat came one day after a car bomb attack in central
Algiers killed three people and injured 70.
</P>
<P>
It also coincided with the second anniversary of the hijacking
of an Air France airliner in Algiers by GIA members.

<HEADLINE> China to Rule Trust Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A new game rule on trusts was
submitted to China's top legislative body in Beijing today for
review. The aim is to outlaw chaotic trust markets and
irresponsible trustees in China.
</P>
<P>
The draft law, which is parallel to international standards, is
expected to standardize management of trusts, and safeguard the
rights of property or trust investors, Zhang Xuwu, Vice-Chairman
of Financial and Economic Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC), said in an address to the 23rd Plenum of NPC's
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
China's economic reform has endeavored to breathe life into the
trust business, reinvigorating it from a standstill two decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
A total of 392 trust corporations account for capital of more
than 600 billion yuan (about 72.3 billion US dollars), taking up
one tenth of the whole country's capital funds, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
However, the vaguely defined function of trust businesses, low
ability of risk bearing, and lack of self restraint, have plunged
the promising field into a tailspin, Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
He believes the lack of a specific law governing trust
activities in China is a major curse to ineffective mechanism and
loose supervision.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also defined the basic line of the law draft:
</P>
<P>
-- restraining trustees and guaranteeing the value of the
property and money, accredited to trust corporations;
</P>
<P>
-- regulating existing trust businesses to specialized ones for
particular capital and property management, and playing a role of
medium and long-term financial management, but different from that
of banks;
</P>
<P>
-- and stablizing trust activities to reduce the impact on the
business from the state's macro-control policies.
</P>
<P>
Non-business trusts are also on the list of regulations along
with business trusts, backbone of the field.
</P>
<P>
Despite its current limited transactions, non-business trusts
are promising, with more well-off Chinese appearing in the near
future, Zhang said. Trust organizations might become choices of
the future for individuals.
</P>
<P>
Non-business trusts also provides an effective means to guard
China's overseas capital.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the trust business of capital, securities,
property and fixed assets, trust corporations in China are allowed
to do business in loans, investments, leasing, safe box,
guarantees, deputy and foreign exchange, according to the draft.
</P>
<P>
Every trust corporation is subject to higher-level examination
and approval to help avoid possible risks.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Finance Ministry
today officially announced the country's key macro-economic
targets for the next two or three years, setting the annual
economic growth rate at 7.0 to 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the government house today,
Thailand will try to achieve an annual growth rate of 7 to 10
percent in its exports during the next two or three years.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate will be curbed at 5 percent in
1997 and then will be brought down below the level in the

</P>
<P>
The current account deficit will be kept at around 7.5 to 7.9

<P>
The targets set by Thailand's new government led by Prime
Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh for the upcoming years are
generally lower than those set by the previous government led by
Banharn Silpa-Archa after the country suffered an economic
slowdown over the past year.
</P>
<P>
The Banharn government earlier set an 8.5 percent economic
growth and an 18 percent export growth this year, but the year is
ending with the country expected to see only a 7 percent economic
growth and a near-zero growth in its exports.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meets With Israeli Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Minister of Defense
Yitzhak Mordechai today went directly into talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on the imminent deal on the overdue
Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
They will review the lastest developments of the peace process
in the Middle East during the meeting held upon Mordechai's
arrival in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Hurghada. Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa attended the meeting, according to
Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure from Tel Aviv today, Mordechai was
quoted by Israel Radio as saying that he would affirm to Mubarak
Israel's commitment to live in peace and security with its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He said he will brief the Egyptian president on the latest
developments concerning the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In a relevant development, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat today at Erez
checkpoint on the border between Israel and the Gaza strip.
</P>
<P>
The meeting aims to put the final touches on the long-delayed
agreement on redeployment of Israeli forces in the last
Israeli-controlled West Bank town of Hebron, which was due to
take place in march.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast peace coordinator Dennis Ross met earlier today
with Netanyahu and later with Arafat after his Cairo visit Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa presented a report to Mubarak on progress in the Hebron
talks after his meeting with Ross, who had been shuttling between
Palestine and Israel over the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Monday evening Mubarak received a phone call from Netanyahu.
They discussed the possibility of reaching an Israeli-Palestinian
agreement on implementing the previously concluded accords.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu clarified that some progress has been realized in
the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks on the long overdue Israeli
redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic breakthrough in the talks between the Israelis
and Palestinians came Monday afternoon when Netanyahu joined the
negotiations at a hotel in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Both Arafat and Ross expressed cautious optimism following
the talks, but Ross admitted that difference remained between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the reason for the breakthrough is
a package deal Ross has been working on, which includes Israel's
commitment to further redeployment elsewhere in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Israel also would agree to hold final status
talks on the West Bank and other issues a few weeks after the
conclusion of the Hebron redeployment.

<HEADLINE> Iran Finalizes Agreements on Major Gas Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran claimed here today that
it has finalized agreements on a few billion dollar projects with
European and Far Eastern countries despite U.S. embargo and
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Reza Rostami Sani, director of the international affairs
department of the National Iranian Gas Co., said that the
official announcement will be made by Oil Minister Gholamreza
Aqazadeh soon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official told Xinhua in an exclusive interview
that some companies from European and Asian countries will take
part in the massive gas projects in South Pars gas field in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iran is the second largest gas country in the world. Its
natural gas reserve stands at 21 trillion cubic meters and can
be used for 500 years.
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1995, Iran announced 11 major oil and gas
projects with a total foreign investment of 7 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
They include the South Pars gas field development project
with an investment of 851 million dollars, the Salman Dalan gas
field development project with an investment of 572 million
dollars, the Amak gas compression and treating project with an
investment of 250 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sani said that foreign companies will undertake the massive
gas projects in form of buy-back system since the demand for gas
in Europe is bigger than the supply. Asian countries such as
Japan and South Korea have great interest in purchasing Iranian
gas. The Iranian official said that Iran has a giant gas export
project, which will transfer natural gas from the Iranian gas
field to European countries.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, Iran has established an joint company of
Iran-Gas Europe in cooperation with six European countries of
Austria, Spain, Germany, France, Czech Republic and Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
Specialists have spent three years in making feasibility
studies on the massive project with two ways for gas transmission
to Europe via Turkey and the Caucasus, he said.
</P>
<P>
It will take eight to 15 years to complete the gas
transmission project first to eastern Europe and then to western
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Iran now produces 40 billion cubic meters of natural gas
annually for the local market with a 16,000-kilometer main trunk
gas pipeline across the country.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stages Maneuvers Against Chemical Warfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 13 battalions of Iranian
mobilization forces staged the second defensive maneuvers
against chemical attacks in Qom, 156 kilometers south of Tehran,
an informed source said here today.
</P>
<P>
The military source said that the maneuvers were held Monday
in order to "strengthen civil defense and prepare the
mobilization forces against possible aggression." Eleven men's
battalions and two women's battalions took part in the war game.
</P>
<P>
The first defensive maneuvers in Iran were held on December
10 in Ahwaz, the provincial capital of the southwestern province
of Khuzestan.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of elite fighters from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps (IRGC) carried out the maneuvers including defense
against chemical-biological attacks.
</P>
<P>
Defending against chemical warfare has become an integral
part of the military maneuvers in Iran since thousands of
Iranian soldiers were exposed to mustard and cyanide gases
during the Iran-Iraq war between 1980 and 1988.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: A Non-End Chess Game in South Lebanon (Part 1) (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 24 (Xinhua) -- In the year 1996, Lebanon and
Israel have failed again to go beyond a circle in which they
accuse each other of making trouble in south Lebanon in the wake
of every single violent incident, especially when casualties were
caused.
</P>
<P>
An Asian diplomat in Beirut described south Lebanon, the last
active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict, as a "non-end
chess game." In the "game playing," the two sides were getting
more and more experienced to smartly break the rules.
</P>
<P>
"But the point is that the Kings are not on the board," the
diplomat said, "and neither of the contestants has found it
possible to check the other one."
</P>
<P>
Trained and financed by Iran, the Lebanese Hezbollah, or Party
of God, is the main force fighting against the Israeli occupation
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Under an understanding brokered by the United States, a
committee grouping the U.S., France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel
was established in order to monitor the cease-fire on the
 Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "April cease-fire understanding" put an end to
a 17-day Israeli blitz in south Lebanon, in which some 200
Lebanese, mainly civilians, were killed.
</P>
<P>
However, the understanding gives a green light to guerrilla
attacks on Israeli forces occupying a border strip in south
Lebanon, allows the Israelis a "right of self-defense" and
demands that civilians be kept away from military operations.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and the Jewish state have raced one another to file
complaints to the five-nation committee when non-military targets
were attacked.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the committee has held seven meetings, issued four
statements, but failed to make any condemnation in spite of the
fact that over two dozens of south Lebanese villagers have been
wounded in Israel's artillery shellings since the committee was
set up in August.
</P>
<P>
Israel argued that the shellings were retaliative for the
attacks launched "from civilian areas" by guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, which violated the cease-fire
understanding.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: A Non-End Chess Game in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 25 Israeli soldiers have been killed by Hezbollah
guerrillas in south Lebanon since the beginning of this year,
including 18 killed after Israel's "Operation Grapes of Wrath" in
April.
</P>
<P>
In its last meeting in the south Lebanese border town of
Naqoura last week, the cease-fire monitoring committee confirmed
that "at least one Katyusha rocket" was fired into northern
Israel on December 13, but it declined to hold Lebanon responsible
for the offensive.
</P>
<P>
Threats posed by the Katyusha on the Jewish settlements in
northern Israel had been one of the main causes prompting former
Prime Minister Shimon Peres to launch the large-scale military
strike in south Lebanon in April.
</P>
<P>
The 17-day blitz led to the killing of some 200 Lebanese,
mostly civilians, and caused material losses estimated at 500
million to 700 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the operation did not save the Labor government from
stepping down. Shimon Peres, the former Israeli Prime Minister
suffered a defeat in the May 29 general elections and Binyamin
Netanyahu, the Likud party leader, won the race and later put
forward the "Lebanon first" proposal in an apparent attempt to
break the dilemma.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal was dismissed by Lebanon and Syria, both of
which terms it as a scheme to estrange the two close neighbors.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, Israel will pull its forces out of
the occupied border enclave after a security arrangement
satisfying the Jewish state is reached with Lebanon and
guaranteed by Syria.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi said that the "Lebanese first"
proposal was aimed at "driving a wedge between Lebanon and
Syria," the last two Arab countries still in a state of war with
their Jewish neighbor.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that after the Israeli withdrawal, the Lebanese
army will guarantee tranquility and stability on the border and
will prevent any shot and bombardment directed at northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
To eliminate the resistance before the Israeli withdrawal "is
a political price Lebanon is not willing to pay," Hrawi said.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer buffer zone,
stretching from the Mediterranean coast in the west to Mount
Hermon in the east in 1985, in a bid to protect northern Israel
from cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Political observers rule out a solution for the south Lebanon
problem outside the framework of peace process between Lebanon
and Syria on the one side and Israel on the other.

<P>
LUSAKA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Health Minister
Katele Kalumba here today called for redoubling investments in
the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba made the remarks while officially launching a policy
document on AIDS in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He said that Zambia made a political commitment on fighting
HIV/AIDS two years ago, but it was disappointed that there
was little financial support in the fight against the disease.
</P>
<P>
"It is sad and very disappointing that we cannot cope with the
catastrophe that has befallen us," Kalumba noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that less money is being spent on AIDS projects and
it is difficult to mobilize resources to combat the deadly
disease.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that at least 500 young women in the
country are daily getting infected with HIV virus that causes the
deadly disease AIDS. In the age group of 15-39 there are about
700,000 people infected with HIV. Out of the total population of
8.9 millions, about 70 percent are youths who are at great risk
of contracting HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The spread of HIV/AIDS seems to be on the increase in Zambia,
Deputy Minister of Youth and Child Development Mutele Chitika
said earlyer. "It is therefore a matter of utmost importance and
great urgency that the young are protected from this deadly
disease AIDS."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: A Non-End Chess Game in South Lebanon (Part 1) (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 24 (Xinhua) -- In the year 1996, Lebanon and
Israel have failed again to go beyond a circle in which they
accuse each other of making trouble in south Lebanon in the wake
of every single violent incident, especially when casualties were
caused.
</P>
<P>
An Asian diplomat in Beirut described south Lebanon, the last
active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict, as a "non-end
chess game." In the "game playing," the two sides were getting
more and more experienced to smartly break the rules.
</P>
<P>
"But the point is that the Kings are not on the board," the
diplomat said, "and neither of the contestants has found it
possible to check the other one."
</P>
<P>
Trained and financed by Iran, the Lebanese Hezbollah, or Party
of God, is the main force fighting against the Israeli occupation
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Under an understanding brokered by the United States, a
committee grouping the U.S., France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel
was established in order to monitor the cease-fire on the
 Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "April cease-fire understanding" put an end to
a 17-day Israeli blitz in south Lebanon, in which some 200
Lebanese, mainly civilians, were killed.
</P>
<P>
However, the understanding gives a green light to guerrilla
attacks on Israeli forces occupying a border strip in south
Lebanon, allows the Israelis a "right of self-defense" and
demands that civilians be kept away from military operations.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and the Jewish state have raced one another to file
complaints to the five-nation committee when non-military targets
were attacked.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the committee has held seven meetings, issued four
statements, but failed to make any condemnation in spite of the
fact that over two dozens of south Lebanese villagers have been
wounded in Israel's artillery shellings since the committee was
set up in August.
</P>
<P>
Israel argued that the shellings were retaliative for the
attacks launched "from civilian areas" by guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, which violated the cease-fire
understanding.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stages Maneuvers Against Chemical Warfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 13 battalions of Iranian
mobilization forces staged the second defensive maneuvers
against chemical attacks in Qom, 156 kilometers south of Tehran,
an informed source said here today.
</P>
<P>
The military source said that the maneuvers were held Monday
in order to "strengthen civil defense and prepare the
mobilization forces against possible aggression." Eleven men's
battalions and two women's battalions took part in the war game.
</P>
<P>
The first defensive maneuvers in Iran were held on December
10 in Ahwaz, the provincial capital of the southwestern province
of Khuzestan.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of elite fighters from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps (IRGC) carried out the maneuvers including defense
against chemical-biological attacks.
</P>
<P>
Defending against chemical warfare has become an integral
part of the military maneuvers in Iran since thousands of
Iranian soldiers were exposed to mustard and cyanide gases
during the Iran-Iraq war between 1980 and 1988.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: A Non-End Chess Game in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 25 Israeli soldiers have been killed by Hezbollah
guerrillas in south Lebanon since the beginning of this year,
including 18 killed after Israel's "Operation Grapes of Wrath" in
April.
</P>
<P>
In its last meeting in the south Lebanese border town of
Naqoura last week, the cease-fire monitoring committee confirmed
that "at least one Katyusha rocket" was fired into northern
Israel on December 13, but it declined to hold Lebanon responsible
for the offensive.
</P>
<P>
Threats posed by the Katyusha on the Jewish settlements in
northern Israel had been one of the main causes prompting former
Prime Minister Shimon Peres to launch the large-scale military
strike in south Lebanon in April.
</P>
<P>
The 17-day blitz led to the killing of some 200 Lebanese,
mostly civilians, and caused material losses estimated at 500
million to 700 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the operation did not save the Labor government from
stepping down. Shimon Peres, the former Israeli Prime Minister
suffered a defeat in the May 29 general elections and Binyamin
Netanyahu, the Likud party leader, won the race and later put
forward the "Lebanon first" proposal in an apparent attempt to
break the dilemma.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal was dismissed by Lebanon and Syria, both of
which terms it as a scheme to estrange the two close neighbors.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, Israel will pull its forces out of
the occupied border enclave after a security arrangement
satisfying the Jewish state is reached with Lebanon and
guaranteed by Syria.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi said that the "Lebanese first"
proposal was aimed at "driving a wedge between Lebanon and
Syria," the last two Arab countries still in a state of war with
their Jewish neighbor.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that after the Israeli withdrawal, the Lebanese
army will guarantee tranquility and stability on the border and
will prevent any shot and bombardment directed at northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
To eliminate the resistance before the Israeli withdrawal "is
a political price Lebanon is not willing to pay," Hrawi said.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer buffer zone,
stretching from the Mediterranean coast in the west to Mount
Hermon in the east in 1985, in a bid to protect northern Israel
from cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Political observers rule out a solution for the south Lebanon
problem outside the framework of peace process between Lebanon
and Syria on the one side and Israel on the other.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meets With Israeli Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Minister of Defense
Yitzhak Mordechai today went directly into talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on the imminent deal on the overdue
Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
They will review the lastest developments of the peace process
in the Middle East during the meeting held upon Mordechai's
arrival in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Hurghada. Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa attended the meeting, according to
Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure from Tel Aviv today, Mordechai was
quoted by Israel Radio as saying that he would affirm to Mubarak
Israel's commitment to live in peace and security with its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He said he will brief the Egyptian president on the latest
developments concerning the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In a relevant development, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat today at Erez
checkpoint on the border between Israel and the Gaza strip.
</P>
<P>
The meeting aims to put the final touches on the long-delayed
agreement on redeployment of Israeli forces in the last
Israeli-controlled West Bank town of Hebron, which was due to
take place in march.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast peace coordinator Dennis Ross met earlier today
with Netanyahu and later with Arafat after his Cairo visit Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa presented a report to Mubarak on progress in the Hebron
talks after his meeting with Ross, who had been shuttling between
Palestine and Israel over the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Monday evening Mubarak received a phone call from Netanyahu.
They discussed the possibility of reaching an Israeli-Palestinian
agreement on implementing the previously concluded accords.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu clarified that some progress has been realized in
the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks on the long overdue Israeli
redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic breakthrough in the talks between the Israelis
and Palestinians came Monday afternoon when Netanyahu joined the
negotiations at a hotel in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Both Arafat and Ross expressed cautious optimism following
the talks, but Ross admitted that difference remained between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the reason for the breakthrough is
a package deal Ross has been working on, which includes Israel's
commitment to further redeployment elsewhere in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Israel also would agree to hold final status
talks on the West Bank and other issues a few weeks after the
conclusion of the Hebron redeployment.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Build Second Air Traffic Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A second advanced air traffic
control center will be built at Prestwick, southern London,
according to Britain's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
</P>
<P>
The Prestwick center, with a total investment of 200 million
pounds (325 million U.S. dollars), will be built, equipped and
owned by private sector companies, but staffed by CAA employees.
</P>
<P>
It will complement a publicly-funded center at Swanwick due to
open at the end of next year, CAA said.
</P>
<P>
The Swanwick center, also in London, was scheduled to open this
month, taking over air traffic control from facilities at West
Drayton near Heathrow airport. But the opening was put back
because of computer software problems. Swanwick's air traffic
operations room is said to be the biggest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The National Air Traffic Services, a subsidiary of the CAA,
expected the traffic it would have to handle to increase by 30
percent over the next 10 years and by up to 50 percent by 2015.

l996-97 cash requirement of almost 300 million pounds (480 million
U.S dollars).

"The Post Office and all its businesses will have to work hard
for the rest of the financial year if we are to meet the
