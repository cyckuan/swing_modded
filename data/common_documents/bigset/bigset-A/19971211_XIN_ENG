<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Party Politburo Calls for Efforts to Eliminate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The top administrative organ of
the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) has called for stepping up
efforts to eliminate hunger and alleviate poverty.
</P>
<P>
The appeal, by the Politburo of the CPV Central Committee, was
made in a recent instruction to party and government
organizations, and carried Wednesday by official media here.
</P>
<P>
Greater efforts are needed to bring down the country's
percantage of poor and hungry households from 20-25 percent
currently to 10 percent by year 2000, the instruction said.
</P>
<P>
To reach the goal, set last year by the CPV's Eighth National
Congress, party organizations should focus on some key issues,
such as proper land use and better use of local resources, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Politburo also called for the gradual implementation of the
policy to cut all or part of school fees for children from
poverty-stricken families, and of medical charges for poor people.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 2.9 million households classified as "poor"
throughout Vietnam, including 600,000 households in rural areas
where people often don't have enough food, the party document said.
</P>
<P>
These households in poverty account for 19.3 percent of the
country's total, it said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Parliament Adopts Law on More Foreign Borrowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, Wednesday adopted in the first reading a
draft law allowing the government to increase the 1997 foreign
borrowing.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, foreign borrowing is to be increased from 45.9
trillion rubles (8.4 billion U.S. dollars) to 52.45 trillion
rubles (8.86 billion dollars), the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The law sets the upper limit of the 1997 foreign borrowing at
10.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
This draft law is aimed at reducing the soaring cost of
borrowing on domestic and foreign markets, said a statement
released by the budget committee.
</P>
<P>
It also said that yields on government securities tend to
increase and exceed the yields on borrowings on external financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
This law will help preserve the volume of borrowings stipulated
in the federal law on the 1997 federal budget and will increase
the efficiency of loans by restructuring them, the statement
said.

<HEADLINE> EU Launches Debate on Improvement of Ports Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, Wednesday called for a
Europe-wide debate on how to improve the efficiency of ports and
their integration into the EU's transport network.
</P>
<P>
The Commission Wednesday invited EU institutions, port
authorities, operators and the maritime industries to take up the
debate.
</P>
<P>
Ports had tended to remain on the sidelines of the general
transport debate on the EU's transport policy.
</P>
<P>
A green paper published Wednesday sets out possible
improvements in existing policies and identifies other areas,
particularly in the field of charging and market access where new
initiatives might be taken.
</P>
<P>
The commission also proposed to integrate better ports and
other interconnection points into the guidelines which detail the
exact makeup of the Trans-European Transport Network (TENs).
</P>
<P>
The proposal to adapt the TENs transport guidelines will, if
endorsed by EU member states and the European Parliament, include
300 European ports as part of the TENs.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Again Express Reservation Over 35-Hour Work Week Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
on Wednesday again expressed his reservation over the draft law on
35-hour work week presented by the Socialist government.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think in fact that the draft law, taking into account
its obligatory and constraining character, would be favorable to
jobs," Chirac told a cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
However, all cabinet members expressed approval of the law
prepared by the Minister of Employment and Solidarity, Martine
Aubry, as a job-creating measure.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time that Chirac expressed his opposition to
the law.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said the solution to the country's 12.5 percent jobless
rate lies in "the management of the working time" through
negotiations between employers and employees.
</P>
<P>
The French national association of employers CNPF strongly
opposes the law, and some regional associations of employers have
vowed to "go to war" with the government over the issue.
</P>
<P>
If adopted by the National Assembly, or parliament, the law
will oblige all enterprises to start observing 35-hour work week
from year 2000.
</P>
<P>
A poll in Wednesday's Liberation daily suggests that two out of
three Frenchmen will accept a reduction of work week time if that
really leads to the creation of more jobs.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Threatens Former President With Legal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today joined Truth and Reconciliation Commission
(TRC) Chairman Desmond Tutu in a threat of bringing charges
against former state president P W Botha if he refuses to appear
before the TRC.
</P>
<P>
The law should take its course if Botha persisted in his
refusal, South African Press Association quoted Mandela as saying
in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Botha was served with a third subpoena last week to testify
before the TRC on December 19 on the role of the former State
Security Council (SSC), which he chaired at the height of the
apartheid conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We would like the rule of law to be respected, No one is
above the law," Mandela told reporters after meeting a Dutch
Reformed Church delegation to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
"If all persuasion fails, the law must take its course," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the founding bill of the TRC, a person could face fines
or up to two years of imprisonment or both for disobeying a
subpoena.
</P>
<P>
Botha, who was president between 1984 and 1989, has repeatedly
said that he would not comply with a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
He also refused to apologize for the role of his government,
which vehemently implemented apartheid policies.
</P>
<P>
He escaped charges against him after he failed to appear at
the second round of SSC hearings last Friday in Cape Town owing
to a defection in the second subpoena.
</P>
<P>
Botha defied his first subpoena at the first round of SSC
hearings in Johannesburg last month on the grounds of bad health.
</P>
<P>
He told an Afrikaans newspaper in mid-November that he would
rather be charged than appear before the TRC and that he would
not seek amnesty at the TRC, which he called a "circus".

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Peace Conference Concludes in Bonn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- An international conference on
Bosnia was concluded here today with Western nations vowing to
force improved compliance with the Dayton peace accord from the
Bosnian parties.
</P>
<P>
But the two-day meetings had to adopt its final communique
without the participation of serb leaders who walked out of the
talks earlier today in protest against a Western demand to
negotiate the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Leaving the event were Federal Yugoslav Foreign Ministry
Director Dragomir Vucicevic, Bosnian Serb President Biljana
Plavsic and the Serb member of Bosnia's collective presidency,
Momcilo Krajisnik.
</P>
<P>
What prompted them to quit was the inclusion of Western demands
in the final's communique that Belgrade negotiate with ethnic
Albanians in its Kosovo region to defuse ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
"Dealing with the Kosovo issue at such a conference amounts to
indirect support for separatism and also terrorism," said
Vucicevic in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his government would not approve and did not
feel bound by the conference's 28-page final document because of
the inclusion of the Kosovo paragraph. However he also noted that
this did not mean that Belgrade would not back compliance with the
Dayton peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who chaired the meetings,
told reporters that he regretted the Serb walk-out but stressed
that it would not have a direct impact on what had been achieved
in the meetings
</P>
<P>
Among the concrete results achieved was an approval from
Bosnian leaders of a common passport and citizenship for Bosnia, a
long-sought decision which has yet to be approved by the Bosnian
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The conference also approved strengthened power for the chief
international coordinator for Bosnia reconstruction, Carlos
Westendorf, who would be able to take binding decisions if the
Bosnian parties can not agree among themselves on issues such as a
common national flag, common car license plates as well as the
timing, location, and chairmanship of meetings of the common
institutions in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the meetings at a news conference, Kinkel said the
final document had made it clear to the Bosnian parties that
international assistance would remain conditional upon their
compliance with the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
"Those who comply will get help and those who do not will be
excluded," Kinkel warned.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing news conference, Westendorf said: "There
are still many things to be done and we have to speed up the
process because there is not much time left."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Police to Take Stern Action Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean police will
take any necessary stern actions to deal with incidents of
violence and general lawlessness, Home Affairs Minister Dumiso
Dabengwa warned here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters following violent protests which rocked
the capital on Tuesday, Dabengwa said Harare had the highest
number of violent incidents reported with 31 shops being looted
during the one-day nationwide mass action organized by the
Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions to protest against heavy taxes.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We arrested 14 people in Harare for looting and they
will soon be appearing in court."
</P>
<P>
Three police vehicles and a national army van had been burnt
while at least eight private motor vehicles were stoned in the
capital on Tuesday, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said at least five police officers suffered minor injuries
while another police officer received serious head injuries
during the violence which broke out.
</P>
<P>
The exact cost of the damage is not yet clear as most
businesses and individuals are still evaluating the extent of
damage, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President of Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce
Danny Meyer today said that loss of revenue as a result of
Tuesday's mass protests against crippling taxes ran into millions
of dollars and affected not only the business community but the
fisc as well.
</P>
<P>
He noted that conflict resolution should be discussed at the
table, not the streets.
</P>
<P>
"If we want Zimbabwe to be a winning nation we must talk with
each other and not to each other," Meyer said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Current Account Trade Deficit Shoots Up in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. current account
deficit shot up 11.4 percent to 42.2 billion U.S. dollars in the
third quarter of this year as Japanese investors sharply retreated
from their purchases of U.S. Treasury securities.
</P>
<P>
The deficit under the current account, the broadest measure of
U.S. foreign trade, rose from a seasonally adjusted 37.9 billion
dollars in the second quarter to 42.2 billion dollars in the
third, the Commerce Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
This was the highest level in a year. The shortfall for 1997
was mounting at an annual rate of 160 billion dollars as compared
with an actual deficit of 148.2 billion dollars in 1996. If
realized, 1997 would mark the worst current account trade
performance in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The current account includes not only trade in goods and
services but also investment flows between countries and foreign
aid.
</P>
<P>
The deterioration in the deficit partly reflects a currency
crisis that began in Thailand this Summer and spread to other
countries in the region this Fall. Sharp currency devaluations
have curtailed Asians' purchasing power and that's hurt U.S.
exports. Meanwhile, Asian nations have pushed to increase their
exports.
</P>
<P>
During the third quarter, the U.S. department reported a two
percent increase to 21.9 billion dollars in its surplus in
services such as tourism and consulting fees.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth was not enough to compensate for a 9.4
percent rise to 51.5 billion dollars in the deficit for goods and
a 2.3 percent increase, to 3.3 billion dollars, in the outflow of
investment income to foreign holders of U.S. assets. Besides, the
category that includes foreign aid rose 5.9 percent to 9.2 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The department said the big drop in Japanese purchases of
Treasury securities was mostly offset by an increase in European
purchases.

Such work will lead to an expanded knowledge base and a wider
dissemination of development lessons and skills, all of which is
vital for the future development of the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jesus Estanislao, former Philippine finance secretary and the
first dean of the institute, said in his message that the
institute will help ADB's developing member states identify
development strategies suited to their particular conditions, and
facilitate the practical applications of these strategies through
applied research and training.

<HEADLINE> Iran: Thaw in Tehran-Cairo Ties Crucial to Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said here Wednesday that resuming and broadening amicable
ties between Tehran and Cairo can be a prelude to new developments
in the Middle East and in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa on the fringe of the ongoing Islamic summit.
</P>
<P>
Iran cut off its relations with Egypt after it signed peace
accord with Israel under the brokerage of the United States in
1979. Represented only by interest sections in each other's
capital, the two have yet to recover full diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
In a conciliatory tone, Khatami said Tehran highly respects
Cairo, adding political disagreements are nothing but natural and
should not affect the historical and cultural common bonds
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Civilized people agree on disagreements," Khatami said, adding
the two sides should settle their disputes rationally.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite disagreement over the Middle East peace
process, Iran has never tried to impose its views on any country
or individual.
</P>
<P>
However, most neighboring Arab countries saw Iran as a threat
to their security in the 1980s for its advocacy of exporting
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said Iran opposes the peace process as the trend of
affairs has proven that it is highly unlikely for anyone to come
to terms with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He lauded the recent Egyptian stance -- which has become more
and more critical of Israeli government's hardline policies
blamed for the stalemate in the peace-making.
</P>
<P>
The president called the Egyptian people as brothers and
expressed the hope that Iran and Egypt act as two pivots for
peace, progress and development in the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
As the first Egyptian foreign minister to visit Iran in nearly
two decades, Moussa conveyed President Hosni Mubarak's
congratulations to Khatami on his election as president.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak himself refrained from turning up at the three-day
summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) which
opened Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing their long-standing cultural and historical common
bonds, Moussa said his country always regards Iran as a very
great and important country in the region whose determining role
cannot be ignored.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt has long desired to have close and amicable
ties with Iran.

<HEADLINE> EU Official Welcomes Call for Aerospace Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU)
official Wednesday welcomed the call for a restructuring of
Europe's defense and aerospace sectors by Europe's three leading
aerospace-manufacturing countries.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
issued an urgent appeal Tuesday to consolidate the industry into a
combined civil-defense company to compete on a world-wide scale with
its American rivals.
</P>
<P>
Martin Bangemann, EU commissioner in charge of industry,
said he was satisfied with the statement.
</P>
<P>
He said, "this initiative is a concrete step in the direction"
outlined by the EU's executive body, the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the three key EU member countries proposed expanding
the European Airbus consortium into an integrated company that
would also produce fighter jets, helicopters and missiles.
</P>
<P>
They also asked for a detailed timetable and a clear plan for
the consolidation to be presented in less than four months.
</P>
<P>
Bangemann said the EU executive would take necessary measures
at the European level in order to facilitate such structuring.
</P>
<P>
He also welcomed the involvement of other companies and other
European nations in the expansion.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus consortium, which groups the civilian aircraft
industries of France, Germany, Britain and Spain, has over 30
percent of the world market for civilian jets with more than 100
seats, and wants to increase that share to 50 percent.

Brussels to further reach other cities in northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Under a current plan, along the extended route will be Antwerp

<HEADLINE> WHO: Seven Million Doses of Vaccine Available to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- There are seven million doses
of meningococcal meningitis vaccine, plus an equal number of
autodestruct syringes, stockpiled and available to combat
meningitis in the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
Funding mechanisms are also in place to allow countries, which
may experience shortfalls in their own vaccine stocks during the
upcoming meningitis season, to have quick access to the ICG
stockpile and at a preferential price, according to a press
release issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ICG, the International Coordination Group, had a two-day
meeting at WHO headquarters in Geneva on December 8-9.
</P>
<P>
The ICG was set up in 1997 for meningitis control in Africa by
WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund, the Federation of the
International Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Medecins Sans
Frontieres, as well as international nongovernmental
organizations, technical partners from WHO Collaborating Centers
and manufacturers of meningitis vaccine and autodestruct syringes.
</P>
<P>
The meningitis season normally runs from approximately December
to April and in the 1996 season, which ended in April 1996, there
was a record 150,000 cases of meningitis reported in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meningitis epidemics occur in irregular cycles lasting a number
of years and therefore, the ICG confirmed, the same African
countries which have suffered over the past two years, as well as
neighboring countries, may experience large outbreaks again this
year.
</P>
<P>
The five countries to which the ICG made emergency supplies
available during the 1997 season were Burkina Faso, Gambia, Ghana,
Mali and Togo.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Minister Shocked at Jewish Gold Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit
Zalm was shocked at a reported 1968 private sale to civil servants
in his ministry of valuables belonging to deported Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
De Groene Amsterdammer, a weekly, said the gold and silver
items, held in the safe of the Nazi-controlled Lippman &AMP; Rosenthal
Bank in Amsterdam, were offered at 1958 appraisal prices.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, it said, their purchasing rights were balloted.
</P>
<P>
In his response, Zalm said he could not believe this had ever
happened and would look into it.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed his disbelief in a letter to the lower
house of parliament, in which he was also responded to questions
about the plundering of Jewish citizens by soldiers of Nazi
Germany.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Shooting Suspect Takes Children Hostage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A shooting suspect broke
into a house in a chase by police and took two small children
hostage Tuesday in downtown Orlando, Florida, local media
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
John Edward Armstrong was suspected of shooting a man to death
earlier Tuesday in nearby Winter Park, north of Orlando. He
broke into the house after his car rammed another car while
fleeing police.
</P>
<P>
The career criminal, who was released early from armed robbery
charges in March, took the children, a 4-year-old and 2-year-old
girl, hostage but released two women when he got into the house.
</P>
<P>
Police have decided against using tear gas to force the
39-year-old Armstrong out of the residence for fear of harming the
children.
</P>
<P>
Hostage negotiators and Armstrong's family asked him to free
the children, but he has shown no indication that he is willing to
let them go.
</P>
<P>
Residents closest to the hostage scene were evacuated from
their homes and the area remained condoned off this morning.

<HEADLINE> France on Frontline Fighting Greenhouse Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said today that France is on the frontline in controlling
greenhouse gas emission and is the locomotive of Europe in its
campaign for reduction of such gases at the Kyoto conference.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that with its nuclear electric power centers and
its policy emphasizing the saving of energy, France has set an
example in the control of greenhouse gases, which are blamed for
destroying the ozone layer of the earth and causing global
warming.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on the nuclear energy policy of France at
the National Assembly, or parliament, the minister said that among
developed countries, France contributes the least to the emission
of greenhouse gases on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
This gives France credit at the Kyoto conference on controlling
the emission of such gases and helps it defend the position of
Europe for cutting by 15 percent greenhouse gas emission by all
countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kyoto, Japan, said that the 140 countries
attending the conference are approaching an agreement to reduce by
6-9 percent the emission of greenhouse gases, as the United States
is yielding to the pressure from European Union countries.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Saudi Mediation Between Iran, US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Foreign
Minister Javad Zarif today denied any mediation efforts by Saudi
Arabia between Iran and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the venue of the summit of the
Organization of Islamic Conference here, Zarif said there has been
no discussion between Iran and Saudi Arabia over the kingdom's
offer to mediate between Iran and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
He made the denial after Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz has been quoted by media reports as saying that if
asked by the U.S., Saudi Arabia is willing to mediate between Iran
and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The Saudi prince is here to attend the three-day Islamic summit
which opened Tuesday. He also held talks with Iran's supreme
leader Ali Khamenei Tuesday night, during which the two sides
expressed willingness to iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
The moves are believed to reflect the improvement of relations
between the two Gulf giants, which have been at odds on a series
of issues since the Iranian Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
They have severe disputes over Iran's incitement of revolution
in the kingdom after the Islamic Revolution, Saudi support for
Iraq during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, and Saudi support for
U.S. military presence in the Gulf region.

<HEADLINE> WFP Starts to Assist Flood-Hit Kenyans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program
(WFP) today started airlifting urgently needed food and other
items to almost 300,000 people in Kenya's worst flood-hit areas,
said a WFP report issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The WFP operation is expected to last one month with a total
of 1,000 tons of relief cargo including bulk foods, blankets,
drugs, plastic sheeting, seeds, cooking sets and kerosene to be
delivered to flood victims in eastern and coastal Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which will cost 7.2 million U.S. Dollars, is a
direct response to an appeal from the Kenyan government late last
month to help ease the devastating flood situation in the region
where people have been cut off from their regular sources of
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Even if the rains cease now, it will be until early January
that road communication can be restored there and Wajir and parts
of Tana River District, the worst flood-destroyed areas, are
likely to be isolated for longer time, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Extraordinary heavy rains caused by the El Nino weather
pattern have halted agricultural recovery in a majority parts of
Kenya from the previous drought brought about by the failure of
two rainy seasons in the country in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, household and commercial food stocks have
reportedly almost run out and prices for the remaining available
commodities are skyrocketing especially in the flood-affected
areas.
</P>
<P>
"Reports indicate that in a number of areas such as southern
Wajir and Garsen division of Tana River district, the situation
has if anything deteriorated since the time of the government
appeal," said Mike Sackett, the Country Director of Kenya.

<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook held talks here this afternoon with Richard Butler, Chairman
of the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) on Iraq to exchange views on
the arms inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after the meeting, Cook
described the work of the UNSCOM in Iraq as a "vital job" and he
urged the Iraqi government to honor all UN resolutions concerned.
</P>
<P>
Cook stressed that Britain's Labor government is fully
committed to support the work of the UN arms inspection team in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Butler said that he would hold talks with Iraqi government
officials later this week over gaining access to all sites in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Butler noted that there was no question of Iraq being allowed
to ban the UN arms inspection team from investigating sites which
Baghdad considered to be sensitive.
</P>
<P>
"We can't work that way. We'll be talking about getting access
in a way which shows respect for Iraqi security," he added.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Nigerian Economy Needs More Than </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Various statistics show that
the Nigerian government has made further headway in 1997 in its
four-year-old efforts to bring order and stability into the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate, which stood at more than 100
percent in 1993 and 28 percent in 1996, has dropped to 13.7
percent by the end of August this year, which is two percent
lower than the government's 15.5 percent target for 1997.
</P>
<P>
In his November 17 national broadcast marking his four years
in power, the head of state, General Sani Abacha announced that
the latest inflation rate is now 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have attributed the sliding inflation rate to the
government's tight fiscal policy. The 70 billion Naira (about 886
million U.S. Dollars) budgetary deficit of 1994 had been replaced
by a surplus of 37 billion Naira (468 million Dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
For an economy which depends heavily on crude oil export for
revenue-generating and imports most consumer goods, the stability
of the currency is certainly important to the macro-economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
The government has also done well in this aspect, thanks to
the establishment in 1995 of the Autonomous Foreign Exchange
Market, at which the U.S. Dollar is sold to commercial banks
through auctions.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the first 10 months of the year, the exchange rate
of Naira against dollar had been moving between 80 to 85 Naira to
one Dollar, though the Naira appreciated under pressure to 79
Naira against one Dollar in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the external sector is equally encouraging.
The country's foreign reserves, which kept growing in the last
two years, shot up to eight billion Dollars by September,
according to the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the government expects an economic growth rate of
about four percent in 1997, which, though lower than the set goal
of five percent, is the highest in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
While the government's success in stabilizing the economy
received general recognition, almost all the people agreed that
the Nigerian economy now faces another menace. It is now in a
serious stagnation.
</P>
<P>
The manufacture industry is perhaps the most miserable sector
of the economy. A mid-year report of the Manufacturers
Association of Nigeria (MAN) said the sector's unsold inventory
swelled to 4.6 billion Naira (58 million Dollars) by the end of
June, 13.7 percent up from the level at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, the sector's capacity utilization declined
33.9 percent to an alarming 29.4 percent. As a result, about
12,000 jobs were lost in the sector.
</P>
<P>
MAN has repeatedly blamed its misfortune on the worsening
business environment: the population's poor purchasing power, the
increasing frequency of power failure, the shortage of petroleum
products and many more others.
</P>
<P>
MAN was right in pointing out the problems. But the other
sectors were having their own share of bad lucks.
</P>
<P>
The power sector has been suffering from acute shortage of
funds to repair its aging systems. Its operator, the National
Electric Power Authority (NEPA) has warned repeatedly of an
imminent nationwide blackout.
</P>
<P>
NEPA's thirst for fund was a joint product of underfunding by
the government and serious indebtedness to it by consumers.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that consumers nationwide now owe NEPA as much
as 15 billion Naira (190 million Dollars), so high that the
federal government had to set up a task force in October to help
recover the debt.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Nigerian Economy Needs More Than </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The oil industry, which
generated 98.2 percent of the country's export income in 1996,
suffered a loss as well in 1997.
</P>
<P>
While the sector's cash demand was put at 3.5 billion Dollars,
the government allocated only two billion Dollars in the budget,
though another one billion was agreed upon later after
negotiations between the government and the oil sector.
</P>
<P>
To make it worse, the government insisted that the Nigeria
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) must account for its
spending in 1996 before fresh fund is released. As the NNPC
failed to do so, the release was much delayed.
</P>
<P>
This has forced NNPC's foreign partners, which produce the
majority of the country's crude oil, to scale down their
production and in some cases, exploration schemes were cancelled.
Analysts have warned that this will have an adverse effect on
Nigeria's long-term oil strategy.
</P>
<P>
An immediate victim of this policy is the country's aging
refineries, which have been due for major repairs for years.
</P>
<P>
When it was clear that the refineries could no longer meet the
nation's needs for fuel and that fuel shortage was developing
into a nation crisis, the government ordered fuel import in June.
It is expected that Nigeria, one of the largest oil producers in
the world, will continue importing fuel in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under all these misfortunes, many common Nigerians have
complained of little improvement in their living standard. Though
prices are increasing at slow pace, many basic goods are still
beyond their reach. There is no power, no petrol and no traffic.
The government's figures of economic improvement appears
suspicious to them.
</P>
<P>
To improve the funding and management of the country's many
infrastructure departments, the government has taken some steps
to liberalize them.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization of the telecommunications sector, which
began in 1995, saw a major breakthrough in October 1997, with the
signing of a network interconnection agreement between the
Nigeria Telecommunications (NITEL) and the private Multi-Links,
ending NITEL's decades of monopoly in wired telephone service.
</P>
<P>
Rescue is also coming to the country's ailing refineries, with
reports that talks were on to sell some major refineries to Shell
and other multi-national oil companies.
</P>
<P>
Some groups, however, have criticized the government of being
too slow on the road to liberalization. They want the government
to open the power sector to private businesses and merge the
official exchange rate of 22 Naira to one dollar to the
Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market, among other things.
</P>
<P>
This, of course, has been resisted by the government, which
prefers a more prudent approach because of its political
fragility as military government is set to quit from the scene in
less than one year's time.
</P>
<P>
General Sani Abacha did promise in his November 17 national
broadcast to give Nigerians a more reliable power supply and to
boost their purchasing power in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The government seems to have realized that any economic
achievements will be pale and unconvincing if the true purchasing
power of the people remains unimproved.
</P>
<P>
The biggest concern at the moment, however, is how the Abacha
administration's economic feat will survive the political
uncertainties expected in 1998, as the transition to civil rule
program reaches its final stage. Faster growth in 1998 is out of
the question.

<HEADLINE> UK'S Moves on Regulation, Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) - Britain is to take moves to
improve co-ordination of regulatory activity in the period before
formal creation of a single financial services regulator and about
Millennium Risk.
</P>
<P>
Speaking today about the FSA's (Financial Services Authority)
developing agenda at a Regulation Conference, its Chairman Howard
Davies said: "We will take every opportunity we can to improve the
co-ordination of regulatory activity."
</P>
<P>
He said that means working towards a single approach on
responsibilities of senior management, co-ordinating FSA's
assessments of the challenges posed to financial institutions by
EMU and promoting regulatory action on Millennium risk.
</P>
<P>
The Year 2000 is an important business issue for financial
firms and markets. They all wish, in their own interests, to
maintain continuity and quality of service for their customers.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman said, but the Year 2000 is also a regulatory
issue. It has implications for investor protection, for the
prudential health of businesses, for market integrity and for
investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
"This is because an institution's failure to prepare for the
Millennium could leave investors or depositors unable to access
their money and asset, or degradation of customer records and
even, in the extreme, business collapse," he warned.
</P>
<P>
For regulators, just as for firms, "prevention" is far better
than "cure", Davies argued, saying "every financial firm should
have completed its remedial action and tested its systems by the
end of 1998".

<HEADLINE> Conference on Comoros Crisis Opens in Addis Ababa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
today appealed to concerned parties of the Comoros to "put the
interest of the country above all else".
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Salim at the opening session of a
four-day international conference on Comoros here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being attended by various delegations
representing the Comoroian government, different political forces
and islands, including islands of Anjouan, Moheli and Grand
Comoro.
</P>
<P>
Salim pointed out that this conference is aimed at assisting
in resolving the current crisis and creating conditions for
tackling the real crisis facing the islands.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the issue of poverty and underdevelopment is
seriously addressed, the islands will continue to be faced with
instability," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Being cognizant of this reality, the OAU, working in tandem
with the League of Arab States, the European Union, the United
Nations and others is determined to mobilize international
support and assistance for socio-economic development of the
Comoros with particular focus that such assistnace should benefit
all the islands, Salim said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We must urgently overcome the current crisis,
create an enabling environment for understanding and cooperation
among the islanders which is essential for the return of peace
and stability."
</P>
<P>
Salim mentioned two fundamental factors in their
consulations, that are "the legitimate concerns and interests of
all the islands" and "the need to preserve the unity and
territorial integrity of the country".
</P>
<P>
This is important not only for the Comoros but for the
continent as a whole, Salim stressed.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the Comorian delegations to "put national
consideration at the top of the agenda" and to reach greater
understanding#,greater cohesion and greater solidarity among the
people of the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
The opening session presided by Salim was attended by
observers from the League of Arab States, the United Nations, the
Organization of Islamic Conference, the European Union, the
neighboring countries of the Comoros, the Central Organ of the
OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution,
the permanent members of the UN Secutriy Council and others.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: West Africa Gears up to Promote Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The development of energy
supply in west Africa is expected to get a boost soon with the
completion of two multi-billion-U.S.-Dollar projects in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
A hydroelectric power supply network is underway to connect
Senegal, Mali and Mauritania, while preparations are being made
to lay pipeline from Nigeria to Ghana, Benin and Togo for natural
gas transportation.
</P>
<P>
The hydropower project, estimated to cost a total of some 1.25
billion Dollars, involves the construction of three electric
carrier line interconnecting the three countries.
</P>
<P>
It will have its source from the Manatali Hydroelectric Dam in
Mali which is now being developed to produce 800 gwh per year.
Senegal is expected to consume 33 percent of this output, with
Mali and Mauritania sharing 52 and 15 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the European Union (EU) and European
Investment Bank approved 40 billion CFA (about 70 million
Dollars) to be injected by Europe for the implementation of the
project.
</P>
<P>
The three countries has set up a body known as Organization
for the Development of River Senegal for the construction of the
project.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a multinational company has been established to
oversee the execution of the 315-million-Dollar west African gas
pipeline project.
</P>
<P>
When completed, the rich natural gas resources in Nigeria will
be transported to its neighbors to meet their energy demands.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the World Bank-backed gas project, the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has conducted a study
to identify the renewable energy requirement of its 16 member
countries in the area of solar, biomass and wind energy.
</P>
<P>
According to ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate, work
is progressing on the preparation of a solar and energy map which
will highlight solar and wind energy potential in each country,
region and area.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS member states also target at establishing a
sub-regional electricity grid for providing energy for countries
which have no hydropower stations and no petroleum resources,
Kouyate said.
</P>
<P>
A protocol on the project has been signed by leaders of member
countries.
</P>
<P>
When the ambition is realized, west African countries will
have a radical improvement in energy supply, therefore
accelerating the economic development in the sub-region.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Leaving Summit, Not Due to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic summit Spokesman
Javad Zarif said today that Turkish President Suleyman Demirel is
leaving here ahead of schedule, but not due to displeasure at the
criticism of his country's close ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Zarif, who is also Iran's deputy foreign minister, said that
Demirel's early departure "can be due to some other engagements
rather than the reported unhappiness of Turkey over some of the
resolutions."
</P>
<P>
Turkey is under pressure during sessions of the three-day
Eighth Summit of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC),
which is to be concluded Thursday, for its close relations with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the 55 OIC members are attending the three-day
conference during which they described Israel as the "Zionist
regime," "usurper of Arab lands" and "occupier of Qods"
(Jerusalem) which is holy to Muslims, calling for isolation of the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Turkey signed two military agreements with Israel last year,
provoking criticism by Muslim countries especially Arab nations
who regard the cooperation as a threat to them.
</P>
<P>
However, the Turkish leader today told Iranian reporters that
differences within the Islamic world are a natural thing. He said,
"when one speaks of the Islamic world, he speaks of different
peoples with a variety of socio-economic conditions. Therefore, a
single definite and uniform solution can not be adapted for all of
them."

<HEADLINE> BA in Dogfight With Rival Lufthansa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) - British Airways (BA) has taken
rival Lufthansa to the European Commission over an alleged "dirty
tricks" campaign.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the EU's free trade commissioner in Brussels,
Karel Van Miert, BA's German arm accused Lufthansa of subsidizing
price-cutting on internal German routes in order to drive the
British airline out of the skies over Germany.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche BA operates services on eight of the busiest 10
internal German routes and is second to Lufthansa in Germany, with
14 percent of the domestic flights market.
</P>
<P>
It contends Lufthansa's tactics of sustaining losses to secure
a monopoly in the internal market violate the Treaty of Rome and
European single market rules.
</P>
<P>
"Lufthansa's price-setting strategy is very selective and
systematic," the BA letter alleged.
</P>
<P>
"Selective, because Lufthansa does not change its prices on the
routes it operates without competition, Systematic, because
Lufthansa copies the slightest price readjustment by Deutsche BA,"
it added.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's ANC Releases Nomination List for Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) today released its nomination
list for top posts to be contested at next week's national
conference, the South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
ANC Deputy President Thabo Mbeki is set to succeed President
Nelson Mandela as party chief, and National Union of Mineworkers
General Secretary Kgalema Motlanthe is the sole nominee for ANC
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
No nominations from the floor are allowed for the two posts.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing National Chairman Jacob Zuma has been nominated for
the post of deputy president by all nine ANC provincial
structures, although he may be challenged by Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela if she is nominated from the floor.
</P>
<P>
The national chairman's post will be contested by Patrick
Lekota and Steve Tshwete, while Mendi Msinmang and Popo Molefe
will vie for treasurer-general, the ANC Nominations Committee
said.
</P>
<P>
The only two women nominated by the ANC's nine provinces for
the top executive positions, Thenjiwe Mtintso and Mavivi
Myakayaka-Manzini, will contest the deputy secretary-general's
post.
</P>
<P>
Nominations Committee coordinator Charles Nqakulu told a press
briefing that under ANC constitution, only provinces had the
right to nominate candidates for ANC's National Executive
Committee.
</P>
<P>
However, a delegate to the conference had the right to
nominate any person whose name had not been proposed by the
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Certain constitutional amendments were being proposed to
govern nominations from the floor, Nqakulu said.
</P>
<P>
The ANC constitution currently allows for such a nomination to
be supported by a show of hands of 10 percent of voting
delegates. The proposed amendment will push the percentage to
either 25 or 30 percent. The nomination vote process might also
change from a show of hands to endorsement in writing.
</P>
<P>
The process of nominations from the floor may be crucial for
Madikizela-Mandela's bid for the deputy presidency, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
If an endorsement is by a show of hands, delegates might be
reluctant to show support for Madikizela-Mandela in front of the
national leadership, while having their support preserved in
writing may also put some delegates off.
</P>
<P>
The reputation of Madikizela-Mandela, former wife of Mandela,
was marred to some extent as she was implicated in 18 cases of
human rights violations at a nine-day hearing on the role of the
so-called Mandela United Football Club, her former bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
Provinces had also submitted names of nominees for the 60
directly elected positions on the policy-making National
Executive Committee, Nqakulu said.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Expresses Determination to Reduce Reliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa said today his country will strive to reduce
reliance on donors and further economic and political reforms.
</P>
<P>
Opening a three-day Consultative Group Meeting (CGM) for
Tanzania and its donors at the Sheraton Hotel here, Mkapa said
that Tanzania will make efforts to achieve self-reliance through
self-development.
</P>
<P>
However, development of the country is hindered by the burden
of external debt, which had reached as high as 8.1 billion US
Dollars by the end of October.
</P>
<P>
The president last Saturday appealed for debt relief to
Tanzania, saying the country's debt was unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is spending 37 percent of its revenue
on debt repayment, a burden that fails to finance important
social services like education and health adequately.
</P>
<P>
While appealing for debt relief, the president assured
participants at the CGM today that Tanzania will press ahead with
economic and political reforms simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made in reforming finance, social services and
other sectors, pushing privatization process and combating
corruption, he added.
</P>
<P>
CGM is a forum at which major donor countries and multilateral
institutions collectively meet individual developing countries to
review donor-funded projects and agree on future terms on
co-operation. The meetings are normally held in Paris, but is
being held in Tanzania for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa expressed thanks to international donors which have been
supporting the country for so long since the independence of the
country in 1961.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania scores good marks on macro-economic performance with
inflation declining to 15.8 percent from 25.1 percent in January
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's success to curbing inflation despite adverse
weather conditions experienced during the last quarter of 1996
and early this year, is attributed to cash-management budget and
tight fiscal discipline.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats told the press that cash-management budget and
fiscal discipline are likely to draw sympathetic response for
appeals for debt relief.
</P>
<P>
Donor countries attending the meeting include Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland,
France, Ireland, Japan, Kuwait, the Netherlands, Norway, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reiterates Stance on Exporting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir
Mohammed Rashid today reiterated Iraq's stance that it will not
start exporting oil unless an agreement on a new food distribution
plan is approved by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in the northern Iraqi province of
al-Tameen on the occasion of first anniversary of Iraq's
resumption of oil exports, Rasheed said Iraq is capable of meeting
all future world need for crude, whether in accordance with the
oil-for-food deal or not.
</P>
<P>
His remarks indicate that Iraq has not changed its stance on
this issue. Some recent reports said Iraq has agreed to cooperate
with the U.N. Security Council to extend the deal for another
period of six months.
</P>
<P>
A Security Council resolution adopted in 1995 allows the
sanctions-ridden Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil
over every six months and to buy food and medicines. It was put
into effect a year ago and the third phase was supposed to start
last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq stopped exporting its oil last Friday, saying that it will
not export any more fuel until the United Nations approves a new
plan for distributing food bought with oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
In the following months, Iraq will be able to produce and
export 2.5 million barrels per day, said Rashid.
</P>
<P>
The oil minister stressed that the total amounts of food and
medicines Iraq has received so far do not exceed 55 percent of the
contracts signed under the first phase of the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
He said that many contracts are still being held up by the
U.N. Sanctions Committee, including 14 percent of medicine
contracts, 20 percent of electricity contracts and others in the
field of education, agriculture, water and sewage in addition to
contracts for the purchase of spare parts for the Iraqi-Turkish
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
He accused the United States of continuing obstructing all
contracts concluded within the first and second phases of the
deal, with the aim of maintaining the sufferings of the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
The crippling economic sanctions were imposed by the United
Nations in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> UK Royal Yacht Britannia to Be Permanently Preserved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary
George Robertson announced here today that Britain's Royal Yacht
Britannia is to be permanently preserved as a corporate
hospitality center or a tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a written answer to the parliament, Robertson said:
"I have decided that Britannia should be preserved for the wider
public benefit."
</P>
<P>
After Britannia's final voyage to Hong Kong for the handover
ceremony in June, it is widely debated that the Royal Yacht would
either be scrapped or preserved as a heritage legacy.
</P>
<P>
Robertson noted that it would be wrong to scrap the Royal
vessel, which "has a special place in the people's affections".
</P>
<P>
The Defense Secretary said that the Ministry of Defense had
considered several imaginative ideas for its future and had now
narrowed the choice down to two.
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposal, Britannia could either be used for a
corporate hospitality center on Edinburgh's Firth of Forth
waterfront or become the centerpiece of heritage site near
Manchester.

<HEADLINE> 2 Drug Traffickers Seized in Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Police have arrested
two Zanzibar residents and impounded 1.5 kilograms of heroin
(worth about 24,000 US dollars) imported from Bombay of India, an
official in charge of the Anti-Drug Unit told reporters today.
</P>
<P>
Esaka Mugasa said here that the two suspects were nabbed by
the Anti-Narcotics Unit (ANU) at Zanzibar International Airport
on Tuesday, with the contraband sealed in lady's slippers which
were carried as gifts for relatives.
</P>
<P>
He said the alleged traffickers were caught as they were
disembarking from Gulf Air No. GF 711/09. The first one,
Abdulrahmani Sheikh Rajabu, 34, was seized with one kilogram of
heroin sealed in five lady's slippers.
</P>
<P>
Mugasa named the second alleged suspect as Hamisi Abubakar
Machano, 27, who was nabbed with 500 grams of heroin sealed in
two lady's slippers.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were from Bombay via Muscat to the Zanzibar
isles, Mugasa noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the two will appear before the
court soon.
</P>
<P>
Last May, a Dar es Salaam resident, Salum Mbwana, 25, was
booked at the same airport. He was found to have swallowed 250
grams of the same drug worth 2.5 million Shillings (about 4,000
US Dollars). Mbwana was nabbed as he was disembarking from Gulf
Air from Bombay through Muscat.
</P>
<P>
The Anti-drug Unit chief has given warnings to drug
traffickers that it is in vain to adopt the mushrooming practice
of sealing the drugs in lady's slippers and other newly
formulated methods.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges Islamic Help to Save Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat today appealed to Islamic leaders for
united efforts to save the Holy Qods (Jerusalem) from being
judaized.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Islamic summit today, Arafat, who looked tired,
urged Muslims around the world to "rise to the level of the great
responsibility" when the Mideast peace process is facing acute
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here Monday to attend the eighth summit of the
Organization of Islamic Conference, which lasts from Tuesday to
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that we could overcome our differences and unite our
work faithfully to save the Holy Qods" from plots to "eliminate
its Arab and Islamic identity and jeopardize its civilization,
historical and heritage features and noble spiritual and religious
status," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Israel's construction of Jewish settlements
in the traditionally Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel have been
deadlocked due to Israel's retreat from the peace agreements
signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that Israel has decided to build more settlements
in an attempt to isolate Jerusalem from its Palestinian
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
It also plans to construct the "temple of Solomon, to replace
Al Aqsa Mosque after its demolishing," he warned.
</P>
<P>
He urged Islamic leaders to "act quickly and sincerely to
rescue it and to defeat that Israeli plan" and show solidarity
with the city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Peace can not be realized unless the occupied Holy Qods
returns to its legitimate owners as the capital of the
independent Palestinian State," he emphasized.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Praises UNHCR Efforts in Assisting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- OAU secretary general
Salim Ahmed Salim today spoke highly of the efforts made by
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in
assisting African refugees.
</P>
<P>
Salim expressed his appreciation during his meeting with
Sergio de Mello, U.N. assistant high commissioner for refugees,
who is currently visiting Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU), Salim and de Mello exchanged views on humanitarian
issues in the Great Lakes region and on the flood situation in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief also expressed satisfaction over the cooperation
between the pan-African grouping and the UNHCR which has
facilitated action on addressing the concerns of the governments
in the region and the refugees themselves.
</P>
<P>
The two stressed in particular the need to avoid the
increasing tendency toward compassion fatigue which has eroded
much of the well known African condition of caring for refugees,
the press release said.
</P>
<P>
As a reflection of OAU's concern over the recent flood
disaster in Somalia, Salim handed de Mello a check for 50,000
U.S. Dollars on behalf of the OAU as a token gesture to assist
those affected by floods in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
De Mello promised that the donation would be used for an
emergency package consisting of items such as medicine, food and

<HEADLINE> Jordan Expels 7 Iraqi Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today expelled seven
Iraqi diplomats after the Iraqi authorities executed four young
Jordanians Monday on charge of smuggling auto spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister Jawad Anani this noon summoned
Iraqi Ambassador Nouri Elwayess and told him to decrease the
number of the embassy staff from 15 to eight, Jordan's official
news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
The seven Iraqi diplomats have to leave Amman in a week,
according to Petra.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan has recalled its charge d'affaires in
Baghdad Adel Sweidan back home in order to listen to his report on
the execution, said Petra.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Acting Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour said today that
Iraq did not inform Jordan on the trial of the four Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
The execution came as a "sudden" news to Jordan as the kingdom
is rallying behind Baghdad for lifting of the U.N. sanctions on
Iraq imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Ensour was quoted
by Petra as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government will adopt more actions later at proper times,
said Ensour, insisting that the mere issuance of official
statements condemning the execution is far from enough to explain
the embarrassed situation of the government.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the House of Representatives Saad Hail El-Sorour
 today told Petra that the execution is short of legal evidence
and violates the principle of good neighborliness and Arab
fraternity.
</P>
<P>
Jordan used to adopt a way of negotiation with other Arab
countries, including Iraq, when it came to legal issues, said
Sorour.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Iraq's action is wierd and surprising, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian senate and government have also issued official
statements to condemn the execution.
</P>
<P>
The government statement on Tuesday said that Iraq did not
answer Jordanian officials' efforts to enlist information about
the nature of the charge. Jordanian officials failed to dissuade
the Iraqi authority from carrying out the "unjust" decision to
execute the Jordanians, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement insisted that the Jordanian should only be
punished with fine or prison term even if the charge proved to be
true.
</P>
<P>
The statement from the Senate today said that the execution
contradicted with the principles of good neighborliness and Arab
fraternity.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has not reacted to Jordan's condemnation.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Iraq used to be firm allies before and during the
1990-91 Gulf Crisis. But after that, the bilateral ties suffered a
setback as Jordan distanced itself away from Iraq to end
international alienation.
</P>
<P>
However, the ties have been picking up in recent years as Iraq
began to provide the kingdom with more oil at discount prices and
kept increasing the volume of imports from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is a main supplier of humanitarian goods for Baghdad
under the U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food deal signed in May last
year.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Foreign Minister Appreciates Islamic Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf expressed his country's appreciation of the
ongoing Islamic summit here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on the second day of the three-day eighth
summit of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), Sahhaf
said the summit is taking a step forward in strengthening the OIC
and refocusing attention on the basic and strategic causes of the
Islamic nations.
</P>
<P>
On the draft resolutions on Iraq due to be discussed at the
summit, he said some drafts call on the Arab and Islamic states to
help relieve the hardships of the Iraqis caused by the sanctions
imposed by the United Nations in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He said another draft emphasizes the respect of Iraq's
sovereignty, integrity and security, which is a strong reference
to Ankara's military operations against Turkey's outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf is a member of the Iraqi delegation led by Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan to the OIC summit. This is Iraq's
first high level delegation to visit Iran since the war between
the two countries from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
On Iraqi ties with Iran, Sahhaf said that practical steps have
been taken to help ease the tensions in the bilateral relations
and further resolve the existing thorny problems.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Iran have held talks on exchanging prisoners of war
and some other issues and achieved a little progress. But their
positions on the problem still keep far apart. They accuse each
other of holding far more POWs than believed.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, stressed today that
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights must be given practical
effect.
</P>
<P>
In her massage to the occasion of the Human Rights Day,
December 10, Robinson said Human Rights Day should be a time to
reaffirm our commitment to work for change and to demonstrate that
the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights are not theoretical or abstract.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that this must be given practical effect with the
results measured by the improved well-being of individuals around
the world.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner said this Human Rights Day begins the
year-long review of the Vienna Declaration and Program of
Action, a time when the United Nations system and all governments
seriously assess their successes and short-comings in living up to
the solemn obligations made at the World conference on Human
Rights in 1993.
</P>
<P>
She said this year should be a year of discussion and debate on
the continuing relevance of international human rights standards
in the international system, in national administration and the
work of civil society.
</P>
<P>
Robinson encouraged purposeful debate on economic, social and
cultural rights and the right to development in ways which open up
better understanding on how these human rights can be implemented
in international and national programs.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Negotiators Meet to Discuss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli and Palestinian
peace negotiating teams held talks here today in an effort to
narrow their gap so to achieve progress in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two teams were headed respectively by Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy and deputy head of Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen).
</P>
<P>
The two leaders first held a half-hour private meeting before
holding enlarged talks joined by other senior negotiators and some
heads of the nine joint interim committees.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the joint news conference after the meeting, Levy
described the talks as being held "in a spirit of good-will and
mutual desire to see progress" in the peace process. "I want to
stress the desire that has been given and expressed by the
Palestinian side to find solutions to issues on our agenda," he
said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
Levy said the Israeli government is looking into various issues
concerning the peace process in order to "bring new impetus for
the peace process to create a different atmosphere and to
facilitate progress in all fields of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the sides are at an era when important
decisions should be made on many crucial issues. He was referring
to Israeli government's deliberations on the second troop
redeployment in the West Bank, guidelines on permanent talks,
time-out of settlements and the interim issues, such as opening
the Gaza airport, building a Gaza seaport and creating a safe
passage between Gaza Strip and West Bank.
</P>
<P>
On the second redeployment, Levy said the government will
convince the Knesset (Parliament) to approve the scope approved
by the cabinet. But he did not disclose when and what the cabinet
will come out with the second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Levy announced that the joint negotiating teams will continue
their intensive talks Thursday in a bid to solve the remaining
differences on the interim issues. "I have no doubt that the
mutual efforts we are investing will indeed bear fruits in the
near future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abbas said both sides have made necessary efforts to push
forward the peace process in the right direction. He added that
the two sides will work intensively in order to achieve results in
the talks at the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
Today's talks were held under the shadow of a heated dispute
between the two sides over the PNA's attempt to conduct census in
the disputed East Jerusalem. Contrary to the wide speculation,
Levy denied that they have discussed the dispute over census.
</P>
<P>
But Levy made it clear that Israel regards the PNA attempt as a
unilateral step in violation of signed peace agreements. He said
although similar census was conducted before the January 1996
Palestinian elections as agreed by the sides, this time the PNA
did not contact Israel on the matter.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Israeli government will prevent the PNA
from taking census in East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Georgia to Normalize Border Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 10 (Xinhua) -- After border post dispute with
Georgia, Russian border guards have resumed the examination of
vehicles leaving Georgia, a high ranking officer told reporters on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The commander of Russia's special Caucasian border guard
district, Lieutenant-General Yevgeny Bolkhovitin said "our border
guards acted tactfully and calmly" when a group of Georgian young
people tried to picket a Russian border guard post.
</P>
<P>
He said "the distance between border guards and picketers did
not close to less than three meters... Common sense prevailed".
</P>
<P>
At the same time Bolkhovitin stressed that "we have the right
to post border guards where we believe it necessary in order to
ensure the security of the state border.
</P>
<P>
Both Russia and Georgia have agreed to resume the work of
commissions in charge of delimiting the countries' common border.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian Foreign Ministry made a statement last Friday
saying that Georgia will discontinue working with the commissions
to protest the moving of a Russian border post in the vicinity of
the village Verkhny lars deeper towards Georgian territory, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit of Deputy Prime Minister Valery Serov to
Tbilisi on December 8-9, the two countries agreed that the post
would be returned to its former position in the Daryal Canyon in
Russia's North Ossetia.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also signed a protocol establishing the
return of border posts to the positions they occupied in July
1997.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Police Hold Four over Murder of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Liberian police have arrested
four men in connection with the murder of an opposition member of
parliament and three members of his family, the Justice Ministry
said today in Monrovia, the capital.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the four men were identified as
Isaac Whonnie, an aide-de-camp to President Charles Taylor, Moses
Jallah, who works for the Special Security Service (SSS) of the
executive mansion, and two civilians, Richmond Saydee and Kennedy
Fineboy.
</P>
<P>
"The culprits, irrespective of who they are, will be brought
to justice," said the minister, quoted by the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
</P>
<P>
SSS Director Colonel Benjamin Yeaten has been asked to help in
the investigation, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Samuel Dokie, a
prominent Liberian political figure, first disappeared and was
later confirmed arrested, but on December 2, he was founded dead.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said the charred corpses of
Dokie, his wife, sister and cousin, were found near the central
town of Gbarnga.
</P>
<P>
As investigation is still going on, the justice minister
warned the public against what he called premature judgement in
the murder case, saying, "no charges have been made."
</P>
<P>
A ministry statement also urged the Liberian press to stop
printing photographs of the corpses "to avoid prejudice".
</P>
<P>
After the minister finished reading the statement, reporters
were not allowed to ask questions, the BBC said, adding that
Taylor earlier pledged his government's commitment to equal
justice for all under the law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NAN reported that many Liberians living in the
United States were shocked by the killing of Dokie, which seemed
to have destroyed the confidence they reposed on the democratic
process in the country.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted some leaders of Liberian groups as saying
that the unfortunate development would make many Liberians who
intended going back to contribute to the post-war peace-building
effort to have a second thought about it.
</P>
<P>
Late Dokie was an ally of President Taylor at the beginning of
his rebellion against the government of Samuel Doe, which
triggered off the Liberian civil war in the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
However, he fell out with Taylor, the then leader of a major
warring faction, complaining that Taylor did not want the war to
end.
</P>
<P>
The murder of Dokie also aroused complaints from various human
rights groups. Women groups moaning the killing today in
Monrovia called the day "Black Wednesday".
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, Taylor has appointed his former
rival Alhaji Kromah to the position of chairman of the newly
constituted National Reconciliation Commission.
</P>
<P>
Kromah, who is currently in the Guinean capital of Conakry,
has not responded to the appointment in the public.

<HEADLINE> Iran Hails Sudan's Resistance to US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today hailed Sudan's steadfastness in the face of the
threats and plots of the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Resistance and steadfastness is the only way to confront
American pressure, said Khamenei when meeting with Sudanese
President Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that Sudan has won a prominent position in the
Islamic world by adopting this policy.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir is here to attend the eighth summit of the
Organization of Islamic Conference on December 9-11.
</P>
<P>
On Israeli presence in southern Sudan, Khameini said that this
would sabotage the peace and stability in the area and the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
There has been an allegation on Arab countries' newspapers that
Israelis are training rebel militants in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir briefed Khamenei on the current political and
economic situations in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Sudanese government and people are determined
to resist U.S. pressures and foil Israeli plots.
</P>
<P>
Bashir expressed the hope that the ongoing Islamic summit would
come up with fruitful results and promote unity of the Islamic
states in the future.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which accuses Sudan of supporting terrorism,
broadened sanctions against the country last November. It decided
to seize the assets of the Sudanese government in the U.S., block
partial trade with Sudan, and ban American investment in the
Africa's largest country.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Approves Plans on Border Guard Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The concept and overall idea
for developing the Federal Border Service (FPS) was approved today
by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Director of Service Andrei
Nikolayev told reporters.
</P>
<P>
While the service plans to discontinue certain kinds of heavy
weaponry such as armored vehicles and artillery systems of caliber
greater than 82 millimeters, it will simultaneously "improve its
arsenal," in particular by developing a light armored vehicle
which could be serviced at conventional service stations,
Nikolayev said.
</P>
<P>
The FPS is manned to 97 percent of its intended capacity, with
an officer corps of 27,000, according to the director.
</P>
<P>
The FPS is looking for other sources because of insufficient
financing, Nikolayev said. Yeltsin instructed the government and
the Finance Ministry to keep the FPS properly financed in 1998.
Nikolayev quoted Yeltsin as saying, "Everybody must attend to his
business, the Armed Forces to defense and the FPS to border
security."
</P>
<P>
On the border problem with Georgia, the director said that
Russia will not move. He emphasized that the strategic tunnels in
the Daryal Canyon, the gateway into the Caucasus, rather than
border posts are at stake.

<HEADLINE> Special Committee Urged to be Set Up to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany's opposition Social
Democrats (SPD) and the Greens party today proposed to establish a
special parliamentary committee to probe the latest scandal that a
convicted neo-Nazi had been invited to address officers at an
elite defense academy.
</P>
<P>
German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, whose resignation was
demanded by the SPD on Monday, also told the parliamentary defense
committee meeting today that there would be an investigation to
find out whether defense ministry officials were responsible for
the incident.
</P>
<P>
Manfred Roeder, 68, was invited in 1995 to speak at the Hamburg
Bundeswehr Leadership Academy. His subject was ethnic Germans who
populated Koenigsberg, the former capital of East Prussia, which
is now the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, located between Poland
and the Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
Roeder was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 1982 for racist
bombings against immigrants. He was released on probation in 1990,
with his activities monitored by the country's anti-extremist
watchdog agency.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe has punished two senior officers for their failure to
investigate Roeder's background. He has stressed that no evidence
can now show that those responsible for Roeder's appearance were
aware of his history.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe today also announced that an independent panel of experts
would be set up to scrutinize the general morale of the
Bundeswehr. The German armed forces have been hit by a series of
scandals involving extreme rightist activities.
</P>
<P>
According to the Defense Ministry recently, more than 80
incidents involving neo-Nazi behavior have been under
investigation in the past year, which range from the possession of
far-right praopaganda to drunken assaults against foreigners
living in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe has insisted that all these were isolated cases and did
not mean that rightist extremism was rampant within the army.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary defense committee was today also informed of
a newly-discovered video which, made in 1990, depicted soldiers
giving the banned Hitler salute.
</P>
<P>
A videotape found earlier this year showed soldiers staging
mock executions and rapes as well as giving the Hitler salute and
making anti-Semitic remarks.

<HEADLINE> US to Set Up Drug Court Institute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Barry McCaffrey, director
of the Office of National Drug Policy, has presented a 339,000
dollar initial grant to the National Association of Drug Court
Professionals to create a National Drug Court Institute to provide
training, research and education for 300 drug courts.
</P>
<P>
Judge Jeffery Tauber, association president, said about 75
percent of those who enroll in the drug court programs do not
return to criminal lives.
</P>
<P>
During the yuletide season, Tauber said prisoners released from
drug courts usually show their gratitude for the treatment that
has put their lives back together by writing "thank you" notes to
the judges.
</P>
<P>
The judge urged the government to offer alternatives to drug
addicts, rather than criminal terms.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said the establishment of the drug courts, "coupled
with their judicial leadership, constitutes one of the most
monumental positive changes in the U.S. justice system relating to
drug offenders since World War II."
</P>
<P>
The association was formed in 1994 with a mission to reduce
substance abuse, crime and recidivism by promoting the
establishment and funding of drug courts and distribution
information.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said drug courts provide an effective solution to
drug and drug-related crime through comprehensive supervision,
drug testing and treatment services.

<HEADLINE> S. African Farmers Call for State of Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A three-month state of
emergency should be declared in South Africa to enable the
security forces to crack down on criminals, south African farmers
urged today at a meeting in Newcastle in northern Kwazulu-Natal.
</P>
<P>
At least 13 farmers were murdered in 18 attacks in rural areas
last month and four others have been killed since the beginning
of December.
</P>
<P>
"The government should declare a three-month-long state of
emergency of the whole of the Republic of South Africa, or in
selected magisterial districts, so that the security forces can
search, detain and vigorously sort out criminals, gangs and
syndicates," Graham McKintosh, president of Kwazulu-Natal
Agricultural Union, told about 400 farmers.
</P>
<P>
Farmers also called for a six-month moratorium on the
prosecution of people in possession of unlicensed firearms, to
allow them time to hand in their weapons.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the moratorium anybody found in possession of
an unlicensed firearm should face a mandatory sentence of five
years in jail without the option of a fine," McKintosh said.
</P>
<P>
Farmers were adamant that the death penalty should be
reintroduced, and that corporal punishment should be meted out to
juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
Another suggestion was that the government should allow the
courts the freedom to impose sentences that would deter
criminals.
</P>
<P>
Farmers were critical of the justice system, which they said
favored criminals. They questioned why hardened criminals were
given light sentences for serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
As peace-loving citizens, they said, they were frustrated and
that the government was not doing enough to stop attacks on
farmers.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, South African Agricultural Union leader Chris du
Toit gave an ultimatum to the government after meeting South
African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Du Toit said farmers would consider further measures to
protect themselves if the government failed to curb rural murders
by the end of January.
</P>
<P>
But today he said his organization will still cooperate with
the government. Farmers also said at the meeting that they did
not want to take law into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
In another development, all major political parties and
agriculture leaders would meet in Pretoria on Thursday to discuss
the issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has called on all
parties involved in the Cyprus problem, namely Greece, the Greek
Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots, besides itself, to jointly
solve the issue, the Cyprus News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is not the only country which can propose a solution to
the protracted problem, Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Inal Batu
said in an interview with London Greek Radio, according to the
agency.
</P>
<P>
"We need the contribution of at least three other sides, the
Turkish Cypriots, the Greek Cypriots and Athens and that's what we
are trying to achieve," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops landed
on the Mediterranean island and took over the northern third to
protect the ethnic minority of the Turkish Cypriots following an
abortive coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on plans by the Cypriot government to deploy
Russian-made missiles, Batu said that Turkey will not allow the
missiles to become threats to it.
</P>
<P>
"I am not saying that we will be hitting them or destroying
them, we will take measures which will make these missiles, if
they are bought, ineffective against our country as a threat," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia last January to buy a number
of anti-aircraft missiles.

training to the Colombian national police for presidential
candidate protection," State Department spokesman James Foley
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have provided training for presidential security staff in
various countries in the past. And we would be willing to
consider a Colombian request for such training," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Colombia's national police had announced that
they signed an agreement with the U.S. secret police to help
train Colombia's plainclothes police.
</P>
<P>
"I'd be happy to go back and check the record to see if my
information omits that important detail. But as I understand it,
We at least have not received a formal request," Foley told
reporters at a press briefing.

<HEADLINE> UK Minister Resign Over Benefit Cuts to Lone Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A British minister resigned
today over welfare plans, dealing a blow to the Labor government
which came to power in May.
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Chisholm, a junior Scottish Office minister, handed his
resignation letter to Prime Minister Tony Blair and said he would
oppose the cuts of benefits to single mothers in a parliamentary
vote later in the day as the cuts were "an attack on some of the
poorest women in society."
</P>
<P>
Blair suffered a further revolt today when another Labor MP,
Gordon Prentice, stepped down as parliamentary private secretary
to Transport Minister Gavin Strang.
</P>
<P>
Other MPs were also stepping up their opposition to the benefit
plans and announced their intention to oppose the government.
</P>
<P>
The Labor wants to reduce state benefits for Britain's one
million lone parents by up to 11 pounds (18 US dollars) a week in
an attempt to encourage them to abandon welfare and go to work.
</P>
<P>
Although dozens of Labor MPs were opposed to the welfare plan,
Blair took a tough stand and was determined to see it through,
saying getting single mothers back to work was more important than
granting benefits.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is to help those lone parents off
benefits and into work," the prime minister told parliament.
</P>
<P>
"There are limited resources. When we came to power, we made it
quite clear we had to stick within existing budgets guidelines
because we weren't going to lose control of the money available,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Anti-PNA Census Bill Passes First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (parliament)
Wednesday evening passed the first reading of a legislation bill
prohibiting the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to conduct
census in disputed East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The first reading of the bill was passed with a vote of 35-22.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday afternoon, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
opened the debate of the bill by declaring Jerusalem as the sole
and unified capital of Israel and it will remain so forever.
</P>
<P>
This legislation bill will prohibit all "illegal activities"
of the Palestinians in East Jerusalem and it is a test of
difficult struggle of Israel ahead, said Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"It is not only the test of the government, but the test of the
Israeli people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu called on the opposition to support the bill.
</P>
<P>
Although they voted in favor of the legislation, the Labor
Party MPs criticized the government for formulating such a bill at
this time, which they said will create more conflicts with the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The timing of submitting and passing of this bill is terrible,
Labor Party chairman Ehud Barak told the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shimon Peres, another Labor Party MP and former
prime minister, called on the government to accept the proposal of
asking some independent organizations to conduct census for the
PNA in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
MPs from the opposition Meretz Party voted against the
legislation bill, saying the rest of the world may consider the
legislation as another step of making obstacles for the second
phase of Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
A ministerial committee approved the amendments of this bill
Tuesday night, which prohibits all kinds of activities of the PNA
in East Jerusalem and gives the public security minister the legal
authority to prevent the PNA from conducting census there.
</P>
<P>
According to Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi, violators of this
legislation will be sentenced to at least three years in jail.
</P>
<P>
As the Israeli Knesset struggling to pass this legislation
bill, PNA's census in Gaza Strip and the West Bank went on very
smoothly throughout the day today.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of census staff conducted door-to-door census, while
collecting copies of census questionnaires filled by the
Palestinian families.
</P>
<P>
The census is scheduled to be completed on December 24 and
final results will be announced on January 4, 1998.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Down on Weaker Asian Markets, Dow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all ended lower today, undermined by Asian markets' retreat and
Wall Street's opening losses as well as by a weaker dollar.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index closed nearly 1 percent or 46.6
points down at 5,130.7, but still managed to hold onto the key
5,100-point level.
</P>
<P>
Prices drifted lower as profit-takers stepped into after an
overnight sell-off on Asian markets. Losses were extended in
afternoon trading with Wall Street's further losses.
</P>
<P>
The downturn in London was led by banking stocks which
accounted for almost 40 percent of the FTSE 100 index's decline.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares ended 1.62 percent lower,
continuing a period of consolidation after recent gains.
</P>
<P>
"The losses in the Far East and Wall Street added some downward
pressure," one trader commented.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index was 67.64 points lower at 4,117.27 as a softer
dollar also weighed on the market.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index in Paris finished 27.22 points weaker at
2,932.18. Dealers said that the market was also dragged down by
profit-taking and falls on other world markets.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Climate Change Conference Wraps Up in Kyoto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations climate change
conference ended in Kyoto, western Japan, on Thursday by obliging
the developed countries to cut more on their greenhouse gas
emissions.
</P>
<P>
The gathering, of delegates from some 160 countries, was the
third of the kind to substantiate the U.N. Framework Convention on
Climate Change forged in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 1992.
</P>
<P>
The conference was initially scheduled to close on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, its most important product, a protocol to cut global
gas emissions in the 2008-2012 period by an average of 5.2 percent
below the 1990 or 1995 levels, was not delivered until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After all-night rounds of stormy deliberations, negotiators at
the policy-making committee finally adopted the document at 10
a.m., and submitted it for approval by the plenary session.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, 38 industrialized countries are divided
into eight groups and different emission targets, ranging from an
8 percent reduction to a 10 percent rise, are set for each.
</P>
<P>
Among these groups, the 15-nation European Union (EU) is to cut
its emissions by 8 percent, the United States 7 percent and Japan
6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Greenhouse gases referred in the document are carbon dioxide
(CO2), methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),
perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).
</P>
<P>
These gases, especially CO2 from burning fossil fuels such as
oil and coal, could trigger what is called "greenhouse effect" to
trap solar radiation heat within the Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the world's science community has provided
increasingly convincing evidences to pinpoint greenhouse gases
behind what is believed to be an ongoing trend of "global warming."
</P>
<P>
The Kyoto protocol stipulates that 1995 may be used as the base
year for HFCs, PFCs and SF6, as these man-made gases were hardly
produced before 1990, the base year used for the other three gases.
</P>
<P>
It also ratifies "joint implementation," in which an
industrialized country can invest in a developing country to cut
emissions and take those emission reductions into its own account.
</P>
<P>
Industrialized countries can also add to its account the
absorption of greenhouse gases by forests in achieving binding
commitments.
</P>
<P>
To help developing countries tackle global warming, the
document calls for the creation of a "clean development
mechanism," to legalize the sale of reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions by developing countries to industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was praised by Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary
Kanezo Muraoka, who described it as "an epoch-making first step
toward preventing global warming and preserving the global
environment."
</P>
<P>
Japanese industry officials, however, expressed pessimism about
the practicality of the emission reduction targets for
industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
To meet Japan's 6 percent cut target, they said, the Japanese
people will be urged to cut their energy use by more than 10
percent and to change their lifestyle.

<HEADLINE> Former French PM Suggests Constitutional Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Former French prime minister
Raymond Barre Thursday suggested a reform of the French
Constitution to avoid right-left cohabitation in the country's
political system.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview, Barre said that a division on top of
the state caused by the cohabitation is beginning to cause
problems in the country's national and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Could there be the means... through the constitutional
mechanism, to avoid this division at the summit of the state which,
in national and international field, begins to pose problems?" he
asked.
</P>
<P>
He said he was in favor of the idea to reduce the presidential
term from seven years to five years, and to have the legislative
elections held simutaneously with the presidential election,
although he admitted that this is not a "perfect formula."
</P>
<P>
France holds its presidential election every seven years and
legislative elections every five years.
</P>
<P>
Barre, who is from the centrist Union for French Democracy,
also doubted whether the cohabitation between President Jacques
Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin "will be long."
</P>
<P>
Raymond Barre worked as French prime minister from August of 1976
to May of 1981.

<HEADLINE> UK PM to Meet Sinn Fein Leader with no Illusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair was to meet Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams for the sake of
peace, a government spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister is under no illusions about the nature of
Sinn Fein but they are in the talks... Mr. Adams and his colleagues
will be treated in the same way as other parties in the talks,"
Blair's official spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister "is prepared to take risks for peace and he
believes the prospects are better than they have been for a
generation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The historic talks, to be held at 2:00 p.m. in No.10 Downing
Street, will be the first meeting in London between a British
prime minister and a Irish Catholic republican leader for 76 years.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein is the political wing of the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), the largest nationalist paramilitary organization which has
resorted to violence to end the British rule of Northern Ireland
over the past 28 years, with 3,200 people being killed.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has drawn strong criticism from Northern Ireland's
Protestant majority, who fear the government may cave in to
republican demands for a united Ireland and an end to British rule
of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Blair would tell his critics he had a duty
to try to bring stability to Northern Ireland, just as he would
with any part of the United Kingdom that had been rocked by
violence.
</P>
<P>
Adams said on BBC radio Thursday morning that he wanted the
talks to produce peace for Northern Ireland, not just publicity
for his cause.
</P>
<P>
"The symbolism itself is important but it's the substance of the
meeting that is more important," said the Sinn Fein leader.
</P>
<P>
Adams will be accompanied by his chief negotiator, Mitchel
McLaughlin, and six other delegates. No handshake is expected at
the meeting which is expected to last about an hour.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Rice Exports Up, but Earnings Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's rice exports were up
17 percent in the past 11 months but earnings were reportedly down
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The exports, of nearly 3.3 million metric tons, were close to
the Vietnamese government's projection of 3.6 million tons for the
entire year, or 600,000 tons more than last year.
</P>
<P>
But earnings from the exports were 50 million U.S. dollars
less, due to a drop of rice prices at the world market, said
official Vietnamese media reports available on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mismanagement of rice purchase and exports were also to be
blamed for the decrease.
</P>
<P>
The government said this year's total grain output could be
equivalent to 30.6 million tons of paddy rice, including more than
9 million tons of commercial paddy rice.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development plans to
continue to designate and build infrastructure for export rice
growing areas, streamline export procedures, so as to increase the
number of direct exporters.

<HEADLINE> PNA: Census in Jerusalem to Go Ahead Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) will go ahead with its census in East Jerusalem
despite a ban hastily adopted by Israeli Knesset (parliament),
said a cabinet minister of the PNA today.
</P>
<P>
But the PNA is to take census in the city in a different way
from that in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, PNA Minister for
Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini told the press in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Census-takers will collect data of the Palestinians by fax,
rather than going door to door, said Husseini.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli reports, Palestinian census-takers may
pose as students to collect information for research.
</P>
<P>
Husseini said traditionally Arab East Jerusalem is regarded as
part of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of using repression to prevent the PNA from
implementing rights, including census, in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in
the 1967 Mideast war, as their future capital of an independent
state.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Knesset passed a law in a marathon session late
Wednesday night to prohibit the Palestinians from carrying out
activities in East Jerusalem without "taking permission" from the
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The legislation also authorizes Israeli police to take actions
against the Palestinians who "violate" the legislation, to take
part in the census in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police were on the look-out in East Jerusalem for
Palestinian census-takers.
</P>
<P>
The census, the first of its kind since the formation of the
PNA, began Wednesday and went on smoothly in Gaza Strip and the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 staff and workers have been mobilized for the
census, which is to last a fortnight and the results will be
published next month.

<P>
A summary of the Chinese economy showed appropriately rapid
growth with low-level price rises in 1997, and showed a healthy
development trend towards "high growth and low inflation." The
market played increasingly important role in economic operations
and the allocation of resources. In addition, overall economic
structural adjustments showed signs of positive change, with more
marketable products and a better production/sales ratio.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China expanded economic and technical exchanges, with
an upsurge in foreign trade and a better international balance.
</P>
<P>
The conference indicated various noticeable contradictions and
problems in China's economic operations during the year and urged
that appropriate attention should be paid to finding solutions.
</P>
<P>
The list of problems included: a number of state-owned and
township enterprises operating in the red; the rising ranks of
laid-off workers; the imperfect legal system and poor supervision
of China's financial sector; the weak agricultural base; and the
deteriorating agricultural ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
In terms of economic work for 1998, the conference pointed to
the pressing need for the country to advance the moderization
drive towards the new century.
</P>
<P>
The conference proposed to meet goals by basing the general
principle of China's future economic work on upholding the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, fully implementing the guideline
formulated during the 15th Party Congress, promoting thorough
reforms related to China's economic system restructuring and
growth patterns, further enhancing the status of agriculture in
terms of the national economy, accelerating state enterprise
reform, continuing to readjust the economic structure,
strengthening and improving macroeconomic controls, opening
further, making a better arrangement for people's life and
realizing sustained, rapid and sound economic development, as well
as comprehensive social progress.

curb inflation, stabilize and enhance the status of agriculture,
prevent and resolve financial risks, improve the social security
system and maintain a stable macroeconomic and social environment.
</P>
<P>
"Making progress" refers to the fact that China should register
new breakthroughs in state enterprise reform, financial system
reform and various other reform efforts. In addition, new measures
will be introduced to resolve important social
issues. Advancements should also be made in economic structural
readjustments and opening in order to markedly improve China's
overall economic strength and efficiency.

<P>
The conference, which outlined a number of major tasks for
China's economic sector in 1998, stressed that the status of
agriculture as the economic base should be further reinforced in
order to achieve overall agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Based on the current good situation and successive good
harvests, a clear mind should be maintained and investments in the
agricultural sector should be steadily increased, according to the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the country is implementing a national
development strategy and is attaching great significance to
economic development dictates that greater priority should be
placed on the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The conference called for the optimization of the rural
economic structure, improvement in agricultural infrastructure and
the ecological environment, and further strengthening the status
of agriculture as the economic base in order to ensure the growth
of the agricultural production, increase the income level of
farmers and ensure stability in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The Party's basic work policies in rural areas should remain
stable, especially in terms of the policy of land contractual
system, the policy to further reduce economic burdens on farmers
and the policy governing grain and cotton purchases and sales, in
order to protect the initiative of farmers.
</P>
<P>
The conference called for accelerating reform of the country's
grain and cotton purchase systems in an active and appropriate way
in order to establish a new marketing system and pricing mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The conference also called for the accelerated construction of
agricultural infrastructure, including water conservancy,
agricultural science and technology, cultivatable land and the
ecological environment in order to enhance the integrated capacity
of agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
While optimizing the economic structure in rural areas and
maintaining the steady growth of grain, the nation should also
extend great efforts to develop the plantation, cultivation and
processing industries in the countryside, the conference stressed.
</P>
<P>
China should continue along the track of industrializing the
agricultural sector and increase both the value and efficiency of
the sector, according to the conference.

The conference pledged to complete the crucial stage in
restructuring of the state-owned enterprises in order to improve
the managerial status of state firms.
</P>
<P>
The conference noted that the reform of state enterprises is
regarded as the key to the nation's overall economic restructuring
drive, and stressed that the pressing task of current economic
work is to restructure and develop state firms.
</P>
<P>
The 15th Party Congress's targets for restructuring state-owned
enterprises included: enabling the majority loss-making medium- to
large-sized state-owned enterprises escape current difficulties
within three years, while enabling the majority of the large and
medium-sized state-owned back-bone enterprises to initially adopt
a modern enterprise system by restructuring, regrouping, carrying
out renovations and reinforcing management.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the textile industry is expected to record major
breakthroughs in efforts to establish a modern enterprise system
for companies to substantially improve the management of various
state enterprises, according to the conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference called for active efforts to strategically
regroup state firm by attaching greater attention to larger firms
and relaxing controls on smaller enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A number of large enterprise groups will be established in
various key industries or related sectors through introducing
regrouping, mergers, leasing and contracting, according to the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Policies encouraging mergers, bankruptcies, reducing excessive
redundancies and reemployment programs will be continued in order
to realize mechanisms for competition and reasonable flow of
labor. The conference also pointed out that enterprises should
strengthen their sense of competition and risk.
</P>
<P>
The conference also pledged to reinforce Party leaderships of
enterprises, urging them to serve as the core and persist in the
principle of relying on the working class. It also called for
restructuring the government to realize the separation of
government and enterprises, introduce efficient supervision and
operational mechanisms for the state properties; and accelerate
and improve the social security system.

accelerate industrial upgrades, while relocating less advanced
industries to central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Reform of the investment and financing systems should be
accelerated by separating the government from enterprises, and
establishing strict responsibility mechanisms to prevent financial
risks and redundant operations.
</P>
<P>
The conference pledged to further introduce and improve
macroeconomic controls in order to create a more favorable
environment for reform and development.
</P>
<P>
Based on the premise of optimizing the structure, China should
maintain a moderately rapid economic growth and appropriate growth
in investments, exports and consumption, keep a basic balance for
the macroeconomic volume, and avoid major fluctuations in economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The conference called for avoiding any factors which could
possibly spark inflation by deepening reform and using both
economic and legal means to establish a price regulation system to
maintain a relatively low inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
The relationship among foreign exchange, trade, investment and
debt must be properly handled to maintain an appropriate foreign
exchange reserve and ensure the balance of international payments.
</P>
<P>
The conference called for adherence to the moderately tight
monetary policy in order to achieve financial growth and
stability, and to promote sustained, rapid and healthy national
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The conference exhibited great concern about the financial
sector, urged accelerated and expanded financial reform needed to
establish a modern financial system. The supervisory role of the
central bank must be strengthened, while existing state-owned
commercial banks should be transformed into true commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The conference called for accelerated legislation to
standardize activities of the financial sector, safeguard order
and reduce risks in the sector.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Assures Citizens of Keeping Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) will not change its
policy of linking the Hong Kong dollar with the U.S. dollar, Tung
Chee Hwa, chief executive of the HKSAR, said here today upon his
return from a duty visit to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We don't need to change this policy because our economic
fundamentals are very good," Tung told reporters at the airport.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, Hong Kong's stock market is volatile recently due
to the impact of the financial turmoil in Asia, but I am confident
 that the repercussion will pass just like the big waves," Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong stocks fell 602.19 points or 5.4 percent to close at
10,420.22 points this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
At the airport, Tung briefed the reporters on his first duty
visit to Beijing, saying that in Beijing, he called on President
Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng to report work.
</P>
<P>
He said he also met with vice premiers Zhu Rongji and Qian
Qichen as well as Liao Hui, director of the Hong Kong Macao
Affairs Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Tung said he explained to the leaders that in the past five and
half months after Hong Kong's return to the motherland, Hong
Kong's development in the fields of politics, economy and
livelihood is very well.
</P>
<P>
He also told the leaders that the operation of the SAR
government is very well, Hong Kong people continue to retain their
 original lifestyle and Hong Kong's economy is still expanding.
</P>
<P>
Tung said he took the opportunity to brief the leaders on the
reason of the Asian financial turmoil and its impact on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He also reported to the leaders the measures of the SAR
government to deal with the financial turmoil and expressed his
confidence about Hong Kong's future, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the leaders had spoken highly of the operation
of the SAR government and agreed with the SAR government's
measures to deal with the financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"The leaders introduced to me the direction of the economic
development of the country. They are confident about China's
economic development," Tung said, adding "I was encouraged by
their remarks."
</P>
<P>
The economic development of the country is very important for
the development of Hong Kong, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Since Hong Kong is now part of China, so it is right for the
leaders to show concerns about Hong Kong, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Not just the leadership, all across China, everybody is very
proud that Hong Kong is now part of China, Tung said.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Troop Redeployment in West Bank Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy today demanded that the government make an urgent
decision on the further redeployment, warning failure to do so
will be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by Israel Radio, Levy said anyone who thinks that
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu can go empty-handed into next
week's meeting with United States Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright is "naive."
</P>
<P>
A failure to understand the urgent need of such a decision will
lead to a "dangerous gamble," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that if without substantive committment by Netanyahu
to Albright, Israel will find itself in an impossible situation
of international isolation and will lose its most important
assests, its friendship with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is expected to hold a meeting next Thursday with
Albright in Paris to discuss Israel's decision on the second
further redeployment in the West Bank and Tel Aviv's position on
the permanent talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
During her two meetings with Netanyahu in Paris last week,
Albright reportedly pressed Israel to come out with a concrete and
more credible decision on the scope of further redeployment in
order to advance the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli officials have indicated that despite the
U.S. pressure, the Israeli government may not produce a final
decision on the percentage of the second redeployment before the
Netanyahu-Albright meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial panel charged with formulating plans for the
further redeployment and final-status talks, which is headed by
Netanyahu and includes Levy, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
and National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, has already
held three sessions but failed to reach consensus due to the
inner rift.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that while hard-liners Netanyahu and Sharon
favor creating expansive security zones along the Green Line
and Jordan Valley, moderates Levy and Mordechai insisted that
such zones can be much smaller.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial panel is to reconvene later today in another
effort to make progress before Netanyahu's scheduled meeting with
Albright next week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sharon denied an Israel Radio report earlier today
that he and Mordechai have allegedly agreed to set the scope of
the second redeployment at 13 percent, 10 percent come from Area C
under sole Israeli control and 3 percent from Area B under Israeli
and Palestinian joint control.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is reportedly demanding that Israel agree to pull out
troops from at least 12 percent of the West Bank in the second
redeployment, rather than the 6-8 percent originally proposed by
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Netanyahu held talks with a group of settler
leaders from the West Bank to discuss the government's plan to
carry out further redeployments.
</P>
<P>
The settler leaders demanded the government to ensure that the
Palestinian side fulfill its commitments to the signed agreements
before Israel takes actions to redeploy troops.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Hongkong Telecom, Hong
Kong's leading telecommunications services provider, will join
consortium to build the first undersea fiber-optic cable network
directly linking China and the United States, the company
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the company said that it has signed an
agreement with 13 leading telecommunications companies in the
Asia-Pacific Region on the one-billion-US-dollar project.
</P>
<P>
The 16,000-mile China-US cable network, one of the largest ever
constructed, will serve as a primary conduit for international
long-distance telecommunications traffic in the Pacific
Rim. Having a total of 80 gigabits per second, the system will be
able to carry one million phone calls simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Once the necessary permits are obtained, construction on the
cable network will begin and is expected to be completed by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Each of the 14 consortium members holds an equal stake, and
they will be jointly responsible for network oversight,
maintenance and administration.
</P>
<P>
The consortium is made up of China Telecom, Hongkong Telecom,
AT&AMP;T, MCI, Sprint, Kokusai Denshin Denwa (Japan), Nippon Telephone
&AMP; Telegraph (Japan), Korea Telecom, ITDC (Taiwan), SBC
Communications Inc., SingTel (Singapore), Telecom Malaysia,
Teleglobe, and Telstra (Australia).
</P>
<P>
With six submarine fiber-optic cable systems coming ashore in
Hong Kong and two cable linked with the inland areas of China,
Hong Kong now has more international cable landings than any other
cities in Asia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- One of the few pieces of
evidence confirming the actual existence of William Shakespeare is
brought under the hammer here.
</P>
<P>
The document for sale a deed for land Shakespeare bought
in his home town, Stratford-on-Avon, in 1602. The auctioneers,
Sotheby's, estimate it will go for more than 250,000 pounds
(425,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is one of the 13 known documents confirming the playwright's
existence, although it does not end the controversy about whether
he really did write the plays attributed to him.
</P>
<P>
The deed is said to be the only first-hand material to
Shakespeare's life and the most important manuscript on the life
of the English playwright to appear at auction.
</P>
<P>
As there remains little evidence directly linking him with the
plays, some people have questioned his existence or his genius in
writing so many plays.
</P>
<P>
Shakespeare was one of the greatest and most productive
playwrights in the world. He wrote 37 plays and 154 sonnets before
he died in 1616 at the age of 52.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Summit Supports Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Islamic leaders have approved
six draft resolutions related to the Arab-Israeli conflict,
reaffirming support for Middle East peace process and its
principle of "land-for-peace."
</P>
<P>
All the 142 draft resolutions tabled at the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) dealing with a wide range of issues both
within and outside the Muslim world have been approved.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic leaders supported the Palestinians'
"inalienable ... rights to return, to self-determination and to
the establishment of their independent state," according to the
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
They requested all the relevant U.N. resolutions, and
agreements signed by the Palestinians and Israel be implemented
and obligations and commitments fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
They strongly attacked Israel's hardline policies, pointing
finger at its attempt to Judaize Jerusalem and its continued
occupation of south Lebanon and Syria's Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The leaders are scheduled to approve a Tehran Declaration and
decide the venue for their next meeting before concluding the
three-day summit later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The three-day eighth OIC summit opened here Tuesday with the
participation of all its members to seek solidarity and unity in
the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of Arab countries gave a hand to the
debt-ridden OIC at the summit, said an informed source. Saudi
Arabia has offered the organization 10 million U.S. dollars, while
Qatar and Kuwait have each pledged 3 million, Iran 1 million, and
Egypt half a million.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old, 55-membered Islamic body now has a debt of 15
million U.S. dollars due to its low budgets and difficulty to
collect financing.

Adams in Downing Street later Thursday, the first such meeting
over the past 76 years.
</P>
<P>
Blair is expected to make clear to Adams that if Sinn Fein
turns its back on the Mitchell Principles, his party will be
kicked out of the multi-party peace talks. The principles call for
all parties involved in the talks to renounce violence.
</P>
<P>
In an article published on Thursday's Sun newspaper, Blair said
he would warn Sinn Fein that "if you return to violence, there
will be no place for you at the negotiation table."
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein is the political wing of the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), the largest nationalist paramilitary organization in
Northern Ireland, which has been fighting to end the British rule
of the divided province over the past 28 years.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview with GMTV earlier in the day, Adams
said that his goals at the meeting were clear: a lasting peace in
Northern Ireland and a commitment from Blair that he would coax
pro-British Protestant Unionists towards a deal for the province.
</P>
<P>
"We're not there to make publicity. We're there to make peace,"
Adams said.
</P>
<P>
Blair promised to meet Adams to reward Sinn Fein for a
five-month-old IRA truce that has won the party a seat at
political negotiations on Northern Ireland's future. But it has
drawn widespread criticism from Northern Ireland's pro-British
Protestant community.
</P>
<P>
A senior Ulster Unionist Party official, Reg Empey, said the
meeting should be called off.
</P>
<P>
"We warned him (the prime minister) it was going to be a
high-risk strategy because we do not believe the Republican
movement is committed to exclusively peaceful means yet."

<HEADLINE> Sensitive Index on BSE Market Loses 18.19 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 11 (Xinhua)-- The sensitive index on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market today lost 18.19 points to
close at 3,329.14 as against Wednesday's close of 3,347.33.
</P>
<P>
The national index also fell by 8.20 points to 1,448.94 from
the previous close of 1,457.14.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 and the U.S. dollar index were quoted marginally
lower at 324.86 and 137.20 compared with the previous closes of
327.59 and 139.67 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The sensitive index pierced through the 3,319 support level and
dropped below the 3,300-mark at 3,247.63 around mid-session,
reflecting a setback in share prices on the BSE market today on
continued selling pressure from foreign institutional investors.

bear operators were also reported to have sold heavily. The market
has been witnessing a bear phase since the last couple of weeks
and the sensitive index has lost more than 231 points during the
current month.
</P>
<P>

market in the absence of any clear indication about which party

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Scientists and engineers have
warned that Bangladesh may face severe earthquakes in future and
urged the government to take steps to identify vulnerable areas,
localities and structures as precautions against the possible
disaster, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
They observed with concern that despite the apprehension of
tremor strikes, little preparedness have been adopted to contain
the disaster, The New Nation said.
</P>
<P>
The opinions and suggestions came at a seminar organized by a
disaster preparedness network recently in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations of the seminar included the establishment
of a national committee, disaster management agencies and
lifelines such as water supply, fire services and others,
extensive study of earthquake activities by establishing a
national level research institute, and development of a national
contingency plan for earthquake disaster mitigation.
</P>
<P>
Installing an extensive seismological observatory network with
a central unit at Dhaka is also included in the recommendations.

<HEADLINE> Surveys Show Chinese College Students Know More About HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- About 93 percent of Chinese
college students know that people sharing intravenous injection
needles or having sex without using condoms are possibly infected
by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), according to a survey.
</P>
<P>
Anti-AIDS experts quoted the survey results as saying that
Chinese students have understood HIV/AIDS better as a
result of educational programs provided by schools and social
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The survey was made among some 3,000 college and university
students by a sociological research institute under the
Beijing-based People's University this April. Its results were
published at an on-going symposium on AIDS
(acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) in China.
</P>
<P>
The survey found 60 percent of the students know HIV could be
transmitted through blood transfusion. And 75 percent said they
need to know more about the disease.
</P>
<P>
Another survey, conducted in Beijing, Shanghai and six other
major cities, found nearly all college students know AIDS is an
infectious disease, and only nine percent of them wrongly think
AIDS is curable.
</P>
<P>
The experts attending the symposium said it is very important
to help college students obtain more HIV/AIDS knowledge.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission, the country's highest
educational authority, has ordered colleges and universities to
add courses about HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases
(STDs), said Zhang Xin, a SEC official in charge of health
education.
</P>
<P>
"We've asked the schools to carry out sex education more widely
among students in order to prevent HIV/AIDS from invading into the
campus," she said.

HONG KONG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Securities and

Code on Unit Trusts and Mutual Funds, a regulatory document
guiding the fund management industry and protecting investors.
</P>
<P>
This is the third edition of the Code, which has been amended

</P>
<P>
Latest revisions include new requirement that trustees be

errors and many others.
</P>
<P>
"The underlying spirit of the Code continues to be core
standards for investor protection, especially the appropriate
supervision of all parties, whether in Hong Kong or overseas,"
said Deborah Glass, senior director of the SFC's investment
products division.
</P>
<P>
She added: "In keeping with Hong Kong's open market policies,
the Code not only remains open to properly regulated overseas
funds, but also expands the list of overseas countries to give
Hong Kong investors even greater choice."

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Signs Tax Reform Bill Into Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today signed into law the long-delayed Comprehensive Tax
Reform Package (CTRP), paving the way for the country to exit from
the supervision of the International Monetary Program (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The bill, which will significantly improve the government's
fiscal position, is a vital requirement for the country's planned
exit from 35 years of economic supervision by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The country was supposed to graduate from the last IMF
supervision program in June this year, but the graduation was
delayed due to the lower house's failure to pass the corporate and
individual income tax bill, the third and last part of the CTRP.
</P>
<P>
The income tax reform bill was finally ratified by both the
lower house and the upper house Monday after the lower house
agreed to the Senate's version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
With the signing of the tax reform bill, the country is
expected to graduate from the IMF at the end of this month.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Unlikely to Meet Cotton Production Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is unlikely to meet
the cotton production target of 10 million bales this year as the
main export crop of the country was substantially damaged by
natural calamity, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan will produce about 9 to 9.2 million bales of cotton
this year (1997-98) as the crop was damaged by heavy rains, hail
and wind storms, according to the officials at Central Cotton
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Punjab province, which was expected to produce 8.4 million
bales of cotton, is likely to produce only about 7.1 million to
7.3 million bales while Sindh province will produce 1.9 million,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
An increase in the sugarcane price also diverted the growers
from sowing cotton, which resulted in an 8 percent decrease in
cotton growing area in the country, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Europe's biggest electrical
engineering group Siemens said Thursday it expected net profits in
the current business year to hit a record of three to four billion
marks.
</P>
<P>
The German firm attributed the prospects to its acquisition of
the fossil-fuel electricity-generating plants of Westinghouse of
the United States and the takeover of Electrowatt of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Siemens saw its net profits rising to 2.61 billion marks (1.5
billion U.S. dollars) in the past 1996/97 business year ending
September 30, up five percent from a year before.
</P>
<P>
The results were achieved on sales of 106.9 billion marks, an
increase of 14 percent, with overseas sales growing to 70.6
billion marks, or about 66 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive Heinrich von Pierer told reporters in Munich
that orders rose 12 percent in the last business year to 113.1
billion marks, while investment was up 24 percent to 9.8 billion
marks.
</P>
<P>
He said orders were heading for between 115 billion and 120

<HEADLINE> Poland, China Win at World Weightlifting Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHIANG MAI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Andrzej Cogfalik claimed
the first gold medal for Poland at the World Weightlifting
Championships for 15 years here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Polish strongman took the title in the 83kg category with
172.5 kilograms in the snatch and 380kg in the total. But he had
to be content with the bronze medal in the clean and jerk with a
lift of 207.5kg.
</P>
<P>
Chinese hercules Zhang Yong, world record holder for clean and
jerk, won China's eighteenth gold of the championships with a lift
of 207.5kg. Cofalik's Polish teammate Krzystof Siemion took the
silver.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Dursun Sevinc took silver in the total category with
375kg and bronze in the snatch with 170kg, while Russian Yuri
Miskovetz won the snatch silver with 172.5kg.
</P>
<P>
In the women's event, China's Xiang Fenglan set three women's
world records in the 70kg class.
</P>
<P>
Xiang added a half kilo to the previous bests when she snatched
105.5kg and jerked 130.5kg -- both with only her second attempt.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old, in her first world championships, had not
increased her lifts by the statutory 2.5kg for the attempts to
count for the competition total but her first attempts of 105kg
and 130kg were enough to count for a world record total of 235kg.
</P>
<P>
Chinese lifters have now broken seven records at the world
championships and won 17 gold medals, which, unlike the Olympics,
are awarded for each event -- snatch, jerk and total.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hsi-Li of Chinese Taipei won the jerk bronze and overall
silver while Hungary's Ilona Danko, the snatch silver medallist,
was the overall bronze medallist.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: OAU Makes Progress in Mediating Comorian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Chen Cailin)
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Mediation efforts of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) has finally succeeded in
gathering all the concerned parties to the Comoros crisis to sit
at the table for a peaceful solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
A four-day international conference on Comoros, organized by
the OAU and now going on in the capital of Ethiopia, is attended
by delegations representing the federal government, different
political forces and the islands of Anjouan, Moheli and Grand
Comoros.
</P>
<P>
This is the progress the OAU has achieved after over four
months mediation of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
On August 3 this year, separatists from the Anjouan Island,
one of four islands of the Comoros, announced their independence.
</P>
<P>
They set up so-called "the state of Anjouan", elected
"president" and announced to join France, the former colonial
ruler of the islands.
</P>
<P>
The separative activity was immediately opposed by the OAU
which maintains the sovereign and territorial integrity of member
states. OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim also appointed a
special envoy to Comoros for the mediation mission.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the OAU deployed military observers in the Island
of Moheli and Island of Grand Comoros. Because of the refuse of
the Anjouanese, the military observers have not been deployed at
the Island of Anjouan.
</P>
<P>
The clear-cut OAU stand and mediation efforts have received
support from the United Nations and the international community.
</P>
<P>
Now, all the Comorian delegations attending the conference
have agreed to seek a peaceful and negotiated settlement of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to the OAU, the current consultations between the
Comorian delegations will be based on two fundamental factors,
which are "the legitimate concerns and interests of all the
islands" and "the need to preserve the unity and territorial
integrity of the country."
</P>
<P>
The current Comorian crisis, in the final analysis, is a
crisis of socio-economic and its root cause is poverty and
underdevelopment.
</P>
<P>
Salim pointed out "unless the issue of poverty and
underdevelopment is seriously addressed, the islands will
continue to be faced with instability."
</P>
<P>
Cognizant of this reality, the OAU working in tandem with the
League of Arab States, the European Union, the United Nations and
others is determined to mobilize international support and
assistance for socio-economic development of the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
The OAU efforts to help the eradication of factors of
instability of the islands country will certainly receive the
appreciation and support of the Comorian people.

<HEADLINE> France Welcomes Agreement at Kyoto Climate Change Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- France on Thursday welcomed the
agreement in Kyoto, Japan, on an average 5.2 percent cut in major
industrial countries' emissions of greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Environment Dominique Voynet said the
agreement reached earlier in the day at the United Nations climate
change conference was "more than honorable" for Europe and France.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the United States and Japan finally accepted "what
they rejected for several months," Voynet hailed the solidarity by
European Union (EU) countries in negotiations with the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The agreement "marks a considerable new progress for the
protection of global environment," she was quoted as saying by the
Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Brice Lalonde, president of the French non-government group
Generation Ecologie, said the agreement "will mark a date in the
history of the protection of environment."
</P>
<P>
Greenhouse gases are group of chemicals, mainly carbon dioxide,
released largely as the result of industrial activities, such as
the burning of fossil fuels, including oil and coal.
</P>
<P>
They could prevent the solar radiation from reflecting back
into space, thus trapping the heat within the Earth's atmosphere
and causing what is called "greenhouse effect."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, scientists have been providing more convincing
evidences to pinpoint greenhouse gases behind what is believed to
be an ongoing potentially devastating "global warming" trend.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Tourist Arrivals to Increase in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals in Cyprus
for 1997 are expected to increase by 5 percent compared with that
of last year, an official from Cyprus Tourism Organization (CTO)
has said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Mail today quoted the unidentified CTO official as
saying that "our estimates are pointing to a 5 percent rise of
tourist arrivals by the end of 1997, to an overall arrivals figure
of 2.05 million tourists."
</P>
<P>
According to the official, foreign visitors to Cyprus in
October reached 224,371, compared to 194,500 in October
1996. British tourists accounted for nearly 40 percent of the
October 1997 arrivals, followed by Germany with 14.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures were regarded as good news for the island, which is
heavily dependent on tourism.
</P>
<P>
The income of tourism industry accounts for nearly 20 percent
of the island's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The figures also backed the positive picture painted
Wednesday by Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou, who
forecast a 2.5 percent GDP growth this year and 4 percent
growth in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Christodoulou said the number of
tourists coming to the island rose 8 percent year-on-year for
May-October period this year.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted bankers and economists as saying that
the rise in tourist arrivals in 1997 was largely due to the
Cyprus pound's depreciation against the British pound. More than
a third of the tourists who visited Cyprus are British.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China will take delivery of 19
Airbus planes in 1998, the European Airbus Industrie announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
Airbus vows to achieve a 50 percent share in China's airliner
market in a couple of years, it said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines became the
first Chinese customer of Airbus Industrie in 1985, the large
aircraft manufacturer in the world has got confirmed orders for 92
airliners from China, including 60 A320-series airliners, and 47
of them have already gone into operation.
</P>
<P>
Airbus Industrie will deliver a total of 19 airplanes to China
for the whole year of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The CASC/Airbus Aviation Training Center, a joint effort of
Airbus and the China Aviation Supplies Import and Export
Corporation, held a ceremony today to mark the completion of
training for the first two pilots of the China Northwestern
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The center, with an investment of 80 million US dollars from
Airbus Industrie, has also helped to train 850 attendants for
China's airlines, since it was set up several months ago.
</P>
<P>
Airbus Industrie has also participated in another key project
to develop 100-seat airliners together with the China Aviation
Industrial Corporation and a technology company of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Airbus Industrial predicts that China needs 1,320 airliners
from now to 2014, with a combined value of 100 billion US
dollars. It has to compete fiercely in the Chinese market with
another aircraft manufacturing giant, the new Boeing company,
which was merged by Boeing and McDonnell Douglas not long ago.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Li Ruihuan Meets NZ Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China would like to
strengthen its cooperation with all countries in the world
including New Zealand to make contributions to the sustainable
development of the mankind, Chinese leader Li Ruihuan said here
today.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley, Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, said that the
Chinese government has made the strategy of sustainable
development as the country's fundamental state policy, and will
positively implement it.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li, who arrived here this morning on a
four-day visit to the country, extended his congratulation to
Shipley for taking the prime minister' office and the leadership
of the National Party.
</P>
<P>
He also conveyed to Shipley the cordial regards and
congratulations of Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li
Peng, and welcome her to visit China at her convenience.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said that Li is the first distinguished visitor she has
greeted after she swore in as prime minister on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I see this as a good omen, and a symbol of the importance of
China for New Zealand," she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that in the 25 years after the two countries
established diplomatic ties in 1972, the constant strengthening of
the cooperation between the two countries has laid solid
foundation for the bilateral friendly cooperative ties between
China and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her conviction that this kind of bilateral
relations will be pushed into a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Li told Shipley that China has noted with pleasure that since
the coalition government of New Zealand came to office last year,
it had on many occasions indicated that it attaches importance to
relations with China and that it continues to pursue a "one China"
policy and opposes the containment of China.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand government took the lead in announcing that it
would send Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters to attend all the
activities for the return of Hong Kong to China, including the
swearing-in ceremony of the Provisional Legislative Council of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
China and New Zealand concluded a bilateral market access
agreement in August this year in the context of China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, making New Zealand the first
Western country to have such an agreement with China.
</P>
<P>
Li continued to say that two-way trade between China and New
Zealand has enjoyed rapid development, which has become a
significant feature in the two countries' bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
There are broad prospects for the mutually beneficial
cooperation between the two countries, Li said, as the rapid
development of China's economy makes it a market with great
potential and New Zealand has advantages in agriculture, forestry
and animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here this morning from Christchurch, the largest
city in South Island of New Zealand.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Open wider to World, Mayor Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will further open its
gate to the world so as to attract quality overseas-funded
programs to the city, Mayor Jia Qinglin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by Xinhua reporters before the opening of the
Eighth Beijing Municipal Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), Jia, who is also secretary of the CPC Beijing Municipal
Committee, said that in the past five years, Beijing has actually
used overseas investments of 9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Now, 138 of the 500 largest transnational corporations in the
world have come to Beijing to do business, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jia, also member of the Political Bureau of the CPC's Central
Committee, pointed out that promoting economic development will
further improve Beijing's functions as capital of China.
</P>
<P>
He said that foreign investors are expected to put their funds
to the development of infrastructural facilities, new and high
technology and comprehensive application of energy.
</P>
<P>
He said that Beijing should accelerate economic development so
as to lay substantial foundation for realizing the capital's
functions as the national political and cultural center.
</P>
<P>
He said that he expects Beijing to see a sustained economic
growth in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan Period (1991-95), Beijing's
annual economic growth rate was 12 percent. This year the rate
will be 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the next few years, the growth rate of Beijing
will be 9 percent while the inflation rate under 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
He noted that to realize the goals, Beijing should give full
play to its advantages, boost the development of high and
new technology, and build a high-efficient and open economy with
optimized industrial set-ups.
</P>
<P>
Jia said that Beijing is expected to make use of its scientific
and technological advantages to promote economic development.
There are about 100 universities and institutions run by the State
with more than 1.1 million scholars and scientists.
</P>
<P>
He said that of the high and new technology-oriented
industries, development priority should go to industries like
electronics information, biological engineering, new medicines,
and new materials.
</P>
<P>
Jia also outlined four sectors which will be stressed in
Beijing in the next five years: service trade with focus on
commerce, finance, insurance, communications, cultural
entertainment, sports and tourism; modern agriculture including
the export-oriented farming services, ecological agriculture, rare
animal and plants raising and breeding, and flower producing; key
industries like electronics, automobiles and machinery; and civil
housing industry.

<HEADLINE> Rabbani Demands Restoration of Afghan Seat in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani said today that he does not accept the decision to leave
the Afghan seat vacant in the three-day eighth Islamic summit
being held here.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua at the summit hall, he
said that his government would not accept the decision because
it has not been made by the foreign ministers' meeting or the
summit, but "by a few members in a very hurried way" before the
summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
He stated that his government is recognized by the
international community and therefore should be recognized by the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the OIC foreign ministers meeting in Jakarta,
Indonesia, in 1996 recognized his government as a true
representative of Afghanistan which had the right to occupy the
seat of the organization. But to his regret, the decision had
been changed by some members.
</P>
<P>
He said that leaders attending the current meeting of the OIC
summit should reverse the decision and restore the rights to his
government.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in order to solve the Afghan issue, foreign
interference should be stopped first, the war in his country
should come to an end and negotiations between different factions
should start in a peaceful atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
As to the future political set-up of Afghanistan, he said
that it should be decided by the whole people of Afghanistan
through a general election or Loya Jirgah (national assembly).
</P>
<P>
On the peace efforts by Iran and Pakistan, Rabbani said,
"Iranian and Pakistani officials met Wednesday to seek a way out
of the Afghan crisis, and they had invited my government to join
in the discussions. There is no obstacle for our
participation." However, he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani said that his government is ready to negotiate with
the Taliban regime in Kabul to find a peaceful solution to the
Afghan issue. "However, if the Taliban forces do not accept
peace, then we have to be ready for war and recapture the
capital city of Kabul," he added.
</P>
<P>
He denied reports that Iran had provided military or
financial aid to his government, but saying that he is grateful
to Iranian humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the United Nations and the international
community at large to help Afghanistan end the foreign
intervention and bring back peace to the landlocked nation.
</P>
<P>
Guerilla forces took over Kabul in April 1992, and Rabbani,
leader of Jamiat-e-Islami, was empowered as head of the state by
groups of the guerilla forces.
</P>
<P>
After years of battle for control of Kabul, Taliban forces
emerged in 1994 and defeated the government forces in 1996 by
capturing the capital. Now the Taliban government is only
recognized by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Profits of State-Owned Enterprises Up (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The economic returns of
state-owned enterprises was in a steady revival in the third
quarter of this year, with their losses shrinking significantly
following good performance in the January-June period.
</P>
<P>
The statement is contained in an official report jointly issued
today by the State Statistics Bureau, the Ministry of Finance and
the State Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
During the first three quarters this year, all the 67,400
state-owned enterprises made pre-tax profits totaling 199.66
billion yuan, up 10.31 percent from the same period in 1996. Their
post-tax profits reached 22.56 billion yuan, up 67.74 percent on
an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
The loss of the enterprises running in the red amounted to 63.5
billion yuan, of which the proportion in pre-tax profits
decreased to 31.8 percent, compared to 34.3 percent in the same
period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the mean time, the comprehensive index for enterprise
economic returns grew by 2.59 percentage points on an annual
basis, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In wake of a net loss of 1.5 billion yuan in the first quarter
this year, the state-owned sector realized a rebound in profit in
the second quarter, with its net profits hitting 13.59 billion
yuan, up 57.86 percent an an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth rate was impeded by both the hot weather
and sluggish market in the third quarter, with the pre-tax
profits amounting to 68.67 billion yuan, up 4.68 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the profit gap between the enterprises run
by the central government and those run by local governments has
further widened, because the comparatively larger production scale
and capital ensured an advantageous position for central
government-owned enterprises in the increasingly fierce market
competition.
</P>
<P>
In the July-September period, the 3,582 central
government-owned enterprises made net profits totaling 11.38
billion yuan, up 32.54 percent, while enterprises run by local
governments incurred losses reaching 914 million yuan.

Beijing, Yunnan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hubei, Guangdong and
Sichuan increased their profits by more than 30 percent over the
same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The losses of the state enterprises in Tianjin, Ningxia,
Xinjiang, Guizhou and Gansu decreased by more than one fifth.
</P>
<P>
Benefitting from the improved market environment and trend
toward enterprise merger, large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises, whose number accounts for 22 percent of the total of
the state sector, took the lead in the enterprise revival
and generated 94.8 percent of the profits and taxes of the state
sector in the January-September period.
</P>
<P>
However, the losses of small enterprises are still large,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Though the state-owned sector achieved a significant increase
in profits during the January-September period, the basis for the
revival, which refers to the profits of state-owned enterprises in
1996, is rather weak, the report said.

<HEADLINE> German Clubs Allowed to Market European Cup Home Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- German federal supreme court
ruled in Karlsruhe on Thursday that the country's soccer clubs can
freely market the broadcast rights to home games in two European
competitions, the UEFA Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup.
</P>
<P>
The court upheld a 1993 ruling by the federal Cartel Office
breaking the German soccer federation's monopoly on the TV rights,
which the anti-trust agency viewed as a way to drive up prices.
</P>
<P>
A Berlin administrative court had also ruled against the
federation.
</P>
<P>
The federal court said the federation had ``no rights'' to
marketing the games. It did not specify whether European soccer's
governing body, UEFA, was entitled to share in the clubs'
marketing rights.

PARIS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Val d'Isere downhill piste
has been named after the name of the two of the most famous skiers
bred in the Savoie village, Henri Oreiller and Jean-Claude Killy.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 25th Anniversary of Sino-New Zealand Ties Marked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese and New
Zealand Leaders called for efforts to strengthen the Sino-New
Zealand bilateral ties here today at a reception held to mark the
25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At the reception, hosted by New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley, Li Ruihuan, visiting chairman of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference National Committee, hailed the
all-round development of the Sino-New Zealand relations over the
past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
"We may learn something useful from this 25-year history," Li
said, "Countries, in their contact with one another, should hold
each other in respect, respect each other's specific national
conditions and historical traditions, and respect the will and
political choice of each other's peoples."
</P>
<P>
"Only by respecting others can one be respected," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that countries should also equitably and fairly handle
the ties between their respective interests and seek common
development on the basis of equality, mutual benefit,
complementarity and reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
"Only by accommodating the interests of others can one's own
interests be guaranteed," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He continued to say that countries should deepen their
knowledge about each other and reach understandings with each
other as common ground is built on constant communication.
</P>
<P>
"Countries should follow the principle of seeking common ground
while putting aside differences, acknowledge the diversity of the
world, acknowledge the differences among the countries in terms of
economic interests, cultural traditions and value judgment, and
explore common interests and universally applicable principles
from those differences by treating each other with sincerity,
equality and politeness," Li noted.
</P>
<P>
He told the reception that only by seeking common ground while
putting aside differences can the common ground be steadily
expanded and the differences steadily reduced.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that as long as our two sides handle matters in
such a spirit, the friendly and cooperative relations between us
will bear even richer fruits in the next 25 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Located in the Asia-Pacific region, both China and New Zealand
are members of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Regional Forum and share
broad common ground in safeguarding regional peace and promoting
regional economic development, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two economies of China and New Zealand, with
their distinctive features, are highly complementary.
</P>
<P>
"We should, in a positive and pragmatic attitude, tap into and
utilize the Sino-New Zealand economic potentials so as to inject
fresh vitality into our respective economic growth," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said that after the development of 25 years, the
bilateral relations now rest on solid foundations.
</P>
<P>
"We have an active dialogue," she said. "Our two way trade and
investment is substantial, and still growing. And we have built
bridges of friendship and understanding."
</P>
<P>
She noted that over the past 25 years, the New Zealand has come
to look to the Asia-Pacific community as the place where it
belongs, and its dialogue with China is growing.
</P>
<P>
"Looking to the future, I believe we are at the threshold of a
new phase in our relationship," she added.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief on Peace Process, OIC, Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan said here today that he hoped the U.N. can
act as a coordinator in pushing forward the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference this afternoon, Annan said
that the U.N. has adopted a series of resolutions on the
regional conflict and that he hoped those resolutions can be
implemented by both the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He asked the two sides to regard the U.N. as a peace
coordinator. Otherwise, he said, too many coordinators could
make things more complicated.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here Monday to attend the eighth summit of
the Organization of the Islamic Conference and then pay a visit
to Iran.
</P>
<P>
He called the Islamic summit a "significant" event with the
participation of more than 30 presidents, vice-presidents, crown
prices and prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a proposal made by Iran's supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the Islamic world's representation in
the U.N. Security Council, Annan said the reform of the U.N. can
only be decided by all members of the world body.
</P>
<P>
In an opening speech at the summit, Khamenei said the OIC
should become a sixth permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he has raised a set of reform-oriented programs in
order to make the U.N. more effective and responsive to world
crises.
</P>
<P>
He envisioned better cooperative relationship between the OIC
and the U.N. in the future, in addition to their past good
coordinations on the issues of Somalia and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions from reporters, Annan said the
U.N. sanctions against Iraq is not directed at punishing the
Iraqi people, and the "oil-for-food" deal between the U.N. and
Iraq itself spells out the fact that the U.N. is aimed at
alleviating the sufferings and crises of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
On the Afghan issue, he said that there will be no military
solution to the conflict, and that it can only be settled
through dialogue and negotiations among all factions and forces.
</P>
<P>
He urged neighboring countries to exercise an arms embargo on
Afghanistan to enable military conflicts there to peter off
pending a complete solution.

<HEADLINE> No-confidence Motion Against Hashimoto Cabinet Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan's House of
Representatives, the lower house, Thursday rejected a
no-confidence motion tabled by opposition camp against Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The motion, the first against Hashimoto's cabinet since he took
office in January 1996, was voted down by 268 to 219 at a lower
house plenary session.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition New Frontier Party (NFP) tabled the motion
accusing the cabinet of failing to take appropriate economic measures
and leaving the economy on the verge of crisis.
</P>
<P>
Members of the NFP and other opposition parties such as the
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the Japanese Communist Party (JCP)
and the Taiyo Party voted for the motion.
</P>
<P>
Members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which
enjoys a majority in the 500-seat lower house, and its two non
cabinet allies, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and New Party
Sakigake, voted against the motion.
</P>
<P>
Following a series of failures of Japan's financial
institutions such as the Yamaichi Securities Co, public support
rate for Hashimoto's cabinet have dropped due to voters'
disappointment with economic measures and Hashimoto's perceived
lack of leadership, according to recent opinion polls conducted by
Japanese media.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese and US governments
today in Washington signed an agreement on construction and
maintenance of an undersea optical cable project linking the two
countries and a contract on the building of the project, an
official with Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPT) told
Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
The official said the two documents marked the start-up of the
Sino-US optical cable project, slated to be completed and
operational in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The proposal for the project was raised by China Telecom, the
country's largest telecom operator, and AT&AMP;T of the United
States. It has won active response and support from other
transnational telecom corporations.
</P>
<P>
The MPT official considered the project a milestone for the two
countries in telecom construction and a foundation for
Asia-Pacific region to build itself into one of the key telecom
hubs worldwide in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jichuan, Chinese minister of Post and Telecommunications,
representatives from 14 organs that initiated the project and 36
enterprises that will participate in the construction were present
at the signing ceremony, according to the official.
</P>

negotiations between relevant countries and China will reach a
successful conclusion in the near future," according to Downer.
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely pleased that China is preparing to approve the
business license for an Australian insurance company. In addition,
I'm pleased that the Chinese Government has decided to approve a
business license for a second Australian insurance company in the
near future," said Downer.
</P>
<P>
He said the approval of a license for a law firm will increase
the number of Australian companies operating in China to three.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese government's recent designation of
Australia as an approved tourist destination represents an
important development in bilateral economic and trade
cooperation. He said the approval will benefit Australia's
economic and tourism sectors during a period in which a number of
southeast Asian countries face financial turmoil and the number of
tourists from the said countries will most likely diminish.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Tourism Forecast Council of Australia projects
that the number of Chinese tourists visiting the country will grow
from 53,000 in 1996 to 139,000 in 2001, and even further to over
300,000 by 2003.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we will do even better than that," said Downer.
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely delighted with the status of our bilateral
relations which continue to gain even greater strength. The
momentum of our relationship is quite obvious and we sincerely
hope to accelerate same," according to Downer.
</P>
<P>
The Australian leader departed Beijing today for northwest
China's Xi'an to continue his three-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Ceremony On 60th Anniversary Of Nanjing Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A forum was held in Beijing
today to mark the 60th anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre of
civilians by Japanese troops.
</P>
<P>
In December 1937, the Japanese intruding troops seized Nanjing,
the Chinese capital at that time, and slaughtered 300,000
civilians and unarmed soldiers within a six-week time period. The
event was called "a dark page in modern human civilization" by
historians.
</P>
<P>
Japan's aggression against China constituted part of its move
toward destinations in Southeast Asia and elsewhere. Nanjing was
targeted after the invaders defeated Chinese troops in Beijing and
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Scholars and officials present today said that attempts by the
Japanese right wingers to cover over the truth of the massacre
must be exposed, and that the Chinese must remember the event to
promote patriotism. China has adequate materials to prove that the
massacre actually took place.
</P>
<P>
The forum was held by the Chinese Association for the History
of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and several
other organizations.

<HEADLINE> China To Commemorate Human Rights Declaration's Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China's Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Tang Guoqiang said today that plans for marking the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights are now
under discussion by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
China also supports the UN to launch activities in
commemoration of the occasion, Tang said. The declaration was
passed on December 10, 1948 by the UN General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the basic principles enshrined in the
declaration have great significance for the development and
progress of mankind, and that it is an important document,
especially in its recognization of economic, social, and cultural
rights for the first time in history, and its impact on the
overall promotion and protection of human rights.
</P>
<P>
He said that China regards the commemoration as an opportunity
to sum up past experiences and lessons on the promotion and
protection of human rights, to look to the future, and to increase
co-operation among nations.
</P>
<P>
And, the Chinese government has had some achievements in
promoting and protecting human rights in an all-round manner, Tang
said. By working with its specific situation, China has taken the
promotion of the rights of the people's subsistence and
development as its primary task, and the economic, social and
cultural rights of the Chinese people have improved
considerablely, he said. On such basis, the Chinese government
has signed the International Convenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights.
</P>
<P>
In the area of protecting the citizens' civil and political
rights, the Chinese government has passed many important laws and
continually strengthened its socialist democracy, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that, while emphasizing human rights within the
nation, China has actively engaged in dialogues and communications
with other countries, on the basis of equality and mutual respect,
to increase international co-operation in this regard.

<HEADLINE> China to Put More Emphasis on Technology for Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China will encourage research
centers to co-operate with business, according to Xu Guanhua,
vice-minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, who
said that China will place more emphasis on the role of science
and technology in economic growth, and use them to solve economic
development problems.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that China will give priority to 500 science and
technology service centers for the rest of this century to help
small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country will encourage technology development
centers in industries to aid large enterprises in solving key
technology problems.
</P>
<P>
China has had rapid economic growth since the early 1980s, but
quality and returns are not so satisfactory, experts said. Xu
points out that the main reason is a weakness in the development
of new technology.
</P>
<P>
Xu also said that China will make full use of technology in
transforming traditional industries and developing agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"Priority should be given to the promotion of intellectual
power in industries, and the employment of biological and
information technology in reforming traditional agriculture," he
said.

KAMPALA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan residents asked for
another newspaper in local language, The Monitor reported today.
</P>
<P>
Remegious Kataratambi, a local council vice chairman in Kabale
district, asked The Monitor to introduce a sister paper in local
language for south-western Ugandans to promote development of
local culture.
</P>
<P>
Development cannot be achieved without well informed people,
Kataratambi said.
</P>
<P>
Karebi (monitor in local language in south-western Uganda)
weekly should be introduced in Kabale, Rukungiri and Ntungamo
districts, he added.
</P>
<P>
Local people can expand their knowledge on national issues
through the local language newspaper, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor is an English daily. There are two English dailies
in Uganda. The other one is The New Vision.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has four main ethnic groups -- Gandas, Nilotics,
Hamid-Nilotics and Sudanics. Each ethnic group has its own
languge. A person from an ethnic group has dificulties to
communicate with other people from other ethnic groups if not
trained.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq Wants to Solve Problems with Iran: Ramadan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan, who is attending the eighth Islamic summit here,
said today that he will stay after the meeting to sort out
problems between his country and Iran with Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
"We just can not allow problems between our two countries to
linger on unresolved," Ramadan told Xinhua on the fringe of the
summit attended by Muslim countries across the world.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Iran fought a protracted war during 1980-88, causing
an estimated one million casualties on both sides, devastating
damages to their economies and untold human sufferings to the two
peoples.
</P>
<P>
They resumed diplomatic relations in October, 1990, soon
after the breakout of the Gulf crisis triggered by Baghdad's
invasion of Kuwait. But problems left over from that war,
including the issues of POWs (prisoners of war), war reparations
and Iraqi aircraft, which flew to Iran to escape allied attacks
during the Gulf War, stand in the way to improved relations.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this meeting can create a good opportunity for the
two sides to improve relations, which is beneficial to both,"
Ramadan said, adding Iraq looks forward to better ties with the
old rival.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan admitted there are 62 Iranians currently detained in
Iraq, far fewer than the 15,000 claimed by Tehran. Several days
ahead of the summit, Iran released 498 Iraqi POWs and Iraq
reciprocated by freeing two Iranians.
</P>
<P>
This summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference which
opened here Tuesday and will end today, the largest such event
in Iran after the Islamic revolution in 1979, seems to have
succeeded in rallying Islamic leaders whatever their differences.
</P>
<P>
It highlighted the conflicts between Arabs and Israel at a
time when the Likud government's tough policies virtually sent
the Middle East peace process to a dead end. It also addressed
Turkey's repeated incursions into northern Iraq, saying Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said Turkey is abetted by the United States in a bid
to make use of Iraq's present difficulties. "What Turkey does
will only bring serious consequences, not to Iraq, but to Turkey
itself," he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey denied it wanted to invade Iraq, arguing its troops'
entry into northern Iraq was to eliminate its outlawed Kurdish
militants, who use the area as a shelter and springboard for
attacks on targets inside Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel withdrew from the summit
Wednesday, one day ahead of schedule, to avoid facing growing
criticism of his country's ties with Israel and incursion into
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Animal Husbandry Contributes To Agricultural Growth In Shandong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Province has reported
good harvests this year, with animal husbandry helping it thrive
in spite of adverse weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
The summer grain harvest was a record 22.4 billion kg., but
farmers immediately felt threatened by possibly falling prices.
The provincial government intervened, encouraging the development
of animal husbandry and greater grain consumption, and a large
amount of surplus grain was turned into meat, eggs and milk,
pushing grain prices up as a result.
</P>
<P>
In late summer and early autumn, Shandong had one of the worst
droughts in 80 years, but, again animal husbandry played a part in
holding losses to a minimum, and putting 100 yuan more in every
farmer's pocket, by developing some technology-intensive and
market-friendly livestock products.
</P>
<P>
The province's success in curbing fluctuations in agriculture
is attributed at least in part to developing animal husbandry, and
Shandong has grown into the country's largest livestock products
supplier. Animal husbandry uses half the province's grain output,
80 percent of its corn, 20 percent of its wheat, and 30 percent of
its peanuts.
</P>
<P>
This year, the province is expected to produce 6.85 million
tons of meat, 3.89 million tons of eggs, and 760,000 tons of milk,
an all-time high.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Charter Change Bid Over, Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Filipino people, the
opposition and investors heaved a sigh of collective relief early
this week when President Fidel Ramos declared his endorsed
candidate for the 1998 presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
Ramos announced Monday that he had chosen Speaker of the House
of Representatives Jose de Venecia as the presidential candidate
for the ruling Lakas-NUCD (National Union of Christian Democrats)
Party in next year's general polls.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine stock market reacted positively to the
announcement, which, among other factors, helped the local
bourse's main index maintain a strong uptrend for the first three
days this week.
</P>
<P>
"It's not because of the selection of de Venecia. It should
have a positive effect (on the market) because a choice was
finally made. It takes away some clouds of political uncertainty
aggravating the currency crisis," a trader said.
</P>
<P>
The much-awaited announcement ended lingering speculation among
the president's critics and investors that Ramos might press on
his bid to ensure his continued stay in power by reviving the
charter change bid or through other hidden plots.
</P>
<P>
In almost the entire year of 1997, however, the country's
years-long political stability and robust economic growth have
been at stake due to a fierce row over whether to change the
Constitution to remove the term limit of Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1987 Constitution, Ramos can only serve a single term
of six years, and must step down in June 1998. The term limit was
designed to prevent a reprise of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos
who ruled the country for 20 years with a high hand.
</P>
<P>
But Ramos' supporters, most of them members of the ruling party
and government officials, claimed that a six-year term was "too
short" for Ramos, who had done a lot in revitalizing the ailing
economy and restoring stability in the country since taking office
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Starting late last year, they launched an unremitting campaign
in the Supreme Court and the Congress in a bid to revise the
charter to allow Ramos run for a second term or extend his present
term.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the charter-change drive was strongly objected by
the Opposition, the influential Catholic Church and even the
business community which had regarded Ramos a "savior" of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who had been ambivalent on the charter-change drive, was
blasted for failing to stop his associates from pushing the drive
and to clarify his political plans in the 1998 polls.
</P>
<P>
Due to mounting pressure from the anti-charter change camp, the
charter-change efforts were blocked both in the Supreme Court and
the Congress in early September.

But Ramos' refusal to categorically announce his objection to
the extension of his term prompted Manila Archbishop Jaime Sin and
former president Corazon Aquino to call a mammoth protest rally in
Manila on September 21, the 25th anniversary of the proclamation
of martial law by Marcos.
</P>
<P>
On that day, more than half a million people from all walks of
life braved heavy rains and trooped to downtown Manila to say "No"
to the extension of Ramos' term.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the grand anti-charter change rally, Ramos backed
off and declared his promise not to run for a second term, calling
for changing the charter after the 1998 polls. He likewise pledged
to hold the 1998 general elections and ruled out the proclamation
of a martial law.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' assurances ended the months-long political unrest in the
country and avoided a political crisis. But speculation still
persisted over Ramo's future political options until this week
when Ramos announced his successor.
</P>
<P>
"The party is now really over for Ramos," said a political
observer who asked not to be named. "The only option left for
Ramos is to catapult de Venecia to the highest post, and then
maybe he can continue to exert influence by working as his senior
adviser. "
</P>
<P>
"As long as there was no (successor) chosen, there will be
doubts on whether or not the presidential elections would push
through," he said, adding that investors' worries over the
country's political instability have been eased somewhat now.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that uncertainty will remain in the political
scene until a smooth transfer of power after the May 1998
presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
Among the proclaimed presidential contenders, Ramos' choice, De
Venecia, is not a favorite for the public. Widely viewed as a
traditional politician, the Lower House speaker has fared poorly
in many independent opinion polls so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Two opposition candidates, Vice President Joseph Estrada and
Senator Macapagal Arroyo, have been leading in almost all opinion
polls. But both have no strong links with the military, whose
support is deemed vital for political stability in a country
having experienced many aborted coups in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, a former action movie star, is popular among the
ordinary Filipinos, but is reportedly detested by the military. A
shadowy military group warned earlier of the election of Estrada
as president, saying they would take drastic actions against this
scenario.
</P>
<P>
Using the powerful government machinery to boost the popularity
of de Venecia will be a pressing task for Ramos during the
remaining months of his term.
</P>
<P>
The Filipino people, who had already made a crucial decision in
the charter change row, will have to make another difficult choice
in the coming elections. The Philippines stands again at a
crossroads.

<HEADLINE> Common Agenda Urged Among SAARC Nations in WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Sri Lankan Trade
Minister K. T. Wikramaratna today urged member nations of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to forge
a common approach in tackling trade issues before the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in 1985, embraces Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
"Why should the seven different countries of SAARC speak in
seven different voices? The friction between India and Pakistan is
not making things any easier," he told the Press Trust of India
(PTI) here.
</P>
<P>
Given the atmosphere of distrust among some SAARC members, Sri
Lanka would opt to be a spokesman for the region as a neutral
member and voice its concerns, needs and requirements at
international meetings, he said.
</P>
<P>
"While the whole world is grouped into trade blocs, we are
squabbling among ourselves allowing others to exploit us," he
claimed.
</P>
<P>
"Only if we have a common agenda before the WTO can, the South
Asian nations derive benefits for the region from such
international negotiations," he said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Chief Executive Talks With Press In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- At a press conference here
today, Tung Chee-hwa, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), said that he was "greatly encouraged"
by the central government's understanding and support when he came
here to give his first progress report.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that central government leaders think highly of the
SAR government's work after July 1, and his progress report
increased understanding and exchanges between Hong Kong and inland
areas, and he himself has gotten a better look at current economic
development of inland areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong has maintained close economic ties
with inland areas in the past and their prosperity has helped Hong
Kong's development.
</P>
<P>
Tung said he is satisfied with the SAR government's work since
its establishment five months ago and that everything has gone
smoothly since Hong Kong's return to the motherland. Because of
appropriate government measures, the economy is growing and people
are confident about Hong Kong's political and economic futures, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that civil servants in Hong Kong have had
more exchanges with inland counterparts and that the SAR will
increase those exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He said that recent financial crisis in Southeast Asia had not
had much influence in Hong Kong, thanks to its solid economic
foundation, proper SAR government policies, and central government
support and assistance.
</P>
<P>
The crisis did cause Hong Kong to make some readjustments of
its stock market and real estate market, but, that these
readjustments were "healthy", he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the SAR will increase economic and cultural exchanges
with Taiwan to play a positive role in the reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
He added that the SAR government is preparing to set up
an office in Beijing and the central government has promised to
support the plan.

<HEADLINE> French Farmers Protest EU Agriculture Policy Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- French farmers will stage a
series of protests on Thursday against the plan of the European
Union (EU) to reform the Common Agricultural Policy (PAC), on the
eve of the EU summit to be held on December 12-13 in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The National Center of Young Agriculture Workers (CNJA) said
that the reform of PAC would mark "the deviation from a new
course of competitiveness and to the enlargement of exploitations."
</P>
<P>
In its "Agenda 2000" reform project, the European Commission,
the EU's executive body, plans to cut the guaranteed prices for
cereals by 20 percent, meat by 30 percent and milk by 10 percent,
while partially compensating the loss of European farmers with a
rise in aid package.
</P>
<P>
The members of CNJA have sent thousands of post cards to
President Jacques Chirac, asking him to "change the things" at the
EU summit.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded that the new PAC "affirms the European model
of agriculture with a human face, which allies men, markets and
territory," instead of letting the market force farmers make
"standardized, trivialized and dehumanized products."

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The average life expectancy of
Macao residents has increased by 9.84 years over the past two
decades, the latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department
show that average life expectancy between 1969 and 1972 reached
66.73 years, but it grew to 76.57 years during the 1993-1996
period.
</P>
<P>
As usual, women tend to live longer than men. They survive
their male counterparts by between 4.87 and 8.31 years in the
1969-1996 period.
</P>
<P>
The calculation was made on a four-year basis, involving the
overall population, their age and sex and the mortality rate of
different age groups.
</P>
<P>
In addition, life expectancy in Macao has become one of the
highest in the region.
</P>
<P>
While Macao residents live one or two years less than those in
Hong Kong, they outlive the Japanese by two to three years. They
also live seven to eight years longer than residents in China's
inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The number of Macao residents reached 420,300 by the end of
September this year. About 97 percent are Chinese nationals and
the remaining Portuguese and other foreign nationals.

<HEADLINE> New Documents on Nanjing Massacre Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese history professor has
released more documents describing Japanese atrocities in China,
on the eve of the 60th anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
They provide more historical evidence than some previous
documents that stunned the world with their proof of the week-long
barbarity of Japanese soldiers in 1937.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kaiyuan, a historian at the Central China Normal
University, stumbled on the documents in the theology school at
Yale University during a visit to the United States in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Zhang has studied the Bates Documents, left by Miner Bates, who
was working on a doctoral degree in history at Yale, and who was
in Nanjing for the 30 years before 1950. He helped start the
History Department at Nanjing University, and along with 20 other
foreigners, organized an international aid commission during the
Massacre.
</P>
<P>
He witnessed many of the events of that time and kept the
valuable historical documents. After his death in 1978, his family
donated all the papers to Yale University.
</P>
<P>
In his study of them, Zhang found that Bates and nine American
missionaries had recorded details of the massacre in various
letters, bulletins and research reports,
</P>
<P>
In one comment, written between February and March, 1938, Bates
said that Japanese soldiers had killed at least 300,000 civilians
in their march from Shanghai to Nanjing. The Japanese intruding
troops seized the city of Nanjing on December 13, 1937.
</P>
<P>
Zhang will go to Tokyo and Osaka on December 13 to attend a
special international conference in commemoration of the 60th
anniversary of the massacre.

<HEADLINE> FM Office to Guard Interests of Macao: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese Foreign Ministry
(FM) official said here today that the FM Macao office that will
begin operation in December 1999 will help maintain China's
national sovereignty and interests and protect Macao residents'
legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yingfan, vice-minister of foreign affairs, told an
audience of about 400 people at the cornerstone-laying ceremony of
the FM office in Macao that the office will be an important
symbol of China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over
Macao.
</P>
<P>
"The office will, in accordance with the Basic Law of Macao,
deal only with foreign affairs of the Macao Special Administrative
Region within the scope of the Central People's Government," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It will maintain China's national sovereignty and interests,
protect the lawful rights of Macao residents and play its due role
in the long-term stability and development of Macao," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister reiterated that the policy of "one country,
two systems" will be implemented in Macao, adding that both China
and Portugal are making vigorous efforts for a smooth handover of
power and transition.
</P>
<P>
Locating just a few blocks away from the Hong Kong-Macao port
terminal, the building sits on a land area of more than 6,000
square meters. It will have a total construction space of 19,000
square meters and is about 45 meters high with eight floors,
housing both offices and residences.
</P>
<P>
The construction will be completed in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
who is on an official trip to Beijing, sent a message of
congratulations, pledging Xinhua's full support to and help for
the construction.
</P>
<P>
Present at the ceremony were Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira
and Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao
Affairs Office under the State Council.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Release 42M$ Credit to Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Finance Minister
Ronald Panza said today that the World Bank has decided to grant
Zambia 42 million U.S. Dollars credit to support its balance of
payments, according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
ZANA quoted Panza as saying here during a news release that
the decision was made by the bank during a meeting held Tuesday
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
This is the second tranche of the credit to be released to the
country. The first part was made available to Zambia in 1996 to
support the government's economic recovery program.
</P>
<P>
Panza said the bank's decision indicates that it considers the
country to be fully on course with the implementation of the
recovery program and recognised the government's good performance
and management of economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
He added that the bank is aware that good results have been
obtained under the program such as the dropping of inflation from
30 percent in 1996 to 15.7 percent during the first 11 months of
1997 and the restoration of the growth momentum of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's economic recovery program, which is designed by the
World Bank and the International Monetary Foundation (IMF), aims
at not only increasing economic growth but also at higher rates
of proverty reduction, a more efficent public sector, sustained
human resource investments and more effective safety net
provisions.
</P>
<P>
At present, two missions from the World Bank and IMF are
holding talks in Lusaka with the Zambian government on the
financing of the country's economic reform program for 1998.

<HEADLINE> Interview: "One Country, Two Systems" Successful in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Everything has proved that
Hong Kong continues to be as usual after its return to China on
July 1, said Douglas Henk, Chairman of the American Chamber of
Commerce (AmCham).
</P>
<P>
Five months after the handover, the Hong Kong people are
leading their lives in ways they are used to and the big changes
some people predicted before the handover did not take place after
July 1, Henk said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua at his
office.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, Henk has been an active member of the AmCham, which
is a non-partisan, non-profit business organization with a mission
to foster the development of commerce between the United States,
Hong Kong and the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He was elected chairman of the largest American chamber of
commerce outside the United States in 1996 for a one-year term
beginning January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Henk said many people predicted that the Hong Kong government
would operate under instructions from Beijing after July 1, but
the situation now has been exactly the opposite.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) is running Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
Henk, who has been working in Hong Kong for 11 years, said that
the Chinese characters for "crisis" mean both "danger" and
"opportunity" and he thought that the recent financial crisis in
Asia has offered China a good opportunity to tell the world how
the SAR government deals with its affairs in its own way.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government has shown its respect for and support to
the measures taken by the SAR government to defend the pegged
exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Henk, who has been to China's inland areas many times,
said: "The good news is that China itself is weathering this
economic crisis pretty well. For a couple of times China had to
go to the controlling mechanism to make sure that the economy did
not get overheated," Henk said. This should be good for Hong
Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, Henk led a delegation to Washington to
persuade U.S. President Bill Clinton to extend the Most Favored
Nation (MFN) trading status to China unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
He told Clinton that granting permanent MFN would stabilize
U.S.-China relations but revocation of MFN would damage Hong Kong,
undermining confidence during a critical transition period.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1969, AmCham has established channels of
communication and ongoing dialogue between the chamber and
governmental bodies in Hong Kong, the United States and China's
mainland.
</P>
<P>
AmCham often organizes seminars and conferences for business
executives at various levels. AmCham's Publications Department
has published a number of trade and commerce resource books on
doing business in the area.
</P>
<P>
Looking to the future, Henk is confident about Hong Kong's
prospects although he predicted that Hong Kong's stock market would
continue to be volatile for a period.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the SAR government will succeed in upholding
the pegged exchange rate. "The policy of the HKSAR to defend the
peg is quite right and the peg has been very good for Hong Kong,"
Henk said.
</P>
<P>
There are some pains now, but it will be good in the near
future, he noted. "If we were to drop the peg right now, the
short-term benefit will be relatively small and we will lose
whatever benefits we've gained pretty quickly."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is a place where people come for reasons that go
beyond Hong Kong, Henk said. There are a large number of
multinational companies which choose to put their regional
headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
There are five favorable factors of doing business in Hong Kong
-- geographic location, communications network, infrastructure,
free port and taxation, and most of the 1,200 member companies of
the AmCham plan to expand their business here, Henk said.

LANZHOU, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Changqing
Oilfield, in the Erdos Basin, on the juncture of Gansu, Shaanxi
and Shanxi provinces, and the Ningxia Hui and Inner Mongolia
autonomous regions, is expected to produce 3.3 million tons of
crude oil this year, 1.9 million tons more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield has 300 billion cu.m. of proven gas reserves,
making it the country's biggest, and oil reserves are expected to
reach 640 million tons, according to the Changqing Oil Exploration
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Its first oil well was sunk in 1907. In the past eight years,
the administration has increased exploration in Mesozoic to
Palaeozoic Era layers, and in gas exploration.
</P>
<P>
In this way, it has found 244 billion cu.m. of gas and can
produce 840 million cu.m. of natural gas a year and has built
China's biggest gas purification plant.
</P>
<P>
Recently completed pipelines began sending gas to Xi'an, the
capital of Shaanxi, in July, and to Beijing in August.
</P>
<P>
The administration has said it will work harder to bring its
oil output to five million tons by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Regulations to Protect Yungang Grottoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A set of regulations on the
protection of Datong Yungang Grottoes has been put into effect in
north China's Shanxi Province with approval from the National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The regulations involve financial resources for the protection
and maintenance of the grottoes, construction controls in the area
and other legal guarantees, said Wang Heng, head of the Cultural
Relics Research Institute of the Yungang Grottoes.
</P>
<P>
Yungang Grottoes is one of China's three major groups of
artistic grottoes, along with Dunhuang in northwest China's Gansu
Province and Longmen in central China's Henan Province, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 45 grottoes were built in the middle of the Fifth
Century. They contain 51,000 statues, mainly of Buddhist
figures. The tallest statue stands 17 meters high; and the
smallest, two centimeters.
</P>
<P>
Located in one of the country's major coal production centers,
the Yungang Grottoes has suffered serious pollution damage from
dust, cinders and acid rain stemming from the mining industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, structures such as factories and
residential houses which have nothing to do with the grottoes
should be removed from the protected area. The regulations also
ban demolition for mines and stone quarries.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles carrying coal and garbage must be covered when passing
the road in front of the grottoes, according to the regulations.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Japan Launches Six Major Reforms in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto ambitiously vowed in January to work for
wide-ranging reforms in the national bureaucracy, fiscal and
economic structures, the financial, social welfare and educational
systems, which attracted worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said if all reforms in the six areas turned out to be
successful, Japan would experience a third rejuvenation following
the Meiji Restoration and the post-war reconstruction of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The reforms were initiated because the problems in these areas
had fettered the social progress.
</P>
<P>
The current world economy has been undergoing a rapid
development toward globalization and an era is approaching when
manpower, products, capital and information flow freely and
businesses enjoy choices to favor countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The high costs of the Japanese economic structures, however,
have increasingly squeezed its industrial, employment and
financial sectors so that they are hollowing out.
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, the total trading volume of the Tokyo stock
market ranked first in the world in 1989, whereas it was less than
30 percent of that in the New York stock market in 1995. Owing to
a great number of restrictions on the Tokyo financial market, and
high tax rates and brokerage commission fees, the number of
foreign companies listed in the Tokyo securities market dropped
from over 140 in 1989 to about 70 in 1996. Many foreign banks and
securities firms have withdrawn their headquarters from Tokyo for
the same reason.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, low birth rates, the aging population and the
shrinking work force have depleted the vigor and vitality of the
Japanese economy and society, worsened financial operations and
created hidden perils to the economic growth and social security
system in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
To achieve a sustainable growth, the Hashimoto administration
viewed it imperative to perform a major operation on various
systems established in the post-war period of more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
This year, the Japanese government finally set the reforms in
motion and scored some initial achievements, which are as follows:
</P>
<P>
First, an administrative reform plan has been finalized which
aims at forming a "leaner government" and strengthening the
centralization of the government. The current 22 government
ministries and agencies are to be reduced to 13 by the year
2001. A related bill will be submitted to the Diet (parliament)
early next year and special bodies to streamline the bureaucracy
are expected to be set up next summer.
</P>
<P>
Second, Japan's House of Councillors passed a fiscal reform
bill which stipulates that the aggregate amount of central and
local government deficits should be reduced to less than three
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) by the 2003 fiscal
year and called on the government to stop issuing deficit-covering
national bonds.
</P>
<P>
Third, the reform on the financial system has produced a new
system of mutual penetration by banks, securities and insurances,
which allows banks to establish holding companies and relaxes the
restrictions of various commission fees. Starting from 1998, the
revised foreign exchange law will go into effect and all banks
will enjoy free convertibility of currencies.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, the "action plan" for the reform of economic structure
worked out by the cabinet in May will be revised by the end of the
year. Accordingly, electricity and gas prices will be duly lowered
and the restrictions on economic activities relaxed.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, as for the social welfare system, a reform bill on
medical insurance has been framed and will be submitted to the
next Diet. The bill mainly covers abolishing the medicine pricing
standards by 2000 and revising the medical awarding system. The
pension deliberative council has decided to start working on the
pension reform program early next year, to lower the amount of
pension and set an older age for people to receive pension.
</P>
<P>
Finally, an amendment act on educational reform, which aims to
implement a consistent junior-to-senior middle school system
starting from 1999, has been drawn up and will be submitted to the
next Diet for passage.
</P>
<P>
Despite the achievements, the long-delayed reform programs have
met strong resistance as they are not thorough and involve various
aspects of the Japanese society and the vested interests of many
people. This also helps explain why no leaders prior to Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had enough courage to put the package
of reform programs on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The release of the interim and final report on administrative
reform caused a public outcry. Some people thought Hashimoto's
move was nothing but a superficial operation. In view of the past
reform attempts, some people cast doubts on the government's
resolve and feared it would turn out to be "a change in form but
not in essence".
</P>
<P>
The Nihon Keizai Shimbun said that despite the achievements,
the administrative reform program will not go any farther but
result in the "overlapping" of the central government
organizations for its failure to specify how to decentralize the
power of the central government and how many staff members will be
cut. The newspaper pointed out that in so doing, it would also
create a hotbed for those who abuse power for personal gains.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties brought forth sharp criticisms. The leader
of the New Frontier Party Ichiro Ozawa said the administrative
reform and its program "fell short of their names and lacked
philosophy and essence." The Sun Party, however, viewed it as
nothing but "a sheer random change and stopgap". The Sankei
Shimbun said the government's administrative reform move was a
fine start and a poor finish.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, despite the formation of the reform act on the
fiscal structure, remarkable questions still persist such as the
separation of the Finance Ministry's fiscal and financial
functions and the reform on the pension system.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the current continuous bankruptcies in the
financial world have also intensified people's worries about the
possible premature end of the economic resurgence. The Japanese
media held that the key factor in the economic restructuring lies
in the government's daring and resolve to relax various
restrictions on the economy. The reform on the medical care system
and the reduction of the pension remain to be hard nuts to crack
in the reform of the social security system.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have noted an eye-catching point in the six reforms
advocated and pursued by the Hashimoto administration is that they
conceal a strategic intention to turn Japan into a political power
which will play a more important role in the international
political arena. The proposal raised by some Diet members of the
Liberal Democratic Party in the administrative reform debates to
upgrade the Japanese Defense Agency to Defense Ministry is an
ominous signal to people who wish the reforms will be able to be
carried forward in the direction of peaceful development.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Travellers Cheque Project Stranded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The west African travellers
cheque project has been stranded with the pullout of the
Francophone countries at the last minute, casting shadow over the
sub-regional effort to introduce a single currency by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Promoted by the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), ECOWAS travellers cheque is scheduled to be launched
this month as a prelude to the attainment of the goal of single
monetary zone.
</P>
<P>
However, at the meeting of the Committee of ECOWAS Central
Bank governors in Dakar, Senegal, the Francophone members (BCEAO)
withdrew their participation from the project over the failure of
all debtor banks to settle their arrears of debts.
</P>
<P>
According to Tony Ede, Nigeria's central bank spokesman who
was at last week's Dakar meeting, BCEAO attributed the pullout to
the refusal of some countries to settle their trade arrears
contracted through the west Africa monetary agency, the
sub-regional clearing mechanism.
</P>
<P>
BCEAO specifically asked that until full settlement of payment
arrears are made, it would not be possible to introduce the
cheques, Ede said, quoted by local press today.
</P>
<P>
BCEAO represents the interest of such Francophone countries as
Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote D'ivoire, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger,
Senegal and Togo.
</P>
<P>
Sources, however, attributed the sudden withdrawal of BCEAO
from the scheme to fear among the Francophone countries on the
possibility of a single currency in the sub-region that could
produce a negative effect on their CFA currency.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Times pointed out that France, which still wields
immense influence in these countries, might have dissuaded them
from participating in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
The idea of ECOWAS travellers cheque was mooted in 1987 as a
means of coordinating trade transactions with the sub-region.
Regional central bank governors finally agreed last August that
the checque would be launched this month.
</P>
<P>
The cheque, which would have been in circulation by January 28
next year, is also expected to usher in an era of common currency
to further boost economic activities within the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nigerian central bank spokesman, all
necessary arrangements have been made for the launching of the
cheque, including the printing of the cheque and other publicity
materials.
</P>
<P>
If BCEAO stands firm in its resolve, the money expended so far on
the project would be lost, Ede said.
</P>
<P>
But effort was said to be in top gear to woo back the BCEAO
group to the scheme in order to ensure the take off of the cheque
soon.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Financial Crisis Increasingly Deepens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Trading at the Seoul foreign
exchange market stopped just three minutes after the South Korean
won rocketed to 1,719.8 against the U.S. dollar today from the
previous day's 1,565.9.
</P>
<P>
The composite index at the country's stock market plunged 14.95
to 384.9 points as of 10:07 a.m. even though the 50 percent
increase in foreign investment limit, which was promised by the
South Korean government during negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout program, became effective today.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts here said the won would soon soar to 2,000
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
After the trading stopped at the foreign exchange market, South
Korean Deputy Prime Minister Lim Chang-yuel convened officials for
an emergency meeting at the Ministry for Finance and Economy to
discuss a measure of persuading IMF to deliver all of its promised
21 billion dollars in loan within this year in a bid to calm the
trembling financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based IMF planned to loan nine billion
U.S. dollars to South Korea before 1998.
</P>
<P>
The financially troubled country, which had ordered 14 merchant
banks' suspension of business operation in the past 10 days to
ease jitters in the financial market, said that it would need
about 20 billion dollars to boost foreign currency flows.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the South Korean people on TV this morning,
South Korean President Kim Young-sam said his nation would face
greater financial troubles if it failed to regain the trust of the
international community.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his nation should undergo a fundamental
restructuring in economy for a revitalization.

<P>
PARIS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- During a cabinet session on Wednesday, President Jacques
Chirac renewed his reservations over the draft law on 35 hour work
week, saying that "taking into account its obligatory and
constraining character, it will not be favorable for jobs." The
right-wing oppositions want to see in this text "the first error
of the government," and President of the Liberal Democratic Party
Alain Madelin is launching a campaign of "national billposting" to
"create a current of lucid opinion" against the plan.
</P>
<P>
-- After the merger of two Swiss banks, the UBS and the SBS,
the spectacular rising of the value of the shares of the National
Bank of Paris and Paribas at the Paris Bourse over the past few
days is feeding speculation on a merger between the two French
banks. Cutting costs and seeking a great size of world standard
are an imperative for international activities by banks
nowadays. Having risen by 52 percent since the beginning of the
year, the values of the shares of financial service institutions
in Paris Bourse are only experiencing the beginning of a hike.

<HEADLINE> ILO: Most Women Still Kept Away From Top Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Most women continue to suffer
from occupational segregation in the workplace despite rapidly
increasing rates of female education and participation in the
workforce worldwide, according to a report released here today by
the International Labor Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
While women have made substantial progress in closing the
gender gap in managerial and professional jobs, most female
managers worldwide are still barred from the top levels of
organizations, whether in the private or public sector or in
political life, the ILO said in its new report entitled Breaking
Through the Glass Ceiling: Women in Management.
</P>
<P>
"Glass ceiling" is a term coined in the 1970s in the United
States to describe the invisible artificial barriers, created by
attitudinal and organizational prejudices, which bar women from
top executive jobs.
</P>
<P>
"Almost universally, women have failed to reach leading
positions in major corporations and private sector organizations,
irrespective of their abilities," in spite of the overall progress
of women in middle management, said ILO labor expert Ms Linda
Wirth, author of the report.
</P>
<P>
The ILO will hold a tripartite meeting involving
representatives of governments, employers and workers from 20
countries worldwide on December 15-19 in Geneva to discuss the
findings of the report and examine the situation of working women
in management.
</P>
<P>
The participants will seek to develop action strategies
designed to provide more and better jobs for women, especially in
management and top-level positions.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Remains Depressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
remained depressed today, with stronger-than-expected employment
data overshadowed by ongoing concerns over depressed gold prices
and the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the session at 66.70 US cents,
down from 66.75 US cents locally late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank corporate foreign exchange senior dealer
Stavros Nitis said the Australian dollar rallied 25 points after
the release of the data, to a high of 67.15 US cents, but failed
to sustain its gains.
</P>
<P>
Total employment rose 70,900 to 8.52 million, adjusted, in
November from 8.45 million in October, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
The market had expected a rise of 15,000 in employment.
</P>
<P>
Australia's unemployment rate was a seasonally adjusted 8.4
percent in November, the same as in October.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the market's attention is really on unemployment
data, I think it's still gold, Asia, South Korea, Japan," Nitis
said.
</P>
<P>
"The best you can probably expect is a bit of a short squeeze,
or a knee jerk reaction higher in offshore trading tonight, but I
wouldn't expect the Aussie to go any higher than 67.40 US cents or
thereabouts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Colless from ANZ Investment Bank said that "the
interpretation is that, at the moment, employment may be picking
up but with the Asian crisis descending to new depths today people
feel that the Australian economy next year may suffer."
</P>
<P>
Against the Japanese yen this evening, the Australian dollar
was at 86.19 yen from 86.69 yen Wednesday. It was also at 1.1904
German marks from 1.1957 marks.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Drop in Asian Domino Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
lost ground today as a pre-emptive drop ahead of an anticipated
softening on Wall Street tonight in reaction to a further fall in
key Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index fell 37.9 points, nearly 1.5 percent
to 2,516.8, with the problems spread over resource and industrial
stocks, large and small.
</P>
<P>
It came off a low of 2,506.2 points as the Hong Kong and
Japanese markets continued to fall.
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely attributable to that (Asian and US fall),"
Henderson Charlton Jones dealer Scott Emms said.
</P>
<P>
"There are concerns in the States that this Japanese banking
and financial crisis is going to have impacts there," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Wall Street overnight stocks fell, led by technology and
banking shares, as Asia's economic crisis continued to erode
profits of US multinationals.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index closed 63.7 points down at 4,310.5,
with News Corp one of the main sufferers as its recent
improvements came to a halt.
</P>
<P>
ANZ Bank shares were sold down as investors shied at its large
Asian exposure. ANZ shares fell 30 cents amid general falls in
banking stocks.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank fell 23 cents, Commonwealth dropped 25
cents and Westpac fell 10 cents.
</P>
<P>
Resource stocks were again sold down on the Asian concerns,
with the all resources index down 17.4 points to 1,086.7.
</P>
<P>
WMC shares fell 19 cents while BHP shares dropped 18 cents to
its lowest level this month at 13.77 Australian dollars.

Gold stocks generally rose as the bullion price improved by
0.60 to 284.60 US dollars per ounce.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Current Account Deficit Shrinks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel's current account
deficit shrank in the first nine months of this year to 3.786
billion U.S. dollars, a 29.7 percent drop compared with the same
period in 1996, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted an announcement published by Israeli Central Bureau
of Statistics Wednesday as saying that it was a dramatic drop as
the current account deficit of the first three quarters in 1996
amounted to 5.387 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the reduction was the relatively stable
level of imports, while exports increased. For example, combined
imports of goods and services will total 32.827 billion dollars
this year in comparison with 32.444 billion dollars in 1996,
while exports will increase from last year's 22.419 billion
dollars to this year's 24.157 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In July, the Treasury predicted the current account balance of
payments will show a 3.6 billion dollars deficit in 1997, with a
reduction to 3.1 billion dollars next year.

TOKYO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo stock prices plunged
Thursday in reaction to a remark by the Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto that public funds will be used only for the

Most market participants took a wait-and-see stance, monitoring
talks on the proposal to float 10 trillion yen (7.7 billion
U.S. dollars) worth government bonds to restore confidence in the
deteriorating financial system.
</P>
<P>
But when they heard the reports that Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto wants to infuse public funds generated through bond
issuance only to stabilize the financial system, but not to prop
up the economy, disappointment spread in the market.

Hokkaido Takushoku Bank was today's most actively traded issue.

<P>
"We will also highlight the important role East Asia will and
has continued to play in the world as a whole," he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, President Jiang will meet with leaders of all the
heads of state or government at the meetings, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
China became a full dialogue partner of ASEAN in July of
1996. Bilateral consultation between China and ASEAN has been
conducted mostly at the foreign minister-level until now.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first high-level contact between ASEAN and
China. The issues on the agenda for discussion between Jiang and
leaders of the member nations will involve relations between ASEAN
and China toward the 21st century, including guiding principles,
political issues, economic issues, cooperation between China and
ASEAN as well as other issues of common concern, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders will issue a joint statement which is expected to
target a relationship of military trust and good-neighborliness
and the framework for an ASEAN-China relationship for the 21st
century, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
It will also embody a number of principles to guide this
relationship, as well as a number of detailed contents so that
this relationship will be characterized by all-round cooperation
and good-neighborliness, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the South China Sea, Chen said it is left over
from history, and good bilateral channels exist between China and
relevant countries for a peaceful settlement of any disputes.
</P>
<P>
China hopes, within the framework of shelving disputes and
entering the joint development, to gradually settle this issue,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Through consultations between China and ASEAN in recent years,
both sides are convinced that the maintenance of peace and
stability in the region serves as a precondition for economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have realized that the development of friendly
relations, cooperation, good-neighborliness and mutual trust serve
the overall interests of both sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides maintain that disputes over the issue of the South
China Sea should not affect the development of friendly relations,
nor should it affect peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, disputes between concerned countries should be
solved through bilateral talks and discussions from the
perspective of maintaining peace and stability, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that China supports the treaty on a nuclear-free zone
in Southeast Asia. However he said this nuclear-free zone includes
a continental shelf and an exclusive economic zone and that is why
China and other countries are now consulting with ASEAN members to
find a way that China can join the protocol of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to work to this end," he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Knesset Passes Law Against PNA Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset
(parliament) has passed a legislation preventing the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) from conducting census in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The legislation passed its third and final reading Wednesday
night by a vote of 26-11. The new legislation is an amendment to
the law on the implementation of the Oslo Accords, which was
aimed at preventing the PNA from taking a census in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The original legislation prevents the PNA "from opening or
operating offices or holding meetings within the state of
Israel," while the new version broadens this ban to include
"activities."
</P>
<P>
The government's speedy move to submit a Knesset bill to block
a PNA census in Jerusalem followed a suggestion by
Attorney-General Elyakin Rubinstein, who said there are loopholes
in the law, which is known officially as the Gaza/Jericho
Agreement Implementation Law (limiting of activities) passed by
the Knesset in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
It restricts PNA activities to Gaza and Jericho and bars any
PNA activity "of political or government nature...which does not
coincide with respect for Israel's sovereignty" in Israel
without the Israeli government permission.
</P>
<P>
But the law did not cover eventualities. While it could
prevent the holding of PNA meetings in Israeli areas, it could
not restrict the PNA from holding a census.
</P>
<P>
A ministerial committee headed by Justice Minister Tzahi
Hanegbi convened urgently Tuesday night to prepare an amendment
that could enable the Israeli police to prevent a PNA census in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The ministers approved the draft amendment by phone Wednesday
morning, since there was no time to convene the cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The issue of how the public perceives its stand on the unity
of Jerusalem split the Labor Knesset faction.
</P>
<P>
After heated discussions, the Labor members of parliament
decided Wednesday by a vote of 16-8 to support the government
bill.

<HEADLINE> Australian FM: Outcomes, Not Headlines, on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government is
seeking outcomes instead of headlines through dialogues on human
rights with China, visiting Australian Minister for Foreign
Affairs Alexander Downer said here today.
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe that the diplomacy that has been conducted
through the United Nations Commission on Human Rights toward China
has been successful," Downer told a press conference at the
Australian Embassy today.
</P>
<P>
"The old route was not productive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Australia was one of the first countries that quit
co-sponsoring resolutions against China before the U.N. Commission
on Human Rights, he said: "What the Australian government is about
are outcomes. We are not about headlines for the sake of
headlines. We are not about headline-hunting."
</P>
<P>
He said that Australia had a human rights dialogue with China
in August and will talk again in June. He said that Australia will
back-up the dialogues with an increasing number of
development-assistance projects in the broad area of developing
human rights in China, including a publicity network for promoting
women's rights.
</P>
<P>
"Initiatives like these are effective, practical and
cooperative, rather than just a bit of confrontation once a year
in the United Nations forum," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I mean that, OK, you have the confrontation. You have the
vote. Then what do you have?"
</P>
<P>
He said that because all seven attempts to pass a resolution
against China by the U.N. commission have failed, "China has been
able to demonstrate that it is able to use its influence on the
United Nations Commission on Human Rights and to overthrow, year
after year, a resolution.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking a more productive and more considered path to
the future.
</P>
<P>
"It requires a good degree of cooperation with China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"From our perspective, this relationship in the area of human
rights is progressing at this stage in a constructive way," Downer
said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation that many other countries, except the
United States, have followed Australia's lead on the human rights
issue.

<HEADLINE> PNA Seeks Closer Economic Links with Israel: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) would like to form a regional economic bloc with
Israel, according to a report of today's The Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Said Bamia, director-general of the PNA
Ministry of Economic Affairs and Trade, as saying that "the
Palestinians seek political separation and economic integration,
integration in the style of the European Union or EFTA (European
Free Trade Association)."
</P>
<P>
"We in the PNA have found that the development of economic
ties between the two private sectors is already significant,
especially for the development of the Palestinian economy,"
Bamia added.
</P>
<P>
But he criticized the Israeli customs authority's requirement
that "Israel" be marked on import documents as a destination
point, even in cases when the products are headed exclusively
for the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Israeli customs authority also requires Palestinian
importers to sign a guarantee that such products won't be sold
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The PNA, meanwhile, outlined a three-year development plan
for 1998-2000, which will be submitted today to the donor states.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for investments of 3.5 billion U.S. dollars,
of which 600 million dollars are designated for projects in
progress. Donor states also have been asked to approve a second
five-year assistance plan for the territories.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Military Leader Meets U.S. Pacific Commander  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of
China's Central Military Commission, met here today with Joseph
Prueher, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Command.
</P>
<P>
Extending a warm welcome to Prueher on behalf of the Chinese
Ministry of National Defense, Chi, also a state councillor and
minister of national defense, said Sino-U.S. relations have made
great strides over the past year, and that President Jiang Zemin's
visit to the United States has, in particular, turned out to be
very successful.
</P>
<P>
Describing Jiang's visit as a major event of great historical
importance in bilateral relations, Chi said that President Jiang
and US President Bill Clinton decided at the summit to make
concerted efforts to set up a 21st-century-oriented constructive
strategic partnership by way of increasing cooperation and
promoting world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The summit served to provide historical opportunities for
further increasing Sino-U.S. relations in the future, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to join hands with the US to remove all obstacles
to achieving the goal of increasing understanding, expanding
common grounds, developing cooperation and ushering in the
future," Chi said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Taiwan issue is still the most sensitive
problem in the bilateral relationship and that he hoped the United
States would observe the three joint communiques and statements
signed between the two nations, and in earnest follow its promises
on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Chi went on to say that the contacts between the two armies
have been rather active through joint efforts this year, and
bilateral relations are developing smoothly. He also said he hoped
this momentum would be maintained next year.

<P>
He was optimistic about the future of friendly contacts and
exchanges between the two armies, he added.

<HEADLINE> Australia Hails China's Grant of Destination Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government and
tourism industry today welcomed China's decision to approve
Australia as one of several officially designated tourist
destinations for Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard today welcomed the
approval, saying, "That will unlock the capacity for tens of
thousands of Chinese citizens to visit Australia without having to
get and make special passport arrangements."
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer earlier announced
that Australia has won approval from the Chinese government as a
designated tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
Downer said this would provide a substantial boost to the
Australian tourism industry and is an important development in
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Tourism Minister Andrew Thomson said the
minister looked forward to using his Mandarin language skills to
cultivate these bilateral tourism ties during his visit to China
in February.
</P>
<P>
"More than 54,000 Chinese visited here last year. But now they
can use ordinary passports and apply for tourism visas, there is
huge potential for growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) said the move would
create thousands of new jobs in Australia and make travel to
Australia easier for Chinese holidaymakers.
</P>
<P>
"Previously, travel to Australia by Chinese nationals had been
largely restricted to business-related visits," ATC Managing
Director John Morse noted in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This one decision will create thousands of jobs all around
Australia and bring into Australia a significant increase in
foreign exchange earnings."
</P>
<P>
The ATC would now accelerate plans to open an office in
Shanghai by early next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Task Force said the decision by the most populous
nation in the world to first expose their citizens to Western
culture using Australia would provide a welcome boost to a
flagging industry.
</P>
<P>
Australia has thus joined only five other destinations holding
approved destination status - Macao, the Philippines, Thailand,
Malaysia and Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Arafat to Meet in London: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are set
to meet in London next Thursday, the English daily The Jerusalem
Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu-Arafat summit will take place next Thursday
within 24 hours of their planned separate meetings with United
States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Paris and Geneva,
an Israeli Foreign Ministry official was quoted by the paper as
saying.
</P>
<P>
But the official conceded that there is possibility of a
last-minute change in venue or date for the Netanyahu-Arafat
summit, which if convened will boost the momentum for advancing
the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Radio reported today that the Israeli
government is prepared to hand over about 13 percent of the West
Bank to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in the second
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The report said this was according to a map drawn jointly by
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon after secret consultations.
</P>
<P>
Among the 13 percent handover, 10 percent come from Area C
under sole Israeli control and the rest from areas near Jenin,
Nablus and Hebron within the Area B, which is under Israeli and
Palestinian joint control.
</P>
<P>
Both Mordechai and Sharon are members of the four-man
ministerial committee charged with formulating the scope of second
redeployment in the West Bank and Israeli position on the
permanent talks with the PNA. The committee headed by Netanyahu
includes Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
The committee has already held three sessions to draw a map
on the further redeployment and final-status talks, but has
failed so far to produce an agreement due to reported inner rift
on Israel's security interests in the final settlement.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that while hardliners Netanyahu and
Sharon favored creating expansive security zones along the Green
Line and Jordan Valley, moderates Levy and Mordechai insisted
that such zones could be much smaller.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial panel is to reconvene this afternoon in
another effort to make progress before Netanyahu's scheduled
meeting with Albright next week.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who held two meetings with Netanyahu in Paris last
week, has been pressing Netanyahu to come out with a concrete and
more credible decision on the second redeployment. The United
States is reportedly demanding for at least 12 percent for the
second redeployment, rather than the 6-8 percent originally
proposed by Netanyahu.

</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair's honeymoon with
Labor MPs ended abruptly Wednesday night when he suffered a
huge revolt over plans to impose benefit cuts for single
parents.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's Labor government's determination to stick to
public spending targets inherited from the previous Tory
government will impose real cuts in resources on Whitehall
departments.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- A ban on the sale of lamb on the bone from animals
more than a year old was recommended by the European Union's
scientists Wednesday to avoid the remote risk that sheep
might be infected with mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- An Irish Republican Army murder Wednesday night
escaped from the high-security Maze prison by disguising
himself as a woman in an embarrassing prelude to today's
historic meeting at Downing Street between Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams and Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- British higher education is a big success compared
with that in most developed countries, according to an

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Launch Telecommunications Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
officially launch Telematika Indonesia, an ambitious
telecommunications project to prepare the country for entry into
the information technology era, an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The project consists of an integrated program to develop the
country's telecommunications infrastructure, its application and
human resources, Director General of Post and Telecommunications
Djakaria Purawidjaja said.
</P>
<P>
He said Telematika Indonesia is based on the Nusantara 21
information superhighway project developed by the Ministry of
Tourism, Post and Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
"Nusantara 21 is a concept and vision for the country's
telecommunications sector in the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
"On January 15, Telematika will be revealed, just wait and see.
We have prepared a very thick manuscript," he said. But he refused
to give further details.
</P>
<P>
Nusantara 21 is Indonesia's mega-telecommunications plan for
entering the information technology era. The project is designed

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Cotton Production Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has harvested a raw
cotton of 70,000 tons in 1997, a record high since 1975 when the
country won its independence.
</P>
<P>
Erasmo Muhate, director for the Mozambican Cotton Institute,
was quoted by today's Noticias as saying that the harvest is much
higher than the 53,000 ton goal set for the year.
</P>
<P>
The country turned out 51,000 tons of raw cotton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Muhate attributed the harvest to the prevailing peace and the
rising cotton price on the world market.
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 families are engaged in cotton planting on an
area of 130,000 hectares, and 11 companies are also planting
cotton on 147,000 hectares of land, with 10,000 employees
involved.
</P>
<P>
Cotton is Mozambique's third export commodities. It is
estimated that the country would export cotton valuing 33 million
U.S. Dollars this year, over the 28.5 million U.S. Dollars export
last year.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Egypt Sends Message of Defiance to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- When veteran Oscar Best Actor
Omar Sherif stood on the stage in front of the Hatshepsut Temple
in Luxor, southern Egypt Wednesday night, he was not just there
to perform. He has a message to convey.
</P>
<P>
"From beautiful Thebes which has infused the world with its
radiance; From the temples that gave man his sanctity of
soul,... the (Egyptian) people wish to express to the world their
deepest apologies and condolences," Sherif read out the message
at a ceremony at the scene of a cold-blooded massacre to
thousands of intense-faced audience who came to pay their tribute
to the victims of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
With candles and roses as well as music and arab songs, Egypt
mourned the 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians, who were killed
on November 17 in front of the Hatsheput Temple, an ancient
necropolis, in the Valley of Kings in Luxor, about 500 kilometers
south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
"Thebes Message to the World," conveying Egypt's anguish at
the massacre and determination to track down terrorism, was
written by Naguib Mahfouz, the 86-year-old Nobel Prize laureate
and prominent novelist who himself survived a terrorist attack in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The ancient city of Thebes, now known as Luxor, fell captive
by terrorism. As a result of the carnage, the city which includes
some of the world's greatest monuments, has been abandoned by
foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
As Sherif's deep voice flying in the whistling gust lapping
the Valley of Kings, a group of Nubian drummers donned in white
robes lined up on the platform of the temple, the very spot where
the killings took place, beating out a mournful tune amid the
swirling bonfire smoke and thick wind dust.
</P>
<P>
After Verdi's "Tears of Anger" was played by Egypt's best
symphony and orchestra troupes, the audience lit candles to
commemorate the victims and placed flowers at the scene of the
slaughter.
</P>
<P>
These were part of the funeral ceremony organized by the
Ministry of Culture and attended by 4,000 guests including
President Hosni Mubarak, a number of ministers and Islamic
leaders as well as senior diplomats of 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
Mitsuko Okazaki, the 26-year-old Japanese graphic designer,
nodded in agreement as she heard the message. She and her friend
Hiroshi Otani tripped on the requiem when touring the Valley of
Kings Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Okazaki told Xinhua that she heard of the Luxor tragic when
touring in Spain and then decided to continue her booked 10-day
trip to Egypt, a country "too great to be missed."
</P>
<P>
Looking around the car-loads of armed policemen and
numerous security checkpoints, the two Japanese young tourists
said they felt very safe.
</P>
<P>
However, they said, due to the lack of Japanese tourists,
EgyptAir, the Egyptian airline, has cancelled all its direct
flights between Tokyo and Egyptian cities, forcing the handfuls
of hardy tourists to transit in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Ten Japanese tourists, including a couple on their honeymoon,
were killed on November 17, when six Islamic militants slashed
and gunned down 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians in front
of the temple on the west bank of Luxor.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, as Luxor's big hotels reporting rarity of foreign
tourist groups and shop-owners sitting idle by the side of empty
streets, Luxor, the city that thrived on tourism, has turned into
a deserted city.
</P>
<P>
Ali, the owner of a gift shop taking a vantage place in front
of the temple, complained that the massacre has virtually killed
his business. "The last time I sold a three-pound stone necklace
was two days ago when an Egyptian preparatory school group came
here," he said.
</P>
<P>
As foreign tourists rushed to cancel their bookings, the
government has taken a string of measures including encouraging
domestic travelling to prevent a tourism crash. Tourism has been
Egypt's back-bone industry that brought in 3.6 billion
U.S. dollars and nearly 3.9 million tourists in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The "message" delivered at the requiem is just a beginning of
a series of cultural and popular events that Egypt will host in a
campaign to boost its image as a safe tourist haven, according to
Minister of Culture Farouk Hosni.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Indonesia to Jointly Manage Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Indonesia
today agreed to make joint disaster management and relief efforts
in the wake of July's haze crisis resulting from forest fires in
Indonesia and affecting several neighboring countries including
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding (MOU), signed by Malaysian
Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat and Indonesian Minister for
People's Welfare Utama Azwar Anas, spells out cooperation in joint
operations including deployment of personnel, equipment, search
and rescue missions, training and information exchange.
</P>
<P>
Under the MOU, covering a three-year period, Kuala Lumpur and
Jakarta will host alternate bi-annual meetings to discuss
disaster-related collaboration.
</P>
<P>
The MOU is automatically renewable for another three years
after the original three-year time span unless either country
chooses to terminate it by giving a six-month notice.
</P>
<P>
The MOU is crucial as next year Malaysia would be hosting two
key events, namely the Commonwealth Games and the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum conference, Mohamed said at a joint
press conference with Azwar after the signing.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully with the MOU, both sides can react promptly and
activate rapid response to future forest fires," Mohamed said.
</P>
<P>
Last July's haze in Malaysia forced the government to declare
an emergency in Sarawak, which lasted for 10 days, incurring
substantial economic losses.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the MOU requires both countries to control the
disaster at source at their own expenses and according to their
own laws and procedures.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, which also suffered extensively from the forest
fires in Kalimantan and Sumatera, has tightened its environmental
protection laws by banning open burning.
</P>
<P>
Azwar said the recent fires destroyed 165,361 hectares of
forest in Indonesia, causing damage estimated at 134 billion
rupiah (about 4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He added that Indonesia has learned a lot from the forest fires
and the resulting haze and has drawn up preventive measures to
avoid a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are under way to train national and local-level
authorities in forest fire management similar to those undertaken
to deal with volcanic eruptions, he said.

<HEADLINE> Monk Studies Chinese Literature in Yunnan University (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A young Buddhist monk, wearing
his gown and beads, gets in touch with common lives in a
university, but not theological one.
</P>
<P>
Monk Renkong from Panlong Temple, 60 kilometers from
Kunming-based Yunnan University, spends more time reading literary
works than chanting Buddhist scriptures.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first monk that Yunnan University has enrolled in
its 70-year history," said Xu Yangfu, director of the university's
Student Administration Office. Xu added that religious personnel
have always been allowed to receive a higher education.
</P>
<P>
Renkong, 24, already had studied for three years in Fujian
Buddhist Theological Institute, several thousand kilometers away
from his hometown.
</P>
<P>
"Freedom of religious belief in China includes equal education
opportunity among all people," said Na Zhonglun, director of the
Yunnan Provincial Religious Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Monks and nuns also can study in secular education
organizations in addition to theological ones, Na said. However,
most religious people still choose theological institutes, which
can provide special treatment and plan particular courses for
them, he said.
</P>
<P>
With his love of ancient Chinese literature, especially poems
in the ancient Tang and Song dynasties, Renkong persisted in
starting his university life as a literature major. After
obtaining support from his temple, he came to Yunnan University, a
renowned study center in southwest China.

<P>
For continuing his daily routine of scripture recital, Renkong
rented a room in a house near the university. He follows the
tradition of rising early.
</P>
<P>
After chanting the required religious works, the monk reads
ancient Chinese poems aloud and then goes to class.
</P>
<P>
"Reading those ancient poems will also make me attain a lofty
realm," said Renkong, who also likes plucking musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
"The school has required the same of Renkong as other students
in most aspects," said Yang Xingxing, his instructor.
</P>
<P>
"He is now doing well in his studies," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
"We were even reluctant to talk with him at the very beginning
because of his peculiar attire," said a classmate who added: "Now
we are getting along well with each other."
</P>
<P>
After all, he is a monk. He dislikes pop songs, most of which
he claims are about love affairs between men and women.
</P>
<P>
He said that love is unintelligible and painful. The young man
said he would not set foot in any love affair, which is forbidden
by Buddhist principles.
</P>
<P>
Panlong Temple is paying for tuition during his four-year
campus life, a cost of 10,000 yuan (about 1,200 U.S. dollars) each
year.

Renkong said he will return to the temple for the enhancement
of Buddhism.

KUWAIT CITY, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti newspaper today
described the talks between the Kuwaiti emir and Iranian leaders
in Tehran on the sidelines of the summit of the Organization of
the Islamic Conference (OIC) as "highly fruitful."
</P>

The talks between the emir and Iranian supreme leader Ali
Khamenei and Iranian President Mohammad Khatami were very frank
and open, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The talks which centered on strengthening regional stability

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today listened to the first progress report by Tung Chee-hwa,
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR). Tung assumed office on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Hong Kong SAR has maintained social and
political stability since its establishment. Although the
financial turmoil of Southeast Asia has had some impact on Hong
Kong, Hong Kong still remains economically healthy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong people continue to retain their original lifestyle
and enjoy a wide range of democracy and freedom, Jiang noted. All
these demonstrate that the SAR is operating smoothly under the
framework of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" with a high
degree of autonomy, prescribed in the Basic Law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hong Kong residents have a deeper understanding on
the "one country, two systems" policy and the central government's
determination to carrying out the policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that in the past five months the Hong Kong SAR
government led by Tung has made remarkable achievements through
hard work.
</P>
<P>
Facts show that Hong Kong people can administer their own
affairs and the SAR has a good beginning, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pledged that the central government will support Tung's
work, as well as the SAR in implementing the policies of "Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high-degree of autonomy in
accordance with the Basic Law. The central government will never
interfere in affairs belonging to the SAR's autonomy, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said he believes that with the strong backing of the
motherland, Hong Kong will have a better future.
</P>
<P>
Present on the occasion were Zeng Qinghong, director of the
General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China, and Liao Hui, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and

BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to an agreement between
the Civil Aviation Administration of China's Computer Center and
the US's Unisys Corp., signed on Tuesday, China's civil aviation
industry will soon be using a large CMOS computer that can handle
200 million customers annually.
</P>
<P>
The computer, valued at 15 million US dollars, is expected to
greatly improve the present computer network, and make it possible
to handle a larger number of air travelers in China over the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
The number of passengers has grown at a rate of roughly 20
percent annually for the past few years, and the figure reached
more than 55 million in 1996. This is expected to continue in
coming years, and the present network can not handle such a large
market.
</P>
<P>
The new computer was first put on the market earlier this
year. It is expected to arrive here late this month and will
go into trial operation next May.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets Cape Verde Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Rong
Yiren met with Cape Verde Defense Minister Ulpio Fernandes and his
party here today.
</P>
<P>
Rong expressed his belief that Fernandes' visit would advance
the mutual understanding and promote friendship and cooperation
between China and Cape Verde and their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Africa is a very important region in the world, he
said that the visits by President Jiang Zemin last year and by
Premier Li Peng this year showed the importance China attaches to
the development of its friendly and cooperative relations with
African countries such as Cape Verde.
</P>
<P>
China and Cape Verde, both developing countries, have much in
common, he said. The Chinese government hopes to enhance
communications in various forms with African nations to make
further advances in friendship and cooperative links in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Rong thanked the Cape Verde government for its "one China"
position and its constant support to China on human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the visitors on China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes said Cape Verde treasures the efforts made by the
Chinese government and its people to develop friendship and
cooperation with Cape Verde and other African countries.
</P>
<P>
Cape Verde hopes that western Africa would strengthen the links
with China, which is a great cooperative partner, in politics and
economy and other areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cape Verde and other African countries also value China's
experience in the field of economic development, and it would be
significant for African countries to make use of that experience,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that China could continue to trust Cape
Verde's support on China's great cause of reunification and human
rights issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda President Yoweri
Museveni advised human right activists to go to rural areas to
help local people to eradicate poverty, The Monitor reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech read yesterday by Emmanuel Kirenga, the
State Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs, the
president told the newly created Human Right Peace Center
(Huripec) that there is greater need for human rights' education
and empowerment in Ugandan rural areas than at an university.
</P>
<P>
"The center must not confine itself only to dissemination of
human rights principles on the campus, it must reach down to the
grassroots", the president said.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating Huripec at Makerere University here, the state
minister said Uganda now is on the road of constitutional
democracy and no single individual can divert the process.
</P>
<P>
A strong civil society keeps government on its toes and
enables the development of a health dialogue between the
government and its people, he added.
</P>
<P>
Huripec is co-funded by Makerere University, the United States
Agency for International Development program and the faculty of
law of Makerere University.
</P>
<P>
Huripec is the second of its kind in Africa after South
Africa's.

<HEADLINE> China's Shipping Industry to Adopt ISM Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China plans to adopt the
International Safety Management (ISM) Code among local companies
engaged in international shipping, in a bid to improve management
quality and viability in the world market.
</P>
<P>
By July 1, 1998, 103 of the country's 250 international
shipping companies' vessels should meet the code's requirements.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Baochen, an official in charge of shipping safety from
the Ministry of Communications, made the announcement at today's
closing session of the Second Conference of the China Shipowners'
Association.
</P>
<P>
The ISM code is designed for the safety of management and
prevention of pollution among local vessels involved in
international shipping, Zhang said, and to improve the managerial
level of international shipping companies and the safety of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the code would force the country's shipping
industry to give up its traditional managerial model and prevent
management errors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang stressed that implementation of the code should be
regarded as a crucial reform in the shipping industry.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China has 250 firms involved in
international shipping, with more than 1,300 vessels with a total
capacity of 23 million tons, ranking fourth in the world.

<HEADLINE> China Shipowners' Association Conference Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The three-day Second China
Shipowners' Association (CSA) Conference closed here today.
Vice-Minister of Communications and CSA Honorary Chairman Liu
Songjin and Chairman Chen Zhongbiao were re-elected.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, representatives from 177 CSA members held
heated discussions on the country's shipping market, the
difficulties local firms are facing, industry reforms and the role
of CSA.
</P>
<P>
The participants shared the view that Chinese shipowners have
to survive in a growingly competitive market by depending on their
own efforts. They also expressed the hope that the government would
take measures to create an equal and fair market environment for
shipping companies.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jiafu, managing director of the Tianjin branch of the China
Ocean Shipping Company and president of the Tianjin Shipowners'
Association, said that the only way out for local shipping firms
is to adopt scientific managerial methods and modern enterprise
systems.
</P>
<P>
He asked local shipowners to avoid vicious domestic competition
and to be united against overseas competitors.
</P>
<P>
Participants agreed that CSA should play a bigger role as the
bridge between shipowners and the government, serve as the
industry's information center and coordinate local and foreign
shipping companies.
</P>
<P>
The association was founded in Beijing in 1993, with the
country's major international shipping firms as its members.
</P>
<P>
CSA Secretary General Liu Xuezhong told Xinhua that China has
more than 250 international shipping companies with more than
1,300 vessels operating on international routes and a capacity of
23 million tons, fourth in the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- More efforts are expected to
be made in Vietnam to eliminate hunger and alleviate poverty.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) has said recently that
greater efforts should be made to achieve the target set by last
year's CPV congress of reducing the country's rate of poor and
hungry households from 20-25 percent to 10 percent by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
To reach the target requires a reduction of 300,000 poor
households a year.
</P>
<P>
The party also called for the gradual implementation of the
policy to cut all or part of school fees and grant scholarships
for children from poor households, and to cut all or part of
medical charges for poor people.
</P>
<P>
The campaign to eradicate hunger and reduce poverty has spread
nationwide and helped reduce the number of poor and hungry
households by two percent annually.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still nearly 2.9 million households, which
account for 19.3 percent of the country's total households.

<HEADLINE> China to Make Yangtze River Silting Model at Chongqing Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Early next year China will
make a model on silting of the section of the Yangtze River in
Chongqing Municipality early next year.
</P>
<P>
The model will provide a basis for discussions on harnessing
the Yangtze River in southwest China at Chongqing, a port on the
upper and middle reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
Downstream of Chongqing, construction of the Three Gorges water
control project, the world's largest, is under construction. When
the project is completed in 2009, the upstream area of the dam will
be flooded and become a big reservoir, which is expected to cause
a major silting problem upstream, especially in the Chongqing Port
area.
</P>
<P>
The model will be used for feasibility research on silting law,
plans for comprehensively harnessing the port area of Chongqing
and navigation around the port city.
</P>
<P>
A normal design will be adopted in making the model which will
be built according to a scale of 1:50. The model will cover the
main port areas of Chongqing, including the section from Qiezi
River to Tongluo Gorge, and the section from Jialing River at
Chaotianmen to Jingkou.
</P>
<P>
The model will be 400 meters long, 7 meters wide and 2 meters
high. It will be placed in the Southwest China Water Transport
Engineering Science Institute of Chongqing Jiaotong College and it
is expected to be completed in August of 1998.

<P>
The city of Huichun, which is located at the heart of the
triangular area, used to be at the bottom of the barrel.
</P>
<P>
But since 1992, when the central government declared it an open
city, a highway network has been taking shape, and the city's
three border crossings have a combined cargo handling capacity of
900,000 tons, and in the first half of the year, had nearly
250,000 people and over 370,000 tons of goods.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese are busy building a highway linking Huichun with
Changchun, the capital of Jilin Province, and Fangchuan, a small
town near Russia and the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Russia has completed work on a railway to China that will
become operational next year and has expanded a border crossing
with a 240 million-US-dollar bank loans from Japan.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has spent 50 million US dollars annually on the Rajin
Pioneer Free Economic and Trade Zone and 120 million US dollars of
foreign capital has been used for the construction of hotels and
telecommunications facilities there.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK plans to introduce 7 billion US dollars worth of
foreign investment to electrify a railway link with Quanhe, a
Chinese border city. In 1995, local companies opened regular
service to Rajin and Chongjin and to Vladivostok in Russia,
cutting the distance, freight costs and amount of time needed to
move goods from Japan and ROK.

BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese chef in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region made more than 65,500
noodles as thin as hair by stretching a dough weighing one
kilogram (2.2 pounds), according to a report in the Shanghai-based
"Xinmin Evening News", which was seen here earlier.
</P>
<P>
The total length of 65,536 noodles was 99,600 meters after they
were connected one by one, breaking a Guiness World Record, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Li Enhai, the record-setter who is working at the Five-Star
Mansion Hotel of Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang, spent only 20
minutes on stretching the noodles.
</P>
<P>
The 49-year old chef used nothing but water and salt to knead
the dough. "But proper temperature and moisture content in the
dough are very important," the chef said.
</P>
<P>
Li has practiced the noodle-stretching skill for more than 20
years, including eight years in China's best kitchens in Diaoyutai
State Guesthouse and the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Hand-stretched noodles have been a favorite on Chinese dining
tables for centuries, even though the large variety of
machine-made noodles provide residents with greater convenience
today.
</P>
<P>
Noodles are an important part of various celebrations like
birthday parties, because many people still believe that long
noodles symbolize longevity.

MANILA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine House of
Representatives Speaker Jose de Venecia, the ruling party's
candidate for the 1998 presidential elections, has ruled out the
possibility of choosing a non-party member as the vice president
bet.
</P>
<P>
"That is technically possible but it is impossible," he said,
explaining that the ruling Lakas-NUCD party has three aspirants to
the vice-presidency and they all meet the staunch qualities of a
good partner, the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The three aspirants are Interior and Local governments
Secretary Robert Barbers, Senator Leticia Shahani and Justice
Secretary Teofisto Guingona.
</P>
<P>
The speaker made the statement in response to reports that
Senator Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, leader of a small opposition
party, wants to join him in the elections.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia added that since he is from Luzon, the northern part
of the country, the vice presidential candidate must be from the
central or the southern part to create a balance in governance.
</P>
<P>
This also rules out President Fidel Ramos' sister, Senator
Leticia Shahani, from the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party is expected to announce its candidate for vice
president during the weekend or early next week.

DHAKA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh plans to end all
forms of child labor by the year 2010, according to State Minister
for Labor and Manpower M. A. Mannan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the three-day 12th Asian regional meeting of the
International Labor Organization (ILO) being held in Bangkok,
Thailand, Mannan said his country has almost eliminated child
labor in ready-made garment industries and it plans to abolish it
in hazardous industries by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh respects workers' fundamental rights and has so far
satisfied six core ILO conventions, reflecting the country's
commitment to the principles of freedom of association and
collective bargaining, prohibition of forced labor and
non-discrimination, the state minister was quoted by the national
news agency BSS today as saying.
</P>
<P>
Though the other conventions are yet to be ratified, there has
been substantial implementation and reflection "in our laws and
practices," he added.
</P>
<P>
The International Program on Elimination of Child Labor has
been under effective implementation with donor assistance since
1995, Mannan said, adding that the program will remove the last
vestiges of child labor in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Despite substantial improvement in the employment situation,
Bangladesh has 11 million unemployed at present, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The government has given priority to the expansion of
vocational and technical education for skill development in a bid
to overcome the problem, the state minister said. "Such programs
will continue in the future."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Stronger Over News on Soeharto Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah closed
higher against the US dollar Wednesday as the market calmed down
following news that President Soeharto would attend the informal
ASEAN summit in Malaysia, currency dealers said.
</P>
<P>
But the stock market lost 2.2 percent as state-owned securities
houses, which had been actively buying stocks for the last four
days, ran out of investment resources, stockbrokers said today.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said here today that spot rupiah strengthened
to 4,380 against the dollar in the afternoon before closing at
4,410, compared with an opening of 4,350/4,380.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto was rumored to be seriously ill Tuesday,
sending the rupiah to a historic low of 4,600.
</P>
<P>
The market received further relief after Minister/State
Secretary Moerdiono announced that President Soeharto would attend
next week's informal summit of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has been resting at home on doctors' advice since
returning last week from a strenuous 12-day trip that took him to
Namibia, South Africa, Canada and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
While the rupiah was stabilizing, share prices on the Jakarta
Stock Exchange dropped 2.2 percent, with the composite index down
9.559 points to close at 415.937.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Meet 3-percent Deficit-DDP Ratio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Italy will meet the crucial
3-percent deficit-GDP ratio called for by the Maastricht Treaty
for entry into the European single currency at the end of the
year, a study by the employers' association Confindustria reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of the deficit-GDP ratio was achieved through
higher taxes and lower interest rates, not through a
much-hoped-for reform of public spending, Confindustria said in
the report on the country's economic picture.
</P>
<P>
Confindustria also predicted that in 1998, the ratio will dip
below 3 percent to 2.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Lung Operation Performed on Fetus in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The first-yet operation on a
six-month-old fetus was conducted in Costa Rica one month ago,
Dr. Gerardo Escalante, head of the maternal-fetal medicine unit of
the Calderon Guardia Hospital, disclosed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Escalante said that so far, both mother and the daughter, who
will be born on February 12, are in good health.
</P>
<P>
The fetus had a congenital malformation in her right lung,
which was detected during the fourth month of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
A six-centimeter-long cyst was in the fetus' lung, which had
begun to exert pressure on the heart and the lung itself.
</P>
<P>
Doctors told the 35-year-old mother that only an operation
could save the baby from death prenatally or at birth.
</P>
<P>
The objective was to remove the liquid produced by the cyst
inside the lung by suction and install a valve to drain the liquid.
</P>
<P>
A catheter was inserted into the mother's abdomen to reach the
fetus, and the process of puncturing the fetus's back and lung was
especially delicate, said the doctors.

<HEADLINE> Railway Line Spurs Economy in Mountainous Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The economic picture in
backward southwestern Baise prefecture is looking up with the
opening of the Nanning-Kunming Railway trunk line.
</P>
<P>
Located in a mountainous region of landlocked Guangxi
Autonomous Region, the area's 3.08 million residents are mainly
Zhuang, Yao, Miao and other minority people. The prefecture has
been listed as one of the 18 poor areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, rich mineral resources have been verified here.
Reserves of bauxite, copper, crystal and brown coal rank first in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Construction started in 1990 on the western section of the
Nanning-Kunming Railway, which stretches 272 kilometers through
Baise for 30 percent of its total length.
</P>
<P>
The railway has greatly enhanced the local economic potential
by bringing large amount of raw materials and equipment to the
region and transporting non-ferrous metals, building materials and
machinery to other regions.
</P>
<P>
The Pingguo Aluminium Plant, built shortly after the railway's
construction, has become the largest aluminium production center
in China with a capacity of 300,000 tons of aluminium oxide and
100,000 tons of electrolytic aluminium.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture along the railway has also developed
rapidly. Production centers with an area of 66,667 hectares each
have been set up for mustard greens, sugarcane, bamboo, camellia
tea, Chinese chestnuts and fruit.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in Baise began to draw the attention of
overseas investors in 1995 with 61 foreign-funded projects along
the Nanning-Baise section of the railway with an investment of
118 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
During the last seven years, 1.24 million impoverished Baise
people have risen above the poverty line. In the first half of
this year, Baise's Gross Domestic Product increased 11.2 percent
from the same period last year. The per-capita annual income now
averages 1,435 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Coffee-Growing Areas in Colombia Shrink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's coffee-growing areas
decreased by 14 percent from 1980 to 1997, a survey issued by the
national coffee information system said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that the total coffee-growing area was
1,009,579 hectares in 1980 but dropped to 869,157 hectares by the
end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The reduction was partly due to diversification programs, which
have had a significant impact on the use of land for income
purposes and the protection of biological diversity in
coffee-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey revealed that in Colombia's 16 coffee
growing states, the number of coffee growers had increased since
1970.
</P>
<P>
The number of families engaged in coffee growing grew to
566,230 in 1997, from 392,945 in 1970.
</P>
<P>
The increase was due to coffee-growing areas being divided into
smaller and smaller fields which descendants of traditional
coffee growers had.

communications and telecommunication carried out.
</P>
<P>
He noted having a "permanent capital" in Akmola, part of the
openning up policy of Kazakhstan, is because of Akmola's important

well as mechanical breakdowns, lack of pilot training, the result
of military budget restraints, is the main cause for the
continuous crashes.
</P>
<P>
The Mig Series aircraft, imported from the former Soviet Union,
is the mainstay of the Romanian Air Force. Three-hundred Mig-21s,
account for the biggest proportion.
</P>
<P>
Romania is technically upgrading to these planes with aid from
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Three-party Consortium Taps Nuclear Possibilities in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Westinghouse Electric Co of
the United States has organized an international consortium with
Spanish and Japanese partners to tap the Chinese nuclear market,
it was announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted analysts as saying the group is
expected to be a powful competitor when China selects its next
partner for nuclear power projects because it can combine
financing from the three countries.
</P>
<P>
However, no signing for a direct project between Westinghouse
and China will emerge before the US Congress officially lifts
the sanction on the export of nuclear power technology to China,
which is hopeful to take place some time earlier next year.
</P>
<P>
According to Charles Pryor, president and chief executive of
the U.S. company, Westinghouse "is doing a lot of preliminary
design work for nuclear projects in China."
</P>
<P>
The company is co-operating with the China National Nuclear
Corp. (CNNC) to develop a new generation of nuclear power plants
-- called the CAP600 megawatt -- for the next century.
</P>
<P>
Such design will combine the technology of Westinghouse's most
advanced AP600 megawatt design and the AC600 megawatt design
developed by CNNC.
</P>
<P>
Pryor said at a nuclear power localization seminar held by the
State Planning Commission Wednesday in Beijing that his company
has submitted a highly detailed localization plan to the
commission.
</P>
<P>
Westinghouse has already transferred steam-generating
technology to Shanghai Boiler Works for the second phase of
construction of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in Zhejiang
Province, sources said.

<HEADLINE> Modified Cotton Seed to be Used in North China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-U.S. joint venture
producing genetically modified cotton seed started operation
yesterday in Shijiazhuang, capital of north China's Hebei
Province, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The company, named Hebei Jidai Cotton Seed Technology Co, has
4.2 million U.S. dollars of capital and was jointly formed by
US-based Monsanto Corp., Delta and Pine Land Co. and Hebei
Provincial Seed Co..
</P>
<P>
The seed breeding company will sell the genetically modified
cotton seed, called "Boll-guard", to local farmers, who are
expected to plant the seeds in 200,000 ha. of field in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hebei Province now has about 4,733 ha. of cotton grown out of
the genetically modified seed introduced from the United States,
which proved a 20 percent yield increase from the ordinary
local seeds in the past three years of pilot planting, said Ji
Junqun, director of the Hebei Provincial Seed Administration
Station.
</P>
<P>
With the use of new seeds, an average rural household can save
about 4,500 yuan (about 540 U.S. dollars) per ha. of cotton
compared with the expense of using locally developed seed.
</P>
<P>
Monsanto will launch two or three joint ventures in an effort
to explore the possibility to localize modified seed of such
plants as wheat and corn, according to Paul Johanson. head of the
Agricultural Sector of Monsanto China Operations.

<HEADLINE> Hardaway to Be Sidelined 10 Weeks after Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Orlando Magic's Penny
Hardaway will be sidelined for eight to 10 weeks after undergoing
arthroscopic surgery for a small cartilage tear in his left knee
in Orlando, Florida.
</P>
<P>
The injury had kept the Magic All-Star guard out of nine games
this season as he was placed on the injured list this week.
</P>
<P>
The surgery was performed at Houston's St. Luke's Hospital by
Dr. Walter R. Lowe of the Baylor Sports Medicine Institute, who
expects Hardaway to make a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
The same knee injury forced Hardaway to miss 23 games last
season. The Magic was 7-1 without its star before Wednesday
night's game against the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
Orlando filled Hardaway's roster spot with Carl Thomas, a guard
averaging 18.1 points per game for the Fort Wayne Fury of the
Continental Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
The Magic also placed guard Nick Anderson on the injured list
with a broken left hand. He was hurt Monday night in a 95-86
victory over the Philadelphia 76ers.

<HEADLINE> China to Protect Ancient Papermaking Skill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hotian City of northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is trying to retain an
ancient papermaking skill by making it known to more and more
people.
</P>
<P>
Reyaz Ihan, a 62-year old Uygur woman who is the owner of the
city's only mulberry papermaking workshop and is believed to be
the only successor of mulberry paper making, receives lots of
visitors to her workshop every summer.
</P>
<P>
Apart from increasing her income, the move is designed to
encourage more local people to pick up the mulberry paper making
skill popular in the area for more than 500 years, a city official
said.
</P>
<P>
Mulberry paper is made of bark of mulberry trees and the
mulberry paper had been the main writing material in the Hotian
before the founding of new China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Reyaz Ihan said her papermaking tool is handed down from her
grandfather-in-law and she expected to hand it down to the coming
generations.
</P>
<P>
She said, in the past, the mulberry paper was well sold but
things all changed with the spreading of the modern white paper.
</P>
<P>
The old woman explained that her paper would only be used  to
wrap up traditional Chinese medicine or lining of hats of Uygur
people.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the move, a villager has already started to learn
the papermaking skill from the old woman and she often goes to the
villager's home to offer her instructions.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Regulate Cultural Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China is to draft a series of
laws and regulations to better manage its theaters, arts galleries
and other institutions, the Ministry of Culture announced.
</P>
<P>
The documents include regulations on the management of the
entertainment industry, on business in the fine arts sector as
well as on the supervision of the cultural market, says Meng
Xiaosi, vice-minister of culture.
</P>
<P>
The cultural sector is flourishing, she said. However, there
exist certain "unhealthy tendency and out-of-order operation," she
added. The fundamental way to solve the chaos in the cultural
market is to use law, she noted.
</P>
<P>
China's introduction of a market economy has enabled the people
to have more choices and voices in the cultural sector, but there
are also new problems such as rampant copyright piracy,
money-worship philosophy, and the selling of pornographic and
violent materials.
</P>
<P>
Meng said that local governments and departments have worked
out many regulations to deal with the situation since
1993. Currently, the cultural market is regulated mainly by
regulations drafted by the State Council. The future goal is to
map out a general law on the management of the cultural market,
according to Meng.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the State Council promulgated a regulation on
the management of commercial performances, the first example that
the state uses the weapon of law to regulate the sector.
</P>
<P>
Meng urged cultural officials and workers to better manage the
market by investigating big cases, and form management networks at
both the central and local levels.

COLOMBO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition
party, the United National Party (UNP), has decided not to contest

<P>
HARBIN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The 14th Ice and Snow Festival
will open to tourists on Jan. 5 in Harbin, capital of northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The festival, which began in 1985, has become a traditional
winter event in the city, attracting tourists from home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, about 30,000 people attended last
year's festival. An Ice and Snow Festival official said even more
people are expected to attend this year.

sculpture, but also entertainment programs and trade and economic
activities, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The ice and snow make the city look like a crystal world. The
Children's Garden is decorated as a fairy kingdom and many works
of art are on both sides of the European-style Central Street, a
symbol of the city. More than 100 scenic spots and the winding
river through the city all take on a new look with ice ornaments.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Denies Cancelling Friendlies With Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian High Commission in
Nigeria denied Wednesday that its government has cancelled two
friendly matches with the Super Eagles, Nigeria's national soccer
team.
</P>
<P>
The high commission said in a statement here that the matches
will go on as scheduled and that media reports to the effect that
the matches had been put off were false.
</P>
<P>
"The government of the Republic of Zambia has already
authorized the issuance of visas by the high commission in Lagos
and the South African High Commission too, has authorized their
transit visas," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Bizwayo Nkunika, the Acting Zambian High Commissioner was
quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria as saying that arrangements
have been concluded for the smooth transit of the Super Eagles
through Johannesburg to Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
"The Zambian High Commission in Pretoria has been directed to
meet the 31-man contigent and facilitate their smooth transit," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The trip to Lusaka of the Nigerian players is to be financed by
the Zambian government. They are expected to play against the
Zambian national team on Sunday December 14, in Lusaka, and again
in Kitwe on December 17.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the Zambian government has cancelled
the matches because of the sports sanctions on Nigeria imposed by
the Commonwealth, of which both Nigeria and Zambia are members.
</P>
<P>
Nkunika said the Zambians would use the friendlies to prepare
for the African Cup of the Nations Cup scheduled for February in
Burkina Faso and would also use the opportunity to avenge its
defeat by Nigeria at the Tunisa '94 Cup of Nations final.

<HEADLINE> Computer Associates, Fujitsu Launches Jasmine Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Computer Associates
International, Inc. (CA), the leading business software builder of
the United States, and its Japanese partner Fujitsu Limited
Wednesday jointly launched the first pure object-oriented database
software Jasmine.
</P>
<P>
"For years, object technology has been long on promise and
short on reality, forcing programmers to learn complex languages
and cobble together nonintegrated databases and tools," said CA
Chairman and CEO Charles B. Wang.
</P>
<P>
"That's why we teamed with Fujitsu, developer of world class
object database technology, to jointly develop and globally market
this breakthrough technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jasmine differs from all other database management products on
the market today, Wang said. It offers programmers and
non-programmers an object-oriented platform ideally suited for
dynamic multimedia applications in their business management.
</P>
<P>
Since it is so powerful in managing multimedia data, including
bitmaps, animation, audio and full-motion video, the CA people
called it a "revolutionary product."
</P>
<P>
It supports such a wide range of "next-generation applications"
from electronic commerce to industry-specific applications in
sectors such as insurance, financial services, health care and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Jasmine as one of the cornerstones of its vision for
the future, Computer Associates places high hope on the new
product. The company sold 4 billion U.S. dollar worth of software
in 1997. That still makes Computer Associates arguably the third
largest software company after Microsoft and Oracle.
</P>
<P>
CA now pays greater attention to its presense on the Asian
market. It just set up a new technology center in India.
</P>
<P>
On cooperation between CA and its Chinese partners, Wang said,
"one of the things CA and I myself can help is to bring into the
Chinese market what a role of technology is. It's a great
tool. Don't reinvent everything. There is tremendous
technology. How do you add value above and how do you use it."
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of things CA can do with the Chinese, he said.
Apart from bringing Chinese students and business people over to
study in CA, the company is also asking some software developers
in Shanghai to write codes for it, said Wang, who founded CA in
1976 and brought it to the public in 1981.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese market place and talent base are tremendous," he
noted. But the Chinese have less knowledge about the market and
they need to understand how to develop and market their products.
</P>
<P>
"Jointly and cooperatively, we can do a lot," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Georgia to Resume Border Demarkation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Georgia have agreed
to immediately resume the work of border demarkation commissions.
</P>
<P>
Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov was
quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying Wednesday that the
agreement was reached during Georgia's Deputy Prime Minister
Valery Serov's visit to Tbilisi on December 8-9.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Georgian Foreign Ministry made a statement,
saying that Georgia would discontinue the work of the commissions
in protest of the moving of a Russian border post into Georgian
territory.
</P>
<P>
During Serov's visit, Russia agreed to move the post back to
its former position, thus setting the stage for the restarting of
the delimitation work.
</P>
<P>
But Russia insists the agreement does not mean it was wrong in
moving the post in the first place.

<HEADLINE> Police, Military Officers Behind Kidnappings: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A group of middle-ranking
police and military officers have been tagged by intelligence
reports as the alleged brains behind kidnap and bank robbery
syndicates operating in Metro Manila, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Appearing before a hearing of the House Committee on Public
Order and Security, Justice Secretary Teofisto Guingona said on
Wednesday that these officers are now under surveillance and would
be arrested within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the officers supplied guns, stolen vehicles, map
and mobile telephones to abductors, adding that these kidnap
groups can be classified as "the sophisticated organized groups",
armed with cellular phones and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
However, he further assured the public by saying that "not all
kidnap and bank robbery syndicates have military and police
officials as protectors."
</P>
<P>
Vice President Jose Estrada claimed earlier that more than 50
percent of the country's kidnap-for-ransom cases were undertaken
by rogue policemen and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The government recently launched a drive against kidnappers
after the Filipino-Chinese living here staged a series of protests
against rampant kidnappings. Police said they had busted three
kidnap gangs and rounded up 28 kidnap suspects.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Former Defense Chief Urged to Run for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of former Philippine
Defense Secretary Renato de Villa are urging him to run for the
presidency next year even without the backing of President Fidel
Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The Multisectoral Volunteers for Renato de Villa, which claims
a membership of over one million, said the former defense chief
should "consider breaking away from Mr. Ramos and run
independently", the Manila Chronicle reported today.
</P>
<P>
De villa lost out Monday night to House of Representative
Speaker Jose de Venecia in the race for the endorsement of
President Ramos as the standard bearer of the ruling Lakas-NUCD
party.
</P>
<P>
Another group of de Villa backers, the Citizens for de Villa
for President Movement, said it is calling on the Liberal Party to
support the presidential bid of de Villa.
</P>
<P>
Oscar Landicho, a spokesman for the movement, said de Villa
will make a provincial tour starting next week in order to "feel
the pulse of the people."
</P>
<P>
He added that the movement had started negotiations with
Liberal Party president Raul Daza. The party is affiliated with
the Lakas-NUCD in a coalition.
</P>
<P>
So far it is unknown whether de Villa would follow his
supporter's advice. He and seven other presidential aspirants of
the ruling party earlier agreed to support whoever President Ramos
picks up.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ramos dismissed as mere "grumblings" the threat
of de Villa's supporters, advising them to talk to de Villa first.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States, while
always grading human rights records of other countries, is facing
a wide range of human rights violations at home, said a study
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A poll, commissioned by Human Rights U.S.A. to mark the
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
indicated that 63 percent of Americans said that the poor were
usually discriminated against in U.S. society.
</P>
<P>
Half or more of the 1,004 adults surveyed last month also named
the disabled, the elderly, gays and lesbians and native Americans
as routinely discriminated against, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
Forty-one percent of those surveyed said black Americans
routinely suffered discrimination, and 70 percent of blacks
themselves said they felt discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
In grading their country's performance in human rights, three
in four Americans said that if the country's founding fathers
returned today they would be "disappointed with the way things are
going in the country," Peter Hart Research Associates said.
</P>
<P>
Hart told a news conference Wednesday that Americans felt U.S.
social programs fall short in affordable health care,
environmental protection and helping the poor.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, U.S. President Bill Clinton talked about human
rights violations in a number of foreign countries in a speech
marking the anniversary of the 1948 declaration.
</P>
<P>
However, Lyn Beth Neylon, director of Human Rights U.S.A., said
Wednesday, "The survey shows we have human rights problems right
here in the United States."

<HEADLINE> International Standards For Coding Tibetan Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The "compilation of characters
of the Tibetan language code" has passed two national reviews and
has been designated as an important part of the international
standard, China's leading newspaper "People's Daily" reported this
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new development of the language code has marked a new stage
for the Tibetan language in modern information exchange, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The development of the code which was jointly sponsored by the
State Technical Supervision Bureau, State Nationalities Affairs
Commission and the Ministry of Electronics has laid a foundation
for the processing of the Tibetan language and exchanges through
computer networks.
</P>
<P>
The code standard will be applied next year, which will allow
the Tibetan language to play a larger role in the development of
information technologies and international exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Most of China's ethnic groups have languages of their own and
some of them have their own writing, the major tools for social
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
China has attempted to preserve and improve its ethnic
languages, standardizing them for the modernization of information
processing technologies.
</P>
<P>
Application systems have been developed for processing the
language information of such ethnic groups as Mongolian, Tibetan,
Hui, Korean, Hani, Dai and Yi.
</P>
<P>
The languages of these ethnic groups are applied widely in
publishing, education, publicity and administration.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China is establishing a
forestry park near northwest China's major coking coal producer
in Shizuishan, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The park, covering three sq.km., will have well over 260,000
trees representing 115 species, expansive grasslands and an
80,000-cubic meter reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the park will greatly improve the local ecological
environment, and will at the same time protect the urban area and
cultivated land from windstorms and sandstorms.
</P>
<P>
The park will also help to conserve water and improve the
quality of the atmosphere, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Shizuishan, which is known as the "Coal City" and is one of
China's new industrial cities, is famous for its production of
high quality anthracite.
</P>
<P>
The city suffers from serious pollution resulting from
inadequate precipitation, a lack of vegetation, strong winds and
dust.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Organize to Compete on Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A kind of newly emerging economic
organization -- farmers' associations -- are gaining popularity in
the rural areas of northwest China's Shaanxi Province. The
associations have been successful in helping farmers compete
profitably on the market.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October, the province had set up 8,192 farmers'
associations in planting, breeding, processing and transporting
activities that include 760,000 people.
</P>
<P>
By joining the organizations, farmers expect to reduce natural
and market risks. The household-based economic activity has been
considered by local farmers fragile and less competitive in the
market economy which is taking shape in rural China, said Shi
Zhicheng, director of the province's Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
The number of farmers' associations is increasing and, more
importantly, the organizations are also expanding their service
areas from seed supply to providing techniques, processing and
marketing support.
</P>
<P>
In Fengxiang County the Fruits Growers' Association has opened
branches in 16 townships and 40 villages. It has trained more than
10,000 farmers and helped sell 80 million kilograms of apples
during the last four years.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has adopted some measures to promote
the organizations' healthy development, Shi said.

GUILIN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Science and technology projects
have helped members of minority ethnic groups living in
poverty-stricken areas in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and local
governments jointly established a technology demonstration zone
and a technological development company to aid poverty-stricken
areas in the Huanjiang Maonan Autonomous County. The company has
allowed local farmers to move to the special technology zone, and
obtain loans of farming tools, fertilizer and seed plants, as well
as extra subsidies for living expenses in order to develop
agriculture and increase their personal income.
</P>
<P>
The company has also allocated a certain portion of profits and
taxes to construct public infrastructure, including roads,
schools, water treatment and power generation plants.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company has provided a number of services such
as providing farmers with seedlings, marketing agricultural
products and sponsoring advanced technology training programs.

<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- At least one terrorist prisoner
is believed to have escaped from Northern Ireland's top security
Maze jail near Belfast, local press reports said tonight.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed republican prisoner, who was serving a life
sentence, was reported missing after a Christmas party for
inmates' children at the jail.
</P>
<P>
"The Northern Ireland Office has received reports from the
Prison Service that it would appear that a prisoner has gone
missing this evening," said a government spokesman
</P>
<P>
He added that "checks and investigations are proceeding. A
further statement can be expected from the Prison Service later."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a major security operation has been
mounted and the motorway which passes close to the jail has been
sealed off.
</P>
<P>
The prison is reportedly Europe's most closely guarded
guerrilla jail and is used to hold around 300 republicans and
about 270 loyalist paramilitary members.
</P>
<P>
The suspected jail break happened on the eve of historic London
meeting between British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Gerry Adams,
president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican
Army (IRA).

<TEXT>
<P>
CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan,
a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee, arrived here at 8
a#.m#.local time (3 a.m. Beijing time) today, to start his
four-day official goodwill visit to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Li, also chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, is making the
trip at the invitation of the government of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech at the airport, Li said that this year is
of great significance in the relations between China and New
Zealand because the year witnessed the 25th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries
and centenary of the birth of Rewi Alley, an envoy of friendship
from New Zealand and a great friend of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to note that in the 25 years, especially in
recent years, our relations have scored positive achievements in
such fields as politics, economy, science and technology, culture
and education," Li said.
</P>
<P>
China and New Zealand, both located in the Asia-Pacific region,
hold common and similar views on many major international and
regional issues, Li said, adding that there are both sound basis
and broad future for the further development of China-New Zealand
relations, which not only conform to the fundamental interests and
common aspirations of the two countries and peoples but also
contribute to the development and stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government has all along attached
importance to its relations with New Zealand, and "I come to New
Zealand with the wish to strengthen friendship, enhance mutual
understanding, expand cooperation and promote the all-round
development of the bilateral ties."
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to exchanging views with leaders of New
Zealand on our bilateral ties and international and regional
issues of common interest," Li noted. "I hope and believe that,
through the joint efforts of the two sides, this visit will
promote the further development of China-New Zealand friendly
relations and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Li came to New Zealand from the Ho Chi Minh City of Vietnam
after a four-day visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in this largest city of the South Island of New
Zealand, Li visited a sheep farm and met with Richard Johnson,
chairman of Canterbury Regional Council.

<HEADLINE> U.S. not Concerned over Yeltsin Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
today that there was no reason for concern over the health of
Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Both the State Department and the White House denied they are
concerned over the health of Yeltsin, who has been admitted to a
sanitarium with a viral infection.
</P>
<P>
"We have no reason to believe that he's not at the top of his
game, that he's in good health. He has recovered amazingly well from
the surgery he had (last year)," State Department spokesman James
Foley told a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
A White House official traveling with U.S. President Bill
Clinton in New York told reporters who asked about Yeltsin's
health: "Given the information we have, we don't see reason for
concern."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Kremlin said Yeltsin had an acute
respiratory viral infection resulting from a cold and would stay
at a sanitarium outside Moscow for 10 to 12 days.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who has established a warm relationship with the
Russian leader in a series of summit meetings, was sending a note
wishing him well, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore also said there appeared to be no need
for "undue concern" about Yeltsin's health.
</P>
<P>
"If what his doctors are saying is accurate, and we believe it
is. this is a temporary matter from which he will quickly
recover," said Gore.

<HEADLINE> Britain Rejects Spanish Proposal on Gibraltar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Labor government has
turned down a Spanish proposal for shared sovereignty over
Gilbraltar, which is now a British colony.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after meeting his Spanish
counterpart Abel Matutes, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said that the status of Gibraltar could only be changed with the
consent of the Gibraltar inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
Cook made it clear that "Britain will not compromise on the
question of sovereignty against the interests of the people of
Gibraltar."
</P>
<P>
"It is important that the people of Gibraltar should not be put
under siege," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Matutes, whose country has long claimed sole
sovereignty over Gibraltar, told reporters that under the Spanish
proposal, Gibraltarians could hold both Spanish and British
citizenship and would enjoy wide-ranging legal and government
powers.
</P>
<P>
"The local authority would enjoy far more governmental powers
than its does currently. The people of Gibraltar would continue to
enjoy the financial, tax and customs advantages they do now,"
Matutes said.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Cyprus Begins in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A two-day conference began here
today to discuss the prospects for Cyprus's accession to the
European Union (EU) and the U.S. initiative on the protracted
Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The conference, entitled "The Cyprus Problem: Prospect of
Solution," which has been organized by the Greek Coalition of the
Left and Progress, is attended by political personalities,
representatives of Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot parties and
academics.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the conference, Nikos Konstantopoulos, president of
the Greek coalition, said that the new developments created new
opportunities to solve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998, especially after the island's presidential
elections, would be a critical one for the Cyprus issue, he said,
adding that the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots should create
conditions for dialogue aiming at finding a solution to the
problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Haralambos Christophorou, Cyprus ambassador to
Greece, said that the Cyprus government wants to cooperate in
seeking a solution to the problem. He urged the Turkish Cypriots
to take the same position.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initiative was expected to intensify after next
Feburary's presidential elections, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
In June, Richard Holbrooke was appointed U.S. presidential
emissary for Cyprus as part of efforts by Washington to help
settle the problem, but no substantial progress has been made so
far.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern part of the island after a pro-
Athens coup.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad
today called on Muslim states not to compromise with Israel as it
is forbidden by Islam.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the the Eighth Summit of the Organization of
Islamic Conference, Assad said that Muslim states should halt
their compromises with Israel. Appeasement has only encouraged
more extremism on part of the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
He said "compromise with Israel is forbidden by Islam, because
Israel is a regime which has violated Islam, Muslims and their
sanctities."
</P>
<P>
He said "Israeli aggression against Arabs is an Islamic as
well as Arab problem, therefore we all have to cooperate to
reverse the aggression and to restore Arabs' rights."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the expansionist policies of Israel, Assad said
the Arab-Israeli conflict had been a major detriment to the world
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
He warned of the threat posed by the Israel's huge arsenal of
weapons supplied by the U.S. and other major powers and said that
"while the Israeli military power is enhanced, the Arabs are under
constant pressure to be void of any means to defend themselves."

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Three-Year EFF Credit for Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year credit for Panama
equivalent to about 162 million U.S. dollars under the Extended
Fund Facility (EFF).
</P>
<P>
The credit is provided in support of the Panama government's
medium-term economic reform program for 1998-2000.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to deepen and broaden structural reforms
within the context of continued prudent fiscal policy and low
inflation, with the objective of promoting sustainable output and
employment growth and reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
The program also aims at raising GDP growth to 5 percent by
the year 2000 from 2.5 percent in 1996, while holding inflation at
about 1.5 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
The EFF is an IMF financing facility that supports medium-term
programs that seek to overcome balance of payments difficulties
stemming from macroeconomic imbalances and structural programs.
</P>
<P>
Panama joined the IMF in March 1946. Its quota is about 202
million dollars equivalent and its outstanding use of IMF
financing currently totals about 132 million dollars.

The dollar also fell against the German mark as both currencies
were hurt by the yen's surge during European trading.
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell as much as 1.29 yen in overnight trading as

boldly to shore up the financial system. But sentiment quickly
ebbed once traders arrived at work in New York.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 129.28
Japanese yen, down from 129.59 late Tuesday. The dollar was

<P>
ATHENS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Luxembourg Prime
Minister Jean-Claude Juncker today discussed with his Greek
counterpart Costas Simitis the coordination of economic policies
and support for the political independence of the European Central
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks, Juncker, current president of the
EU Council, said that he hoped the 15 member states could reach
agreement on the issue of an informal monetary council.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Luxembourg could contribute to building a bridge
between the founding members of the Euro currency and those who
are not, which in any case would be able to meet informally.
</P>
<P>
All European countries, he stressed, could become EU members
only if they fulfilled the conditions established in Copenhagen,
particularly those concerning respect for human rights and good
neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
Juncker said that EU's expansion to include central and eastern
countries and Cyprus was a different issue to EU-Turkey relations.
</P>
<P>
He added that negotiations with all eleven prospective members
should begin at once, but that each country should be dealt with
separately according to its degree of readiness.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said that as many countries as possible should be able
to join the EU, so long as certain rules were observed with regard
to safeguarding European principles.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that the accession talks between the EU and
Cyprus should begin as scheduled in April next year.

LUXOR (Egypt), December 10 (Xinhua) -- A memorial service was
held today in Egypt's southern resort Luxor for the victims of the
shocking terrorist attack here last month.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Egyptian Ministry of Culture, the service,
under the theme of conveying a "message from Thebes to the world,"

was attended by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Prime Minister
Kamal El-Ganzouri, several cabinet ministers and a representative
of a U.N. organization in Cairo.

The service began with the martyr anthem played live by the
side of a torch erected on the site of the incident, followed by
the orchestra and choir singing Verdi's memorial service
masterpiece and Egyptian patriotic songs.
</P>
<P>
Observing a two-minute silence, the lights on the site went dim
until darkness enveloped the whole arena, and every participant
lit a candle solemnly moving towards the torch.
</P>
<P>
The renowned Egyptian novelist and Noble Prize Laureate Naguib
Mahfouz addressed a recorded "message from Thebes to the world,"
which denounced the terrorist act.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Protest Against Israel's Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Nearly a hundred mothers of
Lebanese prisoners held in Israeli jails today staged a sit-in
protest against human rights abuses by Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The protest was staged in front of the Beirut office of the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on the occasion
of the International Human Rights Day.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the demonstrators, Salim Hoss, a current parliament
member, said that the human rights day is the day for the Lebanese
people whose rights are violated by Israeli occupation of their
territory.
</P>
<P>
Israelis infringed on human rights by nearly everyday's attack
on south Lebanon and the western sector of Lebanon's Bekka Valley.
</P>
<P>
Those held in Israeli jails did not commit any crime but are
opposed to Israel's occupation, said Hoss.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Israelis are using all kinds of ways to torture
and ill-treat the prisoners and cut off their contacts with their
families.
</P>
<P>
Israelis did not permit the ICRC staff to inspect the
conditions of prisons and barred their relatives from meeting them
or sending letters to them, he said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed on the international community to pay attention to
the prisoners and seek to release them with the help of the ICRC.
</P>
<P>

Lebanon run by its militia ally South Lebanese Army, while 50
other Lebanese are held in Israel.

said that although the Sun dominates the flow of energetic
particles to Earth by spewing both protons and electrons,
Jupiter's huge magnetic field bombards Earth with electrons at
times when the Sun is relatively quiet. And Jupiter's electrons
pack even more energy than high-energy electrons from the Sun.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Likely to Host Next Islamic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A Qatari delegate to the eighth
Islamic summit said here today that his country has been chosen to
host next summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC) in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The official, identified as Ahmad Ali, said all the other
member states of the Islamic body supported Qatar's bid for
hosting the ninth summit and a decision in this regard will be
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Still reeling from last month's Doha economic conference,
which was boycott by a majority of Arab countries, Qatar launched
the bid for the next OIC summit partly as an fence-mending effort
with the Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Qatar had insisted on holding the U.S.-advocated Doha meeting
despite strong opposition from most Arab states, which loathe
sitting with Israel under one roof while the Middle East peace
process was on the brink of collapse due to Israel's hardline
policies.
</P>
<P>
Ali said Qatar's bid was unchallenged. "We have the ability to
host the summit, and the Doha meeting, a world-class conference,
is a proof," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi
said several other countries have also offered to host the next
Islamic summit.
</P>
<P>
No decision on the venue has been made so far, he said, adding
that the OIC leaders will reach a consensus on the issue Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to Arab boycott of the Doha meeting, almost all OIC
members attend the Islamic summit in Tehran, much to the
annoyance of the U.S. which repeatedly accuses Iran of sponsoring
terrorism and has tightened the screws of sanctions against
it.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Islamic Summit Differ on Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran holds different views on
the Middle East peace process with the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC), an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Our policies on the so-called Middle East peace process is
different with that of the OIC," Spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi told
Xinhua correspondents on the sidelines of the OIC summit.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran is opposing the peace process while some
other OIC members hold moderate views on the issue, though all the
OIC members consider Israel as a threat to the Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has announced its opposition to relations between
Islamic countries and Israel, a "usurper of Arab lands" as they
described, proposing those Islamic countries which have recognized
or establish ties with Israel to reconsider their minds.
</P>
<P>
However, the OIC foreign ministers' meeting last week only
adopted a draft resolution on opposition to military cooperation
between Islamic countries and Israel, since many OIC members
supported ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi also noted that there are still some other
differences among the OIC members like that on the issue of
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that the differences will be discussed in Thursday's
closing debates, and the OIC leaders will try to reach an
agreement on the Tehran Declaration.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi dismissed the claim that the Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel's scheduled leaving the OIC summit Wednesday
evening is in protest against the draft resolution on opposition
to Islamic countries' military cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey is blamed by OIC members for its military
cooperation with Israel, but the criticism is "understandable for
Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the 55 OIC members are attending the three-day
summit during which they described Israel as the "Zionist regime,"
and "occupier of Qods (Jerusalem) which is holy to
Muslims.
