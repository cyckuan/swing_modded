   NEW YORK _ In a crash course in New York racial politics,
Hillary Rodham Clinton observed Martin Luther King's birthday in a
flurry of celebrations from Brooklyn to Harlem on Monday, tying
King's legacy to her own political ambitions while denouncing what
she and some ministers asserted was a racial divide marking Rudolph
Giuliani's years as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, the Republican mayor and Mrs. Clinton's probable
opponent in this year's race for U.S. Senate, kept a more limited
schedule, skipping annual celebrations that he had attended in the
past in favor of smaller events organized by black supporters.
Giuliani's aides said he declined invitations to the larger events
after learning that Mrs. Clinton would be there and concluding that
they would be politically charged.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton took advantage of Giuliani's absences, giving three
audiences a prepared speech in which she talked about hearing the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. speak when she was a child in a white,
middle-class suburb of Chicago and implicitly denounced Giuliani's
leadership style.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, speaking in soft and measured tones at the Harlem
headquarters of the Rev. Al Sharpton, said: ``If I am given the
privilege of representing the people of New York, I would want to
be defined as someone who unites, not divides. I want to be defined
by who I lift up, not by who I push down.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a hectic and tense day that often verged on chaos,
providing Mrs. Clinton with a vivid glance of what it is going to
be like for her to be a candidate for public office in New York. A
huge press entourage accompanied her, intent on observing the
spectacle of her first public appearance with Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the celebration of King's birthday also served to
highlight the delicate situations facing Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani
in a prominent election. Giuliani's decision to avoid the kind of
appearances where he has been booed in the past reflects that his
standing among black voters is at a particularly low point, coming
after a succession of demonstrations organized by Sharpton that
protested police tactics.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Clinton, visiting Sharpton carried definite political
risks, and had been resisted by some of her advisers. For all
Sharpton's influence among black voters _ as evidenced by the
procession of senior Democratic elected officials who stopped by to
pay tribute to him Monday _ he remains a highly unpopular figure
among many white voters, and is frequently a target of Giuliani's
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said through aides that he had chosen to miss the two
other events Mrs. Clinton attended _ at the Convent Avenue Baptist
Church in Harlem and the Brooklyn Academy of Music _ because the
organizers had also invited Mrs. Clinton. In the past, Giuliani has
been booed at those events, including when he was running for
re-election against Ruth W. Messinger in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani attended a dinner organized by the Congress of Racial
Equality Monday night, and he presided over a muted prayer
breakfast at Gracie Mansion with black clerics, black Republican
leaders and administration officials, where he spoke briefly, and
reverentially, about King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the two best ways to reflect him, so we don't begin to
interpret him in a way in which he really didn't intend,'' Giuliani
said, ``is to, No. 1, to read what he said rather than what other
people have to say about it, and No. 2, to pray, because I think
that's the thing that he would tell us to do. He would tell us to
pray, in order to get guidance.''

AGILE SUSPECT CAUGHT AT CUSTOMS CHECKPOINT

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A fugitive who is believed to have eluded the police
in midtown Manhattan last Tuesday by leaping from a 19th-story
window to the ledge of an adjacent building was returned to New
York City on Monday and charged with murder after being stopped on
a bus crossing into Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that the suspect, Jaquan
Muhammad, was carrying a hand-written journal and three weapons
that linked him to a string of knifepoint robberies in Manhattan
and the stabbing death of a Hunter College custodian in Brooklyn
last month.
</P>
<P>
   The journal ``was very descriptive,'' said Dennis Murphy, a
spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said Muhammad, 21, of Brooklyn, was detained at 6:15 a.m.
Sunday at a border checkpoint on the Peace Bridge, which spans the
Niagara River from Buffalo to Ontario. Muhammad arrived there on a
Greyhound bus, Murphy said, but was refused entry into Canada after
he was asked for identification during a routine immigration check.
</P>
<P>
   He showed a passport in the name of Naftali Triplett, who is
wanted for an assault unrelated to the other crimes. Canadian
border agents who searched his luggage then found a sword and two
knives, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad, whose sprint through the streets and his leap from an
East 53rd Street office tower led some newspapers to refer to him
as Spider-Man, is suspected in 13 knifepoint robberies of Manhattan
pedestrians, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Customs Service officials said Muhammad continued his efforts to
dodge the authorities even after he was detained on Sunday. After
being briefly left alone by the border agents who were questioning
him in Buffalo, the officials said, Muhammad shinnied into the
crawl space of the ceiling in a Customs holding room. He was
recaptured after officers poked the ceiling panels with a
broomstick, causing him to fall to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Muhammad has been secured in leg irons and officers
were ``watching him like a hawk,'' a law enforcement official said
and he arrived on a flight to New York on Monday under police
guard. ``He will remain in police custody as the investigation
continues, and will participate in police line-ups in front of the
victims,'' said Sgt. Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   New York police detectives had been sent to Buffalo to bring
Muhammad back after the Customs agents examined the diary found in
his luggage, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a comparison of the diary notes with unsolved crimes,
Muhammad was charged on Monday night with second-degree murder in
the death of Paul Farrell, 47, a custodian and father of three who
was stabbed and slashed numerous times in Lincoln Terrace Park in
Brooklyn the day after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman, Detective Robert Samuel, said that Muhammad
had stabbed Farrell to settle ``a dispute,'' but offered no more
details.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials said the sword Muhammad was trying to spirit
into Canada appeared to be the weapon used to kill Farrell, and
that it and the two knives had been turned over to the New York
police, who later charged Muhammad with criminal weapons
possession.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they were investigating whether to charge
Muhammad with any of the robberies.
</P>
<P>
   The police also confiscated notes and reading material that
included threats against Israel and the United States. But they
said Muhammad was not believed to be a terrorist and that his notes
were ``just rantings,'' in the words of a Customs official.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials said they believed the name Naftali Triplett
was an alias, along with another name, Umar Ahmed, which appears on
a Pennsylvania driver's license Muhammad was also carrying.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond W. Kelly, commissioner of the Customs Service, said the
border agents' searches led to a solid case against Muhammad. ``The
thoroughness of the Customs inspectors in going through the
suspect's materials was critical to his apprehension,'' he said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after the robber made his leap from the building, New
York City's police commissioner, Howard Safir, was asked about the
investigation after a breakfast sponsored by the Citizens Crime
Commission. The early details were dramatic: the robber had landed
on the 18th floor air-conditioning unit of an adjacent building,
climbed through a window into a law office and sprinted for an
elevator.
</P>
<P>
   During the car ride down, he robbed a sandwich deliveryman of an
apron, shirt and cap, and, so dressed, slipped into the crowd when
the elevator reached the ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   Safir cautioned reporters not to glamorize such an escape,
saying the robber was merely someone who jumped from a window when
cornered. The so-called Spider-Man, he said, is ``a common criminal
who happened to do something pretty stupid.''

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
After pulling a 19-16 upset at Indianapolis in an AFC divisional
playoff, the Tennessee Titans are the biggest thing in Nashville
since country music.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When they returned home after the victory over the Colts, which
propelled them into Sunday's AFC Championship Game at Jacksonville,
the Titans were met by a crowd estimated at 9,000 that halted
traffic for miles and threatened to shut down the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredible,'' said running back Eddie George, who set a
franchise playoff record with 162 yards rushing against the Colts.
``It was like we were the Beatles or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as free safety Marcus Robertson put it, there seemed to be
more fans at the airport Sunday night than watched the team play at
the Liberty Bowl in Memphis in 1997 after it left Houston to play
its first season in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans survived the mob at the airport. If they can survive
the Jaguars for the third time this season, they will play in their
first Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville is coming off a 62-7 victory over Miami that
improved its record to 15-2. The Titans dealt the Jaguars both
losses, 20-19 and 41-14, but still couldn't overtake Jacksonville
and win the AFC Central title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seed of doubt's been planted in their minds, but we know
it's not going to be easy,'' Titans guard Bruce Matthews said.
``Because we know them and they know us, there shouldn't be any
surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Beating a team three times in one season isn't rare. Since the
NFL/AFL merger in 1970, seven teams have defeated an opponent three
times in one season, including five in the 1990s. But never in
history has one team accomplished the three-peat on the road, which
the Titans would have to do against Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars running back Fred Taylor, who rushed for 135 yards and
scored two touchdowns against the Dolphins, is fired up about the
opportunity to face the Titans again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on a mission,'' Taylor said. ``Any guy on this team who
lets that 62 points stay in his head is crazy. It's not going to be
easy at all.''
</P>
<P>
   After experiencing so much bad luck during their history as the
Oilers, the Titans believe they have been reborn and that divine
intervention has played a part in their reaching their first AFC
Championship Game since Bum Phillips' 1979 team lost at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the hand of God is on us,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Added middle linebacker Barron Wortham, ``Only God knows if
we're a team of destiny. We're just a team of puppets.''
</P>
<P>
   To outside linebacker Joe Bowden, there's no question the Titans
are getting help from outside the team, and he doesn't mean from
the officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we're a team of destiny,'' Bowden said. ``So many
crazy things have happened in our favor. In the past, things like
that went against us. This season, a lot of things have been going
our way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans have won back-to-back playoff games by playing
old-fashioned football. Coach Jeff Fisher relies heavily on the
running of Eddie George and solid defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret,'' Fisher said. ``Our philosophy is to run the
ball. You run the ball when you're not supposed to be able to run
it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Indianapolis game, the players were surprised when
Fisher awarded the game ball to Matthews rather than George, who
scored the only touchdown on a 68-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with what Bruce has done the last 17 years,''
Fisher said. ``Bruce has been on this team forever, and he's never
been to a championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews, left tackle Brad Hopkins and right tackle Jon Runyan
are three of the starting linemen who are playing throwback
football. They are punishing drive blockers who help George control
the clock.
</P>
<P>
   In the playoffs, George has accounted for 57 percent of the
Titans' offense with 106- and 162-yard performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pride myself on being able to do that,'' George said. ``To
have the opportunity to do it is great. It's a challenge, and we
want to meet that challenge head on.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy won't change just because the Titans are playing
the Jaguars again. Fisher will continue to do the same things on
both sides of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that we know Jacksonville,'' said Titans
strong safety Blaine Bishop, who led the team in tackles against
the Colts. ``When you've got a chance to beat a team three times,
you must be pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans are good, but so are the Jaguars. Their confidence is
sky-high after the way they manhandled the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Miami guard Kevin Donnalley, who played for the Oilers and
Titans, has a warning for his former teammates and the rest of the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd better take notice,'' Donnalley said. ``Fred Taylor is
back, and their defense is outstanding. Other teams better look
out.''

AL GORE, BILL BRADLEY DEBATE IN IOWA ON MINORITY CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Working to top each
other's concern for minorities, Vice President Al Gore and former
U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley dueled Monday with promises of including
African-Americans and Hispanics in their presidencies.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Democrats used the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday to repeat
their support for affirmative action, their promises to end racial
profiling by police agencies and their desire to choose a Hispanic
as the next Supreme Court justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will make sure,'' said Bradley, ``the administration that I
lead reflects the diversity of the country for one reason _ because
that will make for a better administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, in turn, boasted that the Clinton-Gore
administration had put more women and people of color in top
government jobs than any of its predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have...brought about one of the strongest economies in
history not in spite of diversity, but because of diversity,'' Gore
said. ``It is past time for us to remove the old barriers, move
past the old prejudices, and truly become one America.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's debate, the ``Iowa Brown-Black Presidential Forum,''
was designed for Iowa's black and Hispanic voters to question the
candidates on issues of race. And although Bradley has made race
relations a centerpiece of his campaign _ he regularly refers to
lessons on race gleaned from his career in the National Basketball
Association _ he and Gore differed little on issues Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, each challenged the other's commitment to overcome the
country's struggles with race. The sharpest of their exchanges came
over racial profiling, the practice by law enforcement of
identifying criminal suspects primarily by the color of their skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the first day of the Gore presidency, I would issue an
executive order to ban racial profiling,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Bradley chided the vice president: ``We have a president
now. You serve with him. I want you to walk down that hallway, walk
into his office, say, `sign this executive order today.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd hooted in delight at the challenge. Gore fired back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from Sen.
Bill Bradley on how to stand up and fight for African-Americans,''
Gore said, and the audience at North High School in Des Moines
cheered with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to talk the talk; it's another thing to walk
the walk,'' Gore continued, and the spectators responded with
derisive groans.
</P>
<P>
   Race has been a controversial subject in the 2000 campaign. It
has distinguished Gore and Bradley from the Republicans and from
each other.
</P>
<P>
   One questioner, saying issues of interest to minorities were
being overlooked in the campaign, asked whether the candidates
supported keeping the nation's first presidential caucuses in Iowa,
which is 97 percent white, and the first primary in predominantly
white New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Both men, their fortunes about to be tested in the states that
treasure their special status, said they saw no need for changing
the order of states that pick the parties' presidential nominees.

BATTLE GROUNDS: STARBUCKS, LOCAL COFFEE SHOPS VIE FOR CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At home one day, away
from the espresso grinder and customer chatter at his Country Club
Plaza coffee shops, Jeff Schmidt received the kind of telephone
call that's been the bane of small coffee retailers across the
country.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone from Starbucks Coffee, whose corporate strategy is to
become ``the most recognized and respected brand of coffee in the
world,'' was on the other line. Starbucks, the voice said, intended
to enter the Plaza market and wanted to buy Schmidt's two shops,
LatteLand Espresso.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt wasn't about to give up his start-ups now that they were
prospering. So he declined the overture. A few months later, this
past September, Starbucks opened its first coffee house on the
Plaza _ just one block from a LatteLand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like they were the big corporate giant out to squash
the little guy,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, similar Starbucks openings from coast to coast have
sometimes signaled the death knell for the mom-and-pop shop.
</P>
<P>
   To Starbucks, this happens only by accident. The company says it
has no strategy for locating near established competitors. Yet,
there's enough of a pattern that Ted Lingle of the Specialty Coffee
Association of America attests, ``Their reputation is
well-earned.''
</P>
<P>
   In cities as diverse as Milwaukee, New Orleans and Portland,
Ore., a beloved gourmet coffee house disappeared soon after a
Starbucks moved in close by.
</P>
<P>
   Not in Kansas City, though. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   At Schmidt's LatteLand, business is down slightly. At the
Westport Coffee House, business leveled off after Starbucks moved
in two blocks away, on the corner of Broadway and Westport Road. At
Broadway Cafe, business is up right next door to that Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee trends don't hold much hope for them. The industry
association expects the number of cafes to decline by one-fifth by
2003, the result of too many retailers vying for a stagnant number
of coffee drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   What is saving Westport's and the Plaza's hometown cafes isn't
necessarily the coffee. It has more to do with Kansas City itself,
its willingness to support the hometown shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market has a loyalty or a root-for-the-hometown-guy type
of mentality,'' said Becky Blades, a small-business owner who is
chairwoman of the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce's
Metropolitan Entrepreneurs Council. ``We're kind of conscious in
that way _ local yokels.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider Vicki Rivera and Pattie Porter. These two friends
wanted to meet for coffee one morning last week. Rivera suggested
``that place in Westport on the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Porter answered, ``I won't go to Starbucks.''
</P>
<P>
   They ended up at LatteLand instead. Its ice cream parlor-sized
nook on 47th Street is less than half the size of Starbucks' new
shop nearby and, at least while the two women sipped their lattes,
had half the customers. None of that mattered to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather support the local coffee shops,'' Porter said. ``I
guess because I'm a Kansas City girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Starbucks backlash, an outgrowth of an increasingly
corporatized retail landscape.
</P>
<P>
   A coffee shop is more than just coffee. It fills a social need
by providing a place for people to meet and relax _ much as bars
do, only without the booze. And during gourmet coffee's explosive
boom during the past decade, Starbucks was the undisputed leader.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, the company swelled from about 100 locations on
this continent to 2,300, including seven here. One of every three
coffee cafes in the country is now a Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   Besides coffee, Starbucks also is recognized for something
unusual in corporate America: caring.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune magazine included Starbucks among ``The 100 Best
Companies to Work For,'' based on its health insurance and stock
options for part-time workers. And Starbucks became North America's
leading corporate supporter of CARE, the worldwide relief agency.
Locally, company donations have gone to the KC Reads literacy
program and Newhouse for Battered Women, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, all that means nothing to those who accuse the coffee
colossus of trying to drive hometown shops out of business.
</P>
<P>
   When Starbucks entered the Milwaukee market, it opened a
suburban shop just a few blocks from a Stone Creek Coffee outlet.
When Starbucks entered the New Orleans market, it opened on the
same block as the local Uptown. When Starbucks expanded into the
Portland suburb of Lake Oswego, it located in the same mall as the
locally owned Coffee Nook.
</P>
<P>
   And when Starbucks eyed Saratoga Springs, N.Y., it offered to
buy Madeline's Espresso Bar. After the two sides couldn't agree on
a price, Starbucks opened across the street.
</P>
<P>
   On each of these coffee battle grounds, the independent cafe
closed or moved.
</P>
<P>
   In the minds of Starbucks executives, those shops hardly existed
to begin with. The company says it selects sites in ZIP codes with
high mail-order demand for its products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's purely incidental that other shops may be there,'' said
Jerry Thorpe, Starbucks' marketing director for the middle of the
country. ``That doesn't enter into the equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Starbucks locates so close to competitors so often that
Californian Jeremy Dorosin, who started a Web site _
www.starbucked.com _ to chronicle Starbucks' behavior, contends,
``That's the biggest complaint I get.''
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks' notoriety even has gone Hollywood, with its round
green logo appearing in Dr. Evil's headquarters in the Austin
Powers movie sequel _ though the company laughs along with the
joke, too.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the majority of Starbucks' stores are not next to a
competitor. But its highest-profile urban locales in Kansas City
are. That's how the Starbucks backlash spread here.

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   It's one morning in Westport, and the
streets of bars and restaurants are deserted, except for the corner
of Broadway and Westport Road, in front of the warring coffee
houses. There, it's rush hour.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Near 9 a.m. inside the Broadway Cafe, the line at the counter is
five deep. That very minute next door at Starbucks, the line at the
counter consists of one person, Jerry Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   He's on the run between business meetings and stopped at
Starbucks because of the brand name. ``I consider Broadway (Cafe)
to be the local hangout, and this is the quick, run in and run out
kind of place,'' said Fuller, a 52-year-old investment
representative for Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's hard to tell the two stores apart. Both arrange
tables with wood chairs in L-shape spaces. Both have exposed brick
and coffee-oriented art on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing a small business can do is make their product
different,'' said Sara Honan, Broadway Cafe's co-owner. So her
place is roasting its own coffee. Westport Coffee House, meanwhile,
offers live music and computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not us against them,'' said Cara McLaughlan, a Starbucks
spokeswoman. ``We represent one choice in the community, and we
feel it's a great choice, but not everyone will agree with us on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's a half-hour later that same morning. At Starbucks,
seven patrons sit around tables or in plush chairs sipping
espressos and lattes. At Broadway Cafe, 11 patrons are doing the
same thing. One of them is Jeff Conrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like supporting a local business,'' says Conrick, a
28-year-old student and hospital therapist. ``I didn't like the
idea that Starbucks moved in next to my favorite coffee shop, so
I've avoided them in Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   This allegiance reflects a sort of entrepreneurial ethos in
Kansas City. The area has ranked as high as No. 7 on Entrepreneur
magazine's best cities for small businesses, based on the success
of start-ups as well as the dozens of entrepreneurial support
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a community support the local people,'' said Danny
O'Neill, a local coffee entrepreneur with The Roasterie Inc.
</P>
<P>
   LatteLand's Schmidt, who once lived on the East Coast, agreed.
``There's a loyalty I didn't see in Washington, D.C.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That judgment is hard to prove. This area abounds in examples
like Winstead's, Boulevard beer or Hollywood At Home surviving
against national chains. But in some cases, for every Rainy Day
Books in Fairway, there's The Book Shop that recently announced
it's closing in Brookside. Local small-business observers know of
no studies about Kansas City's propensity for customer loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   But they vow it's there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to say this without sounding like a bumpkin,''
said Rhonda Holman, vice president of community entrepreneurship
for the Kauffman Foundation, ``but it seems to me that
relationships drive the transactions in this community more than
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a little bit stronger tradition in this market
for supporting local ownership.''

BILLS WOULD MAKE LYING TO GAMING COMMISSION A FELONY

 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Lying under oath to
the Missouri Gaming Commission would be a felony under bills
separately introduced by two Democratic state lawmakers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Ronnie DePasco of Kansas City and Rep. Brian May of St.
Louis each drafted legislation to plug a loophole in the 7-year-old
statute that established the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently because of an oversight, there is no prohibition or
penalty for perjury when testifying before the Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an expectation that people who are testifying are
going to be truthful,'' May said. ``The law needs to provide that
they shall be truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   Conviction under each proposal carries a maximum sentence of
five years and a $5,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The problem went unnoticed until December 1998, when
then-Jackson County Prosecutor Claire McCaskill used Missouri's
horse-racing statutes to file perjury charges against a former
casino executive.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, Jackson County Circuit Judge Justine Del
Muro dismissed all charges against former Hilton Hotels Corp.
Senior Vice President Markland Rousseau. The judge ruled that the
state's horse-racing law couldn't be applied in riverboat gambling
cases.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill, now Missouri's auditor, said she turned to the
horse-racing statute because it was the only law that could apply
in the Rousseau case.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Prosecutor Robert Beaird said he would appeal the
dismissal, hoping to reinstate a three-count indictment that
alleges Rousseau lied to the Missouri Gaming Commission at a 1996
pre-licensing hearing for Flamingo Hilton Casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every year there's some quirk in the gaming laws
that needs to be fixed,'' DePasco said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year DePasco and May successfully co-sponsored legislation
that rewrote the state's public bribery law.
</P>
<P>
   The same criminal investigation involving the Flamingo casino
also exposed a legal flaw that made it impossible to charge unpaid
public officials with accepting a bribe, including citizens
appointed to public boards and commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The Hilton investigation focused on the casino company's
relationship with a member of the Kansas City Port Authority.

Coffee-Shops _ (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) At home one day, away from the
espresso grinder and customer chatter at his Country Club Plaza
coffee shops, Jeff Schmidt received the kind of telephone call
that's been the bane of small coffee retailers across the country.
Someone from Starbucks Coffee, whose corporate strategy is to
become ``the most recognized and respected brand of coffee in the
world,'' was on the other line. Starbucks, the voice said, intended
to enter the Plaza market and wanted to buy Schmidt's two shops,
LatteLand Espresso. Schmidt wasn't about to give up his start-ups
now that they were prospering. So he declined the overture. A few
months later, this past September, Starbucks opened its first
coffee house on the Plaza _ just one block from a LatteLand. By
JEFFREY SPIVAK. Story will move in the ``a'' category.

reimbursement cuts by managed care companies, thousands of doctors
in New York and across the country are turning to cosmetic medicine
to keep their practices lucrative. By Jennifer Steinhauer.

   CLASSIC-BOOKS-EDUC (Chicago) _ A new program at Wilbur Wright
College, a community college on this city's North Side that caters
primarily to high school graduates considered not ready for
four-year institutions, allows students to earn a special minor or
certificate by taking a concentration of courses on the so-called
great books of the Western canon. What is different is that at

written off as a realistic presidential contender by most political
pundits, the Forbes campaign continues its seemingly never-ending

   VOTING-RATES (Des Moines) _ The $1,000 limit on presidential
campaign contributions, enacted in 1974 in reaction to the
corruption of Watergate, now serves chiefly to clear the field
before anyone gets to vote, according to two prominent Republican
dropouts. Lamar Alexander and Dan Quayle, while praising
front-running Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, contended in separate

   DOLLAR-ZONE (Quito, Ecuador) _ Even in the rest of Latin
America, this country of 12 million has never been regarded as much

overcome before consumers routinely download music rather than buy

<P>
   GLAXCO-SMITHKLINE (London) _ Until this weekend, only one
obstacle had blocked a merger of drug makers SmithKline and Glaxo
Wellcome: the egos of the companies' top brass. Glaxo's chairman,
Sir Richard Sykes, and SmithKline's chief executive, Jan Leschly,
refused to merge because neither executive wanted to give up
control. On Monday, as Glaxo announced it would acquire SmithKline
for about $76 billion in stock, both executives gave up the control
they so coveted to a third man, Jean-Pierre Garnier, SmithKline's
chief operating officer. By Andrew Ross Sorkin.

   CREATIVE-HISTORY (Undated) _ Not only have all artists
manipulated history to forge theater and cinema, the greatest of
them all, William Shakespeare, did it too. And if Shakespeare

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ The Mavericks were doing their mad-scientist nonsense,
putting together wholly illogical combinations so crazy they just
might work. And for long enough to entertain the locals, they did.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rockets fell into Dallas' half-court traps, rushed
3-pointers, threw the ball away, fought with officials and allowed
Cedric Ceballos and a bunch of backup guards to cruise down the
lane. They tempted fate until they looked up to find their 20-point
lead down to a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Then Steve Francis got so fed up he decided to dunk on 7-6 Shawn
Bradley and nearly pulled it off. Cuttino Mobley, pounded by
Bradley so hard that Bradley later apologized, attacked the human
swizzle stick at the rim. Kenny Thomas drove the lane en route to
the best game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   And just like that Tuesday night, the Rockets had a 121-111 win
to end a four-game road trip with a three-game winning streak,
matching their longest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning at home is great, but there is nothing like winning on
the road,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``You get a big
one out here, and you get on the plane, and you're all together.
You stay together. You start to bond. You form something.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what happened to us during our championship year. All
the really big things, the coming together, happened on the road.
I'm not comparing this to that, but I like the way we're handling
ourselves. This winning on the road, man, it's just great.''
</P>
<P>
   So great that it hardly mattered that the Rockets nearly blew a
huge lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets got Hakeem Olajuwon back from more than seven weeks
of inactivity. They scored more points than they had in regulation
time all season (they had 122 in a double-overtime game in
Phoenix). Their rookies had their most prolific scoring games of
the season, Francis pairing 31 points with Thomas' 20. Francis had
his third consecutive game with at least 10 assists, getting 11.
Thomas matched his season high with 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a weird, wild game,'' Tomjanovich said happily,
unconcerned for the time being with his team's role in making it so
bizarre. ``Our rookies were great.''
</P>
<P>
   Their elder statesman was rusty. Olajuwon played just 14
minutes, going scoreless for the first time in his career, but he
grabbed seven rebounds and blocked three shots.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the Mavericks, trailing by 19, went with either
Ceballos or Michael Finley and four guards, Olajuwon was not ready
to burn them for their lunacy. The Rockets instead matched up
small, and the Mavericks' all-gunner lineup forged a rec-center
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to take the ball to the basket when the Rockets left
the lane undefended, Ceballos scored all of his season-high 39
points in the 34 minutes Olajuwon was out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Leading by 16 with two minutes left in the third quarter, the
Rockets were outscored 12-4 to end the period, all on layups or
free throws. The Mavericks scored 40 points in the quarter, the
most against the Rockets this season or last. And when the
Mavericks started the fourth quarter with a Finley 3, they were
within 90-85.
</P>
<P>
   But with eight minutes left, Mobley and Francis ignored all
logic and took their games at Bradley with angry abandon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refs were cheating us,'' said an obviously perturbed
Mobley, who had an ice bag to his head to numb the result of a
Bradley elbow. ``They were giving them ticky-tack calls. We were
getting beat going to the hole and not getting anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis, meanwhile, was infuriated by the Rockets' inability to
beat the traps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hyper, angry,'' he said. ``We were turning the ball over
a lot. You can't turn it over against a rinky-dink scramble like
that. They put on a little press, and we got careless with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley slipped a shot around Bradley on his drive, and Francis
nearly got over Bradley on his, drawing a foul. His two free throws
gave the Rockets a 98-89 lead. But the Rockets did not regain
control until Matt Bullard nailed a 3-pointer off an inbounds pass
to put them up 105-99 with 2:14 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just worried about getting the ball inbounds,''
Tomjanovich said. ``I told him, `Break the play.' I'm yelling,
`Back out! Back out!' and it ends up being the key basket of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   It held up as the key basket because Francis and Thomas made 11
of 12 free throws in the last two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' Rockets guard Walt Williams said. ``What have we
got? Thirteen wins? We'll take them any way we can get them.''

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DALLAS _ They had a Dream.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, it was more like one of those
sitting-at-your-desk-on-a-long-day-at-the-office reveries.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon returned to the Rockets' lineup after an absence
of nearly two months carrying as much rust as the hull of the
Titanic. And for the first time in his 16-year NBA career, he did
not score a point.
</P>
<P>
   He attempted four shots in 14 minutes that were split between
the second and fourth quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, a 15-foot fadeaway on the left baseline came
up short, and a try for a layup down on the low block was stripped
by Hubert Davis.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, there was another missed attempt on a
turnaround and then a jump hook that didn't quite have the legs to
get over both the outstretched arms of Shawn Bradley and the front
of the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were seven rebounds, three blocked shots and a few
other times when he made himself a defensive presence on the
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will come,'' said Olajuwon. ``My strength felt great. My
whole body felt so good. Now it is just a matter of timing, rhythm,
getting comfortable again.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was told that his previous NBA low _ one single point _
came at Reunion Arena in November 1984, his rookie season, Olajuwon
smiled like the Cheshire cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' he said giggling. ``How could that be? I must have
been thrown out of the game. You know, I got thrown out of a lot of
games in those days. It is all about growth and maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Steve Francis, who is starting to look like
one of those egghead kids who graduate from an Ivy League
university when they're barely old enough to cross the street
without holding their mother's hand.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie point guard is to prodigies what a laser-guided
missile would have been when the troops stormed the castle gate in
the Middle Ages, that far ahead of his time.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the scoring of a season-high 31 points, the
dealing of 11 assists or the snagging of six rebounds. It is the
way he is going about it, with the assurance and ease of a man
relaxing in a custom-made silk robe.
</P>
<P>
   Francis does it all for a simple reason. Because he can.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is the way he is learning to do it all while playing
within the structure of the Rockets' system that has transformed
him lately from just a bundle of raw talent into someone who must
be feared. And respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about being a rookie anymore,'' Francis said.
``I've played enough games now, and that stuff is behind me. Now
this is just basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the glimpse of basketball the way the Rockets want to play
it in the 21st century while they make the transition from a team
built around the most athletic big man of his time to a point guard
with no boundaries on his skills and no limit on his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   See him take the ball to the hoop on a crossover dribble that
practically breaks the ankles of Dallas' Erick Strickland. See him
weave through traffic and set up Pig Miller or Cuttino Mobley or
Shandon Anderson for a hoop. See him take over the fourth quarter
when Dallas makes things tight and even drive in to dunk the ball
on the 7-6 Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had him,'' Francis said. ``Until he grabbed my wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   To see a more obvious changing of the guard, you'd have to look
outside Buckingham Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is so talented, so full of ability,'' Olajuwon said.
``There is nothing he cannot do on the court, and I tell him that
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis nods in agreement and does a brief impersonation of
Olajuwon, complete with the English boarding school accent. ``Shoot
the ball, Steve,'' says Francis the mimic. ``Be aggressive, Steve.
Don't back down, Steve.''
</P>
<P>
   The real Hakeem expects as much from Francis as he always has
from himself. While Olajuwon figures there is still an important
place for himself in the picture over the next 1{ seasons, he
acknowledges this is the rookie's team now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the coach on the floor,'' Hakeem said. ``He is in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis' words say no, but his eyes say something different. He
knows it is his deal now.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a funny word, deal,'' said Francis. ``The first time
coach (Rudy Tomjanovich) told me it was my `deal,' I said, `What
are you talking about? A trade? A deal? Cards?' I learned it's a
Texas thing.''
</P>
<P>
   His thing. Rudy knows it. Hakeem knows it.
</P>
<P>
   What would it have been like to team Olajuwon with Francis 10 or
12 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow!'' said Hakeem. ``But I'm just glad I have him now.''
</P>
<P>
   A Dream and a Future. Fit for the occasion.

WITHOUT RIGHT PERSON FOR RIGHT ROLE, `INTERRUPTED' WOULD GO WRONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When talking movies it's not uncommon to mention photography,
art direction, music and, of course, acting.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody ever talks about casting.
</P>
<P>
   Which is ironic, because any director will quickly confirm that
the success of a dramatic venture rises or falls on the actors at
his or her disposal. With the dramatic arts, casting is 90 percent
of everything.
</P>
<P>
   We're referring here not just to individual performances, but
rather to the unique dynamic that results when certain actors work
with one another.
</P>
<P>
   What, for example, would ``Casablanca'' have been like if the
producers had not cast Humphrey Bogart as the cynical Rick, but
instead had gone with an earlier recommendation that Ronald Reagan
be given the role? How would Reagan have interacted with Ingrid
Bergman? It certainly wouldn't be the ``Casablanca'' we know and
love.
</P>
<P>
   About the only time casting gets mentioned is when it goes
wrong, when two performers clearly are operating on different
wavelengths. This circumstance is most commonly recognized when
actors are supposed to be playing lovers but exude absolutely no
on-screen chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Something like that happens in the current film ``Anna and the
King,'' in which Hong Kong actor Chow Yun-Fat gives a remarkably
nuanced interpretation of the King of Siam while co-star Jodie
Foster turns in a brittle, even affected performance as the royal
family's English governess. The two actors seem to be working in
different movies.
</P>
<P>
   Good, competent casting seems so natural and effortless that it
rarely draws attention to itself. A rare exception to this rule _
casting so good you can't ignore it _ can be found in the current
``Girl, Interrupted,'' director James Mangold's adaptation of
Susanna Kaysen's memoir about the year she spent in a private
mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Winona Ryder fell in love with the book and bought the
film rights several years ago. So it was a given that Ryder would
play the role of Susanna, a recent high school graduate whose
depression (and an affair with a teacher) leads her to check
herself into a mental ward.
</P>
<P>
   Put yourself in the shoes of the film's casting director _ in
this case Lisa Beach. You've inherited Ryder for the role of
Susanna ... not at all a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Susanna is a young woman who is not so much angry as sad and
bewildered. She knows something is terribly wrong in her life but
can't quite pin it down.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder's forte as an actress lends itself very comfortably to
this persona. Physically, she's a waif, with delicate features, a
fragile physique and huge eyes that suggest the character's
vulnerability and introspective nature. Audiences naturally
empathize with Ryder and want to protect her.
</P>
<P>
   Her most endearing characters tend to be unsure, conflicted and
indecisive. (However, every now and then a canny director inverts
that quality to good effect. In ``The Age of Innocence'' Martin
Scorsese cast her as a prim, unassertive society wife, only to
reveal in the last reel that beneath that shrinking exterior hides
an iron will and a steel trap mind.)
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Ryder's a natural to play Susanna.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, then, is to find the right actress to tackle the
pivotal role of Lisa, who is in many ways Susanna's polar opposite.
</P>
<P>
   A headstrong, charismatic young woman who has spent half her
life in the mental ward, Lisa is a born agitator and manipulator.
She periodically runs away from the institution; invariably, after
a few days or weeks she's returned in handcuffs, spitting and
clawing until the tranquilizers kick in.
</P>
<P>
   When Lisa does stick around, she specializes in breaking rules.
A favorite trick is to lead the other patients on nocturnal raids
of the administrative offices so they can read their own medical
files.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa is all attitude _ and not pleasant attitude at that. At one
point in ``Girl, Interrupted'' Lisa so mercilessly picks apart a
fellow patient that the unfortunate woman commits suicide. Instead
of expressing remorse, Lisa contends that some people just can't
handle the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Susanna and Lisa is the key to ``Girl,
Interrupted.'' At first Susanna fears the in-your-face Lisa;
gradually she comes to admire and emulate Lisa's rebelliousness.
And, finally, she recognizes that beneath the charisma Lisa is
toxic _ a desperately sick and miserable person capable of
infecting others. Only then does Susanna turn away and begin
concentrating on using therapy to heal herself.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of potential for scenery chewing in the role of
Lisa. The trick was to find an actress with her own brand of
natural charisma, one who could sweep us up into Lisa's mad world
while gradually revealing the soul-crushing misery beneath the
anger and attitude. An actress we can hate and pity and desire all
at once.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Angelina Jolie, who seems destined to win an Oscar
nomination for her work here. In just a couple of years this
actress (the daughter of actor Jon Voight) has established herself
as a performer who commands the screen. It doesn't matter who else
is in the shot. Jolie's the one we look at.
</P>
<P>
   Typically there's nothing pliant or laid back in a Jolie
performance. She specializes in defiant characters, young women
totally unashamed of their sexual appetites and casually disdainful
of convention and propriety. (Check out her award-winning work in
the made-for-cable movie ``Gia.'')
</P>
<P>
   And she puts all this to good work in ``Girl, Interrupted.'' But
she adds something more _ a gradual revelation of the constant
terror that is Lisa's lot and which can be masked only by a show of
cockiness and cruelty and indifference.
</P>
<P>
   The wonder of ``Girl, Interrupted'' lies in the way these two
performances dovetail. Ryder's Susanna and Jolie's Lisa become a
sort of yin and yang of the feminine psyche. Where one is bawdy,
the other prefers sexual privacy. Where one is withdrawn and
cautious, the other is an aggressive daredevil.
</P>
<P>
   In complementing each other so perfectly, Ryder and Jolie
provide an eerie balance that centers the entire film.
</P>
<P>
   And as is usually the case with perfect casting, we end up
unable to imagine anyone else in these roles.

`ASHES,'`CRADLE' GIVE WATSON TWO VERY DIFFERENT ROLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Emily Watson, who's starring in two new movies this Friday,
never planned on being a movie star. It just sort of crept up on
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always was ambitious to do well in the theater,'' the
two-time Oscar nominee said in a recent telephone interview from
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for British actors, movie stardom doesn't happen often.
There are so many wonderful actors who have full careers just on
the stage and in the occasional television role. So for me becoming
a star was never a forged ambition. More like pie in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Until, of course, she was cast in 1995's ``Breaking the Waves''
as a religion-obsessed young wife who believes she can save her
paralyzed husband by debasing herself sexually. That led to her
first Oscar nomination and _ whether she was ready for it or not _
movie stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly there I was in a movie, being called a star. At first
it was rather alarming. Now I must admit I rather enjoy myself. The
goal of every actor, after all, is to get good roles, and I'm now
in the position of having good roles sent to me. The worst part of
it is that I don't get to spend enough time at home, which I could
when I was just working in the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers have a chance this weekend to see the 33-year-old
actress in a couple of guises. In Alan Parker's ``Angela's Ashes''
she plays a young Irish mother attempting to keep her family
together in the face of crushing poverty and an alcoholic husband;
in actor//director Tim Robbins' ``Cradle Will Rock'' she portrays
an impoverished American actress who lands a job with the
Depression-era Federal Theater Project and gets involved in the
legendary New York debut of America's first ``serious'' musical,
``The Cradle Will Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes,'' of course, is based on Frank McCourt's
Pulitzer-winning memoir of growing up deprived in Limerick,
Ireland. The book became an international phenomenon and developed
a fiercely loyal following. And that put special pressures on the
moviemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book is one of those things that so grips you can't put it
down,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One moment you're weeping, the next you're laughing madly. You
feel a real sense of responsibility when working with material like
this. Millions of people love this book and you don't want to
offend them by getting it wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's biggest fan, in fact, may be McCourt himself, who
has gone on record claiming director Parker's is the best film
adaptation he could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had several conversations with Frank,'' Watson said,
``but oddly enough we never talked directly about his mother. I
once asked him, `Is there anything about your mum you want to say?'
And he said, `No, not especially.' His position was that the book
said it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of playing Angela, Watson said, is that she
doesn't have any big actorish moments. She tends to suffer quietly,
and that fact left the actress with little opportunity to vent in
front of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an actor you take the story and inhabit in a way that comes
naturally to you. For me, the key to the role was dwelling in the
details, the way she cared for her children, the way she threw away
her pride to beg for food. Physically I'm not like the real Angela
at all. She was quite a big woman. But the mothering instinct is
something most of us identify with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she really suffered a nervous breakdown by the end of
the story. Frank waited until she died to finish the book because
he thought it would be quite humiliating for her.''
</P>
<P>
   As downbeat as much of ``Angela's Ashes'' is, wasn't it
difficult to keep a positive attitude?
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually the set was a great atmosphere because of the kids.
They were all over, and you can't get pretentious and maudlin with
kids around. They wanted attention all the time, and since I was
playing the role of their mother, they usually turned to me. I was
too busy to become too moody.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she and her husband have no children, Watson said that
``I have a lot of nephews and nieces so I'm used to being around
wee ones.''
</P>
<P>
   She admitted, however, that the physical circumstances of the
filming were fairly harrowing. The film crew built an exact replica
of ``the lanes,'' the low-low-income Limerick neighborhood in which
the McCourt family hit bottom. Immediately behind their rented
house was a privy used by dozens of area residents. Even worse, the
house sat in a low area and during Ireland's long rainy season as
much as a foot of water collected in the downstairs rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those lanes no longer exist, thank heaven,'' Watson said. ``It
was pretty grim just being on the set _ grisly, dank and dark. You
couldn't sleep at night because your feet wouldn't warm up. So we
got a real sense, if only a slight one, of how miserable that life
must have been. At least as actors we could always look forward to
food at end of the day, which is more than the McCourts could
claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson's next film is a major change of pace. Her first comedy
role will be in Alan Rudolph's ``Trixie'' in which she plays a
wannabe private eye. Co-starring are Nick Nolte, Will Patton and
Dermot Mulroney.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Wisdom from a tooth
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ My mother has to go to the dentist. She's broken
a tooth. It's something that can't wait.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, my wife would step in and take care of everything, but
my wife is out of town.
</P>
<P>
   So, I make the appointment, I pick up my mother, we go to the
dentist's office.
</P>
<P>
   He's the same dentist she took me to when I was a little boy.
Now, I was taking her. Such is life.
</P>
<P>
   These days he has a limited practice, coming in only three times
a week. He's in a little building behind where he used to have his
office ... just a block over from where I went to grammar school
... a couple of blocks from where my grandmother lived ... a
lifetime away from my earliest memories.
</P>
<P>
   This in particular I remember:
</P>
<P>
   I must have been about 3 years old. It was late evening,
summertime. We were all sitting on the porch of my grandmother's
house _ Mother and Daddy, aunts and uncles.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody _ maybe my Uncle Bubba _ had taken a piece of string,
tied a bait of bacon to it and was showing me how to fish for
crawdads.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped the bacon and string down a crawdad mound. He told me
I had to be still, quiet, patient.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember that any other kids were there. The grownups, I
guess, were trying to keep me occupied while they visited. The men
were taking turns at cranking an ice cream freezer. I remember
there was a lot of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   After a while lightning bugs caught my fancy and I wandered away
from the crawdad mound.
</P>
<P>
   Later, maybe a few minutes, maybe half an hour, I remembered to
check the string _ and it was gone! I couldn't believe it. There it
was, and now it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   I went running toward the porch, yelling that the string was
gone, the string was gone. I may have been on the verge of tears.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody _ maybe my Uncle Bubba _ took it all in with a glance,
told me to stand back and then _ to my amazement _ gave the crawdad
mound a kick that destroyed it in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   He reached down, found the end of the string where it had been
pulled into the mound by the crawdad and yanked it up. Nothing was
on the line, not even the bacon.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't get over it, how my uncle had dealt with that mound.
It was a shocking revelation for a 3-year-old, that there is no
permanency in this life. Things change, disappear. There it was,
and then it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The grammar school is gone. My grandmother's house is gone. Dad,
uncles and aunts ...
</P>
<P>
   Now one less tooth for Mother.
</P>
<P>
   But it'll be just fine. The dentist is fixing her up with a
partial plate. He's the same dentist she took me to when I was a
little boy, and now I take her. Such is life. Such is the circle of
life.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Choking in illegal aliens
 &HT;    (For release Wednesday, Jan. 19, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The flood of illegal aliens entering the U.S. continues, and
apparently has not yet reached its crest. Just last week, U.S.
Border Patrol agents intercepted _ in one night! _ 1,400
undocumented immigrants trying to cross the border in Arizona.
Authorities say they have detained 14,664 illegals there this month
alone. It is astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the hundreds of Haitians who were blocked at sea
near Miami and repatriated; add to it the tragedy of 16 Dominican
Republic refugees trying to make it by sea to Puerto Rico and,
therefore, the United States; add to it the equally tragic
discovery in Seattle of dead and alive Chinese immigrants stuffed
into container boxes on ships that traversed the Pacific from Hong
Kong; add to it the fortunate stopping of bomb-minded suspects at
the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the country sits mesmerized or bored by the
extended saga of Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban youngster who is the
pawn in a distasteful war of ideology, everyone else seems to be
slipping into the U.S. without much fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   If Border Patrol agents nabbed 1,400 in one night, just think of
how many got in unnoticed. The border with Mexico runs from
Brownsville, Texas, to San Diego. Some decades ago _ I believe it
was during the Lyndon Johnson administration _ the U.S. began
building a fence at its most vulnerable border spots but backed
away after a spate of complaints from the Mexican government, which
considered it an insult.
</P>
<P>
   It was projected at the beginning of this month that the
population of the U.S. will double in the next 100 years; buoyed by
a continuing flow of illegal aliens, the fully authorized
immigration quotas and aliens' traditionally high birth rates.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of people, particularly if they remain in the
status of low wage earners who require some sort of help, be it
with food stamps, welfare checks, housing and schooling.
</P>
<P>
   All but Native Americans come from immigrant families, so we all
should be sympathetic toward immigrants. I am. But only to those
who come in the right way. It is against our laws to enter the
country illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the assault is so huge along the Mexico-U.S. border and in
the seas around Florida that one tends to surmise that for every
one who is intercepted, five or more get in unnoticed. They find
jobs here, driving many earlier immigrants out of their livelihoods
because they will work for less.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, which
enabled any Cuban floating into U.S. waters to be claimed by
relatives here and be eligible for citizenship in just one year,
authorities have tried to bottle up illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Cuban Adjustment Act was qualified by later White
Houses to extend only to those who touched dry land here; a
half-mile from shore and you were going back to Cuba. A limit of
20,000 a year was set for Cubans to legally immigrate.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there are political considerations in the deluge of
illegal aliens coming to the U.S. But a predominant number of these
people are coming here for economic reasons _ a job. They don't
seek the refuge that Emma Lazarus's words on the Statue of Liberty
talk about. They seek a buck. And I don't blame them. I blame the
U.S., however, for having no workable border security.
</P>
<P>
   While we dash off around the world, protecting countries from
other countries, telling others how to live, we leave our doors
open to a horde of people who enter illegally and will be much a
part of the doubling of our population by 2100.
</P>
<P>
   We ought to be paying more attention _ and money _ to the
breakdown that has developed along our borders and in our waters.
It's becoming a struggle that we are losing.

   FIRST THEY TOOK OUR LAND; NOW THEY WANT OUR CHEESE. It's gooey,
it's yellow and it sustained columnist Karen Lincoln Michel during
her days as a poor college student. It's commodity cheese. ``Unless
you fall within the lowest socioeconomic group or have lived on an
Indian reservation, you probably haven't enjoyed the dining
experience that comes when cooking with food distributed by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture,'' Michel writes. Will the
government cut cheese from the federal Food Distribution Program on
Indian Reservations? Maybe ... Rep. George Nethercutt (R-Wash.)
says government cheese is a health risk, and that the food
distribution program ought to improve the nutritional value of the
food it sends to reservations. ``Them's fightin' words _ no matter
how you slice it,'' Michel writes in this humorous commentary.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S MORE THAN JUST A HOLIDAY. Martin Luther King Jr. Day (Jan.
17) is much more than a holiday to columnist Akilah Monifa. Monifa,
a 42-year-old African-American woman, grew up in Huntsville, Ala.
Her parents strategized and marched with Dr. King. ``I learned
about civil disobedience and protests from them when I was 4 years
old,'' she writes. ``I heard them talk of taking part in sit-ins at
segregated lunch counters.'' Her plans for observing the holiday?
``I will shed tears over the loss of a great man and a
philosopher,'' she writes. ``I will rue the fact that there are
still so many people who know little about his life and legacy. And
I will remember that the best way to honor Dr. King is by reading
his speeches and making a commitment to `walking the walk' of
diversity.'' An appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   PREPARING FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM _ ``We've reached the 21st
century, a new millennium, a new cycle,'' writes Hermene Hartman,
publisher and editor in chief of N'Digo, an African-American weekly
newspaper published in Chicago. ``What should we expect?'' In this
commentary, Hartman offers her take on what black America should
strive for in the coming years _ from confronting racism and
thinking globally to getting ``wired'' and setting your eyes on
success.
</P>
<P>
   PROP. 22: POLITICAL BELLWETHER IN CALIFORNIA _ When Californians
go the polls on March 7, they'll either vote ``Yes'' or ``No'' on
Proposition 22, a ballot measure that reads: ``Only marriage
between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.''
Columnist Chuck Colbert feels that this political initiative is
designed to trigger a backlash against recent significant
civil-rights gains made by the lesbian and gay community. But what
bothers him most is the unprecedented role of the Catholic and
Mormon churches in directly funding this measure. Colbert urges
Catholic Californians, who make up 25 percent of the state's
population, to say no to unjust church politics and vote ``No'' on
Proposition 22.

   PROP. 22: POLITICAL BELLWETHER IN CALIFORNIA _ When Californians
go the polls on March 7, they'll either vote ``Yes'' or ``No'' on
Proposition 22, a ballot measure that reads: ``Only marriage
between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.''
Columnist Chuck Colbert feels that this political initiative is
designed to trigger a backlash against recent significant
civil-rights gains made by the lesbian and gay community. But what
bothers him most is the unprecedented role of the Catholic and
Mormon churches in directly funding this measure. Colbert urges
Catholic Californians, who make up 25 percent of the state's
population, to say no to unjust church politics and vote ``No'' on
Proposition 22.

 &HT;    New law would send modern war criminals packing
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Five years ago Nazi hunter Eli Rosenbaum
sat in the Fort Myers, Fla., airport amid a clutch of spring-break
tourists. By sheer coincidence, the day also marked the 50th
anniversary of Germany's surrender to the Allies and everywhere in
the airport televisions broadcast solemn observances from around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting beside him was a grey-haired grandfather returning to
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Once a prominent homebuilder, the grandfather had fled his
adopted country and retired to Marco Island after Canadian
officials discovered he once belonged to a Nazi death squad under
the notorious Einsatzgruppen, which killed an estimated 1.5 million
Jews during World War II. Now Rosenbaum, having obtained
deportation orders, was escorting Helmut Oberlander out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   As the pair silently watched Germany's surrender on the TVs,
suddenly a crew from the Canadian Broadcasting Company appeared and
trained a camera on the 70-year-old Oberlander.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was beyond bizarre,'' Rosenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   But not totally beyond belief. Not in Florida. Like other
snowbirds, Nazis have flocked to this sunny land of leisure over
the years. So, too, have modern-day oppressors: Salvadoran generals
accused of orchestrating the murder of three nuns and a social
worker, members of Haiti's bloody paramilitary unit FRAPH, which
killed up to 6,000 in the early 1990s, and one of Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet's elite secret police, a squad responsible for at
least 72 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is second only to Illinois in the number of Nazis
located by Rosenbaum's Office of Special Investigations at the U.S.
Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Many suspect the number of modern war criminals is even higher,
but because immigration officials rarely investigate them _ and
Rosenbaum's office deals only with Nazis _ they are less easy to
track. One human rights group says it has identified 66, but
estimates run as high as 7,000 to 10,000 nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Many have been allowed into the U.S. because weak immigration
laws require that war crimes rise to the level of genocide _ not
mere atrocities like the torture of a few innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   But that could soon change.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Senate passed a bill to close loopholes in the
law and expand Rosenbaum's authority to include anyone who commits
atrocities. A companion bill has been proposed in the House by
Reps. Mark Foley (R-West Palm Beach, Fla.) and Gary Ackerman
(D-N.Y.). Hearings are expected to be held later this month or
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the OSI was dealing with the Nazis, the INS should have
been dealing with this. They ignored it,'' said Richard Krieger,
president of International Educational Missions, Inc., based in
Boynton Beach. Krieger, a former State Department administrator and
director of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council, threw the
considerable clout of his 19-year-old foundation _ board members
include former ambassadors _ behind the search for war criminals
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Krieger and others suspect the government has been less than
enthusiastic about taking a blanket approach because some members
of repressive regimes, like a Haitian FRAPH leader openly living in
Queens, N.Y., can be used to gather intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the original legislation that permitted the U.S.
government to go after Nazis was passed in 1978 . . . the bill was
aimed at all war criminals in this country,'' Krieger said. ``But
people from the intelligence community came up and lobbied against
it because they needed these people for information and that bill
was killed. But they didn't lobby against the Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   That has left nonprofit groups _ primarily the Center for
Justice and Accountability in San Francisco _ to pursue civil
lawsuits. The group has so far sued the Salvadoran and Chilean
military leaders living in Florida with the help of the American
Civil Liberties Union. It has also sued a Bosnian Serb, Nikola
Vuckovic, living in Atlanta, on behalf of three Bosnian Muslims who
claim he tortured them.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum and others say it comes as no surprise that Florida,
long a hideout for bootleggers, drug smugglers and scammers, is a
refuge for torturers, rapists and assassins from foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   What the state offers is obscurity in its transiency: a large
retirement population where an aging German or Lithuanian slips
into the crowd, growing Spanish communities that camouflage a
Salvadoran or Chilean general, and Haitian enclaves that justify
the presence of a Creole accent. Surprisingly, the alleged
criminals now being pursued were not living so obscurely.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Guillermo Garcia, a former Salvadoran defense minister,
lives in Plantation and Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova,
director-general of the country's National Guard, in Palm Coast.
Both were sued in May for their alleged roles in the murders of the
four American church women. A second suit claims they oversaw the
torture of a Salvadoran doctor, professor and two other
unidentified church workers.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Dorelien, a former leader in FRAPH, the paramilitary unit
of 7,000 under Gen. Raul Cedras, lives in Port St. Lucie in a brick
house on a winding cul-de-sac with potted plants by the front door
and a screened garage. In 1997, he won a $3.2 million lottery
jackpot. Although he once talked openly of his past, he now refuses
to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, public attention focused largely on the
suspected 60,000 surviving Nazis. Operating with a staff of 11
historians and 12 attorneys on a $6 million budget, the OSI has
filed charges against 108 over the years. Sixteen of its cases _ 10
percent _ have been in Florida. Altogether the agency has stripped
American citizenship from 64 Nazis and deported 53.
</P>
<P>
   ``My colleagues and I have spent an awful lot of time traversing
the roads of Florida, interviewing suspects and having doors
slammed in our faces,'' Rosenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   The movie Marathon Man, frequently invoked when Rosenbaum's work
comes up (in the last scene the Nazi character who fled to the U.S.
after the war is recognized by one of his victims), is far from
reality, Rosenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is much more mundane. But for those of us on the
cases it's much more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians serve as investigators, pouring over old Nazi
records, translating them from Lithuanian, German and other
languages. A watch list with the 60,000 names has been created.
Once someone is identified, legal proceedings can begin. Sometimes,
a case is as easy as a passport check. Alexander Schweidler,
formerly of Inverness, was snared by U.S. Customs at an Orlando
airport, Rosenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens with some frequency is we stop them (at an
airport) and they say, 'No, No. I don't know what you're talking
about.' And at our direction, Customs will ask them to remove their
shirt and look under their arm and there's a tatoo or scar in just
the right place,'' Rosenbaum said. Nearly every member of the SS
had his blood type tattooed under his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Time has proved to be the agency's biggest enemy: Nazis are
dying off faster than the office can find them. Most of those
located in Florida lived on the west coast, around St. Petersburg.
And not all very secretly. As with Oberlander's case, some have
unfolded strangely.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the mayor of Miami Beach unwittingly honored Franz
Hausberger with a gold city medallion when he visited to promote
his Austrian ski town. A day later he fled under cover of night,
just before demonstrations broke out when Justice Department
officials learned he had been a sergeant in the infamous First SS
Infantry Brigade which mopped up behind German lines in the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a Tampa federal judge revoked the citizenship of Adolph
Milius, an 81-year-old obstetrician who retired to St. Pete Beach
in 1979 and had served in the Lithuanian Security Police. In 1992,
Antanas Mineikis, living in Gulfport, was deported after he
admitted taking Jews to Lithuanian concentration camps as a member
of the Lithuanian Schutzmannschaft that killed tens of thousands of
Jews. In 1996, Juozas Budreika, also a former member of the
Schutzmannschaft living in Gulfport, left rather than fight
deportation orders and died later that year. Jurgis Juodis, another
member of the Lithuanian police unit, was denaturalized in 1981 and
died in Tampa in 1986. In May, a federal judge in Pensacola jailed
Vytautas Gecas, 77, of Sunny Hills, after he refused to answer
questions. Gecas served in Belarus during the war in a unit that
killed thousands of Jews and remains jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 Nazis located by the OSI in Florida, all, with the
exception of Gecas, have either died or been deported.
</P>
<P>
   What has not been so easy is finding modern war criminals,
largely because no agency has been responsible for them. The
Anti-Atrocity Act, if it passes, should solve that, Krieger and
other human rights activists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the century we've seen blood letting on a
horrific scale, yet there's no institutional response,'' said Rob
Weiner, of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. ``We've finally
said 'enough' to the continued violence without response.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Justice and Accountability was established after
psychotherapist Gerald Grey, working with Amnesty International,
began encountering more and more victims of torture seeking help
over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 18 centers (to treat torture victims) in the U.S.
alone and they're trusted by the immigrant communities who will in
the course of treatment talk about problems, including the presence
of torturers, and that's how I find out,'' Grey said.
</P>
<P>
   The law protecting victims of torture dates back 200 years to
the Alien Tort Claims Act which allows victims of international
human rights violations to sue in U.S. court. But no one was
successfully prosecuted under the law until 1976, when the family
of Joelito Filartiga sued his Paraguayan torturer and won. In 1992,
Congress reinforced the law by enacting the Torture Victim
Protection Act. The newer law defines specific causes of action and
extends the right to sue to aliens as well as U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, there is a first wave of refugees from areas of
upheaval and often in the next wave of refugees are the
perpetrators,'' explained attorney Beth Van Schaak, who has worked
with the center to prosecute the cases. ``So the perpetrators are
often resettled in the same places as their victims, and they run
into them on the streets, or see them on TV, and until we were
created, there was no place to turn. So what we're responding to is
the failure of the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the U.S. signed the U.N. Convention Against Torture,
which includes laws to criminally prosecute war criminals. But so
far it has been reluctant to try them out, Grey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire refugee community is held hostage by weak U.S.
prosecution, which means the whole country is held hostage by the
criminals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Anti-Atrocity Act is a step in the right direction,
Grey says it falls short because it calls for deportation only and
not prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The communities don't want deportation because that puts (the
criminals) among their families and they don't want that,'' he
said. ``That's the weakness of the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he concedes, it will significantly improve the effort to
investigate former leaders and officials of repressive regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Uncovered so far: Emmanuel Toto Constant, one of the leader's of
Haiti's FRAPH. After the U.S. invaded Haiti, Constant moved in with
an aunt in Queens. When an immigration judge tried to deport him,
the State Department reportedly interceded and argued sending him
back would destabilize the country. One of his deputies, Gwo Fan
Fan, was a neighbor in Queens. Last year, the Boston Globe located
Dorelian living in Port St. Lucie. He told the Globe that another
FRAPH colleague, Jean-Claude Duperval, is also living in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the two Salvadoran generals being sued in federal
court in West Palm Beach, Armando Fernandez-Larios, of Miami, is
being sued by a family claiming he tortured their relative as a
lieutenant in the Chilean army under Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Ethiopian Kelbessa Negewa, alleged to be a leader in
the ``Red Terror'' that executed thousands in the mid 1970s, was
successfully sued for $1.5 million in 1993 by three of his victims.
And a Rwandan, Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, a Hutu believed to have
orchestrated the killings of thousands of Tutsis in Rwanda in the
spring of 1994, is awaiting word on whether the U.S. Supreme Court
will consider his appeal of an order to surrender to the
International Tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more and more examples of ethnic cleansing occurring
in parts of the world,'' said Jonathan Lamy, a spokesman for Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, who introduced the Anti-Atrocity Act.
``And the perpetrators of the acts . . . are seeking the U.S. as a
safe haven more and more.''

 &HT;    Midnight lunar eclipse to show moon in different light
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Schoolkids across the country have the
perfect excuse to stay up past midnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Their science teachers will tell them to.
</P>
<P>
   The entire western hemisphere will see a total lunar eclipse,
when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon, blocking the
sun's rays from reaching the moon.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:03 p.m., the moon begins to enter a light shadow of the
earth _ called the penumbra _ but it is difficult to detect at
first. The moon will gradually turn from bright yellow to dingy
gray.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:01 p.m., the moon will begin to slide into the earth's
darker shadow _ the umbra. ``You can actually see the umbra moving
across the face of the moon,'' said Erich Landstrom, astronomy
director at the South Florida Science Museum in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The eclipse reaches totality at 11:05 p.m. and stays that way
for an hour and 17 minutes. The moon begins to emerge from the
umbra at 12:22 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of looking like a flat disc in the sky, it will
actually look three-dimensional, like a round ball suspended in the
heavens,'' said Jack Horkheimer, director of the Miami Space
Transit Planetarium.
</P>
<P>
   The moon won't black out. It will burn gold to copper red. Why?
Ask your seventh grader.
</P>
<P>
   He or she should say it's because indirect sunlight still
manages to reach the moon but not before it passes through the
Earth's atmosphere, which filters out most of the blue light,
leaving yellow and red.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to see the three-dimensional effect is to use
binoculars, Landstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   So, class, what else does a lunar eclipse prove?
</P>
<P>
   That the Earth is round, as the Greeks deduced more than 2,000
years ago as they watched the Earth's shadow crawl across the moon.

 &HT;    Dell's direct line to the futureBy Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The story of Dell Computer Corp.'s rise during
the 1990s is sprinkled liberally with superlatives like ``first,''
``most'' and ``youngest.''
</P>
<P>
   The company was the first big company to sell computers via the
Internet and the most profitable personal computer maker in the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dell can add the title of best-performing stock on the
Nasdaq exchange in the 1990s. Shares of the Round Rock, Texas,
company appreciated 88,000 percent in the past decade. One hundred
dollars invested in Dell stock 10 years ago and held through all
seven splits would have grown to $88,000 today. During the 1990s,
which the personal computing industry might remember as the Decade
of Dell, the company evolved from upstart PC maker to No. 1 in the
United States and forced bigger rivals to copy parts of its direct
sales approach.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell, 34, the company's founder, chairman and CEO was
once an introverted entrepreneur who seemed uncomfortable in front
of an audience. Now he is regarded as a witty guru of e-commerce.
Even giants of the Industrial Age, such as Ford Motor Co., are
seeking his guidance on doing business over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of exuberant expectations, the question inevitably
comes up: What can Dell do for an encore?
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell _ intense, driven and curious himself about what
his company can achieve _ has no plans to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   He believes Dell can ship four times as many computers in 2004
as it did in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to increase our market share from only 9 percent
last year to only 20 percent, which is probably a goal that's too
low, that would be 47 million units for Dell in 2004,'' Dell said
in an interview recently.
</P>
<P>
   That goal, modest or not, is based on his expectation that
worldwide personal computer sales will soar 69 percent by 2004 and
that Dell will account for more than half of that growth.
</P>
<P>
   But then Dell may be the most bullish executive in the personal
computer industry. He derides talk of the ``post-PC era'' as
``nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is whether a company can grow and expand,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   MORE OF A CURIOSITY
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell didn't have the Internet to inspire him for the
first 11 years of Dell Computer's existence. Instead, he invented a
radical new way of doing business that conveniently realizes its
full potential on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He recognized the opportunity early and seized it. But it was
serendipity, too, a necessary ingredient in every story of
phenomenal success. It didn't hurt that the establishment in the
personal computer industry viewed Dell as more a curiosity than a
threat in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists believed that the then-Austin company's new idea
to sell computers directly to customers would fail in key segments
of the market, such as corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The nerdy college dropout, however, thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically had the foresight to break the rules of
traditional business, and we came up with a new set of rules that
were very effective for us,'' Dell said recently. ``And we stuck by
them.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time bigger competitors understood the threat, sometime
in the middle of the decade, the Texas upstart was too big _ and
had too much momentum _ to stop.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of 1999, Dell achieved his goal and overtook
archrival Compaq Computer Corp. as the top seller of personal
computers in the United States, the world's biggest market.
</P>
<P>
   The research and consulting firm, International Data Corp., said
in a report on the third quarter of 1999 that Dell is closing in on
No. 1 worldwide.

 &HT;    10 steps to a debt-free life
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two years ago, with fear in her heart, Mary Ann Walls
cut up all eight of her credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably the saddest moment in my life,'' she recalls
of her first visit at the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of
Greater Atlanta. ``I thought my life was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   But she had to do it. She and her husband, Gary, owed nearly
$20,000 on their maxed-out cards. They were missing payments, and
they were oppressed by what they had done. ``I was truly, truly
ashamed,'' Mary Ann Walls said.
</P>
<P>
   She's not alone. Americans spent an average of $1,067 for
holiday gifts just weeks ago. That doesn't count spending on
travel, entertainment, decorations and cards, and all the other
stuff that makes the December holidays a commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   Now their credit card bills have started arriving in the mail.
For many, it is a time of remorse and financial distress.
</P>
<P>
   But it can be relieved. Getting out of debt requires a personal
and family commitment, some careful planning and the discipline to
follow through.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just wish improvement to happen, any more than you
can wish away weight,'' said Suzanne Boas, president of CCCS in
Atlanta. ``You've got to lay out a plan that is really specific.
And you've got to keep at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are 10 tips on how to make your way down a long road to
recovery:
</P>
<P>
   1. Stop using credit cards. It sounds terribly obvious, but it
removes a temptation from your everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   If you're worried about emergencies, carry a few traveler's
checks in your wallet _ not a credit card. You can use a debit card
for things like mail-order purchases.
</P>
<P>
   2. Find out how bad the problem is. Put all your bills in one
place and add up how much you owe. Also, write down what interest
rate you are paying on each account. ``You need to get a really
clear picture of where you are and where you want to be,'' Boas
said.
</P>
<P>
   3. Evaluate your spending. Some people go through their
checkbook to make a list of how much they spend and where. But that
may not be enough, especially if you make frequent trips to the
ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   A better method is to keep a daily notebook, writing down
everything you spend for two weeks or even a month. That should
give you an idea of how much you spend on necessities and how much
on feel-good items.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time to make sure the whole family is involved.
Keeping to a budget is like quitting smoking: It's a lot easier if
you and your spouse decide you owe it to each other.
</P>
<P>
   4. Cut your spending. Most people believe they could save $20 a
week without feeling any pain, according to one recent survey. Some
easy ways are taking your lunch to work, cutting back on restaurant
visits, controlling long-distance phone calling, putting off
spending for new clothes and trimming any expensive vacation plans.
</P>
<P>
   Keep a toll of how much you've cut back, and make sure you add
that much to your bill-paying.
</P>
<P>
   5. Beware of easy answers. ``Credit doctors'' and ``credit
repair clinics'' often charge high fees and don't do much for you.
</P>
<P>
   If you are in deep trouble or just need the structure of an
outside agency, check out Debt Counselors of America,
www.getoutofdebt.com or 1-800-680-3328.
</P>
<P>
   Boas advises against borrowing more money through consolidation
loans or home equity loans to pay off debts. ``If you don't change
underlying behavior, people invariably go out and spend again,''
she said. ``That is the most common mistake people make.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Pay off the most expensive card first. High interest rates
are a penalty in themselves. The quicker you pay off those
accounts, the less you will have to pay in interest. It's cheaper,
and you'll climb out of the hole faster.
</P>
<P>
   7. Try to lower the cost of credit. If you have been paying on
time, you may be able to negotiate a lower rate with the creditor.
Your pitch: If you don't get a better deal, you'll move to a
lower-interest card.
</P>
<P>
   If you do decide to switch, check carefully on the terms of the
new credit card. Look for annual fees, punishing late-payment
penalties and introductory offers that quickly move up to a higher
rate.
</P>
<P>
   8. Boost your payments. Most credit card companies will let you
get away with paying only a fraction of your bill each month. But
if you do, it takes much longer to pay off the bill, and the
interest charges keep on sapping your income.
</P>
<P>
   The Walls family began their credit repayment plan with a
commitment of $355 a month. With the help of CCCS branch manager
Susan Cantrell, they figured they could pay their bills in four
years. By nearly doubling their payment to $655 a month, the family
finished in two years.
</P>
<P>
   9. Use automatic payment plans. You can direct your bank or
credit union to make a regular payment to a creditor each month.
You don't have to write a check, and you can't put it off. For many
people, this is the easiest way.
</P>
<P>
   10. Celebrate. ``If you make a commitment to lose weight, you
get a little help along the way because your friends see the
results and give you compliments,'' Boas said. ``You get to talk
about it, and you're proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you're silently working off debt, there's nobody to
help you celebrate. It's important, particularly for families, to
take time to celebrate your achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget the rewards when you finally finish. Walls recalls
that she sneaked into the CCCS office in Carrollton two years ago,
afraid that co-workers in her nearby office might see her.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has regained a spritely outlook. ``There's a sense of
freedom now,'' she exulted. ``We don't have all the phone calls
(from bill collectors). And it's done a lot for my self-esteem _
we're responsible adults now.''

 &HT;    Taking loss from a Biddy's point of view
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ This morning over tea and toast, and well
before daybreak, Biddy and I had a serious chat. Actually, I seemed
to be doing most of the talking while Biddy wigwagged agreement
with a series of flicks of her most expressive tail. Biddy is
Siamese...if you please.
</P>
<P>
   Over the 10 years we've been together, Biddy and I have learned
the art of cat-to-person communication as in: Mee-oww!
(Translation: My basket is no longer in the sun; would you please
move it?) This is a fairly easy one but if I'm a little slow and
she loses patience: Wee-yoww! (Translation: In this lifetime,
Dummy!)
</P>
<P>
   Our person-to-cat talk, on the other hand, needs work. For
example: ``Biddy, it would make me very happy if you would get off
my desk so I can work.'' Naturally, she ignores me and goes on
hooking rubber bands from a partially-open drawer just to remind me
who's really in charge here. If that doesn't work, she'll slide
over to the file baskets and shove all five of them onto the floor,
hopelessly jumbling the In, Out, and To Do papers.
</P>
<P>
   One look over the edge convinces her she's accomplished all she
can there, so she'll turn around twice and splay herself across a
stack of notes I may have just finished sorting according to topic.
Stretching to the very limits of her two-toned Ricky Ricardo
kittysuit, she'll then initiate a painstaking investigation of the
pages under her and begin shredding the corners of those she finds
the tastiest. This would be a normal morning, but today is
different. The desktop doesn't seem to interest her at the moment
and she doesn't even slow down to check out the inside of the shade
on my desk lamp. She's headed for my lap.
</P>
<P>
   Gingerly, she taps a paw first on my arm, and then over to my
stomach, kind of like the way a winter fisherman tests the ice
before heading onto the pond. Once she's sure the chair and I
aren't going to move out from under her, she carefully steps across
to my chest, flattens herself and rests her nose on my chin. I ask
what's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A staccato mew is her only answer. I stroke the top of her head,
pausing to rub a silky ear between thumb and forefinger. She bumps
my chin and stretches a paw up to each shoulder. I ask her if she's
lonely. An affirmative mew. I tell her I understand and she purrs.
</P>
<P>
   The week before Christmas, we lost Stella, her 15-year-old
sister, and even though the girls weren't very close, Biddy misses
the dainty white ladycat she'd known all 10 years of her life. Nap
time certainly isn't the fun it used to be when there was
competition for the sunniest spot, nor is a treat nearly as sweet
when there's no one to pummel for it. And it was fun to have a
buddy to get goofy with when Mom broke out the catnip.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy probably still remembers the clout on the nose that was
Stella's initial response to the tiny newcomer's invasion of her
basket beside the radiator.
</P>
<P>
   That's what we're talking about this morning _ the good times.
The days when Stella was still strong enough to jump onto the
cistern and spend an evening raccoon watching through the basement
window. When she felt up to their twice-daily, fur-flying,
screeching race through the house until one or the other was
seduced by the siren call of a spot of sunlight on the carpet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want a little brother or sister?'' I ask the warm body
glued to my chest. Biddy looks at me, but doesn't respond so I try
again. ``Wouldn't it be fun to have a furry little thing to climb
all over you and bite your ears? Someone to help you roll balls
into the sump-pump hole and maybe stuff a few catnip mice under the
stove?'' No answer.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she's thinking it over. Or maybe it's just too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe tomorrow.

 &HT;    Gratuitous pitch shifts mounting debt onto future taxpayers
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ George W. Bush isn't just talking billions. He's
talking $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Over a decade, that's Bush's tax-cut proposal. And some of it
can be yours.
</P>
<P>
   What's your answer, New Hampshire?
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, we'd like to call Sen. McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most anti-tax states in the union, with some of
the hardest hardliners on federal spending, the man with one of the
most sweeping tax-cut plans in history and the biggest war chest to
sell it risks losing the first primary to McCain, a veritable
prude.
</P>
<P>
   This even though McCain has yet to call Bush's big tax-cut plan
what it is: a big tax _ a tax on future taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't, McCain is not as smart as he appears. And if Al
Gore or Bill Bradley, should either face Bush in the fall, doesn't
point out the same, the Democrats miss a mighty lick that should
resonate with everyone who knows what debt does.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the facts ignored. The United States over the last 25
years bought more government than it had cash to pay for. This
included the largest peacetime military buildup ever, to where the
Pentagon at one point commanded nearly a third of the federal
budget. Meanwhile, Ronald Reagan and blue-sky disciples cut tax
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The national debt now is $5.7 trillion. It grows $436 million
every day. Interest amounts to about $1,000 per man, woman and
child. And it grows. That's a tax someone must pay. Not us, under
G.W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush talks about equal-opportunity tax cuts. (Actually, 60
percent of the $1.1 trillion would go to the wealthiest 10 percent
by rolling back Bill Clinton's tax hike on the wealthiest 20
percent of Americans.) To get there, Bush would bypass a monstrous
opportunity: to reduce the federal debt that today's children and
their children must resolve.
</P>
<P>
   McCain proposes a tax cut about half that size. He has said a
portion of each surplus should be held to bolster Social Security
and reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan would take every penny of projected annual surplus
and plow it into tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   That might make sense for a state with a budget balanced by law.
It makes no sense for a federal government trillions in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, built into Bush's plan _ to cut marginal rates for
every American and to reduce tax brackets from five to four _ are
two unrealistic expectations: First, that today's prosperity will
continue unabated; second, that Congress can hold fast to 1994
balanced-budget caps that require drastic reductions in domestic
spending.
</P>
<P>
   We've already seen this Congress weaseling around the caps by
trying every accounting deceit in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of Bush's proudest moments as a candidate was when
he took on Republican leaders for callously proposing to cook the
year-end books by paying the Earned Income Tax Credit for the
working poor in monthly installments rather than one lump sum in
April.
</P>
<P>
   These 11th-hour contortions were needed to stay under the
self-imposed budget caps.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's tax plan relies on adhering to the same spending
restrictions, though a GOP-dominated Congress was at wit's end
figuring out how to do that.
</P>
<P>
   With all the revenue and the supposed savings aimed at balancing
the budget, you'd think we could be storing away dollars to resolve
the debt question hanging over future generations. McCain seems to
be interested in that. So, too, Gore and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Someone please explain to us why anti-tax Republicans in New
Hampshire haven't fully embraced Bush, the man with a more
gratuitously Reagan-ific tax-cut proposal. Instead, the more
cautious McCain leads in some polls.
</P>
<P>
   Where's the enthusiasm, New Hampshire tax haters? Could it be
that even those who hate taxes hate lingering debt worse? Today's
pre-schoolers sure ought to.

cited medical reasons _ instead of spiritual reasons _ for their
desire to undergo bloodless surgery. In response, Atlanta Medical
Center has started this month a program that can convert up to 99
percent of its operations _ even open heart surgery _ into
bloodless surgical procedures, using a combination of surgical
techniques, drugs and a machine that sucks up, cleans and
circulates the patients' own blood. (Lore, Atlanta

job, and that can be a blessing or a curse. The problem is that
it's easy to get confused and buy an adhesive that won't work well
for the purpose you have in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few tips on using and choosing glues:
</P>
<P>
   THE BASICS
</P>
<P>
   Glues are compounds that are applied as a liquid, paste or putty
between two surfaces that are to be held together. As the glue
dries and hardens, it bonds the surfaces together.
</P>
<P>
   Each type of glue has a characteristic setting time and curing
time. The setting time is the initial period it takes the glue to
dry, and it can be anywhere from a few seconds to a few days. But
the glue doesn't reach its full strength until its curing time has
passed.
</P>
<P>
   You usually have to apply pressure, either by hand or with a
clamp, to hold parts together until the glue has set. After the
joint is set, you have to avoid putting any stress on the joint
until the glue is fully cured.
</P>
<P>
   For a glue to hold, the pieces being joined have to be clean.
Wood should be free of paint, varnish and wax. Never glue with the
pieces resting on a work surface that has sawdust, grease or other
contaminants that can get into the new joint.
</P>
<P>
   Glued surfaces must be dryglues will hold underwater once
they have cured, but they should be applied dry. Other glues will
fail in damp or humid conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The glued parts must fit snugly. Before gluing, push the parts
together to be sure edges butt firmly and joints have good contact.
</P>
<P>
   Usually more is better when it comes to glue. Put on a generous
amount and wipe away the excess following package directions.
Instant bonding glues are an exception and should be used
sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   Generally adhesives work best at room temperature. When using
them outdoors, it's often best to wait until a day that's at least
65 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The best guide to using an adhesive is found on the package the
product comes in. The package will tell you what jobs the glue can
do, how it should be used and what its active ingredients are. Read
and follow all package directions to the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Some adhesives require that you wear gloves and/or provide
ventilation as you use them. Again, the package should be your
guide.
</P>
<P>
   GLUE TYPES
</P>
<P>
   There is no one glue that is best for every application. Choose
the glue for the job you have to do.
</P>
<P>
   _ Epoxy: This type of glue comes in two parts, a resin and a
hardener. The resin and hardener can be either liquid in tubes or
putty. Mix equal amounts of the two components, apply the compound
to the joint and clamp. Setting times run from five minutes to an
hour, and curing times usually run a few hours to a few days.
Epoxies are good for most materials and are particularly good at
holding together dissimilar materials, such as plastic and glass.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wood glue: These glues, generally yellow in color, are used in
carpentry, furniture making and wood repairs. They are squeezed
directly onto the surfaces to be joined, clamped and left to cure
overnight. They form a rigid, water-resistant bond.
</P>
<P>
   _ Instant bonding glue: Sold under names such as Superglue and
Krazy Glue, the scientific name for this type of adhesive is
cyanoacrylate. To use them, you squeeze a drop or two on the
surfaces to be joined and hold them in place for a minute or less.
The glues cure in one to 12 hours. Instant glues come in liquid
form for plastic, metal and rubber and gel form for porous
materials such as wood and leather. Wear gloves to keep from gluing
your fingers together and never point an instant bonding adhesive
toward your face.
</P>
<P>
   _ White glue: Products such as Elmer's Glue-All are
polyvinyl-chloride based. They are cheap and easy to use and clean
up with soap and water. They're good for general interior use on
wood, ceramics and paper, but they're water soluble and shouldn't
be used where they'll get wet. They set in about eight hours and
cure in a day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Contact cement: This type of adhesive is used primarily for
attaching veneers, such as attaching plastic veneer to countertops
or repairing wood veneers on furniture. A thin layer of glue is
applied to both surfaces with a disposable brush and allowed to
dry. The surfaces bond immediately when pressed together and cure
within two days.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hot-melt glue: These glues come in sticks that are melted in a
glue gun. They're good for fast repairs on leather and fabric and
are sometimes used in crafts. The bonds aren't very strong, though,
so hot-melt glues might not be best for permanent household
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Acrylic glue: Acrylic glues, such as Devcon Plastic Welder and
Duro Depend II, can be used to repair outdoor wooden furniture
because it's strong and waterproof. It's also a good choice for
metal and glass. Acrylic glue usually comes in two tubes; the
contents of one tube go on one surface to be joined, and the
contents of the other tube go on the other surface. They set in
about five minutes and cure overnight.

 &HT;    `Simpsons' success unexpected for woman behind Bart's voice
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When she started as the voice of Bart Simpson 12
years ago, Nancy Cartwright never thought the 10-year-old smart
aleck would become a cultural icon.
</P>
<P>
   Or that the animated family would get a star on the Hollywood
Walk of Fame, which happened Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being added to the Walk of Fame is a major feather in our
caps! I always thought it would be tremendous honor, but I never
thought that I would be included! How fun,'' Cartwright wrote in an
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Simpsons will join Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse as animated
characters honored with stars on the walk. The Simpsons' star will
be outside the Galaxy Theater on Hollywood Boulevard. ``Mel Blanc
and Bugs Bunny are our neighbors! Sounds appropriate,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Simpsons premiered in 60-second snippets on the ``Tracey
Ullman Show'' in 1987 and joined Fox as a series 10 years ago
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The show's endurance and popularity has surprised Cartwright.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us knew that the show would be the major,
international hit that it is. Into the first season we had the idea
that the show was a success, but no one had the prediction of how
great a success it would be. Ninety-four countries and Bart is one
of the top entertainers of the 20th century (according to Time)
along with Picasso, Frank Sinatra, Lucille Ball . . . that doesn't
suck at all!''
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright, who lives in California with her husband and their
two children, said the show's future hinges on the writers' ability
to do it justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it is animation, there is a lot more leeway than your
average sitcom. But they are already beginning to feel the crunch,
and we have at least season 12 to do. Rumor has it that they are
wanting to negotiate for another three years. We'll see . . . I'd
love that!''

   AIDS-EDITORIAL _ Clinton administration did right to focus
attention on Africa's AIDS epidemic during its monthlong leadership
of the U.N. Security Council and to step up funding to fight this
plague. Vice President Gore's blunt speech to the world body also
sets the right tone. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED FOR 1/18.
</P>
<P>
   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ My mother has to go to the
dentist. She's broken a tooth. It's something that can't wait. So,

</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ In one of the most anti-tax states
in the union, with some of the hardest hardliners on federal
spending, the man with one of the most sweeping tax-cut plans in
history and the biggest war chest to sell it risks losing the first
primary to John McCain, a veritable prude. This even though McCain
has yet to call George W. Bush's big tax-cut plan what it is: a big
tax _ a tax on future taxpayers. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald)

cited medical reasons _ instead of spiritual reasons _ for their
desire to undergo bloodless surgery. In response, Atlanta Medical
Center has started this month a program that can convert up to 99
percent of its operations _ even open heart surgery _ into
bloodless surgical procedures, using a combination of surgical
techniques, drugs and a machine that sucks up, cleans and
circulates the patients' own blood. (Lore, Atlanta

   Beckham and his colleagues have been trying to understand how
carpets dry after they're dyed. Using a high-powered mri machine
and watching in real time, Beckham found that moisture in a carpet
flows into the backing through the centers of individual tufts of
fiber, even against gravity.

   &UR; FIRST LIGHT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ten billion years ago, the infant universe convulsed with
activity. Small, chaotic, yet intensely bright galaxies suddenly
came alive.
</P>
<P>
   These strange objects blazed as brightly as our Milky Way,
although they were less than one-fifth its size.
</P>
<P>
   A new supercomputer simulation shows why: Collisions between
giant gas clouds _ the precursors of galaxies _ violently collapsed
the material into clusters of hot, energetic, newborn stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``As two of these (gassy) galaxies collide, the clouds of gas
stream together, producing a very high density of gas at the
center,'' explains cosmologist James Bullock of Ohio State
University, who analyzed the simulation along with Tsafrir Kolatt
of the University of California at Santa Cruz. ``From a little bit
of gas, you get a whole lot of stars and a very bright galaxy.''
</P>
<P>
   These interactions churned out as many as a thousand new stars
each year in the early galaxies. A typical galaxy now births just
one new star per year.
</P>
<P>
   The computer model is helping astronomers make sense of the many
faint blobs of light that dot the most sensitive deep-space images
from the Hubble Space Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at these objects, we are seeing massive galaxies
being assembled out of smaller parts. And so what we are really
seeing is the structure of the universe forming,'' Bullock says.

   Light could be better than electricity to make a computer run

</P>
<P>
   But he and his colleagues say they have found a solution. They
</P>
<P>
   poured silicon into a tray full of glass balls and used acid to

</P>
<P>
   Then they coated the holes in liquid crystals, whose
light-scattering properties change in the presence of an electric
field. The resulting structure should allow the scientists to
control the path of light and to reprogram it at will.

   &UR; GETTING THE SKINNY ON TV &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   Teen eating disorders are often blamed on the endless parade of
skinny actresses on television. Still, there are so many cultural
factors to consider that it is nearly impossible to make the
charges stick.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard anthropologist Anne Becker may have found some proof in
the Fiji Islands, where television first arrived just four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   More than four-fifths of Fijian women are overweight by American
standards but, until recently, it didn't seem to bother them.
Fijians have traditionally glorified larger proportions and worried
more about being too thin than about getting fat, Becker says.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight months after Western TV shows were introduced in
Fiji via satellite, however, she found that the number of teen-age
girls who vomited to control their weight increased fivefold, along
with a general rise in abnormal attitudes toward eating.
</P>
<P>
   Her surveys revealed that Fijian girls who clock the most hours
of TV (``Melrose Place'' and ``Beverly Hills 90210'' are especially
popular) are half again as likely to feel fat and a third more
likely to be on a diet than their peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see they're much bigger than these rich, successful
Americans. Add to that a culture attuned to weight changes, and the
results are disastrous,'' Becker says.

its four suction-cup feet and uses cameras and ultrasonic sensors
to inspect welds and detect cracks. Its left foot and right foot
are attached to an axle that slides back and forth and swivels to

</P>
<P>
   Robicen III fixes its front foot and back foot to the tank,

<P>
   For decades, heart disease has been the No. 1 killer in the
United States. But the underlying cause of heart disease has eluded
its pursuers. High cholesterol levels, for example, have never
correlated well with heart disease. Most heart attacks happen to
people with normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   And while medical researchers understand how cholesterol builds
up in a damaged patch of artery, they've never proven that
cholesterol itself does the initial damage.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because it doesn't. A rogue theory of heart-disease
progression holds that another player is at work. The suspect is
homocysteine, a byproduct of protein breakdown that can damage
blood vessels and provoke the cascade of events that leads to
plaques and clotting.
</P>
<P>
   The homocysteine theory has recently won the grudging acceptance
of the medical establishment, and homocysteine is now recognized by
the American Heart Association as a potential risk factor.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of homocysteine's treachery even has a hero. Kilmer
McCully was a promising young graduate of Harvard Medical School in
the 1960s when he heard about a rare disease called homocystinuria.
Researchers knew little about the disease except that it produced
high levels of homocysteine in a patient's urine.
</P>
<P>
   Victims often died in childhood of vascular complications such
as heart attack and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   McCully wondered if there could be a connection between these
unusual fatalities and high homocysteine levels. When he examined
tissue from two child victims, he noted the characteristic plaques
of arteriosclerosis. Strangely, however, the plaques were not
associated with any fat deposits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 he wrote a paper proposing that homocysteine might
influence the development of heart disease in the population at
large.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was published in a good journal by reputable people, and it
was sort of ignored,'' McCully says.
</P>
<P>
   McCully decided to follow his hunch anyway. In his lab at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, he did studies on animals
and tissue cultures to test how homocysteine interacts with other
substances in the body and with the linings of veins and arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Homocysteine comes from the breakdown of an amino acid called
methionine, which is abundant in meat and dairy products. McCully
discovered that the homocysteine molecule is metabolized by enzymes
that act in concert with B vitamins: B12, which comes from meat,
seafood and dairy products, and B6 and folic acid, which are both
abundant in vegetables and whole grains.
</P>
<P>
   He knew that patients with homocystinuria had genetic defects
that disabled these enzymes. But he reasoned that a B-vitamin
deficiency in an otherwise healthy person could shut down the
enzymes as well. In fact, homocysteine could be concentrated in the
blood of anyone who ate a lot of animal protein and didn't get
enough B vitamins to process it completely.
</P>
<P>
   McCully found out that such an accumulation could be bad news
for blood vessels. His experiments and many others since then have
shown that homocysteine can damage cells in the vascular linings,
interfere with the constriction and dilation of blood vessels, and
promote blood clotting. That damage is a first step in the scarring
and hardening of arteries; the deposits of fat and cholesterol that
build up over these scars are often the last step in heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   And to make matters worse, because homocysteine is transported
in low-density, or ``bad,'' cholesterol, it could be playing a
crucial role in the cardiovascular problems associated with high
cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   The more McCully learned about homocysteine, the more convinced
he became of his theory. But he was trained as a biochemist and
pathologist, not as a clinician. Although he could decipher
homocysteine's mechanism of action, he wasn't equipped to undertake
the human trials that might have validated his suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the establishment,'' he adds, ``felt that until it was
proven in patients, (the theory) probably was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong'' wasn't the half of it. When McCully first made his key
observations, the cholesterol model of heart disease was wowing
cardiologists. There was no need for an alternative theory. And for
a decade or so, McCully was one of only a handful of scientists who
appreciated the complicated biochemistry of homocysteine
metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, he couldn't find funding for his medical
research and wound up working as a pathologist at a Veterans
Affairs hospital in Providence, R.I. (where he has remained). But
he persisted in publishing modest studies funded by a
better-established colleague's grant.
</P>
<P>
   Then about a decade ago, results from some of the first major
long-term studies of heart disease began to trickle in. To
McCully's surprise, many included data on homocysteine. To everyone
else's surprise, the data revealed significant correlations between
homocysteine and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of almost 15,000 physicians, for example, those whose
homocysteine levels were highest had more than three times the risk
of heart attack as those whose levels were lowest.
</P>
<P>
   In an ongoing 50-year study of the population of Framingham,
Mass., an examination of more than 1,000 seniors found that
homocysteine levels corresponded to clogging of the arteries in the
neck. About 80 trials have suggested that elevated homocysteine is
associated with hardening or blockage of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The homocysteine hypothesis suddenly became respectable.
McCully's colleagues cite several reasons for the theory's belated
acceptance. In addition to the cholesterol prejudice, there's the
fact that, until recently, measuring homocysteine levels was
costly, difficult and time-consuming. But the latest homocysteine
blood tests are fast and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that there's a desperate need for a long-term
study to evaluate whether lowering homocysteine levels will in fact
help to prevent heart disease. But they say that even if the
connection holds up, homocysteine won't entirely eclipse the other,
more familiar, risk factors such as age, weight, smoking, blood
pressure and cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say, `Well, I'll take folic acid and eat whatever I
want and I'll be protected,''' says Craig Scott, a cardiologist at
the University of Pennsylvania. High homocysteine levels don't
guarantee a heart attack, he says, and low levels won't rule one
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do recommend folic acid for all my patients,'' Scott
says. ``It's something that everybody who's at risk for coronary
disease should consider doing as an adjunct.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately such recommendations may scuttle efforts to prove
once and for all the merits of the homocysteine hypothesis. Federal
guidelines introduced in 1998 increased the amount of folic acid
that must be added to enriched grain products; that increase,
together with the growing popularity of B vitamins in cardiology
clinics, might eliminate any heart conditions caused by vitamin
deficiency and homocysteine surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The latest results from the Framingham study, for example, show
that the new fortification program has added an average of 100
micrograms of folic acid to subjects' daily diets, resulting in a
sizable lowering of homocysteine levels, Krauss says. ``That's
going to make it difficult to do the studies that need to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   For McCully, it's perhaps the final irony in a bittersweet
career.

cardiologists. There was no need for an alternative theory. And for
a decade or so, McCully was one of only a handful of scientists who
appreciated the complicated biochemistry of homocysteine
metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, he couldn't find funding for his medical
research and wound up working as a pathologist at a Veterans
Affairs hospital in Providence, R.I. (where he has remained). But
he persisted in publishing modest studies funded by a
better-established colleague's grant.
</P>
<P>
   Then about a decade ago, results from some of the first major
long-term studies of heart disease began to trickle in. To
McCully's surprise, many included data on homocysteine. To everyone
else's surprise, the data revealed significant correlations between
homocysteine and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of almost 15,000 physicians, for example, those whose
homocysteine levels were highest had more than three times the risk
of heart attack as those whose levels were lowest.
</P>
<P>
   In an ongoing 50-year study of the population of Framingham,
Mass., an examination of more than 1,000 seniors found that
homocysteine levels corresponded to clogging of the arteries in the
neck. About 80 trials have suggested that elevated homocysteine is
associated with hardening or blockage of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The homocysteine hypothesis suddenly became respectable.
McCully's colleagues cite several reasons for the theory's belated
acceptance. In addition to the cholesterol prejudice, there's the
fact that, until recently, measuring homocysteine levels was
costly, difficult and time-consuming. But the latest homocysteine
blood tests are fast and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that there's a desperate need for a long-term
study to evaluate whether lowering homocysteine levels will in fact
help to prevent heart disease. But they say that even if the
connection holds up, homocysteine won't entirely eclipse the other,
more familiar, risk factors such as age, weight, smoking, blood
pressure and cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say, `Well, I'll take folic acid and eat whatever I
want and I'll be protected,''' says Craig Scott, a cardiologist at
the University of Pennsylvania. High homocysteine levels don't
guarantee a heart attack, he says, and low levels won't rule one
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do recommend folic acid for all my patients,'' Scott
says. ``It's something that everybody who's at risk for coronary
disease should consider doing as an adjunct.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately such recommendations may scuttle efforts to prove
once and for all the merits of the homocysteine hypothesis. Federal
guidelines introduced in 1998 increased the amount of folic acid
that must be added to enriched grain products; that increase,
together with the growing popularity of B vitamins in cardiology
clinics, might eliminate any heart conditions caused by vitamin
deficiency and homocysteine surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The latest results from the Framingham study, for example, show
that the new fortification program has added an average of 100
micrograms of folic acid to subjects' daily diets, resulting in a
sizable lowering of homocysteine levels, Krauss says. ``That's
going to make it difficult to do the studies that need to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   For McCully, it's perhaps the final irony in a bittersweet
career.

   Ten billion years ago, the infant universe convulsed with

<P>
   These strange objects blazed as brightly as our Milky Way,
although they were less than one-fifth its size.
</P>
<P>
   A new supercomputer simulation shows why: Collisions between
giant gas clouds _ the precursors of galaxies _ violently collapsed
the material into clusters of hot, energetic, newborn stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``As two of these (gassy) galaxies collide, the clouds of gas
stream together, producing a very high density of gas at the
center,'' explains cosmologist James Bullock of Ohio State
University, who analyzed the simulation along with Tsafrir Kolatt
of the University of California at Santa Cruz. ``From a little bit
of gas, you get a whole lot of stars and a very bright galaxy.''
</P>
<P>
   These interactions churned out as many as a thousand new stars
each year in the early galaxies. A typical galaxy now births just
one new star per year.
</P>
<P>
   The computer model is helping astronomers make sense of the many
faint blobs of light that dot the most sensitive deep-space images
from the Hubble Space Telescope.

   Teen eating disorders are often blamed on the endless parade of

</P>
<P>
   Harvard anthropologist Anne Becker may have found some proof in
the Fiji Islands, where television first arrived just four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   More than four-fifths of Fijian women are overweight by American
standards but, until recently, it didn't seem to bother them.
Fijians have traditionally glorified larger proportions and worried
more about being too thin than about getting fat, Becker says.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight months after Western TV shows were introduced in
Fiji via satellite, however, she found that the number of teen-age
girls who vomited to control their weight increased fivefold, along
with a general rise in abnormal attitudes toward eating.
</P>
<P>
   Her surveys revealed that Fijian girls who clock the most hours
of TV (``Melrose Place'' and ``Beverly Hills 90210'' are especially
popular) are half again as likely to feel fat and a third more
likely to be on a diet than their peers.
</P>

its four suction-cup feet and uses cameras and ultrasonic sensors

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   For decades, heart disease has been the No. 1 killer in the
United States. But the underlying cause of heart disease has eluded
its pursuers. High cholesterol levels, for example, have never
correlated well with heart disease. Most heart attacks happen to
people with normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   And while medical researchers understand how cholesterol builds
up in a damaged patch of artery, they've never proven that
cholesterol itself does the initial damage.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because it doesn't. A rogue theory of heart-disease
progression holds that another player is at work. The suspect is
homocysteine, a byproduct of protein breakdown that can damage
blood vessels and provoke the cascade of events that leads to
plaques and clotting.
</P>
<P>
   The homocysteine theory has recently won the grudging acceptance
of the medical establishment, and homocysteine is now recognized by
the American Heart Association as a potential risk factor.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of homocysteine's treachery even has a hero. Kilmer
McCully was a promising young graduate of Harvard Medical School in
the 1960s when he heard about a rare disease called homocystinuria.
Researchers knew little about the disease except that it produced
high levels of homocysteine in a patient's urine.
</P>
<P>
   Victims often died in childhood of vascular complications such
as heart attack and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   McCully wondered if there could be a connection between these
unusual fatalities and high homocysteine levels. When he examined
tissue from two child victims, he noted the characteristic plaques
of arteriosclerosis. Strangely, however, the plaques were not
associated with any fat deposits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 he wrote a paper proposing that homocysteine might
influence the development of heart disease in the population at
large.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was published in a good journal by reputable people, and it
was sort of ignored,'' McCully says.
</P>
<P>
   McCully decided to follow his hunch anyway. In his lab at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, he did studies on animals
and tissue cultures to test how homocysteine interacts with other
substances in the body and with the linings of veins and arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Homocysteine comes from the breakdown of an amino acid called
methionine, which is abundant in meat and dairy products. McCully
discovered that the homocysteine molecule is metabolized by enzymes
that act in concert with B vitamins: B12, which comes from meat,
seafood and dairy products, and B6 and folic acid, which are both
abundant in vegetables and whole grains.
</P>
<P>
   He knew that patients with homocystinuria had genetic defects
that disabled these enzymes. But he reasoned that a B-vitamin
deficiency in an otherwise healthy person could shut down the
enzymes as well. In fact, homocysteine could be concentrated in the
blood of anyone who ate a lot of animal protein and didn't get
enough B vitamins to process it completely.
</P>
<P>
   McCully found out that such an accumulation could be bad news
for blood vessels. His experiments and many others since then have
shown that homocysteine can damage cells in the vascular linings,
interfere with the constriction and dilation of blood vessels, and
promote blood clotting. That damage is a first step in the scarring
and hardening of arteries; the deposits of fat and cholesterol that
build up over these scars are often the last step in heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   And to make matters worse, because homocysteine is transported
in low-density, or ``bad,'' cholesterol, it could be playing a
crucial role in the cardiovascular problems associated with high
cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   The more McCully learned about homocysteine, the more convinced
he became of his theory. But he was trained as a biochemist and
pathologist, not as a clinician. Although he could decipher
homocysteine's mechanism of action, he wasn't equipped to undertake
the human trials that might have validated his suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the establishment,'' he adds, ``felt that until it was
proven in patients, (the theory) probably was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong'' wasn't the half of it. When McCully first made his key
observations, the cholesterol model of heart disease was wowing
cardiologists. There was no need for an alternative theory. And for
a decade or so, McCully was one of only a handful of scientists who
appreciated the complicated biochemistry of homocysteine
metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, he couldn't find funding for his medical
research and wound up working as a pathologist at a Veterans
Affairs hospital in Providence, R.I. (where he has remained). But
he persisted in publishing modest studies funded by a
better-established colleague's grant.
</P>
<P>
   Then about a decade ago, results from some of the first major
long-term studies of heart disease began to trickle in. To
McCully's surprise, many included data on homocysteine. To everyone
else's surprise, the data revealed significant correlations between
homocysteine and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of almost 15,000 physicians, for example, those whose
homocysteine levels were highest had more than three times the risk
of heart attack as those whose levels were lowest.
</P>
<P>
   In an ongoing 50-year study of the population of Framingham,
Mass., an examination of more than 1,000 seniors found that
homocysteine levels corresponded to clogging of the arteries in the
neck. About 80 trials have suggested that elevated homocysteine is
associated with hardening or blockage of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The homocysteine hypothesis suddenly became respectable.
McCully's colleagues cite several reasons for the theory's belated
acceptance. In addition to the cholesterol prejudice, there's the
fact that, until recently, measuring homocysteine levels was
costly, difficult and time-consuming. But the latest homocysteine
blood tests are fast and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that there's a desperate need for a long-term
study to evaluate whether lowering homocysteine levels will in fact
help to prevent heart disease. But they say that even if the
connection holds up, homocysteine won't entirely eclipse the other,
more familiar, risk factors such as age, weight, smoking, blood
pressure and cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say, `Well, I'll take folic acid and eat whatever I
want and I'll be protected,''' says Craig Scott, a cardiologist at
the University of Pennsylvania. High homocysteine levels don't
guarantee a heart attack, he says, and low levels won't rule one
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do recommend folic acid for all my patients,'' Scott
says. ``It's something that everybody who's at risk for coronary
disease should consider doing as an adjunct.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately such recommendations may scuttle efforts to prove
once and for all the merits of the homocysteine hypothesis. Federal
guidelines introduced in 1998 increased the amount of folic acid
that must be added to enriched grain products; that increase,
together with the growing popularity of B vitamins in cardiology
clinics, might eliminate any heart conditions caused by vitamin
deficiency and homocysteine surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The latest results from the Framingham study, for example, show
that the new fortification program has added an average of 100
micrograms of folic acid to subjects' daily diets, resulting in a
sizable lowering of homocysteine levels, Krauss says. ``That's
going to make it difficult to do the studies that need to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   For McCully, it's perhaps the final irony in a bittersweet
career.

<P>
   For decades, heart disease has been the No. 1 killer in the
United States. But the underlying cause of heart disease has eluded
its pursuers. High cholesterol levels, for example, have never
correlated well with heart disease. Most heart attacks happen to
people with normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   And while medical researchers understand how cholesterol builds
up in a damaged patch of artery, they've never proven that
cholesterol itself does the initial damage.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because it doesn't. A rogue theory of heart-disease
progression holds that another player is at work. The suspect is
homocysteine, a byproduct of protein breakdown that can damage
blood vessels and provoke the cascade of events that leads to
plaques and clotting.
</P>
<P>
   The homocysteine theory has recently won the grudging acceptance
of the medical establishment, and homocysteine is now recognized by
the American Heart Association as a potential risk factor.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of homocysteine's treachery even has a hero. Kilmer
McCully was a promising young graduate of Harvard Medical School in
the 1960s when he heard about a rare disease called homocystinuria.
Researchers knew little about the disease except that it produced
high levels of homocysteine in a patient's urine.
</P>
<P>
   Victims often died in childhood of vascular complications such
as heart attack and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   McCully wondered if there could be a connection between these
unusual fatalities and high homocysteine levels. When he examined
tissue from two child victims, he noted the characteristic plaques
of arteriosclerosis. Strangely, however, the plaques were not
associated with any fat deposits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 he wrote a paper proposing that homocysteine might
influence the development of heart disease in the population at
large.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was published in a good journal by reputable people, and it
was sort of ignored,'' McCully says.
</P>
<P>
   McCully decided to follow his hunch anyway. In his lab at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, he did studies on animals
and tissue cultures to test how homocysteine interacts with other
substances in the body and with the linings of veins and arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Homocysteine comes from the breakdown of an amino acid called
methionine, which is abundant in meat and dairy products. McCully
discovered that the homocysteine molecule is metabolized by enzymes
that act in concert with B vitamins: B12, which comes from meat,
seafood and dairy products, and B6 and folic acid, which are both
abundant in vegetables and whole grains.
</P>
<P>
   He knew that patients with homocystinuria had genetic defects
that disabled these enzymes. But he reasoned that a B-vitamin
deficiency in an otherwise healthy person could shut down the
enzymes as well. In fact, homocysteine could be concentrated in the
blood of anyone who ate a lot of animal protein and didn't get
enough B vitamins to process it completely.
</P>
<P>
   McCully found out that such an accumulation could be bad news
for blood vessels. His experiments and many others since then have
shown that homocysteine can damage cells in the vascular linings,
interfere with the constriction and dilation of blood vessels, and
promote blood clotting. That damage is a first step in the scarring
and hardening of arteries; the deposits of fat and cholesterol that
build up over these scars are often the last step in heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   And to make matters worse, because homocysteine is transported
in low-density, or ``bad,'' cholesterol, it could be playing a
crucial role in the cardiovascular problems associated with high
cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   The more McCully learned about homocysteine, the more convinced
he became of his theory. But he was trained as a biochemist and
pathologist, not as a clinician. Although he could decipher
homocysteine's mechanism of action, he wasn't equipped to undertake
the human trials that might have validated his suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the establishment,'' he adds, ``felt that until it was
proven in patients, (the theory) probably was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong'' wasn't the half of it. When McCully first made his key
observations, the cholesterol model of heart disease was wowing
cardiologists. There was no need for an alternative theory. And for
a decade or so, McCully was one of only a handful of scientists who
appreciated the complicated biochemistry of homocysteine
metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, he couldn't find funding for his medical
research and wound up working as a pathologist at a Veterans
Affairs hospital in Providence, R.I. (where he has remained). But
he persisted in publishing modest studies funded by a
better-established colleague's grant.
</P>
<P>
   Then about a decade ago, results from some of the first major
long-term studies of heart disease began to trickle in. To
McCully's surprise, many included data on homocysteine. To everyone
else's surprise, the data revealed significant correlations between
homocysteine and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of almost 15,000 physicians, for example, those whose
homocysteine levels were highest had more than three times the risk
of heart attack as those whose levels were lowest.
</P>
<P>
   In an ongoing 50-year study of the population of Framingham,
Mass., an examination of more than 1,000 seniors found that
homocysteine levels corresponded to clogging of the arteries in the
neck. About 80 trials have suggested that elevated homocysteine is
associated with hardening or blockage of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The homocysteine hypothesis suddenly became respectable.
McCully's colleagues cite several reasons for the theory's belated
acceptance. In addition to the cholesterol prejudice, there's the
fact that, until recently, measuring homocysteine levels was
costly, difficult and time-consuming. But the latest homocysteine
blood tests are fast and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that there's a desperate need for a long-term
study to evaluate whether lowering homocysteine levels will in fact
help to prevent heart disease. But they say that even if the
connection holds up, homocysteine won't entirely eclipse the other,
more familiar, risk factors such as age, weight, smoking, blood
pressure and cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say, `Well, I'll take folic acid and eat whatever I
want and I'll be protected,''' says Craig Scott, a cardiologist at
the University of Pennsylvania. High homocysteine levels don't
guarantee a heart attack, he says, and low levels won't rule one
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do recommend folic acid for all my patients,'' Scott
says. ``It's something that everybody who's at risk for coronary
disease should consider doing as an adjunct.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately such recommendations may scuttle efforts to prove
once and for all the merits of the homocysteine hypothesis. Federal
guidelines introduced in 1998 increased the amount of folic acid
that must be added to enriched grain products; that increase,
together with the growing popularity of B vitamins in cardiology
clinics, might eliminate any heart conditions caused by vitamin
deficiency and homocysteine surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The latest results from the Framingham study, for example, show
that the new fortification program has added an average of 100
micrograms of folic acid to subjects' daily diets, resulting in a
sizable lowering of homocysteine levels, Krauss says. ``That's
going to make it difficult to do the studies that need to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   For McCully, it's perhaps the final irony in a bittersweet
career.

   LOS ANGELES _ Deborah Kara Unger, sipping tea in the garden at
Hollywood's Chateau Marmont Hotel, might think she's well
disguised. She's wearing a bulky suede jacket and her blond hair is
pulled back in a ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, all is fine. A bird flaps through the bushes.
Butterflies flutter about the bougainvillea. Everyone ignores her.
</P>
<P>
   Then an eager producer lands tableside, reminding her that they
met once in Toronto. Unger is polite, yet looks blank. The man
protests: He seems to think it was a memorable meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoopsie,'' says Unger as he walks away.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Unger doesn't enjoy being approached by strange men.
Although the actress, 33, has the image of an icy femme fatale _
mainly from her roles in ``Crash'' and ``The Game'' _ and although
she has appeared in a handful of nude scenes, she points out that
she is actually rather shy. So shy, she says, that she was a virgin
until she was 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are disappointed when they meet me,'' she
says, snapping out the words. ``Those people are usually silly and
they're usually male, and they can go back to the silly Web sites
they create about me. It feels like such a violation.''
</P>
<P>
   True, Unger is about to appear in two more films in which she's
not completely virtuous: In ``Sunshine,'' set during the 1959
Hungarian revolution, she plays Ralph Fiennes's married love
interest, and in ``Signs and Wonders,'' she's the mistress who
breaks up Stellan Skarsgaard's marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``The Hurricane,'' which recently opened, she plays a
Canadian activist fighting to free American prizefighter Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter from jail, where he languishes after being
framed for three murders.
</P>
<P>
   Director Norman Jewison was impressed when Unger, who was drawn
to the story intellectually and emotionally, flew in from Hungary
to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She showed up at my apartment in New York on a day when I was
reading two other actresses,'' Jewison remembers. ``She said,
`Please excuse the bags under my eyes.' And she really touched me.
As I got to know her, I realized she has an edginess to her, but
she also has a sensuous side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to go to work every day and not have to be some
sort of depraved vixen,'' says Unger, who was also elated by
watching Denzel Washington play Carter. ``He was exercising muscles
metaphorically that he hasn't exercised for a very long time. It's
inspiring to spend time around somebody who's that great an
emotional athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, Unger, who grew up in Canada, the daughter
of a doctor and a political activist, has not found herself
particularly inspired since she first landed in Hollywood eight
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no resonance to fame,'' she says. ``It's so valueless.
So there's a lot of sadness in this town. God bless the loneliness
of those people. It's hard to address what's ontologically valuable
when you're running from your shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   Unger, who attended the Australian National Institute of
Dramatic Arts _ the alma mater of Cate Blanchett, Judy Davis and
Mel Gibson _ claims she's not running from anything; for her, she
says, acting is a means of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   But as a child of divorce, she admits, she's had trouble
figuring out where her real home is. And psychotherapy wouldn't be
much help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can tell me that going to a shrink brings any
retribution for your past _ so just get on with it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That was her attitude even as a teen-ager, when she finished
school a year and a half ahead of her peers. She was also
precocious in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had very large mammary glands,'' she says of herself at 12.
``I looked like the teacher's mistress. But I ended up being
valedictorian, which was my retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Unger is not now _ and never has been_ anyone's mistress. But
after just ending a 3 1/2-year relationship with a producer, she's
hungry for love. And no, she doesn't mean wild sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with dim lighting and a very intimate
missionary position,'' Unger says. ``The missionary position and
candles. Nouveau sex. The journey back to blushing, I think, is a
fabulous one.''

   If pinup calendars and Playboy centerfolds used to be the
answer, today there's another way to for the countless litters of

   A little T&AMP;A, followed by a Q&AMP;A, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an abundance in Hollywood of girls at the same
level,'' said Elizabeth Schulte, special projects editor for
Details. ``We get bombarded with requests. Once a girl has a series
on WB, I get a phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that sells best for us is to show famous or
up-and-coming girls who are identified with a certain role and
image, and then get them a little sexier than what the public's
used to,'' said Jim Kaminsky, co-editor of Maxim. ``Take (December
cover girl) Lara Flynn Boyle. She plays a buttoned-down character
on `The Practice,' but I think she wanted to let people know she's
very pretty and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The holy grail of the men's magazine covers is to get a girl
who's interested in changing her image in a sexier light,'' said
Andy Clerkson, editor of Stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Melissa Joan Hart syndrome. The popular young star
of the hit TV show `Sabrina the Teenage Witch' drew both extensive
criticism (including threats of being fired) and widespread
attention for her appearance on Maxim wearing little and striking
numerous provocative poses.
</P>
<P>
   A few brickbats aside, this new marriage of convenience is
proving to be a win-win situation for everyone involved. These
fledgling young starlets get seen before the ravenous eyes of
hundreds of thousands (sometimes over a million) of young men,
including casting directors and entertainment executives.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jack Wright, executive editor of Gear, his March
issue will feature a prominent actress who's ``much bigger than
Melissa Joan Hart,'' and who hopes to shed her sweet,
girl-next-door image.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fed up with the treatment on the other magazines that
continued the goody-two-shoes image,'' Wright said. ``So we came to
her rescue _ the cover image will be a huge leap from the character
she plays on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, chivalry isn't Wright's main motive. Magazines often
find their newsstand sales soaring _ Maxim delivers approximately 1
million at newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   And while it's too still early to determine whether this month's
Details cover girl, Selma Blair (of ``Cruel Intentions'' and
``Zoe'' fame), will sell more than January stunner Mena Suvari (the
dream girl of ``American Beauty''), magazine editors say Alyssa
Milano, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar can be
counted as reliable best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as magazines vie for the same pool of actresses to get
undressed, editors say they differentiate themselves in the way
they depict them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Maxim, you basically cut off the head and attach a new
one on the same bikini-clad body,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   But while vamping the girls up (sometimes, at their insistence)
will certainly sell more copies, opinions vary as to how far they
should go. While an editor might fight to get the young lady in
lingerie or swimsuits, the publicist might offer her in a halter
top or other semi-revealing, but semi-respectable, outfits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases they (publicists) understand what we're trying
to do very well, and they let us do want we want,'' Kaminsky said.
``Other times it requires a negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, publicists try to fight the sexiness,'' Wright
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Details, under editor Mark Golin, has been trying to
strike a balance between showing beautiful actresses in a sexy
manner to increase circulation, but not too far-out to alienate
upscale fashion advertisers, as well as publicists.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Details, it's about a latent sexiness,'' Schulte said.
``Our reader has a little more class. With a lot of these girls,
this is the second or third cover and they're just starting out in
their careers. With a blatantly sexy pinup, it could ruin their
careers. They can get pigeonholed in a category as a pinup girl
instead of an actress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's about how comfortable the client is,'' said
Leslie Sloane-Zelnik of BWR in New York, and the publicist for such
actors as Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rebecca Gayheart, Shannen Doherty
and Gretchen Mol. ``I love all of the magazines, I think they're
great for different projects. But while I thought the Lara Flynn
Boyle cover was very sexy, it was also bit scary and maybe a little
overboard. It was a bit Playboy-ish. If the actress wants to do
that, then it's up to her.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Deborah Kara Unger, sipping tea in the garden at
Hollywood's Chateau Marmont Hotel, might think she's well
disguised. She's wearing a bulky suede jacket and her blond hair is
pulled back in a ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, all is fine. A bird flaps through the bushes.
Butterflies flutter about the bougainvillea. Everyone ignores her.
</P>
<P>
   Then an eager producer lands tableside, reminding her that they
met once in Toronto. Unger is polite, yet looks blank. The man
protests: He seems to think it was a memorable meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoopsie,'' says Unger as he walks away.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Unger doesn't enjoy being approached by strange men.
Although the actress, 33, has the image of an icy femme fatale _
mainly from her roles in ``Crash'' and ``The Game'' _ and although
she has appeared in a handful of nude scenes, she points out that
she is actually rather shy. So shy, she says, that she was a virgin
until she was 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are disappointed when they meet me,'' she
says, snapping out the words. ``Those people are usually silly and
they're usually male, and they can go back to the silly Web sites
they create about me. It feels like such a violation.''
</P>
<P>
   True, Unger is about to appear in two more films in which she's
not completely virtuous: In ``Sunshine,'' set during the 1959
Hungarian revolution, she plays Ralph Fiennes's married love
interest, and in ``Signs and Wonders,'' she's the mistress who
breaks up Stellan Skarsgaard's marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``The Hurricane,'' which recently opened, she plays a
Canadian activist fighting to free American prizefighter Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter from jail, where he languishes after being
framed for three murders.
</P>
<P>
   Director Norman Jewison was impressed when Unger, who was drawn
to the story intellectually and emotionally, flew in from Hungary
to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She showed up at my apartment in New York on a day when I was
reading two other actresses,'' Jewison remembers. ``She said,
`Please excuse the bags under my eyes.' And she really touched me.
As I got to know her, I realized she has an edginess to her, but
she also has a sensuous side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to go to work every day and not have to be some
sort of depraved vixen,'' says Unger, who was also elated by
watching Denzel Washington play Carter. ``He was exercising muscles
metaphorically that he hasn't exercised for a very long time. It's
inspiring to spend time around somebody who's that great an
emotional athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, Unger, who grew up in Canada, the daughter
of a doctor and a political activist, has not found herself
particularly inspired since she first landed in Hollywood eight
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no resonance to fame,'' she says. ``It's so valueless.
So there's a lot of sadness in this town. God bless the loneliness
of those people. It's hard to address what's ontologically valuable
when you're running from your shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   Unger, who attended the Australian National Institute of
Dramatic Arts _ the alma mater of Cate Blanchett, Judy Davis and
Mel Gibson _ claims she's not running from anything; for her, she
says, acting is a means of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   But as a child of divorce, she admits, she's had trouble
figuring out where her real home is. And psychotherapy wouldn't be
much help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can tell me that going to a shrink brings any
retribution for your past _ so just get on with it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That was her attitude even as a teen-ager, when she finished
school a year and a half ahead of her peers. She was also
precocious in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had very large mammary glands,'' she says of herself at 12.
``I looked like the teacher's mistress. But I ended up being
valedictorian, which was my retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Unger is not now _ and never has been_ anyone's mistress. But
after just ending a 3 1/2-year relationship with a producer, she's
hungry for love. And no, she doesn't mean wild sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with dim lighting and a very intimate
missionary position,'' Unger says. ``The missionary position and
candles. Nouveau sex. The journey back to blushing, I think, is a
fabulous one.''

   Here's a dilemma for the 21st century: You're a TV starlet with
a PG reputation who's yearning to go R. What's a girl to do?
</P>
<P>
   If pinup calendars and Playboy centerfolds used to be the

she plays on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, chivalry isn't Wright's main motive. Magazines often
find their newsstand sales soaring _ Maxim delivers approximately 1
million at newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   And while it's too still early to determine whether this month's
Details cover girl, Selma Blair (of ``Cruel Intentions'' and
``Zoe'' fame), will sell more than January stunner Mena Suvari (the
dream girl of ``American Beauty''), magazine editors say Alyssa
Milano, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar can be
counted as reliable best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as magazines vie for the same pool of actresses to get
undressed, editors say they differentiate themselves in the way
they depict them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Maxim, you basically cut off the head and attach a new
one on the same bikini-clad body,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   But while vamping the girls up (sometimes, at their insistence)
will certainly sell more copies, opinions vary as to how far they
should go. While an editor might fight to get the young lady in
lingerie or swimsuits, the publicist might offer her in a halter
top or other semi-revealing, but semi-respectable, outfits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases they (publicists) understand what we're trying
to do very well, and they let us do want we want,'' Kaminsky said.
``Other times it requires a negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, publicists try to fight the sexiness,'' Wright
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Details, under editor Mark Golin, has been trying to
strike a balance between showing beautiful actresses in a sexy
manner to increase circulation, but not too far-out to alienate
upscale fashion advertisers, as well as publicists.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Details, it's about a latent sexiness,'' Schulte said.
``Our reader has a little more class. With a lot of these girls,
this is the second or third cover and they're just starting out in
their careers. With a blatantly sexy pinup, it could ruin their
careers. They can get pigeonholed in a category as a pinup girl
instead of an actress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's about how comfortable the client is,'' said
Leslie Sloane-Zelnik of BWR in New York, and the publicist for such
actors as Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rebecca Gayheart, Shannen Doherty
and Gretchen Mol. ``I love all of the magazines, I think they're
great for different projects. But while I thought the Lara Flynn
Boyle cover was very sexy, it was also bit scary and maybe a little
overboard. It was a bit Playboy-ish. If the actress wants to do
that, then it's up to her.''

<P>
   Here's a dilemma for the 21st century: You're a TV starlet with
a PG reputation who's yearning to go R. What's a girl to do?
</P>
<P>
   If pinup calendars and Playboy centerfolds used to be the
answer, today there's another way to for the countless litters of
sex kittens running around Hollywood to get the message across. If
you're willing to risk going risque, men's magazines are more than
happy to snap you _ topless or in lingerie, if you please _ and put
you on the cover, followed by an inside interview.
</P>
<P>
   A little T&AMP;A, followed by a Q&AMP;A, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an abundance in Hollywood of girls at the same
level,'' said Elizabeth Schulte, special projects editor for
Details. ``We get bombarded with requests. Once a girl has a series
on WB, I get a phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that sells best for us is to show famous or
up-and-coming girls who are identified with a certain role and
image, and then get them a little sexier than what the public's
used to,'' said Jim Kaminsky, co-editor of Maxim. ``Take (December
cover girl) Lara Flynn Boyle. She plays a buttoned-down character
on `The Practice,' but I think she wanted to let people know she's
very pretty and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The holy grail of the men's magazine covers is to get a girl
who's interested in changing her image in a sexier light,'' said
Andy Clerkson, editor of Stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Melissa Joan Hart syndrome. The popular young star
of the hit TV show `Sabrina the Teenage Witch' drew both extensive
criticism (including threats of being fired) and widespread
attention for her appearance on Maxim wearing little and striking
numerous provocative poses.
</P>
<P>
   A few brickbats aside, this new marriage of convenience is
proving to be a win-win situation for everyone involved. These
fledgling young starlets get seen before the ravenous eyes of
hundreds of thousands (sometimes over a million) of young men,
including casting directors and entertainment executives.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jack Wright, executive editor of Gear, his March
issue will feature a prominent actress who's ``much bigger than
Melissa Joan Hart,'' and who hopes to shed her sweet,
girl-next-door image.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fed up with the treatment on the other magazines that
continued the goody-two-shoes image,'' Wright said. ``So we came to
her rescue _ the cover image will be a huge leap from the character
she plays on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, chivalry isn't Wright's main motive. Magazines often
find their newsstand sales soaring _ Maxim delivers approximately 1
million at newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   And while it's too still early to determine whether this month's

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ As the nation observed the birthday of the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the American Library Association
announced Monday that two of the most prestigious prizes for
children's literature, the Newbery Medal and the Coretta Scott King
Author Award for excellence by African-American writers, were both
going to ``Bud, Not Buddy,'' by Christopher Paul Curtis
(Delacorte). The novel, set during the Depression, is about a
10-year-old orphan who runs away from yet another foster home in
Flint, Mich., in search of a legendary band leader in Grand Rapids
who he thinks might be his father.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis' first novel, ``The Watsons Go to Birmingham _ 1963,''
was a Newbery Honor Book in 1996. But this is the first time since
1976 that an African-American writer has won the Newbery Medal, and
the announcement was greeted with enthusiasm by the librarians and
publishers at the association's midwinter meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Caldecott Medal for illustration went to ``Joseph Had a
Little Overcoat,'' written and illustrated by Simms Taback
(Viking). Based on a Yiddish folk tale, it tells how a resourceful
tailor transforms his worn-out overcoat into smaller and smaller
garments. The ebullient illustrations are in watercolor, gouache,
pencil, ink and collage. Taback's retelling of ``There Was an Old
Lady Who Swallowed a Fly'' was an Honor Book in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The first Michael L. Printz Award for excellence in literature
for young adults (a new award named for a librarian from Topeka,
Kan.) also went to a black writer, Walter Dean Myers, for
``Monster'' (HarperCollins). It was also chosen as a King Honor
Book.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Honor Books, or secondary awards in the prizes
administered by committees of the Library Association, is at the
discretion of the jury for each prize.
</P>
<P>
   This year there were three Newbery Honor Books: ``Getting Near
to Baby'' by Audry Couloumbis (Putnam's), ``25 Fairmount Avenue''
by Tomie dePaola (Putnam's) and ``Our Only May Amelia'' by Jennifer
L. Holm (HarperCollins).
</P>
<P>
   There were four Caldecott Honor Books: ``Sector 7,'' illustrated
and written by David Weisner (Clarion); ``The Ugly Duckling,''
adapted and illustrated by Jerry Pinkney (Morrow); ``When Sophie
Gets Angry _ Really, Really Angry,'' illustrated and written by
Molly Bang (Scholastic); and ``A Child's Calendar,'' illustrated by
Trina Schart Hyman and written by John Updike (Holiday).
</P>
<P>
   There were three King Author Honor Books: ``Francie'' by Karen
English (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux); ``Black Hand, White Sails: The
Story of African-American Whalers'' by Patricia C. and Frederick L.
McKissack (Scholastic), and ``Monster.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also two King Honor Books for illustration: ``My Rows
and Piles of Coins,'' illustrated by E.B. Lewis and written by
Tolowa M. Mollel (Clarion), and ``Black Cat,'' illustrated and
written by Christopher Myers (Scholastic). Myers also illustrated
his father's prize-winning ``Monster.''

&HT;     ON-LINE COMPANY TAKES NOVEL APPROACH TO BOOK PUBLISHING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VANESSA HUA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years of publishers' rejections proved to David Loye that
he was right.
</P>
<P>
   His book, which challenges prevailing notions of Charles
Darwin's theory of evolution, found no takers. Loye remained
confident despite the rejections, reasoning that groundbreaking
works often meet resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Then the former Princeton University psychology professor found
an outlet through iUniverse, an upstart publisher in Campbell,
Calif., that wants to change the book world.
</P>
<P>
   Due out later this month, ``Darwin's Lost Theory of Love''
argues that the evolutionist did not mean for his landmark thesis
to lead to cutthroat competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book was so revolutionary, it was turned down by academic
and trade presses,'' said Loye, 74, an award-winning author who now
lives on the Monterey Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   For as little as $99, iUniverse will publish any new title in
paperback. If an existing book is out of print, the company will
publish it for free.
</P>
<P>
   In return, authors receive royalties ranging from 20 to 50
percent of sales, depending on whether the book is new or
out-of-print, or in paperback or electronic form.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other vanity houses, iUniverse does not charge authors
for the print run. Instead, it makes money from book sales.
</P>
<P>
   The privately-held company, which is not yet profitable, joins a
growing number of on-line publishing houses, including Santa
Clara-based Fatbrain.com and 1stBooks.com of Bloomington, Ind.
Although it is too soon to tell whether such companies will be
profitable, their development has been a page-turner for the book
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional publisher perpetuates the myth that the book
is rejected because it has no quality. That's elitist. A lot of
good books don't get published,'' said Richard Tam, the president
and chief executive of iUniverse.
</P>
<P>
   With iUniverse, anyone with a version of the great American
novel can see the book in print within a month _ thanks to new
digital, low-cost printing technology and a total free-for-all in
editorial standards.
</P>
<P>
   The company is heir to toExcel, which began publishing
out-of-print titles in late 1998 through its printing business
partner, Lighting Press in Lightning Print is located in La Vergne,
Tenn. A year later, the service's popularity led executives to
expand into publishing new titles, which now account for half its
business, and to launch the company as iUniverse in October 1999.
The name ``toExcel'' remains as iUniverse's line of out-of-print
books.
</P>
<P>
   Old-line publishers in the $80 billion-a-year book market tend
to wager on blockbusters from established authors, rather than take
a risk on new writers with smaller followings, industry watchers
said. Typically, traditional publishers spend $25,000 to $50,000 on
editing and printing for a 10,000- paperback run and must fork over
thousands and even millions of dollars in author advances, upfront
costs they must try to recoup through sales. Other overhead
includes warehousing books and tracking inventory.
</P>
<P>
   iUniverse, with 300 employees, targets the opening left by
traditional houses with fatter budgets. It prints a book only after
receiving a customer order, and can then ship it within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   iUniverse's print-on-demand system eliminates inventory costs,
enabling the company to make money on print runs of less than 100
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all about changing the economics of the industry,''
said Tam, who criticized publishers as inefficient and out of touch
with readers. He said the industry's high rate of unsold books
returned to publishers _ up to 30 percent _ signals the need for a
better way to predict and manage inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional publishers defended their process, and also
questioned whether crowding the competitive market with more titles
would help authors.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a consumer point of view, it's better if we can show them
the specials rather than present them with a six-page dinner
menu,'' said Leslie Pockell, an associate publisher at Time Warner
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   iUniverse's ambition is to publish 80,000 titles annually by
next year. Last year the company published about 1,300 titles, with
thousands more in the production pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Its publishing approach won the support of New York-based Barnes
&AMP; Noble, the national bookseller, which acquired a 49 percent stake
in the on-demand publisher in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as a tremendous opportunity for people with a
voice to reach an audience,'' said Ken Brooks, Barnes &AMP; Noble's
vice president of digital content.
</P>
<P>
   By February, all 528 Barnes &AMP; Noble retailers will carry
iUniverse displays with publishing information and works from 12 to
15 authors _ an important boost for writers who want to entice
browsing shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   However, iUniverse makes no guarantee of shelf space for its
budding authors. Buyers from Barnes &AMP; Noble will select from titles
recommended by iUniverse staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our buyers need to make sure they exercise control over what
goes into stores,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   The retail sales channel, coupled with distribution through the
Internet, greatly appealed to Loye. After shoppers browse the text
of iUniverse works on the Internet, they can order through retail
and cyber booksellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People all over the world can access the book on the first day
it comes out,'' Loye said. Conventional publishers may take years
before reprinting books for overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
   Loye has had other titles published by traditional academic and
trade presses. ``The Healing of a Nation'' received the
Anisfield-Wolfe Award for the best scholarly book on race relations
in 1971. His other books include ``The Leadership Passion: A
Psychology of Ideology,'' ``The Knowable Future: A Psychology of
Forecasting and Prophecy,'' and ``The Sphinx and the Rainbow:
Brain, Mind, and Future Vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Other authors viewed iUniverse as a publisher on the forefront
of technology. Cultural historian Riane Eisler, a Monterey
Peninsula writer, picked iUniverse to publish her latest book,
``The Gate,'' a fictionalized memoir about her experiences growing
up as a European refugee in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to be adventurous. This is the direction that
publishing will be going in many ways. Warehousing costs are
infinitely less, and more and more people are shopping on the
Web,'' said Eisler, 68, whose nonfiction book ``The Chalice and
Blade,'' has sold 500,000 copies worldwide.

&HT;     NEW YORKER VOTERS ARE PRISONERS OF POLITICAL BOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN LYNCH  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Like most New Yorkers, I'm thrilled that we'll
have a presidential primary election in this state on March 7. Were
I enrolled in a party, I would be enthralled at the prospect of
playing my role in selecting the next leader of the world's oldest
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   OK, George Bernard Shaw had a point when he described democracy
as the substitution of judgment by the incompetent many for that of
the corrupt few. And we've certainly seen ample evidence that
majorities are not always right. But democracy at least provides
us, the people, the opportunity to choose somebody else to blame
for everything that annoys us.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that democracy is hard to come by in this
presidential primary. Most primary states make it fairly easy for
wannabe presidents to get on the ballot. California, for example,
holds its primary on March 7, the same day New York does. The
Golden State ballot will carry about 20 names. Even Libertarian
candidate Lyndon LaRouche will be on there. The California
political bosses put everybody on the ballot except flat-out,
baying-at-the-moon, around-the-bend head cases.
</P>
<P>
   Empire State bosses are vastly less charitable. To get on the
Democratic Party's primary ballot, a candidate has to gather 5,000
signatures on nominating petitions statewide and additional
signatures in each congressional district. On the Republican side,
candidates need 40,000 signatures statewide. The GOP system is less
restrictive than four years ago when Bob Dole was virtually
anointed by New York's Republican bosses, but the principle remains
the same.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the bosses' choice, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, is on
the ballot in all 31 congressional districts. The party
organization carried his petitions for him. Steve Forbes is on in
every district because he had a spare $750,000 clinking around in
his pocket to use in hiring workers to carry petitions. And Arizona
Sen. John McCain won't be on the ballot in several districts. New
York's GOP establishment opposes him, and McCain's daddy didn't
leave him as much money as Forbes' daddy left him.
</P>
<P>
   When I pointed out in a recent column that New York's
presidential primary system is fundamentally undemocratic, my phone
rang off the hook with angry members of both parties incensed over
the situation. Republicans who wanted a chance to vote for Alan
Keyes or Gary Bauer were especially furious.
</P>
<P>
   A woman named Nancy from the Poughkeepsie area asked if she
could write in the candidate of her choice. I checked. The answer
is yes, if she's a Democrat, and it's no if she's a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   There's a write-in area on the voting machine. Close the curtain
and look for it. If you're a Democrat and you want to write in,
say, Jesse Jackson or Warren Beatty, go for it. But on the
Republican side, you don't vote directly for the candidates.
Instead, you vote for delegates pledged to those candidates. Since
neither Keyes nor Bauer could gather enough signatures to get their
delegates' names on the ballot, writing in the name of either
candidate will mean nothing. Election officials won't count your
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think, though, that the Republicans are alone in their
contempt for real democracy in this process. Under Democratic party
rules, party bigwigs are automatically delegates without anybody's
vote. Those so-called super delegates and delegates-at-large make
up roughly 20 percent of the total. And virtually all those people
are solidly in Al Gore's pocket at the moment, whether you and Bill
Bradley like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   What we are looking at on March 7 is a deck cunningly stacked by
the bosses to benefit the bosses' choices. Which means,
essentially, that we New Yorkers have failed to communicate a
crucial message to our political bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, that we insist on governing ourselves.

 AN INTERVIEW by JACKI LYDEN)

   .....................
</P>
<P>
   JACKI LYDEN: Long before the world knew of Elian Gonzalez, there
was another 6-year-old Cuban boy, who also found himself in the
middle of two battling forces. He was known as ``Fidelito'' _
actually Felix Fidel Castro Diaz _ and he was the young son of a
rebel fighter named Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in 1954 when Castro was imprisoned by the same
Cuban government he overthrew five years later _ the regime of
President Fulgencio Batista. While in jail, Castro learned that he
was about to lose his son in a divorce case and that the boy,
Fidelito, might be taken from the country.
</P>
<P>
   ANN LOUISE BARDACH: Yes, Castro had been imprisoned after his
failed attack (in 1953) upon the Moncada military garrison (in
Santiago), and his wife at that time was Mirta Diaz-Balart. Mirta
informed Fidel Castro she wanted a divorce and that she would be
leaving the country with their 6-year-old son, Fidelito Castro.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: The age is even the same (as Elian Gonzalez').
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Yes, and Castro took this news very badly. He went into
an incendiary rage: Not only was he going to be losing his wife
with his beloved, cherished only child at that point, but also
Mirta's family was connected to the Batista regime and had strong
U.S. ``Yankee'' connections.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: His worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: So Castro wrote a letter to his sister, Lydia, from
prison, and I quote: ``I refuse even to think that my son may sleep
a single night under the same roof sheltering my most repulsive
enemies and receive on his innocent cheeks the kisses of those
miserable Judases.'' Later he would write to her: ``To take this
child away from me, they would have to kill me. I lose my head when
I think about these things.''
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: And indeed, Mirta does take their son to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: It speaks volumes about Fidel Castro's character. He
was in a political situation where, at any time Batista, had he
chosen to, could arrange an accident in which Castro would
``disappear.'' Castro was in no position to be making any demands
whatsoever and yet makes an unprecedented custody demand. And
again, we're talking about 1954, when men were not commonly known
to be asking for custody of their children.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Who were the ``miserable Judases'' Castro was referring
to, his enemies?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Oh, the ``miserable Judases'' are the Diaz-Balarts,
Mirta's family. Her brother was Rafael Diaz-Balart, an official in
the Batista government and, at one time, a very close friend of
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: When Castro was finally released from prison, he was
determined to get his son back. What happens next?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Castro did lose the first round. Mirta was able to get
a divorce and custody of the boy, or at least a temporary order. In
fact, she went off to the United States with their son. After his
release, Castro and his brother (Raul), who was in prison with him,
and his rebel supporters realized it was too dangerous to stay in
Cuba. So they went to Mexico, where Castro then plotted two
strategies. One, of course, was his triumphant return to Cuba (in
1959), and the second was how he was going to get Fidelito back.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: So what was Castro's strategy to get the boy back?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Fidel Castro, by tricking his wife Mirta, essentially,
convinces her to send Fidelito to him. Castro was arguing that it
could be the last time he ever sees his son because he's about to
begin a perilous expedition _ of course, returning to Cuba to start
a revolution. And Mirta buys this and she sends back Fidelito. But
after two weeks' time, the son is not returned.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Castro keeps him.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Castro installs his son, Fidelito, with a couple (who
live in Mexico). And with that, Mirta Diaz-Balart becomes
absolutely distraught. She was from a politically powerful family,
and through the agents of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico, they arrange
to retain three men who follow young Fidelito.
</P>
<P>
   These men accost the boy as he walks through the park with Fidel
Castro's older sisters in Mexico. On their way back home to the
house where the boy was staying, a car literally cuts them off in
the middle of the street. The men jump out of the car; they seize
the boy and return him to the mother.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Yet somehow, eventually, after the revolution is
successful, Fidel Castro convinces his ex-wife to send the boy back
down to Cuba, back down to Havana.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: In fact, Mirta brings him back. Castro takes control of
the country Jan. 1, 1959. You know, Batista flees with the national
treasury and goes into exile. And, of course, Castro then promptly
arranges for his son to be returned to Cuba, and his son is flown
down from the United States with Mirta and is reunited with his
father. From that point on, Castro has the dominant control over
Fidelito.
</P>
<P>
   Later in life, Fidelito is sent to the Soviet Union _ what is
Russia today _ and was educated. He studied to be a physicist. (He
studied nuclear engineering in Moscow and in 1981 became director
of Cuba's Atomic Energy Commission). At one point he married a
Russian woman. Now his second wife is a Cuban woman. He lives in
Havana and has three children.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Do most people know the story of this custody battle 50
years ago?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: No, most people don't, unless they've been reading the
letters from Castro in prison or several of the biographies that
allude to them. But most people (don't know of the parallels
between the cases of Fidelito and Elian Gonzalez), not in Cuba and
not in Miami.

 c.2000 American Heritage  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When the Cold War began, Russians my age were in school, and
when it ended, we were already thinking about retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Our lives were spent amid the fear that America _ our great
national enemy _ would strike a fatal blow if we made the slightest
false step or showed the least weakness. For Americans, of course,
the Soviet Union was the Evil Empire. But for Russians, the United
States was the Evil Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Most of my life was spent in Russia. When, as a mature adult, I
came to the United States, I was amazed at all the parallels
between our respective fears and determination to defend our ideals
and our countries.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, each Cold War power came very close to seizing the
other by the throat in a fit of righteous indignation. In defense
of national ideals, each side verged on using force to make the
other admit it was wrong (always a hopeless approach).
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the statesmanlike and human wisdom of the leaders of
both countries _ and luck _ we succeeded in avoiding a violent
``resolution'' to the ideological quarrel. On its own, the Cold War
expired and, having survived, we can look back now and even joke
about our recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Today we know how close we came to World War III. Now many
secrets are secrets no longer: We know that at the time of Joseph
Stalin's death in 1953, everything seemed to be heading toward a
real war, a nuclear war. The Soviet dictator had ordered an
accelerated buildup of the armed forces not only of the Soviet
Union but also the Warsaw Pact allies, in order to be fully ready
for an armed clash by 1954 or 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated by fear, Stalin ordered that 10,000 tactical IL-28
Soviet bombers, with a range of about 1,500 miles, be produced and
stationed at airfields built on the Arctic Ocean icecaps, closer
than the Soviet empire was to U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Soviet military personnel had reached 5,394,038,
an insupportable burden for a peacetime economy. And yet Stalin
could have done little in case of conflict because the U.S.
strategic Air Force, whose bases surrounded the Soviet Union, could
have destroyed whatever it chose.
</P>
<P>
   Stalin did not possess a weapon capable of responding with a
comparable retaliatory strike on American territory. He knew this
and was deathly afraid of war, but at the same time he considered
it inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1952 I finished school and began studying at the
Electric Power Institute in Moscow. I wanted to become an engineer
in the field of automated control. At the time, we students were
inclined to be militant, even aggressive: ``Just let them (whomever
you like) poke their noses in here and we'll show them a thing or
two.''
</P>
<P>
   At our desks in school we, like our leaders in the Kremlin, felt
sure that war was not far off.
</P>
<P>
   When America elected Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, a hero of World
War II, as president in November 1952, we had no doubt of what it
meant: ``The USA has decided to fight. Otherwise why do they need a
general as president?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that, after living through the horrors of the German
bombings in World War II, we were frightened by the atomic bomb. We
flaunted our courage.
</P>
<P>
   During civil defense classes we were told to cover ourselves
with something white, preferably a sheet, in the event of a nuclear
blast. Supposedly this would reduce the impact of radiation. And
so, a joke immediately went the rounds:
</P>
<P>
   ``If an atomic bomb explodes, cover yourself with a sheet and
crawl to the cemetery _ but without hurrying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why without hurrying?''
</P>
<P>
   ``So as not to cause a panic.''
</P>
<P>
   However, on March 5, 1953, Providence intervened: Stalin died.
And my father, Nikita Khrushchev, who soon became the head of the
new Soviet leadership, knew from personal experience what war was
like. He had traveled the country's roads for four years during
World War II, retreating from our western borders to Stalingrad and
advancing from Stalingrad to Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   From his first months in power he tried to discern whether the
Americans were irrevocably bent on war or whether it was possible
to reach agreement with them. Interestingly, the White House was
thinking more or less along the same lines.
</P>
<P>
   The first time my father and President Eisenhower met (aside
from a fleeting encounter in June 1945 atop the Lenin Mausoleum,
during a Victory Day Parade in Moscow) was in Geneva in 1955, at
the Four-Power Summit Conference.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing for the trip to Geneva, Father had tried to
anticipate every minor detail; he wanted to prevent any sign of
U.S. disrespect or discrimination against our country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, right away, our national pride was wounded, but not
because of any malicious scheme by the West. The Soviet delegation
arrived in Switzerland on a small two-engine IL-14, while President
Eisenhower landed in a giant four-engine Constellation. That did
not escape Father's attention.
</P>
<P>
   The next year he took his revenge during a visit to England. A
TU-104 passenger jet, which had not yet completed all its test
flights, brought his mail from Moscow to London every day. Even the
Americans did not yet have such a plane. The British queen, hearing
an unusual roar coming from the sky (as she told Father later when
they met), went out on the balcony of her palace to gape at the
marvel.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the process of getting acquainted was not without its
bizarre moments. During one of the breaks between sessions,
Eisenhower introduced Father to his assistant _ then it was Nelson
Rockefeller. Father inquired, ``Is he THAT Rockefeller?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was.
</P>
<P>
   A multimillionaire, but looking no different from anyone else,
as Father later would tell me, not in top hat and tails but
modestly dressed and, moreover, serving in a subordinate position.
</P>
<P>
   Right away, Father was dying to touch a real multimillionaire,
but he didn't know how such a gesture would be interpreted. He
didn't hesitate for long, though, but spread his arms and embraced
Rockefeller somewhere around the waist _ ``Rocky'' was a head and a
half taller than Father.
</P>
<P>
   At first Rockefeller was taken aback, but after a moment he
responded in kind, bearhugging my father.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for us now, in America or in Russia, to imagine that
era and how distant we were and how little we understood each
other. Such personal episodes were more valuable then than any
round of official negotiations, which were as yet essentially
unproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Father would conclude that he could do business with
Eisenhower, who of course had also experienced the recent war
firsthand and was not about to seek a new one. But a long and
difficult path lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   At the Four Power Summit, Eisenhower presented his Open Skies
plan, which would have allowed each side to fly over the other's
territory in order to prevent a surprise attack. Father rejected it
outright.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Eisenhower feared a Soviet attack. But Father was afraid
of something quite different. In the process of flying over our
country, America might discover how much weaker we were than they.
This was our most important secret _ the truth of our inadequate
power. Its discovery might prompt the United States to believe it
could carry out a preventive strike against us.

   When the Cold War began, Russians my age were in school, and
when it ended, we were already thinking about retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Our lives were spent amid the fear that America _ our great
national enemy _ would strike a fatal blow if we made the slightest
false step or showed the least weakness. For Americans, of course,
the Soviet Union was the Evil Empire. But for Russians, the United
States was the Evil Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Most of my life was spent in Russia. When, as a mature adult, I
came to the United States, I was amazed at all the parallels
between our respective fears and determination to defend our ideals
and our countries.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, each Cold War power came very close to seizing the
other by the throat in a fit of righteous indignation. In defense
of national ideals, each side verged on using force to make the
other admit it was wrong (always a hopeless approach).
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the statesmanlike and human wisdom of the leaders of
both countries _ and luck _ we succeeded in avoiding a violent
``resolution'' to the ideological quarrel. On its own, the Cold War
expired and, having survived, we can look back now and even joke
about our recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Today we know how close we came to World War III. Now many
secrets are secrets no longer: We know that at the time of Joseph
Stalin's death in 1953, everything seemed to be heading toward a
real war, a nuclear war. The Soviet dictator had ordered an
accelerated buildup of the armed forces not only of the Soviet
Union but also the Warsaw Pact allies, in order to be fully ready
for an armed clash by 1954 or 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated by fear, Stalin ordered that 10,000 tactical IL-28
Soviet bombers, with a range of about 1,500 miles, be produced and
stationed at airfields built on the Arctic Ocean icecaps, closer
than the Soviet empire was to U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Soviet military personnel had reached 5,394,038,
an insupportable burden for a peacetime economy. And yet Stalin
could have done little in case of conflict because the U.S.
strategic Air Force, whose bases surrounded the Soviet Union, could
have destroyed whatever it chose.
</P>
<P>
   Stalin did not possess a weapon capable of responding with a
comparable retaliatory strike on American territory. He knew this
and was deathly afraid of war, but at the same time he considered
it inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1952 I finished school and began studying at the
Electric Power Institute in Moscow. I wanted to become an engineer
in the field of automated control. At the time, we students were
inclined to be militant, even aggressive: ``Just let them (whomever
you like) poke their noses in here and we'll show them a thing or
two.''
</P>
<P>
   At our desks in school we, like our leaders in the Kremlin, felt
sure that war was not far off.
</P>
<P>
   When America elected Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, a hero of World
War II, as president in November 1952, we had no doubt of what it
meant: ``The USA has decided to fight. Otherwise why do they need a
general as president?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that, after living through the horrors of the German
bombings in World War II, we were frightened by the atomic bomb. We
flaunted our courage.
</P>
<P>
   During civil defense classes we were told to cover ourselves
with something white, preferably a sheet, in the event of a nuclear
blast. Supposedly this would reduce the impact of radiation. And
so, a joke immediately went the rounds:
</P>
<P>
   ``If an atomic bomb explodes, cover yourself with a sheet and
crawl to the cemetery _ but without hurrying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why without hurrying?''
</P>
<P>
   ``So as not to cause a panic.''
</P>
<P>
   However, on March 5, 1953, Providence intervened: Stalin died.
And my father, Nikita Khrushchev, who soon became the head of the
new Soviet leadership, knew from personal experience what war was
like. He had traveled the country's roads for four years during
World War II, retreating from our western borders to Stalingrad and
advancing from Stalingrad to Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   From his first months in power he tried to discern whether the
Americans were irrevocably bent on war or whether it was possible
to reach agreement with them. Interestingly, the White House was
thinking more or less along the same lines.
</P>
<P>
   The first time my father and President Eisenhower met (aside
from a fleeting encounter in June 1945 atop the Lenin Mausoleum,
during a Victory Day Parade in Moscow) was in Geneva in 1955, at
the Four-Power Summit Conference.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing for the trip to Geneva, Father had tried to
anticipate every minor detail; he wanted to prevent any sign of
U.S. disrespect or discrimination against our country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, right away, our national pride was wounded, but not
because of any malicious scheme by the West. The Soviet delegation
arrived in Switzerland on a small two-engine IL-14, while President
Eisenhower landed in a giant four-engine Constellation. That did
not escape Father's attention.
</P>
<P>
   The next year he took his revenge during a visit to England. A
TU-104 passenger jet, which had not yet completed all its test
flights, brought his mail from Moscow to London every day. Even the
Americans did not yet have such a plane. The British queen, hearing
an unusual roar coming from the sky (as she told Father later when
they met), went out on the balcony of her palace to gape at the
marvel.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the process of getting acquainted was not without its
bizarre moments. During one of the breaks between sessions,
Eisenhower introduced Father to his assistant _ then it was Nelson
Rockefeller. Father inquired, ``Is he THAT Rockefeller?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was.
</P>
<P>
   A multimillionaire, but looking no different from anyone else,
as Father later would tell me, not in top hat and tails but
modestly dressed and, moreover, serving in a subordinate position.
</P>
<P>
   Right away, Father was dying to touch a real multimillionaire,
but he didn't know how such a gesture would be interpreted. He
didn't hesitate for long, though, but spread his arms and embraced
Rockefeller somewhere around the waist _ ``Rocky'' was a head and a
half taller than Father.
</P>
<P>
   At first Rockefeller was taken aback, but after a moment he
responded in kind, bearhugging my father.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for us now, in America or in Russia, to imagine that
era and how distant we were and how little we understood each
other. Such personal episodes were more valuable then than any
round of official negotiations, which were as yet essentially
unproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Father would conclude that he could do business with
Eisenhower, who of course had also experienced the recent war
firsthand and was not about to seek a new one. But a long and
difficult path lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   At the Four Power Summit, Eisenhower presented his Open Skies
plan, which would have allowed each side to fly over the other's
territory in order to prevent a surprise attack. Father rejected it
outright.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Eisenhower feared a Soviet attack. But Father was afraid
of something quite different. In the process of flying over our
country, America might discover how much weaker we were than they.
This was our most important secret _ the truth of our inadequate
power. Its discovery might prompt the United States to believe it
could carry out a preventive strike against us.

<P>
   My father, Nikita Khrushchev, did not doubt the superiority and
greater economic efficiency of socialism over capitalism, and was
sure that sooner or later capitalism would die out and that he
would bury it.
</P>
<P>
   Father wanted to have a look, however fleeting, at what Soviet
life would be like under true communism _ in other words, when
Russians lived no worse than Americans, those very Americans who
dreamed of destroying communism.
</P>
<P>
   But, as he said in one of his speeches in the United States,
``You Americans work better than we do and produce goods that we
can only dream about, so we will learn from you; we will study
diligently. And once we've learned, we'll begin working better than
you. And you will just have to jump onto the running board of the
train of socialism, which is leaving for the future. Otherwise,
you'll be left far behind and we will wave good-bye from the rear
platform of the last car.''
</P>
<P>
   Father believed that the governmental system that gave people
the best living standards would win. That was the sole criterion.
Nothing would help the losing side _ not nuclear bombs, ideological
dogmas or propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   To the end of his life, he was convinced that Soviet socialism
would come out on top, and he died secure in that belief. His goal
was never to win by competition in the field of weaponry. He was
not captivated by the missile race or even by the space race.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his slogan became the ``food race.'' Fences, walls of
buildings and outdoor billboards were plastered with signs,
reading: ``Catch up and pass the United States in per capita
production of meat, milk and butter.'' In fact, we were in no
condition to compete in this sphere. Our people were emerging
painfully from a condition of semistarvation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, only a madman or traitor could neglect the nation's
security during the Cold War. Because we sorely lacked resources,
our most important decision would be how to strengthen the
country's security at the same time as reducing military spending.
</P>
<P>
   Father believed that future local wars could not be waged
without nuclear weapons. This, he thought, made it senseless to
maintain a gigantic army. Nor would it make sense to continue
pouring money into conventional weapons, so he proposed reducing
the Soviet production of tanks, cannons and tactical aircraft. Of
course the military opposed this with all its might.
</P>
<P>
   The military professionals were demanding that the Soviet army,
air force and navy be given equipment precisely symmetrical to all
that of the mighty U.S. military. However, this would have consumed
all our nation's financial resources, leaving nothing in the budget
for housing or to provide people with normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   Father chose a different path. He tried to make the admirals and
generals understand that the United States was much wealthier than
we were. If we competed with the Americans on that basis, he
reasoned, we would spend all our resources in vain and bring the
country to ruin, and even then not reach parity.
</P>
<P>
   In one meeting, when the military stood its ground Father
angrily exclaimed, ``You'll leave the country stark naked!''
</P>
<P>
   Father finally decided to make use of his power and authority.
He made the tough decision to formulate an asymmetrical defense
doctrine. He thought that we ourselves could determine the
necessary minimum to ensure the country's security _ and whatever
we didn't need we would ruthlessly eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   He started with the navy. Stalin had planned to build an
oceangoing surface fleet able to compete with America's. Our
admirals needed about 130 billion rubles (roughly $32.5 billion) in
the 1955-'65 period to carry out the second stage of Stalin's
program _ an enormous sum. The only way to get it was to cut funds
for essential human needs.
</P>
<P>
   Discussion of the program continued for about a year with no
progress. Once, Father posed a direct question to the navy's
commander in chief, Adm. Nikolai Kuznetsov: ``If today, and not 10
years from now, you had all the ships you're asking for, could you
defeat the Americans at sea?''
</P>
<P>
   The admiral gave a militarily direct answer: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussion ended with the decision to stop building a
surface fleet and limit construction to submarines, primarily
missile submarines, and antisubmarine and shore-defense forces.
</P>
<P>
   To this day the Russian naval officers have never forgiven
Father, but he simply would not give them money to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat later, strategic aviation met a similar fate. Its
development was held to a minimum, while preference was given to
ballistic missiles. From then on, our air force officers also
disliked Father.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, by 1956, only one type of Soviet ballistic missile was
being built, the R-5M, with a nuclear warhead of 70 kilotons. The
USSR had a total of 426 nuclear warheads. In comparison, the United
States had an overall nuclear superiority 10.8 times greater.
</P>
<P>
   And so, believing it was necessary to restrain the West from a
possible attack on the Soviet Union, Father decided to resort to
bluff and intimidation. For example, in April 1956, during his
visit to England he casually inquired _ during an official lunch
and again over tea at the fireplace of the prime minister's country
residence at Chequers _ if his hosts knew how many nuclear warheads
it would take to wipe their island off the face of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   An awkward silence followed.
</P>
<P>
   But with a broad smile on his face, Father informed those
present that if they didn't know, he could help them _ and he
mentioned a specific number. Then he added, quite cheerfully, ``And
we have lots of those nuclear warheads, as well as the missiles to
deliver them.''
</P>
<P>
   From then on Father reacted just as sharply to every crisis in
the vicinity of the Soviet Union, whether in the Near East, the Far
East or Europe. By frightening the world with the idea of Soviet
missile superiority, he hoped our side would be taken as equal to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was in those years that he used the famous phrase, ``We are
producing missiles like sausages.''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked him how he could say that _ we knew, after all,
that the Soviet Union had no more than half a dozen
intercontinental missiles _ Father only laughed: ``We're not
planning to start a war, so it doesn't matter how many missiles are
deployed. The main thing is that Americans think we have enough for
a powerful strike in response. So they'll be wary of attacking
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The history of the ``global nuclear ballistic missile contest''
was similar. The project required launching a nuclear warhead into
an earth orbit. Then, at the command from earth, it would explode
over an enemy on a trajectory that couldn't be predicted by any
sort of antimissile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The organization where I worked, which was located in a
carefully guarded area, had several even-more-secret rooms where we
worked on our new superweapon.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, just a few months after we started, Father joyfully
informed journalists at a press conference that the Soviet Union
would soon possess a global missile, a weapon against which no
defense existed. I was profoundly upset and thought of his
loquaciousness as a betrayal of our national interests.
</P>
<P>
   That evening during a walk I voiced my complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell me you thought the government would actually allow
someone to launch a nuclear warhead into orbit,'' he retorted with
amazement. ``What if something happened to it in orbit, in space?
We would be hostages to our own thoughtlessness. The global missile
is a propaganda weapon. Let the Americans rack their brains over
what I said.''
</P>
<P>
   Now here is the truth: Such statements by Father were in fact
received with enthusiasm in the West because they made it easier
for the U.S. military to receive additional funds. The missile race
was born and gained strength, as John F. Kennedy entered the White
House. Yet all along this race, which never existed _ or rather, in
which America alone took part _ was an internal U.S. competition to
see which branch of the military could grab more funds from the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Insofar as there was a real race, the United States always led.
For example, large numbers of the UR-100 (SS-11) light ballistic
missiles were deployed in the Soviet Union, beginning in 1967, five
years later than the analogous U.S. Minuteman I. The CIA surely
knew this, but the myth of Soviet superiority was useful, or seemed
useful, not so much to the Soviets and my father as to the American
military-industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower understood this very well. He and Father met at Camp
David in September of 1959. One day, as they were walking and
chatting, Eisenhower brought up the subject of relations with the
military, asking Father how he coped with his generals. Father
reacted cautiously. He was not prepared to discuss such a sensitive
subject with an American president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'll start,'' said Eisenhower, smiling. ``My military
leaders come to me several times a year to ask for additional
appropriations for new types of weapons. When I reply that the
budget has been approved and printed and there's no place to find
the money, they begin frightening me by saying that the Soviet
Union is already developing such 'toys,' and I'll be responsible if
the United States is defeated in a future war. Naturally then, I
have to give them the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Father replied that he too was often subjected to such pressure
from his own military-industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should make a secret agreement between us to curb our
military,'' Eisenhower proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be good,'' Father responded. ``But the time has not
yet come.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the moment for confidential relations between Soviet and
American leaders truly had not yet come but by 1959, a great deal
had changed. Eisenhower and Father had learned to talk to each
other, and the first signs of mutual confidence had appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Thus a foundation was built for the future negotiations between
Father and President John F. Kennedy, between Leonid Brezhnev and a
series of U.S. presidents, as well as between Mikhail Gorbachev and
Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   By the time President Kennedy was in office, both sides valued
the need for direct contact. In other words, they had started to
trust each other and believe in the value of a dialogue devoted to
preventing a nuclear war.

   Still, only a madman or traitor could neglect the nation's
security during the Cold War. Because we sorely lacked resources,
our most important decision would be how to strengthen the
country's security at the same time as reducing military spending.
</P>
<P>
   Father believed that future local wars could not be waged
without nuclear weapons. This, he thought, made it senseless to
maintain a gigantic army. Nor would it make sense to continue
pouring money into conventional weapons, so he proposed reducing
the Soviet production of tanks, cannons and tactical aircraft. Of
course the military opposed this with all its might.
</P>
<P>
   The military professionals were demanding that the Soviet army,
air force and navy be given equipment precisely symmetrical to all
that of the mighty U.S. military. However, this would have consumed
all our nation's financial resources, leaving nothing in the budget
for housing or to provide people with normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   Father chose a different path. He tried to make the admirals and
generals understand that the United States was much wealthier than
we were. If we competed with the Americans on that basis, he
reasoned, we would spend all our resources in vain and bring the
country to ruin, and even then not reach parity.
</P>
<P>
   In one meeting, when the military stood its ground Father
angrily exclaimed, ``You'll leave the country stark naked!''
</P>
<P>
   Father finally decided to make use of his power and authority.
He made the tough decision to formulate an asymmetrical defense
doctrine. He thought that we ourselves could determine the
necessary minimum to ensure the country's security _ and whatever
we didn't need we would ruthlessly eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   He started with the navy. Stalin had planned to build an
oceangoing surface fleet able to compete with America's. Our
admirals needed about 130 billion rubles (roughly $32.5 billion) in
the 1955-'65 period to carry out the second stage of Stalin's
program _ an enormous sum. The only way to get it was to cut funds
for essential human needs.
</P>
<P>
   Discussion of the program continued for about a year with no
progress. Once, Father posed a direct question to the navy's
commander in chief, Adm. Nikolai Kuznetsov: ``If today, and not 10
years from now, you had all the ships you're asking for, could you
defeat the Americans at sea?''
</P>
<P>
   The admiral gave a militarily direct answer: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussion ended with the decision to stop building a
surface fleet and limit construction to submarines, primarily
missile submarines, and antisubmarine and shore-defense forces.
</P>
<P>
   To this day the Russian naval officers have never forgiven
Father, but he simply would not give them money to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat later, strategic aviation met a similar fate. Its
development was held to a minimum, while preference was given to
ballistic missiles. From then on, our air force officers also
disliked Father.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, by 1956, only one type of Soviet ballistic missile was
being built, the R-5M, with a nuclear warhead of 70 kilotons. The
USSR had a total of 426 nuclear warheads. In comparison, the United
States had an overall nuclear superiority 10.8 times greater.
</P>
<P>
   And so, believing it was necessary to restrain the West from a
possible attack on the Soviet Union, Father decided to resort to
bluff and intimidation. For example, in April 1956, during his
visit to England he casually inquired _ during an official lunch
and again over tea at the fireplace of the prime minister's country
residence at Chequers _ if his hosts knew how many nuclear warheads
it would take to wipe their island off the face of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   An awkward silence followed.
</P>
<P>
   But with a broad smile on his face, Father informed those
present that if they didn't know, he could help them _ and he
mentioned a specific number. Then he added, quite cheerfully, ``And
we have lots of those nuclear warheads, as well as the missiles to
deliver them.''
</P>
<P>
   From then on Father reacted just as sharply to every crisis in
the vicinity of the Soviet Union, whether in the Near East, the Far
East or Europe. By frightening the world with the idea of Soviet
missile superiority, he hoped our side would be taken as equal to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was in those years that he used the famous phrase, ``We are
producing missiles like sausages.''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked him how he could say that _ we knew, after all,
that the Soviet Union had no more than half a dozen
intercontinental missiles _ Father only laughed: ``We're not
planning to start a war, so it doesn't matter how many missiles are
deployed. The main thing is that Americans think we have enough for
a powerful strike in response. So they'll be wary of attacking
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The history of the ``global nuclear ballistic missile contest''
was similar. The project required launching a nuclear warhead into
an earth orbit. Then, at the command from earth, it would explode
over an enemy on a trajectory that couldn't be predicted by any
sort of antimissile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The organization where I worked, which was located in a
carefully guarded area, had several even-more-secret rooms where we
worked on our new superweapon.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, just a few months after we started, Father joyfully
informed journalists at a press conference that the Soviet Union
would soon possess a global missile, a weapon against which no
defense existed. I was profoundly upset and thought of his
loquaciousness as a betrayal of our national interests.
</P>
<P>
   That evening during a walk I voiced my complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell me you thought the government would actually allow
someone to launch a nuclear warhead into orbit,'' he retorted with
amazement. ``What if something happened to it in orbit, in space?
We would be hostages to our own thoughtlessness. The global missile
is a propaganda weapon. Let the Americans rack their brains over
what I said.''
</P>
<P>
   Now here is the truth: Such statements by Father were in fact
received with enthusiasm in the West because they made it easier
for the U.S. military to receive additional funds. The missile race
was born and gained strength, as John F. Kennedy entered the White
House. Yet all along this race, which never existed _ or rather, in
which America alone took part _ was an internal U.S. competition to
see which branch of the military could grab more funds from the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Insofar as there was a real race, the United States always led.
For example, large numbers of the UR-100 (SS-11) light ballistic
missiles were deployed in the Soviet Union, beginning in 1967, five
years later than the analogous U.S. Minuteman I. The CIA surely
knew this, but the myth of Soviet superiority was useful, or seemed
useful, not so much to the Soviets and my father as to the American
military-industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower understood this very well. He and Father met at Camp
David in September of 1959. One day, as they were walking and
chatting, Eisenhower brought up the subject of relations with the
military, asking Father how he coped with his generals. Father
reacted cautiously. He was not prepared to discuss such a sensitive
subject with an American president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'll start,'' said Eisenhower, smiling. ``My military
leaders come to me several times a year to ask for additional
appropriations for new types of weapons. When I reply that the
budget has been approved and printed and there's no place to find
the money, they begin frightening me by saying that the Soviet
Union is already developing such 'toys,' and I'll be responsible if
the United States is defeated in a future war. Naturally then, I
have to give them the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Father replied that he too was often subjected to such pressure
from his own military-industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should make a secret agreement between us to curb our
military,'' Eisenhower proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be good,'' Father responded. ``But the time has not
yet come.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the moment for confidential relations between Soviet and
American leaders truly had not yet come but by 1959, a great deal
had changed. Eisenhower and Father had learned to talk to each
other, and the first signs of mutual confidence had appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Thus a foundation was built for the future negotiations between
Father and President John F. Kennedy, between Leonid Brezhnev and a
series of U.S. presidents, as well as between Mikhail Gorbachev and
Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   By the time President Kennedy was in office, both sides valued
the need for direct contact. In other words, they had started to
trust each other and believe in the value of a dialogue devoted to
preventing a nuclear war.

 c.2000 American Heritage  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   My father, Nikita Khrushchev, always favored direct dialogue,
without intermediaries, and in Vienna, in June 1961 he and
President John F. Kennedy _ at what would turn out to be their only
face-to-face meeting _ agreed to establish a direct White
House-to-Kremlin link by means of special couriers. Kennedy
proposed exchanging confidential letters outside of official State
Department channels; my father readily agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pact that would serve the parties well during the Cuban
missile crisis, which broke out soon afterward, in October 1962.
For the first time in Cold War history, a secret personal
correspondence between two leaders, rather than mutual threats and
propaganda escapades, was the main instrument for resolving a dire
international crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Both the U.S. president and the Soviet leader understood that
although they may have been determined to defend their own national
principles and values, which were incompatible, it was only through
dialogue that they could achieve their common goal of preserving
life on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when Castro and his companions-in-arms entered
Havana, on Jan. 1, 1959, no one in Moscow took the slightest
interest. The Soviet embassy in Cuba was considered unnecessary and
had closed in 1952. Diplomatic relations continued, but neither an
embassy nor a single Soviet representative remained in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After reading Western news agency reports about Castro's
triumph, however, Father became curious.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to gather more information, he received the following
reply from the intelligence service and the Party Central
Committee's International Department: ``Castro is the usual Central
American dictator, probably closely connected to the CIA, and will
dance to the American tune, just like Batista.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Castro went to Washington expecting to meet with
President Eisenhower, a high-level international specialist from
the Party Central Committee told Father in my presence: ``You see,
Nikita Sergeyevich, we were right. Castro is hurrying to bow to his
master.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Castro intended to conduct a totally independent
policy was evident only later, and Father was the first to
recognize it.
</P>
<P>
   He decided that the only way to defend Cuba from the United
States' inevitable aggression was by deploying missiles with
nuclear warheads on the island. In so doing, he was warning
Washington that military action in that region would automatically
lead to World War III.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963 President Kennedy behaved like Father by declaring that
he was a West Berliner and would defend the city from possible
future Soviet seizure with all the power America possessed. In
economic and other terms, West Berlin was even more useless to
Kennedy than Cuba was to Father.
</P>
<P>
   But the status of a superpower leaves its special mark on the
conduct of world leaders. They have to defend their allies with all
the means available to them. If they retreat an inch, it is
tantamount to bidding farewell to superpower status forever. No one
will believe them any more; such are the implacable rules of the
game in power politics.
</P>
<P>
   It has become customary to argue that Father gave in because of
America's firm stance, that Nikita Khrushchev yielded and blinked
first. In fact, both leaders realized that they would remain in
control of the situation only until the first shot was fired, until
the first bomb was dropped on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After that, other rules would take over, the rules of war, of a
third world war. And Father loved to say, ``Any fool can start a
war, but then where are we going to find the wise men to stop it?''
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Kennedy tried to prevent that first shot by every
possible means.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kennedy was under tremendous pressure. Father knew
this, and he took it into account when he decided to withdraw the
missiles from Cuba in exchange for Kennedy's promise not to invade
the island _ a promise he trusted.
</P>
<P>
   This would have been inconceivable in 1952: Trust an American
president! When Father argued at a meeting of the Soviet leadership
in favor of withdrawing the missiles, he made this unprecedented
statement: ``We have to help Kennedy withstand pressure from the
hawks. They are demanding an immediate military invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   A little later, after the withdrawal of the Soviet missiles from
Cuba had begun, Kennedy too asked journalists to help Khrushchev by
not crowing about the American victory. Could anyone have imagined
hearing such words in the White House five years earlier?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to view the Cuban missile crisis superficially as
Kennedy's victory; he forced the Soviet Union to withdraw. And
Father also thought he had won by protecting Cuba from possible
aggression and by averting a great war. In the political game of
brinkmanship, Father stuck to his opinion: He who decides to blink
first doesn't have weaker nerves, but possesses greater wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The real main consequence of the Cuban missile crisis was the
American society's irrevocable perception of parity, of equality
between the USSR and the United States in shared nuclear
destructive force.
</P>
<P>
   The American media, not Father, were responsible for that. They
so frightened their countrymen into believing that the Soviets
could blast them to eternity that soon it made no sense at all to
talk about nuclear superiority in terms of plain numbers. The
nation's subconscious simply would not absorb them.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Cuban drama ended the cycle of crises and
missile-bluff diplomacy. Both sides recognized that they could now
inflict a mortal blow capable not only of mutual annihilation but
also of destroying an entire civilization, of ending life on earth.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1963 John F. Kennedy was assassinated; a year later,
in October 1964, my father was removed from power. The leaders who
replaced Father hurried to ``correct his mistakes'' by giving a new
impetus to the arms race and producing tens of thousands of
tactical nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   By 1989 the Soviet army had 7,000 nuclear cannons. The Cold War
was prolonged by 20 years, on through the start of the 1990s when
the Soviet Union dissolved. Was the failure to end the Cold War in
the 1960s a wasted opportunity? Was the world ready for it to end
then? We can only guess, and regret that it did not happen. Could
the Cold War have been avoided? Was it a product of the ill will of
politicians or was it historically inevitable?
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of years peoples have resolved their conflicts by
armed clashes. With the invention of nuclear weapons, however,
diplomats and politicians suddenly realized that war would no
longer lead to victory, that both sides would lose. Yet they didn't
know how to behave differently so they behaved the same way,
belligerently and aggressively, but without going to war.
</P>
<P>
   War without war was called ``cold war.'' A very accurate
definition. And at the start of this process, at the dawn of the
Cold War, when a great deal was still unsettled and all the
destructive consequences of the use of nuclear weapons were not yet
apparent, it would have been very easy to yield to temptation and
drift into a real war.
</P>
<P>
   I consider it a great achievement, a heroic deed of the world
leaders of those years _ primarily Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F.
Kennedy and my father, Nikita Khrushchev _ that they showed the
wisdom to pass safely over the reefs of a hot war and preserve the
life of humankind.

proposed exchanging confidential letters outside of official State
Department channels; my father readily agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pact that would serve the parties well during the Cuban
missile crisis, which broke out soon afterward, in October 1962.
For the first time in Cold War history, a secret personal
correspondence between two leaders, rather than mutual threats and
propaganda escapades, was the main instrument for resolving a dire
international crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Both the U.S. president and the Soviet leader understood that
although they may have been determined to defend their own national
principles and values, which were incompatible, it was only through
dialogue that they could achieve their common goal of preserving
life on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when Castro and his companions-in-arms entered
Havana, on Jan. 1, 1959, no one in Moscow took the slightest
interest. The Soviet embassy in Cuba was considered unnecessary and
had closed in 1952. Diplomatic relations continued, but neither an
embassy nor a single Soviet representative remained in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After reading Western news agency reports about Castro's
triumph, however, Father became curious.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to gather more information, he received the following
reply from the intelligence service and the Party Central
Committee's International Department: ``Castro is the usual Central
American dictator, probably closely connected to the CIA, and will
dance to the American tune, just like Batista.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Castro went to Washington expecting to meet with
President Eisenhower, a high-level international specialist from
the Party Central Committee told Father in my presence: ``You see,
Nikita Sergeyevich, we were right. Castro is hurrying to bow to his
master.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Castro intended to conduct a totally independent
policy was evident only later, and Father was the first to
recognize it.
</P>
<P>
   He decided that the only way to defend Cuba from the United
States' inevitable aggression was by deploying missiles with
nuclear warheads on the island. In so doing, he was warning
Washington that military action in that region would automatically
lead to World War III.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963 President Kennedy behaved like Father by declaring that
he was a West Berliner and would defend the city from possible
future Soviet seizure with all the power America possessed. In
economic and other terms, West Berlin was even more useless to
Kennedy than Cuba was to Father.
</P>
<P>
   But the status of a superpower leaves its special mark on the
conduct of world leaders. They have to defend their allies with all
the means available to them. If they retreat an inch, it is
tantamount to bidding farewell to superpower status forever. No one
will believe them any more; such are the implacable rules of the
game in power politics.
</P>
<P>
   It has become customary to argue that Father gave in because of
America's firm stance, that Nikita Khrushchev yielded and blinked
first. In fact, both leaders realized that they would remain in
control of the situation only until the first shot was fired, until
the first bomb was dropped on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After that, other rules would take over, the rules of war, of a
third world war. And Father loved to say, ``Any fool can start a
war, but then where are we going to find the wise men to stop it?''
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Kennedy tried to prevent that first shot by every
possible means.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kennedy was under tremendous pressure. Father knew
this, and he took it into account when he decided to withdraw the
missiles from Cuba in exchange for Kennedy's promise not to invade
the island _ a promise he trusted.
</P>
<P>
   This would have been inconceivable in 1952: Trust an American
president! When Father argued at a meeting of the Soviet leadership
in favor of withdrawing the missiles, he made this unprecedented
statement: ``We have to help Kennedy withstand pressure from the
hawks. They are demanding an immediate military invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   A little later, after the withdrawal of the Soviet missiles from
Cuba had begun, Kennedy too asked journalists to help Khrushchev by
not crowing about the American victory. Could anyone have imagined
hearing such words in the White House five years earlier?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to view the Cuban missile crisis superficially as
Kennedy's victory; he forced the Soviet Union to withdraw. And
Father also thought he had won by protecting Cuba from possible
aggression and by averting a great war. In the political game of
brinkmanship, Father stuck to his opinion: He who decides to blink
first doesn't have weaker nerves, but possesses greater wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The real main consequence of the Cuban missile crisis was the
American society's irrevocable perception of parity, of equality
between the USSR and the United States in shared nuclear
destructive force.
</P>
<P>
   The American media, not Father, were responsible for that. They
so frightened their countrymen into believing that the Soviets
could blast them to eternity that soon it made no sense at all to
talk about nuclear superiority in terms of plain numbers. The
nation's subconscious simply would not absorb them.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Cuban drama ended the cycle of crises and
missile-bluff diplomacy. Both sides recognized that they could now
inflict a mortal blow capable not only of mutual annihilation but
also of destroying an entire civilization, of ending life on earth.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1963 John F. Kennedy was assassinated; a year later,
in October 1964, my father was removed from power. The leaders who
replaced Father hurried to ``correct his mistakes'' by giving a new
impetus to the arms race and producing tens of thousands of
tactical nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   By 1989 the Soviet army had 7,000 nuclear cannons. The Cold War
was prolonged by 20 years, on through the start of the 1990s when
the Soviet Union dissolved. Was the failure to end the Cold War in
the 1960s a wasted opportunity? Was the world ready for it to end
then? We can only guess, and regret that it did not happen. Could
the Cold War have been avoided? Was it a product of the ill will of
politicians or was it historically inevitable?
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of years peoples have resolved their conflicts by
armed clashes. With the invention of nuclear weapons, however,
diplomats and politicians suddenly realized that war would no
longer lead to victory, that both sides would lose. Yet they didn't
know how to behave differently so they behaved the same way,
belligerently and aggressively, but without going to war.
</P>
<P>
   War without war was called ``cold war.'' A very accurate
definition. And at the start of this process, at the dawn of the
Cold War, when a great deal was still unsettled and all the
destructive consequences of the use of nuclear weapons were not yet
apparent, it would have been very easy to yield to temptation and
drift into a real war.
</P>
<P>
   I consider it a great achievement, a heroic deed of the world
leaders of those years _ primarily Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F.
Kennedy and my father, Nikita Khrushchev _ that they showed the
wisdom to pass safely over the reefs of a hot war and preserve the
life of humankind.

CITIZEN CAINE _ MICHAEL, THAT IS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's tough to maintain a rebel stance when your life has gone as
well as Michael Caine's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the archetypal British angry young man,'' the
66-year-old actor says in what has long been the most sophisticated
Cockney accent on the planet. ``I was always angry at the system
... until we beat the system and there was nothing to be angry
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially for Caine, whose journey up from the lower rungs of
England's working class has made him something of an icon for a new
generation of barrier-busting Brits. Long one of the most respected
and hardest-working movie stars on both sides of the Atlantic,
Caine proudly exemplified both his caste (``Alfie,'' ``Get
Carter,'' ``The Man Who Would Be King,'' ``Little Voice'') and a
more general, high standard of English intelligence (``The Ipcress
File,'' ``Sleuth,'' ``Dressed to Kill,'' ``Educating Rita,'' his
Oscar-winning supporting part in ``Hannah and her Sisters'')
throughout a career that has included some 80 feature films.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that 28 years of a happy marriage that's produced two
daughters he adores. And success in other fields (a string of
restaurants, his best-selling autobiography). Not much to complain
about, especially now that the character-based movies he prefers
are back in style.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something about ``The Cider House Rules,'' Caine's
latest picture, that brought out the old maverick impulse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The title refers to the rules posted on the wall of this house
where itinerant apple-pickers stay,'' Caine says of the acclaimed
adaptation of John Irving's popular, 1940s-set novel. ``Delroy
Lindo delivers the most important line in the picture when he says,
`Whoever wrote those rules never lived here.' That's what worries
me about all those things. I came from a very class-conscious
country and from the lowest possible class, and there always seemed
to be somebody making rules for me who not only did not know me but
didn't want to know me. So I became an absolute rebel about rules,
and I think the abortion theme, in John Irving's mind, is a
metaphor for that: You cannot blanket anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Caine plays Dr. Larch, the kindly, ether-addicted master of a
rural Maine orphanage who performs safe but illegal abortions on
the side. He longs to convince his favorite charge, Homer Wells
(Tobey Maguire), to follow in his footsteps. But even though the
young man displays great doctoring talent despite his lack of
medical schooling, he's understandably hesitant to perform an
operation that, but for chance, could easily have prevented his own
existence.
</P>
<P>
   Though Irving released pre-emptive defenses against potential
criticism of the film's pro-choice stance and Larch's character in
particular, such protests have so far failed to materialize. Part
of that may be due to the way that Caine makes Larch, whatever his
shortcomings, such a sweet guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the nicest man, the kindest man, the most compassionate
man that I have ever played ... and I've played a lot of
sleazebags,'' Caine acknowledges. ``I mean, Dr. Larch could be a
sleaze as well, depending on your point of view. A guy who performs
illegal abortions, does ether and forges medical documents isn't
exactly St. Francis of Assisi. But it was the compassion in the
character that meant so much to me.''
</P>
<P>
   So much, in fact, that Caine did something he'd never done
before: essay a typical American accent. While he's occasionally
gone for regional U.S. dialects, such as in the Georgia-set ``Hurry
Sundown,'' Caine has overwhelmingly stuck to his own voice for the
past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Again, not the typical habit of the well-trained English actor,
most of whom make a big deal out of showing off their expertise
with every variation of the language the world has to offer.
Caine's approach ran characteristically counter to all of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens to me is, I'll watch a performance like that and
say, `My God, there's a British actor doing a wonderful American
accent,''' Caine explains. ``I didn't do that. I just tried to be
American, that's it, not do any accent. When you see the movie, you
shouldn't be aware that I'm British, it's so subtle. If I'm doing
it right, you can't see the performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Caine did employ a dialogue coach for the job, insisting that he
frankly tell the actor, after two weeks of practice, whether he was
at all convincing or not. That and ``American friends whose
barbarity I rely on.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviews have been mixed, with some saying Caine nailed the
accent perfectly and others left unconvinced. But it was good
enough for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which has
nominated Caine for a Golden Globe Award. He won the group's
supporting actor trophy last year for his sublime portrayal of a
two-bit talent manager in ``Little Voice.'' But there was no
subsequent Oscar nomination, which didn't necessarily surprise the
actor. After all, he considers his Academy Award for Woody Allen's
``Hannah'' a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who were voting were very perceptive that year,''
Caine says, not sounding too egotistical. ``Very often, you'll see
Academy Awards go to actors who are patently and obviously acting.
Everybody says, `What a wonderful performance that is!' But you're
supposed to be sitting there feeling sorry, happy, sad or hilarious
for this wonderful human being you're seeing. It has nothing to do
with actors.''
</P>
<P>
   By Caine's estimation, movies in general had little to do with
acting by the mid-1990s. Never exactly a snob about work _ he would
rather infamously knock out three to five films a year, often
regardless of quality, in his heyday _ the actor had essentially
lost interest in the field between 1993 and '97.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a couple of years, a person who was an actor rather than
an action star or something like that thought that they were never
going to make plot- or character-led movies again because they
don't make any money,'' he recalls. ``I worried about that because
I was too old to play the action stuff and I couldn't find anything
that was worth doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, there is a load,'' adds Caine, who has ``Quills,'' a
film about the Marquis De Sade, and an update of ``King Lear'' set
in a contemporary underworld milieu on the horizon. ``Now, I
continue to work because I like to work, and I'm doing work that I
want to do. Professionally and in all other ways, I am an extremely
fulfilled and happy man.''
</P>
<P>
   But the young man hasn't completely gone away.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, I still have some leftover anger,'' Caine
reveals, not entirely convincingly. ``So what I do is, I'm now
angry for others; I'm liable to espouse some causes.'' &QL;

<P>
   For the first time, an opinion poll reveals what the Russian
public thinks about a wide range of nuclear security issues, from
the Strategic Arms Control Treaty to nuclear smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, ``Examining Attitudes of Russians Towards Nuclear
Weapons and Nuclear Threats,'' was jointly sponsored by Moscow's
Center for Policy Studies in Russia and the Center for
Nonproliferation Studies of the Monterey Institute in California.
</P>
<P>
   It was based on interviews with 1,500 people in 56 localities
throughout the Russian Federation, and was released Nov. 16. The
research was conducted by Fond Obshestvennoye Mneniye _ a well
respected, politically independent Russian polling company.
</P>
<P>
   The survey helps to clarify how Russians think about nuclear
weapons _ including the role they play in world politics, how much
Russia needs them for its own security and how they could be
diverted for use by international terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The results also demonstrate that, as elsewhere, the public on
this issue does not always agree with the official government and
military positions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the end of the Cold War and a halt to the U.S.-Soviet
superpower arms race, the survey showed that a significant number
of Russians find comfort in their country's nuclear weapons; 77
percent supported the Russian National Security Concept provision
that says: ``Nuclear weapons play a decisive role in providing
national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those polled, 24 percent acknowledged that it is costly for
Russia to maintain its nuclear arsenal, but 32 percent said Russia
ought to have as many nukes as the United States _ while 26 percent
supported the idea of a Russia with more nuclear weapons than
America.
</P>
<P>
   As for totally deactivating their nuclear weapons, it wasn't a
popular idea: 82 percent thought Russia's nuclear arsenal must be
on active duty and ready for use; a mere 12 percent said that the
nukes should be kept in storage. Only 18 percent of those polled
thought Russia didn't need any nukes at all.
</P>
<P>
   That such weapons could fall into the hands of the wrong people
weighed heavily on respondents, with fear voiced about possible
sabotage of Russian nuclear facilities, including power plants and
nuclear munitions storage sites _ 90 percent of those polled
expressed such a fear.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the survey was taken after a devastating series of
terrorist bombs in Moscow and other Russian cities killed more than
300 people _ attacks blamed by the Kremlin on Chechen warlords and
bandits, although solid evidence of guilt remains absent. This
continues to be used as rationale for the bloody Russian military
campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the fact that nine out of every 10 of Russian
adults polled said that nuclear sabotage is possible demonstrates
how great the fear is. It also shows how little the Russian people
trust the official statements which claim that ``all strategic
facilities are under control.''
</P>
<P>
   While only 52 percent of those polled expressed concern about a
nuclear attack by foreign states, 86 percent expressed fear that
international terrorists might use nuclear weapons against Russia.
Only 10 percent considered such terrorism to be improbable; only 4
percent had difficulty answering this question, which suggests that
the majority are indeed living with concern about nuclear
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Russians, the poll revealed, simply don't buy the
assurances of their senior government officials that there is no
way for nuclear thieves to steal weapons-grade fissile materials
from domestic nuclear facilities. The majority, 83 percent of
respondents, believed it possible to smuggle such lethal materials
out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Russians generally valued the concept of curbing the spread of
nukes, with 76 percent saying the world would be far less stable if
more countries had nuclear weapons. Education played a role in
this: 81 percent of those with a higher education said nuclear
proliferation would diminish global stability; so did 74 percent of
those with a secondary education and 64 percent with a primary
education.
</P>
<P>
   Even those respondents who believed that world stability could
be improved by the proliferation of nuclear weapons opposed the
idea of selling Russian nuclear arms and technologies abroad.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Russians don't balk at the idea of total world
nuclear disarmament. Of those polled, 57 percent believed the world
would be a more stable place if all nuclear weapons were abolished.
Russians 60 years of age or older were the biggest supporters _ 67
percent of the elderly Russians believed that eliminating all
nuclear arms would add to international stability.
</P>
<P>
   As for cutbacks, 55 percent of those polled supported
ratification of the START II treaty, which has languished in the
Russian Duma, or parliament, since 1993, and only 25 percent were
opposed. Interestingly, 72 percent of those polled said America
would implement only those treaty provisions of benefit to itself.
</P>
<P>
   Being a nuclear power is linked to global influence, many
Russians believed. Of those polled, 40 percent said Russia will
have a say in world politics if it kept its nuclear weapons; 37
percent thought other nations wouldn't dare attack a nuclear-armed
Russia. Only 23 percent said nuclear weapons were necessary because
developing nuclear technology promotes technical progress.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of respondents, 47 percent, also thought that Russia
should retain the right to launch a first strike _ which is the
official position of their government. However, a large minority,
38 percent, held the opposite view, and the rest found the question
difficult to answer.
</P>
<P>
   As to politics, people's political preferences generally had
very little impact on the opinions reflected in their answers. But
among the more illuminating data:
</P>
<P>
   __ Seventy-nine percent of those polled who were followers of
Yevgeny M. Primakov, former prime minister and leader of
Fatherland-All Russia, a centrist electoral alliance, said the
United States could not be trusted to act fairly in fulfilling its
international arms-control treaty obligations. Primakov is
currently the most likely competitor to Acting President Vladimir
V. Putin in the March 26 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   __ Twenty-three percent of those polled who were supporters of
Gennadi A. Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, maintained that
Russia should have the same number of nuclear weapons as the United
States; 31 percent were sure that Russia needed more. Moreover, his
supporters accounted for the largest number of those opposed to the
six-year-old START II treaty, which calls for the reduction of
nuclear stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fifty-four percent of those polled who were followers of
Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist leader, believed that
Russian nukes should be permanently targeted at certain states.
</P>
<P>
   __ Eighty-seven percent of supporters of Sergei Kiriyenko,
another former prime minister and leader of the Union of Right
Forces, a pro-capitalist group, were sure the world would be less
stable if more countries possessed nuclear weapons.

   Nevertheless, the fact that nine out of every 10 of Russian
adults polled said that nuclear sabotage is possible demonstrates
how great the fear is. It also shows how little the Russian people
trust the official statements which claim that ``all strategic
facilities are under control.''
</P>
<P>
   While only 52 percent of those polled expressed concern about a
nuclear attack by foreign states, 86 percent expressed fear that
international terrorists might use nuclear weapons against Russia.
Only 10 percent considered such terrorism to be improbable; only 4
percent had difficulty answering this question, which suggests that
the majority are indeed living with concern about nuclear
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Russians, the poll revealed, simply don't buy the
assurances of their senior government officials that there is no
way for nuclear thieves to steal weapons-grade fissile materials
from domestic nuclear facilities. The majority, 83 percent of
respondents, believed it possible to smuggle such lethal materials
out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Russians generally valued the concept of curbing the spread of
nukes, with 76 percent saying the world would be far less stable if
more countries had nuclear weapons. Education played a role in
this: 81 percent of those with a higher education said nuclear
proliferation would diminish global stability; so did 74 percent of
those with a secondary education and 64 percent with a primary
education.
</P>
<P>
   Even those respondents who believed that world stability could
be improved by the proliferation of nuclear weapons opposed the
idea of selling Russian nuclear arms and technologies abroad.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Russians don't balk at the idea of total world
nuclear disarmament. Of those polled, 57 percent believed the world
would be a more stable place if all nuclear weapons were abolished.
Russians 60 years of age or older were the biggest supporters _ 67
percent of the elderly Russians believed that eliminating all
nuclear arms would add to international stability.
</P>
<P>
   As for cutbacks, 55 percent of those polled supported
ratification of the START II treaty, which has languished in the
Russian Duma, or parliament, since 1993, and only 25 percent were
opposed. Interestingly, 72 percent of those polled said America
would implement only those treaty provisions of benefit to itself.
</P>
<P>
   Being a nuclear power is linked to global influence, many
Russians believed. Of those polled, 40 percent said Russia will
have a say in world politics if it kept its nuclear weapons; 37
percent thought other nations wouldn't dare attack a nuclear-armed
Russia. Only 23 percent said nuclear weapons were necessary because
developing nuclear technology promotes technical progress.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of respondents, 47 percent, also thought that Russia
should retain the right to launch a first strike _ which is the
official position of their government. However, a large minority,
38 percent, held the opposite view, and the rest found the question
difficult to answer.
</P>
<P>
   As to politics, people's political preferences generally had
very little impact on the opinions reflected in their answers. But
among the more illuminating data:
</P>
<P>
   __ Seventy-nine percent of those polled who were followers of
Yevgeny M. Primakov, former prime minister and leader of
Fatherland-All Russia, a centrist electoral alliance, said the
United States could not be trusted to act fairly in fulfilling its
international arms-control treaty obligations. Primakov is
currently the most likely competitor to Acting President Vladimir
V. Putin in the March 26 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   __ Twenty-three percent of those polled who were supporters of
Gennadi A. Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, maintained that
Russia should have the same number of nuclear weapons as the United
States; 31 percent were sure that Russia needed more. Moreover, his
supporters accounted for the largest number of those opposed to the
six-year-old START II treaty, which calls for the reduction of
nuclear stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fifty-four percent of those polled who were followers of
Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist leader, believed that
Russian nukes should be permanently targeted at certain states.
</P>
<P>
   __ Eighty-seven percent of supporters of Sergei Kiriyenko,
another former prime minister and leader of the Union of Right
Forces, a pro-capitalist group, were sure the world would be less
stable if more countries possessed nuclear weapons.

 LA CROSSE, Wis.: ... Rick Barry.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life in the CBA is far from primitive, but it's not the NBA.
Forget charters. Forget first-class hotels. Forget huge meal money.
Say hello to 5:30 a.m. wakeup calls and Lilliputian three-across
jets that afford no leg room to a jockey, let alone a 7-footer. Say
hello to Comfort Inns (not that there's anything wrong with that).
Say hello to 30 bucks a day meal money.
</P>
<P>
   The arenas, with the exception of the armory in Hartford, are
cozy and comfortable. DJ's home court is the La Crosse Center, a
perfectly charming 5,862-seat arena in this pleasant city of 50,000
on the Minnesota border in west-central Wisconsin. La Crosse is a
classic Wisconsin town, which means that under the heading of
``taverns'' in the yellow pages, one will find no fewer than 80
listings, plus 59 more in such surrounding communities as Onalaska,
Cashton, and, across the river, La Crescent, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they use 'em,' too,'' laughs DJ, who spends his free time
with Donna and the kids at their rental in West Salem. He is still
a California-bred Florida resident, who reports that ``the cold
here just burns your face.''
</P>
<P>
   His impact in this community has been, well, enormous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were overwhelmed he would even consider us,'' says Bill
Bosshard, a local bank president who was one of the team's owners
until Isiah Thomas bought the entire league last year, and whose
wife, Diane, is the team's general manager. ``And then when he took
the job he made a complete commitment. He moved his family here
without hesitation. He said, `If I come, my family comes. We'll be
doing this together.' In town, he wears his celebrity status
easily. He has no need of an entourage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked him up when he got here,'' says Mike Gostomski,
another former part-owner, ``and took him to a group of about 100
Polish guys, and he was great. He gave a short speech and then
said, `Anybody wants me one-on-one, I'll be over in that corner.'
He stayed as long as anyone wanted him.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Byers is the trainer, and he still cannot believe he is
working with the Dennis Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first dinner we had, I just sat there in awe,'' Byers
says. ``At the end, I finally got around to asking him about what
it was like to play on all those great teams. Working with him has
turned out to be a blast. He is just an amazing man.''
</P>
<P>
   CBA coaches don't ordinarily stop traffic at airports. Come on,
would you recognize Dan Panaggio, Tyler Jones, or even Darrell
Walker? Like it or not, Dennis Johnson is more than the coach of
the Bobcats. He is their public face. And he is batting 1.000 in
his role as team ambassador, signing autographs by the hour and
interacting with the townsfolk as if he had lived here for 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With three championship rings and his entire background, I
didn't know what to expect,'' says assistant general manager and
play-by-play announcer Ken Koeller. ``But Dennis has been a joy. He
is a genuine, down-to-earth human being who just likes being around
people.''
</P>
<P>
   All this is a pleasant bonus for the La Crosse Bobcats, but just
being a nice guy isn't going to get Johnson what he wants. He will
get one of those coveted NBA head coaching jobs only if he can
prove that he merits one. Coaching, not hand-shaking, will get
Johnson out of La Crosse.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people are surprised he isn't in the NBA right now _ as
a Larry Bird assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told someone last year in a lighthearted way, although I do
mean it to a degree, that I almost wish Larry hadn't said what he
said,'' sighs Johnson. ``It gave people the wrong impression. I
loved playing with him, and we never had a cross word, but we
weren't close friends off the court. We did talk, and he knew I
wasn't interested in being a third assistant, anyway, even if he
wanted one. It's not a big deal to me, but so many other people
think it is.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a total nonissue. The real issue is his learning curve as a
head man in a competitive business, and Bill Klucas believes DJ is
a coaching keeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's secure,'' Klucas points out. ``He's not afraid to
delegate. I've been around Bird and (Kevin) McHale, and DJ is like
them in that they all have what I call `Celtic confidence.' I've
worked with Fred Taylor, Bill Musselman, Joe Mullaney, and many
others, and from an assistant coach's standpoint DJ is the easiest
man I've ever worked with. He knows the game. The only gap on his
resume was the actual head coaching experience, the game
management. He knew what he needed and he came down here to learn
it.''
</P>
<P>
   DJ has tried this suit on, and it fits very nicely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I see myself coaching in the NBA?'' he inquires. ``Very
nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside to NBA GMs: DJ has a cell phone, too, and it's a guarantee
he'll promptly return your call.

CHANGES MAY NOT SUIT HARKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Revolution coach Fernando Clavijo has some
major decisions to make before preseason training begins next week,
and among the first will involve his former World Cup teammate,
John Harkes.
</P>
<P>
   Harkes has been rehabilitated to US national team status, which
is justice for the unceremonious way he was dismissed before France
'98. Harkes was on the bench for the US's 1-1 tie with Iran at the
Rose Bowl Sunday, but his status has not been defined for either
the US or the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The question Clavijo must answer is: Can Harkes's status as a
top-salaried player be justified without him being the focal point
of the team? Harkes could play a role as elder statesman with the
national team, but the Revolution have several others qualified for
those responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Harkes, then, must decide whether he can take on a lower profile
and accept a lower salary, at least on paper. This will not be easy
for someone who has performed in 168 English League games, the FA
Cup final, and two World Cup finals, and won two MLS Cup titles
with D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is a big part of the team,'' Clavijo said. ``I know how
he feels because I've been there myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks we have a playoff team without making any changes.
But we are bringing in guys, and some guys are going to have to
make sacrifices, and he is one of them. The salary issue is an
unfortunate situation because every player who renegotiates expects
a 5 percent increase. Something has to give. No individual can win
or lose games by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying to build a team and we are going to have to go
through the process, and that includes some suffering. I've told
John he has a big part to play. He is a great competitor, a winner,
and he can help the team tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the small group of US fans at the Rose Bowl was one with a
sign that read: ``Harkesy Rules.'' But even though Harkes performed
well in pregame training sessions, he was not used by coach Bruce
Arena. Clearly, Arena plans to go with younger players, but he also
wants to mix in some veterans to provide guidance.
</P>
<P>
   At age 32, Harkes is at a crossroads in his career. He said he
is negotiating with MLS and hopes to return to the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a contract that potentially allows me to stay in New
England for three or four years,'' Harkes said. ``I love playing in
New England and for the fans. I enjoy the people up there. The only
problem is my family is in Northern Virginia and we are expecting
our third child in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fernando wants me on the team and I am an important part of
the team and I'm excited about that. It was frustrating last year
because we had good players and we had the potential but we just
didn't come around.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkes might be overvaluing the Revolution, who won just seven
games in regulation time last season. Certainly, the starting
lineup was capable of success, especially with Walter Zenga in
goal. But no team can be expected to perform at maximum ability
every game, and the Revolution simply lacked the depth to
compensate for injuries and national team absences.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should the Revolution delude themselves. They could not
challenge D.C. United last year and they will not be able to do so
this season. They should attempt to simply improve to the point
where they have a coherent, consistent style of play. If they can
remained poised for 90 minutes for the majority of games _ whether
losing, tying, or winning _ then they can make progress.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Iranian inroads
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Iranian players such as Andranik Eskandarian performed well in
the North American Soccer League, which recruited them after the
Argentina '78 World Cup. And Los Angeles Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid
expressed interest in Khodadad Azizi, who set up Iran's goal
against the US Sunday. The purchase price of Azizi, 30, would be
$700,000 from FC Cologne in Germany, an amount the MLS could
quickly recoup by promoting Azizi in Southern California, home of
hundreds of thousands of Iranian immigrants. But the Galaxy also
hope to add a Mexican player to replace Carlos Hermosillo, who has
returned to Mexico to play for America. ``An Iranian player with
the Galaxy would look good for the MLS,'' said Hassan Alesafar, a
commentator for Radio Sedaye, a Santa Monica-based Iranian
broadcaster. ``This tour should be a positive for the Iranian
players, especially the ones who are not playing much in Germany.''
Azizi, at 5 feet 6 inches, is an excellent foil for 6-3 Ali Daei in
Iran's forward line. But while Daei is an important part of the
Hertha Berlin team, Azizi seldom plays for Cologne . . . The
US-Iran game was played exactly 21 years after Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi abdicated. And it provided a chance for the exorcising of
demons: The US compensated somewhat for its poor performance at
France '98, when it was defeated by Iran (2-1), and for Iranians
who have been contending with identity and image problems since
militants seized 52 American hostages at the US embassy in Teheran
in 1979 . . . Iran supporters were in the majority of the
approximately 35,000 spectators who attended the Iran-Ecuador match
Wednesday. The attendance for the US-Iran game was announced as
50,181, but the 100,000-seat Rose Bowl appeared to be two-thirds
full.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A losing trend
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four MLS teams have lost their leading scorers from 1999. The
latest to depart was Musa Shannon, a Liberia native with a US
passport, who went from Tampa Bay to Maritimo in Portugal. Shannon
was offered $50,000 by MLS after scoring 11 goals last season. But
based on a two-day visit to the Madeira Islands, Maritimo sealed a
deal worth more than $125,000 annually, plus bonuses, for 3 1/2
years, according to his agent, Patrick McCabe. Maritimo officials
believe Shannon could be worth as much as $1 million if he has a
successful season. Shannon appears to be an example of either a
double standard or misplaced emphasis by MLS. He had the
uninhibited personality that captures the imagination of fans,
setting him apart from the generic US player. Yet he was offered
the same salary as D.C. United striker A.J. Wood, who has scored
fewer goals and had no leverage in negotiations. ``It's a question
of economics,'' McCabe said. ``Certain players, for whatever
reason, are valued more than others, for reasons other than talent
and how they perform. There doesn't seem to be any logic in it. The
MLS says they want to keep their best players, especially the young
ones, but there were only three young players among the leading
scorers in the league, and they lost two of them.'' MLS signed San
Jose striker Ronald Cerritos, 25, for $330,000 annually but lost
Stern John, 23, and Shannon, 24. The league profited from John, who
earned a total of about $85,000 while producing 44 goals in two
seasons for the Columbus Crew, then went to Nottingham Forest in a
deal worth at least $2 million. But MLS lost Shannon, Joe-Max Moore
(Revolution/Everton), and Hermosillo (Los Angeles/America) without
compensation. Moore scored his first goal of the season for Everton
in a 2-2 tie with Tottenham Hotspur Saturday . . . The hiring of
April Heinrichs as head coach of the US women's national team is
expected to accelerate negotiations to end a player strike before
the next game, against Norway Feb. 6. A meeting with the players
and US Soccer Federation officials is planned in New York Jan. 24.
Heinrichs was captain of the team, then retired after the 1991
World Cup . . . Debbie Belkin, formerly of Needham, also a member
of the '91 World Cup team, was named to the all-time collegiate
women's all-star team by Soccer America magazine. Belkin, who
played at the University of Massachusetts, is coaching at the
University of Michigan.

THE END OF MANAGED CARE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have opined that Manuel Ferris was the single most blameworthy
manager in the debacle at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, now in state
receivership after losing an estimated $177 million or so last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine my surprise when I discovered that Ferris is still
serving as chairman of the board at Boston Medical Center, the
Boston University-affiliated reincarnation of Boston City Hospital,
now run by a semi-independent authority.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston resident, as reported at the time of his appointment?
Are you kidding?
</P>
<P>
   Ferris was the out-of-work hotel industry exec who took over the
helm at Harvard Community Health Plan in 1991, merged it with
Pilgrim Health Care in 1994, all the while living in Tucson and
commuting for three or four days at a time to a pied-a-terre at the
Four Seasons.
</P>
<P>
   When in 1996 the 63-year-old Ferris gave up his $880,000 job
``for personal reasons'' and retired to Arizona for the second
time, Mayor Thomas Menino persuaded him to stick around enough to
head the Boston Medical Center board _ Ferris having kindly brought
the troubled city hospital into the HCHP network. He is chief among
30 trustees _ 10 of them named by Menino, 10 by Boston University,
and 10 ex-officio members representing various constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine my delight when Ferris's Arizona phone number, which is
unlisted, came in over the transom from a reader. Imagine my
disappointment when I called Monday to learn he had just gone out.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to explore the history of the Harvard HMO, to
identify the missteps and missteppers and hold them up to public
view. We can expect Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly
to provide a thorough accounting of the case. For openers, Reilly
last week canceled generous severance packages for two executives
on whose watch the problem escalated out of control. He's preparing
to hire an investment banker to survey the range of options _ many
of them quite complicated _ that might return the health plan to
solvency.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to remember, however, that the health care
system has been in turmoil nationally for more than a decade. The
Massachusetts system with its local problems is embedded in the
far-more-extensive controversy over the appropriate form for a
national health insurance system. How to tell which way is up?
</P>
<P>
   The current issue of the Journal of Health Politics, Policy and
Law, edited by Mark Peterson of the University of California at Los
Angeles, is a big help in finding the horizon. Called the ``The
Managed Care Backlash,'' it contains 36 articles by many of the
biggest names in health care economics examining the problem from
every conceivable angle.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most persuasive of its essays is ``The Death of
Managed Care as We Know It,'' a critique of the logic of managed
care by a liberal health care economist, Katherine Swartz, of the
Harvard School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   HMO medicine grew to prominence on the strength of two basic
promises, Swartz writes; to deliver better care at lower cost
through good management and better information systems; and to
foster competition among health plans that would render all
organizations more efficient. Today, she says, the public believes
that neither of these promises has been fulfilled. For at least two
reasons, she says, the backlash against managed care will be hard
to reverse. First, she writes, ``managed care's financial
incentives for providers to skimp on care make it difficult for
patients to trust that an advised course of action is in a
patient's true best interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Second, consumers want to be able to choose providers . . . in
large part so that they can find providers that they feel are
responsive to their needs and who will act as their agents,'' she
adds. Physicians now recognize that they risk losing patients'
trust if they don't distance themselves from managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Any remedy for the Harvard Pilgrim receivership is going to
require an informed bet on where the national system is headed next
_ starting with the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that George W. Bush, though he says little about
health care on the stump, is a better bet to come up with an
equitable and efficient solution than either of the Democrats, each
of them full of bold talk?

SHE' FASHIONING A BRAND-NEW BAZAAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the turn of the century, the fashion world is
witnessing cultural change at the speed of light. Hip hop clothing
is as relevant to style as Paris runways, Internet ``e-tailing'' is
thriving, design houses are trading on Wall Street, khakis are
eclipsing business suits, and senior citizens are garbed in Old
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an era for an out-of-touch, lady-who-lunches species of
fashion editor. Enter Katherine Betts, 35, the new editor in chief
of Harper's Bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   Betts resigned as a top editor at Vogue last June to take the
helm of its longtime rival. Her mission is simple _ to turn the
oldest US fashion magazine (Bazaar, founded in 1867, currently
ranks No. 3 in circulation behind Vogue and Elle) into a ``more
practical, journalistic'' entity with a focus on lifestyles,
off-runway fashion news, society, culture, and arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the days of fashion magazines being created in one
person's image are over,'' Betts said recently in her 37th-floor
executive suite in Manhattan. ``You have to show lots of different
options and points of view. You can't just say there's only one way
to look.'' Betts, dressed smartly in black Prada jacket, tweed
Celine skirt, and Christian Louboutin high-heeled black suede
boots, said she wants to make Bazaar ``younger in spirit, energy,
and inclusiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Bazaar readers, whose median age is 38, can judge for
themselves with the newsstand release of Betts's third issue. The
February edition, with Gwyneth Paltrow on the cover, features a
complete redesign, with new writers, photographers, typefaces, and
sections such as Tremor (on industry trends), Style Safari
(off-runway fashion news), and Reality Check (a look at how women
are adapting to fashion in their lives).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stories include a feature on the post-PC generation; a profile
on a group of young female photographers who are hot just now in
the art world; and a look inside the homes of sisters Aerin and
Jane Lauder, granddaughters of the founder of the Estee Lauder
cosmetics company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt strongly that one of the great traditions of Bazaar was
its quirky, offbeat content,'' said Betts. ``I wanted to maintain
that feeling of surprise but combine it with more journalistic news
and design. Often, those are considered to be mutually exclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Betts was approached for the top job last June after her
predecessor, Liz Tilberis, 51, died of ovarian cancer in April.
Tilberis had served as editor since 1992. ``I knew Liz
professionally. Those were big shoes to fill,'' said Betts.
</P>
<P>
   Cathleen Black, president of Hearst Magazines (a division of
Bazaar's publisher, Hearst Communications), challenged Betts to
create a prototype ``as if she was doing the July, August, and
September issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``She put together a wonderful book with a fabulous cover and
three tables of content,'' Black said. ``We loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   A job offer soon followed. ``This was an opportunity I couldn't
turn down. This is a dream job,'' Betts said. But the timing on the
appointment couldn't have been worse; she was nine months pregnant
with her first child, Oliver. ``I resigned (from Vogue) on my due
date. I was very pregnant. Oliver was 10 pounds, 6 ounces!''
</P>
<P>
   Betts took a two-month maternity leave during which she worked
from her Manhattan home, recovered from a caesarean section, and
opened gifts from designers all over the world. ``Oliver got a lot
of baby clothes,'' she said, smiling. ``People were very
generous.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, the 5-foot-9 dynamo hit the ground running,
working 10-hour days building her staff and creating the magazine
redesign. Oliver stayed at home with a nanny.
</P>
<P>
   In October _ just one month into the job _ Betts prepared to
bring her infant to Milan while she covered the fashion shows. Her
intent was to have her nanny and her husband, Chip Brown (a
freelance magazine writer and author of an alternative medicine
book), keep her son at the hotel. ``I would never bring a baby to a
show,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Betts was assured by her travel agency that Oliver
didn't need a passport to travel, only a birth certificate, the
Delta Airlines agent wasn't budging when the time came to board the
plane. ``He said, `Where's the baby's passport?' '' recalled Betts,
who was standing there with eight suitcases full of formula,
diapers, bottles, wipes, and clothing. ``I tried to beg them and
plead. But they said even if they let me go, Italy wouldn't allow
us in when we arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Duty called, so Betts flew forlornly to Milan by herself while
Oliver went back home with his father, who secured a passport in
three days. Husband, son, and nanny then joined Betts in Europe.
``Most of the way across the Atlantic,'' Betts said in her December
editor's letter, ``I wondered how millions of modern American women
manage the difficult balance of motherhood and work.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Betts's role model was her own mother, Glynne Robinson
Betts, a photographer and former publisher of two Connecticut
newspapers, the Lakeville Journal and the Millerton News. Not only
did Glynne work when Katherine was growing up, she was also a style
maven, said her daughter. (Katherine's father, Hobart Betts, is an
architect). To be sure, it wasn't hard to be fashion-conscious
growing up in Manhattan four blocks from Bloomingdale's and across
the street from the famed designer Halston.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ``He had all these huge, blow-out parties and I was always
really fascinated, looking out the window. I remember drag queens
lounging on Jaguars outside. My brother and I would always try to
sneak in,'' she said. ``My brother got in a lot, but I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   During her years at Princeton University as a European history
major, Betts immersed herself in fashion by summering in Paris
twice. ``I love France, the language, the people. I always knew I
wanted to live there.'' After graduation in 1986, Betts, fluent in
French, landed a job as an editorial assistant at the International
Herald Tribune newspaper in Paris. Meanwhile, she freelanced for
various magazines, writing profiles and traveling across Europe.
``I always wanted to be a reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, a magazine piece she wrote on wild-boar hunting caught
the eye of John Fairchild, editor at large of Fairchild
Publications (which publishes W magazine and the industry newspaper
Women's Wear Daily, or WWD). ``WWD was looking for a feature writer
in Paris,'' she said. ``I didn't have any experience in the
industry.'' But Betts got the job anyway. And in 18 months, the
go-getter was bureau chief. ``It's amazing the training you get at
WWD. It's sort of a graduate school for fashion journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Betts met Anna Wintour, Vogue's editor in chief,
through a friend. The two hit it off and in May 1991, Wintour
persuaded Betts to leave Paris, move back to New York, and work for
Vogue as a writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very lucky at Vogue,'' Betts said. ``Anna gave me a lot
of freedom. I was very independent.'' And fruitful. Betts produced
runway reports, designer profiles, popular culture stories, and
Vogue's themed issues. The editor also created two popular
sections, Vogue's View (feature stories) and Vogue's Index (hot
items and where to find them). Betts was promoted to fashion news
director in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at Vogue a long time and I loved it,'' she said. Her
December editor's letter in Harper's Bazaar credits Wintour as her
mentor. ``She taught me how to connect trends in fashion to the
culture at large, gave me the freedom to develop my own ideas, and
when, after eight years at Vogue, I had the chance to take the
reins of the competition, she gave me her blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wintour, in her September editor's letter, said, ``Weeks after
Kate joined Vogue. . . I knew that one day she would edit her own
magazine. . . She is highly intelligent, has a great journalistic
sense, and has never been duped by even the most passionate fashion
enthusiast. I feel sad that we will now be rivals and will miss
sitting next to her at fashion shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she was rumored to be the heir apparent at Vogue, Betts
maintains that wasn't true. ``I didn't feel I was going to be
editor,'' she said emphatically. ``I always wanted to be the editor
of a magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Betts has her hands full motivating 55 staffers to cover an
industry where, as she puts it, ``the only constant is change.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times recently said that Betts is, essentially,
remaking Bazaar in the image of Vogue with similar headlines,
feature stories, and even the same January cover model. Amazingly,
the model, Gisele, is dressed for both covers in Gucci python
outfits. Said Betts, ``It's a fashion moment. No, I am not remaking
Bazaar in the image of Vogue. Let Bazaar speak for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Betts's publisher is confident in her abilities. Said
Black, ``I joined the company about four years ago and people right
away said there's a big young talent at Vogue that you ought to
keep your eye on. Kate stood out because of the work she was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she has a very young, contemporary, modern vision of
fashion. . . beyond the runway. My sense is that she is an editor
for a new generation. I think she'll take the best of what Bazaar
stands for and will infuse it with a new and younger perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Bazaar's paid circulation, currently about 750,000, has
fluctuated since 1994 but never approached Vogue's, which currently
has a paid circulation of about 1.1 million, according to the Audit
Bureau of Circulations. Elle's paid circulation is about 913,000.
Then there is the newcomer competition, such as InStyle magazine
and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   All these rivals are vying for the attention of busier-than-ever
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, naysayers in the industry contend the average woman
no longer cares about fashion because runways are irrelevant to her
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love to say that fashion is dead,'' said Betts with a
smirk and dismissive wave of her hand. ``Yes, the business has
changed dramatically. There are (initial public offerings),
mergers, and this whole idea that the consumer is more aware of the
stock price and the shoe price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think women will always be interested in designer
fashion. That's what's new. I think every brand now needs a certain
profile on the Net (Bazaar's site is coming in April). But I'm not
convinced people are reading full pieces on the Net. People still
want to read magazines.''

   MELBOURNE _ Although ``Anna and the King'' is banned in Thailand
as politically incoherent _ a tough break for the country's Jodie
Foster fans _ a local version in sneakers opened here to fine
reviews Monday at an amphitheater beside the muddy but sun-speckled
Yara River.

   Anna and the King of the former Siam _ a.k.a. Anna Kournikova
and Paradorn Srichaphan _ played their parts brilliantly as the
Australian Open cranked into being, the traditional springboard for
another long-running tennis campaign.

   This Russian Anna, who commands innumerable male subjects across
the world, must be the most glorified athlete never to win
anything. But even though she's getting on, aged to 18, there's
still a chance she'll cop a title somewhere one of these days.
Nevertheless, that shortcoming doesn't seem to matter to her
worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   But Paradorn Srichaphan? A king? You bet. The king of Thailand
tennis. The greatest in his homeland's history. However, can
anybody name another?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our real king, King Pumipol, does play tennis,'' said
Srichaphan, smiling after stunning 14th-seeded Karol Kucera of
Slovak Republic, 6-2, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. ``But I guess I'm better.''
</P>
<P>
   US Open finalist Todd Martin thought he was better than
Zimbabwean Byron Black, but had to spend all afternoon proving it
while making the escape of the day, 5-7, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-2, 8-6.
After working his way back to 5-4, 30-0 in the fifth, Martin
(moaning inwardly, ``what happened?'') found himself staring at
three match points, 5-6, 0-40, before serving his way to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova can emote. Not in a league with Jodie Foster. Or
Deborah Kerr, who was Anna opposite Yul Brynner's monarch in the
earlier film, a musical, ``The King and I.'' But there was no drama
to this Anna's 2000 debut at Melbourne Park, not enough of her on
the asphalt stage, a mere stadium cameo leaving an audience of
13,000 wanting more.
</P>
<P>
   Silencing Austrian Patricia Wartusch in 34 minutes, Kournikova
rolled a merciless double bagel. Still, from the loser's
standpoint, it was a genuine tear-jerker. Wartusch wept as she
departed the 6-0, 6-0, scene _ ``my first (major) match, and all
those people watching. I wanted to do better.'' She collected all
of 24 points, but $7,200, which should cover a lot of Kleenex.
</P>
<P>
   It was different out on Court 6. There, a few hundred customers,
largely Slovak immigrants plus a couple dozen Thais living in
Melbourne and the otherwise curious, gathered to witness an
expected victory for Kucera. Two years ago Kucera beat Pete Sampras
to make the semis here, and Andre Agassi to enter the quarters at
the US Open while rising to No. 8. He was a quarterfinalist here a
year ago, a name.
</P>
<P>
   Across the net, Srichaphan was just a 20-year-old extra from a
tennis desert, ranked No. 106. But the curious wanted to know what
a Thai guy with racket could do. They were aware of Siamese cats
and Siamese twins, Thai cuisine and Thai silk after the country
changed its name. But a Thai tennis player?
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many of us, only two of us on the tour,'' said
Srichaphan, his eyes sparkling after ``my greatest day. Me and
Tamarine (Tanasugarn).'' She ranks No. 72 on the female tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother, Narathorn, and I are the Thai Davis Cup team, but
he isn't good enough for the ATP Tour. But we're proud to have
moved up to Division 1, and play New Zealand next month.''
</P>
<P>
   Srichaphan has picked up English quickly and well, and hopes to
inspire ``more Thai, more Asians to play.'' A quick-stepping 6 feet
1 inches (``big for a Thai''), he was as hot as the spicy tom yum
soup he adores, as smooth as Thai silk all over the court, banging
flat, topped, and sliced groundies and nailing crucial volleys.
</P>
<P>
   No Thai male had ever won a major match until he qualified at
the last Wimbledon, then stopped France's Guillaume Raoux in the
first round before losing to Yevgeny Kafelnikov in four sets.
</P>
<P>
   How did this swift and eager beaver develop in the land of the
elephant?
</P>
<P>
   ``My father just fell in love with tennis,'' said Srichaphan.
``He read some instruction books, saw some videos, and taught me
and my two older brothers to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Extraordinary. As the stage king, Brynner, crooned, ``It's a
puzzlement!''
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's been my only coach,'' he added. ``My mother
supported us as a schoolteacher. She's happy that her four men are
happy in tennis. My brother, Thanakorn, is a professional coach
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a funny thing. The first professional match I ever saw,
I was 10, and my father took me to the tournament at Pattaya. Slava
Dosedel won, and I had my picture taken with him. The picture is
still in my room. In the second round I play Dosedel. He won't
remember me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Srichaphan said with a laugh, ``I hope to give him
something to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man from Bangkok, the home of kick-boxing, gets his
kicks with fast hands. A Thai TV crew is now following him, a
growing, glowing presence among his people. Who knows how long the
sneakered Anna and the King will run in Melbourne? But don't you
imagine that when it's over King Pumipol will invite King Paradorn
over to the palace to hit a few?

<P>
   For once, the superlatives and the hype seem justified.
</P>
<P>
   The $150 billion takeover of Time Warner by America Online (AOL)
is not just another record-breaking deal, more notable for its size
than its significance.
</P>
<P>
   It is, to use an expression much beloved of Intel's Andy Grove,
an ``inflection point'' _ one of those events that have the
potential to change the competitive landscape so fundamentally that
nothing can be the same again.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the deal has immense implications for media and
communications companies _ and for their audiences. But it may also
mark the moment when the distinction between pure Internet
companies and their bricks-and-mortar equivalents begins to blur as
the former realize they should use their heady valuations to lock
in solid assets and the latter accept, as Time Warner's Gerald
Levin has done, that in some sense ``the value creation of the
Internet is real.''
</P>
<P>
   What the marriage of Time Warner and AOL symbolizes is the
beginning of a trend towards convergence between online and offline
companies, each recognizing the strengths that the other brings.
</P>
<P>
   In coming to their agreement, both Time Warner and AOL have had
to accept that each needs the resources and skills of the other to
compete successfully in the future.
</P>
<P>
   That Time Warner, with its brands, content and distribution
channels, has embraced this deal so enthusiastically is an
extraordinary admission of the difficulty that many traditional
companies face when trying to adapt their businesses to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Its own in-house efforts to move the company in that direction
have pretty much failed.
</P>
<P>
   As for AOL, it has had to recognize that, despite its
preeminence on the Internet and a market capitalization that made
it by far the world's most valuable media company, it is still a
vulnerable enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is dangerously dependent on subscriptions at a time when
more and more firms offer free Internet access; and it may have
difficulty gaining access to cable systems, which are increasingly
seen as the best way to bring broadband services to the consumer. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 225 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, its shares are valued in effect at
75 cents on the dollar, a kind of discount for Internet volatility.
</P>
<P>
   And, for all the (fairly plausible) talk of the wondrous
opportunities that lie before the merged company, it is hard to
avoid the conclusion that Steve Case has decided there will never
be a better time for AOL to cash in its chips.
</P>
<P>
   After all, if he thought that the next 12 months were likely to
be a repeat of the last, he could expect to pick up Time Warner for
half the price in AOL stock this time next year.
</P>
<P>
   If Case's shareholders continue to support this deal, they may
implicitly be calling the peak of the market's Internet frenzy. But
they are also making another point, of huge importance for the
current corporate fashion for establishing Internet spin-offs (the
latest is Wal-Mart) and tracking stocks. It is that the fashion
will fade.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem essential for now to create Internet stock market
value, a currency that can be used to acquire other assets. But
unless there are good operational reasons for separation, once
important lessons have been learned and valuation multiples have
started to converge, these offshoots may well be reintegrated with
their parent companies. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, nearly all companies will be Internet companies in
the sense that all companies today are telephone companies: the
Internet will be so deeply embedded in their being that they no
longer think about it. If the merger between Time Warner and AOL
works as intended, they will simply have got there a little earlier
than most.
</P>
<P>
   But what will we watch? The deal, like all big mergers, takes a
punt on the ability of two corporate cultures to work together. In
this case, AOL stands to lose some agility.
</P>
<P>
   As for Time Warner, already a monster with more than 67,000
employees, it will be owned by a business that employs a mere
12,000.
</P>
<P>
   But an even bigger bet has been placed on the way people will
want to be entertained and informed in future.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 years, the media business has been moving from
broadcasting to narrowcasting. All media companies used to produce
one identical product _ a film, a newspaper or a broadcast
television network _ which they slapped out to as many consumers as
they could.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television changed that by starting to fragment the
audience. Cable networks had to approach their audiences in a
different way to the broadcasters: they had to develop niche
programming, which meant thinking about what made people different,
not what they had in common. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cable-systems companies had to manage subscriber relationships,
which meant dealing with individuals, however clumsily. In the
future, cable companies will be seen as the prehistoric ancestors
of fully evolved narrowcasters. For they began a process that the
Internet takes much further: bringing company and customer closer
together.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can answer back, and so tell companies what they want.
Companies can find out far more about their customers: where they
live, where they shop, what music they like, what books they read.
</P>
<P>
   This individual relationship between producer and consumer is in
its infancy; but already, all sorts of companies are beginning to
sell things differently on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   AOL Time Warner plans to make early use of these possibilities.
AOL will, for instance, offer its subscribers free clips from
Warner Music: because AOL knows its subscribers, they will be clips
of the kind of music those individuals might want to listen to. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,200) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This merger, then, brings forward the shift to narrowcasting.
Some people fear the social consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when the bonds of family and community are loosening,
they say, broadcast television brings people together, listening to
the same news, talking about the same issues, addicted to the same
soaps.
</P>
<P>
   If that common ground disappears, so will some of the glue that
holds society together. Yet social glue, surely, is made of better
stuff than soap. And broadcasting has always pandered to the lowest
common denominator.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of George Gilder, new-media prophet, ``Television
is not vulgar because people are vulgar _ it is vulgar because
people are similar in their prurient interests and sharply
different in their civilized concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Sex, shopping and violence, in other words, are what people have
in common. What differentiates them is their enthusiasm for folk
music, tropical fish or Viennese waltzes.
</P>
<P>
   A broadcast medium could never cater to these interests, because
not enough people shared them. A narrowcasting world can.
</P>
<P>
   Levin and Case, as they begin to shift their huge empire to
address individually the aspirations and sensitivities of their 100
million or so subscribers, would no doubt agree with Gilder that
their merger will make the world a better place.
</P>
<P>
   And they no doubt hope that, because they will be changing the
world in a way that people will like, they might just make a huge
amount of money as well. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   For once, the superlatives and the hype seem justified.
</P>
<P>
   The $150 billion takeover of Time Warner by America Online (AOL)
is not just another record-breaking deal, more notable for its size
than its significance.
</P>
<P>
   It is, to use an expression much beloved of Intel's Andy Grove,
an ``inflection point'' _ one of those events that have the
potential to change the competitive landscape so fundamentally that
nothing can be the same again.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the deal has immense implications for media and
communications companies _ and for their audiences. But it may also
mark the moment when the distinction between pure Internet
companies and their bricks-and-mortar equivalents begins to blur as
the former realize they should use their heady valuations to lock
in solid assets and the latter accept, as Time Warner's Gerald
Levin has done, that in some sense ``the value creation of the
Internet is real.''
</P>
<P>
   What the marriage of Time Warner and AOL symbolizes is the
beginning of a trend towards convergence between online and offline
companies, each recognizing the strengths that the other brings.
</P>
<P>
   In coming to their agreement, both Time Warner and AOL have had
to accept that each needs the resources and skills of the other to
compete successfully in the future.
</P>
<P>
   That Time Warner, with its brands, content and distribution
channels, has embraced this deal so enthusiastically is an
extraordinary admission of the difficulty that many traditional
companies face when trying to adapt their businesses to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Its own in-house efforts to move the company in that direction
have pretty much failed.
</P>
<P>
   As for AOL, it has had to recognize that, despite its
preeminence on the Internet and a market capitalization that made
it by far the world's most valuable media company, it is still a
vulnerable enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is dangerously dependent on subscriptions at a time when
more and more firms offer free Internet access; and it may have
difficulty gaining access to cable systems, which are increasingly
seen as the best way to bring broadband services to the consumer. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 225 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, its shares are valued in effect at
75 cents on the dollar, a kind of discount for Internet volatility.
</P>
<P>
   And, for all the (fairly plausible) talk of the wondrous
opportunities that lie before the merged company, it is hard to
avoid the conclusion that Steve Case has decided there will never
be a better time for AOL to cash in its chips.
</P>
<P>
   After all, if he thought that the next 12 months were likely to
be a repeat of the last, he could expect to pick up Time Warner for
half the price in AOL stock this time next year.
</P>
<P>
   If Case's shareholders continue to support this deal, they may
implicitly be calling the peak of the market's Internet frenzy. But
they are also making another point, of huge importance for the
current corporate fashion for establishing Internet spin-offs (the
latest is Wal-Mart) and tracking stocks. It is that the fashion
will fade.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem essential for now to create Internet stock market
value, a currency that can be used to acquire other assets. But
unless there are good operational reasons for separation, once
important lessons have been learned and valuation multiples have
started to converge, these offshoots may well be reintegrated with
their parent companies. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, nearly all companies will be Internet companies in
the sense that all companies today are telephone companies: the
Internet will be so deeply embedded in their being that they no
longer think about it. If the merger between Time Warner and AOL
works as intended, they will simply have got there a little earlier
than most.
</P>
<P>
   But what will we watch? The deal, like all big mergers, takes a
punt on the ability of two corporate cultures to work together. In
this case, AOL stands to lose some agility.
</P>
<P>
   As for Time Warner, already a monster with more than 67,000
employees, it will be owned by a business that employs a mere
12,000.
</P>
<P>
   But an even bigger bet has been placed on the way people will
want to be entertained and informed in future.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 years, the media business has been moving from
broadcasting to narrowcasting. All media companies used to produce
one identical product _ a film, a newspaper or a broadcast
television network _ which they slapped out to as many consumers as
they could.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television changed that by starting to fragment the
audience. Cable networks had to approach their audiences in a
different way to the broadcasters: they had to develop niche
programming, which meant thinking about what made people different,
not what they had in common. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cable-systems companies had to manage subscriber relationships,
which meant dealing with individuals, however clumsily. In the
future, cable companies will be seen as the prehistoric ancestors
of fully evolved narrowcasters. For they began a process that the
Internet takes much further: bringing company and customer closer
together.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can answer back, and so tell companies what they want.
Companies can find out far more about their customers: where they
live, where they shop, what music they like, what books they read.
</P>
<P>
   This individual relationship between producer and consumer is in
its infancy; but already, all sorts of companies are beginning to
sell things differently on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   AOL Time Warner plans to make early use of these possibilities.
AOL will, for instance, offer its subscribers free clips from
Warner Music: because AOL knows its subscribers, they will be clips
of the kind of music those individuals might want to listen to. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,200) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This merger, then, brings forward the shift to narrowcasting.
Some people fear the social consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when the bonds of family and community are loosening,
they say, broadcast television brings people together, listening to
the same news, talking about the same issues, addicted to the same
soaps.
</P>
<P>
   If that common ground disappears, so will some of the glue that
holds society together. Yet social glue, surely, is made of better
stuff than soap. And broadcasting has always pandered to the lowest
common denominator.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of George Gilder, new-media prophet, ``Television
is not vulgar because people are vulgar _ it is vulgar because
people are similar in their prurient interests and sharply
different in their civilized concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Sex, shopping and violence, in other words, are what people have
in common. What differentiates them is their enthusiasm for folk
music, tropical fish or Viennese waltzes.
</P>
<P>
   A broadcast medium could never cater to these interests, because
not enough people shared them. A narrowcasting world can.
</P>
<P>
   Levin and Case, as they begin to shift their huge empire to
address individually the aspirations and sensitivities of their 100
million or so subscribers, would no doubt agree with Gilder that
their merger will make the world a better place.
</P>
<P>
   And they no doubt hope that, because they will be changing the
world in a way that people will like, they might just make a huge
amount of money as well. &QL;

   ``Ben,'' says McQuire in ``The Graduate'' film, ``I just want to
say one word to you _ just one word. Plastics. There is a great
future in plastics.''
</P>
<P>
   Most environmentalists are not with McQuire. They think of
plastics as the stuff that drifts on to beaches, floats into trees
and blows about in gutters. For over a decade, they have lobbied to
curb the use of plastic and replace it with more natural materials.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s American environmentalists won a famous
victory when McDonald's, in the face of a vociferous campaign,
decided to replace the polystyrene ``clamshells'' in which it
served hamburgers with wraps made mainly of paper.
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught led plastics companies to develop elaborate
recycling schemes and ``biodegradable'' versions of the material.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, properly used, plastic may do less environmental harm
than the materials it so often replaces.
</P>
<P>
   That environmentalists should worry about plastic is
understandable enough. It has been the fastest growing kind of
domestic trash. It is difficult to recycle, mainly because of the
problem of separating the different polymers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plastics industry strenuously tries to think of
things to turn mixed plastics into, such as park benches, the
result is usually nastier than the unrecycled product. And the
increase in the use of plastics often supplants other materials
which are easier to recycle.
</P>
<P>
   One instance is the soft-drinks container: half the material in
aluminium cans in the United States has been used at least once
before, whereas the plastic used in drinks bottles is generally
making its first appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The car is another example. The rise of the mini-mill has
provided an efficient market for the steel in a car hulk. That
happy coincidence disposed of Richard Nixon's nightmare of an
America disappearing under old automobile carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   As cars contain an ever higher proportion of plastic, they also
become more expensive to recycle at the end of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike paper, the stuff does not easily rot. Hence the race to
find biodegradable plastics that can be composted. But rotting is
not what most trash, plastic or otherwise, does these days, if it
ends up in a well-run landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists who excavate modern trash dumps find newspapers
and corncobs discarded two or three generations ago, still
perfectly preserved. A dump protected from leaking into the air or
water will preserve all sorts of detritus for posterity as
efficiently as the British Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Plastics demonstrate one of the great conundrums of
environmentalism: sometimes, the pursuit of one goal comes at the
cost of another.
</P>
<P>
   Because plastics are light relative to their strength, they
frequently allow energy to be saved. The use of plastics in car
bodies has reduced the growth in demand for fuel; so has the use of
plastic rather than glass containers to carry food and drink.
</P>
<P>
   In landfills, plastics take up much less space than paper. Even
in the wasteful United States, plastics account for about 13
percent of municipal waste after recycling, paper for 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to reduce the pressure on city dumps would be to
ration newsprint, not wrappings.
</P>
<P>
   If environmentalists are to love plastics, though, the industry
must do more than brag of its green credentials. It must work with
governments to keep its products off the streets _ not to mention
beaches and verges.
</P>
<P>
   Making good products is important. So is using them
responsibly. &QL;

IT'S RECRUITING SEASON FOR THE MASSCAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Believe it or not, it's time to take a look at the $600,000
Massachusetts Handicap. New England's richest race won't be run
until June 3 at Suffolk Downs, but the field will actually begin to
take shape in less than two weeks, when vice president Lou Raffetto
makes his annual recruiting trip to Florida. Now there's a warm
thought on a cold day.
</P>
<P>
   Raffetto will leave Feb. 1 and point his pitch toward trainers
gearing up horses for the Donn Handicap Feb. 5, the first major
test in the East. Raffetto then will travel to California for the
Santa Anita Handicap March 4. His two big outings in the past have
been so successful that he has been able to lure standouts such as
Cigar (twice), Skip Away (twice), and Behrens to Suffolk.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there is great interest in Horse Chestnut, the Triple
Crown winner in South Africa, who came to America and looked strong
winning the Broward Handicap at Gulfstream Park Jan. 8. Horse
Chestnut will race next in the Donn, and Raffetto is planning a
meeting with his trainer, Michael De Kock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be looking at the South African horse, he was
very impressive,'' said Raffetto. ``If the Dubai World Cup (March
25) is on his schedule, maybe we can work something out, as we did
with Cigar's people. The MassCap could be his first race after he
rests from Dubai.''
</P>
<P>
   Raffetto will concentrate much of his efforts on Payson Park, a
training center 90 miles from Gulfstream. Trainers Elliot Walden,
Bill Mott, and Jim Bond all stable there over the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walden has Ecton Park and Menifee, Mott has Unbridled Jet and
Vision And Verse, and Bond has Behrens and Pleasant Breeze,'' said
Raffetto. ``Other trainers I hope to talk to are Mark Henig, who
has taken over the training of Almutawakel, and Randy Schulhoefer,
who is training Lemon Drop Kid for his father.''
</P>
<P>
   On Raffetto's list for the California trip are Bob Baffert, who
has General Challenge and Real Quiet (third in last year's
MassCap), Richard Mandella, who has Puerto Madero, and D. Wayne
Lukas, who has Breeders' Cup Classic winner Cat Thief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who could have imagined that we would attract such big names
when we started out?'' said Raffetto. ``It's taken a lot of work
and a lot of luck to go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A warm return
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Rudy Baez visited frigid Suffolk Saturday, the first time
he has been at a racetrack since he suffered a paralyzing injury at
Rockingham Park Aug. 4. Baez was surrounded by family and friends
as he watched the races from the Terrace dining room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be back,'' said Baez. ``I am just having a good
time and enjoying myself. I was lucky that the jockeys decided to
ride today. Those guys are tough.''
</P>
<P>
   While at the track, Baez received a call from top California
rider Kent Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was real nice of him,'' said Baez. ``He told me to hang in
there, and that he wished me luck. It's nice to talk to guys like
that and see that they care.''
</P>
<P>

   `Thief' was caught

<P>
   Cat Thief, who seldom wins but is often in the money, finished
second in Saturday's $300,000 San Fernando Breeders' Cup at Santa
Anita. It was the second time he has lost since winning the $4
million Classic (third in the Mailbu Dec. 26). Cat Thief's record
in 1999 was 13-2-3-5, and while it was no surprise that he was
beaten, it was startling that the winner turned out to be 24-1 shot
($50.60 to win) Saint's Honor. Basically an allowance horse,
Saint's Honor stormed through the lane under Desormeaux to prevail
by 1 1/2 lengths. The time for the mile and one-16th was 1:41 4/5.
Cat Thief, the 3-2 choice with Pat Day, was caught in traffic
turning for home, but got up in time to nip 38-1 shot Mr. Broad
Blade and Pat Valenzuela by a head . . . Greenwood Lake, winner of
the Champagne and Remsen last season, also went down to defeat
Saturday, finishing sixth in the $100,000 Holy Bull Stakes at
Gulfstream. Greenwood Lake is a lagger, and Gulfstream favors
front-runners, but the 3-year-old son of Meadowlake was far back at
all times under Jean-Luc Samyn. The winner was Hal's Hope, a 40-1
shot ($82.40), who went wire to wire with Roger Valez, tallying by
better than 5 lengths. The time for the mile and one-16th was 1:44
2/5. ``Greenwood Lake just didn't grab the track,'' said Samyn.
``He warmed up well, but he just couldn't get a hold of the
surface.'' . . . The Godolphin Stable of Dubai took its first shot
at the Kentucky Derby last year and failed when Worldly Manner
tired turning for home. Last week, Godolphin proved it was even
more serious this year by purchasing Chief Seattle, the No. 1 Derby
contender on many lists. Godolphin bought the son of Seattle Slew
from William Bets and Philip Needham for an undisclosed sum. Chief
Seattle will be shipped to Dubai, but you can bet that, barring
injury, he'll be back for the Derby. ``We'll see how he settles in
when he reaches Dubai before deciding on a program for this year,''
said Godolphin racing manager Simon Crisford.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``You don't understand the role of the president of
the United States.'' Thus John McCain, the Republican front-runner
in New Hampshire, to George W. Bush, the favorite nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The charge is the sort of rhetorical exaggeration that comes
from campaigning. But it is instructive all the same.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the contrasts of temperament, and gender preference
(women prefer Bush by 17 percentage points; men prefer McCain by 14
points), the campaign has thrown up fundamental differences not
just over policy, but over how the two men make policy, and how
they might therefore govern as president.
</P>
<P>
   These differences have been dramatized by their tax plans. This
week, McCain unveiled a cut that is surprisingly modest by
Republican standards: $240 billion over five years, half Bush's
promised $483 billion reduction over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as befits a crusader against special interests,
McCain's cut would be partly financed by closing $150 billion in
corporate tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between this approach and Bush's has reopened an
old division in Republican ranks between tax-slashing supply-siders
and what used to be called ``green-eyeshade Republicans'' _ fiscal
conservatives concerned about balancing the budget.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when tax cuts are losing some of their appeal, McCain
seems to be trying to reverse 20 years of supply-side dominance in
his party.
</P>
<P>
   Policies, of course, change all the time. For a president, it is
just as important to know how people make policy. The tax debate
has revealed something about this too _ partly inadvertently.
</P>
<P>
   The weeks of campaigning have shown McCain to be an improviser,
relying on his instincts as much as on a small team of little-known
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   When he first started outlining his tax proposals, he seemed not
to know the details of the so-called ``marriage penalty'' or the
earned-income tax credit. Even now, it is unclear which corporate
loopholes will be closed completely.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when he first released details of his health-care
plan, most of the figures turned out to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Had Bush stumbled in this way, he would have been torn apart by
the press. But in contrast to McCain, he has gathered a huge team
of Republicans, the best and the brightest, and used their
expertise to present his policies as a carefully thought-through
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in a series of speeches, Bush not only went into
detail on his education, welfare and tax proposals but also tried
to show how they fit together under the umbrella of ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that between a commander-in-chief, setting the
broad aims of policy but making up the details as he goes along,
and a chairman of the board, using teams of advisers to think
through issues in fine detail. One is not necessarily better than
the other.
</P>
<P>
   It is a common political distinction. But if carried through to
the White House, the contrasting tendencies would produce very
different styles of government.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is likely to favor a more collegiate, cabinet-dominated
style, while McCain would presumably act, in the words of Bob
Packwood, a McCain supporter and former senator from Oregon, as
``his own chief of staff.''
</P>
<P>
   The two differ not only on individual policies but also on their
range of interests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a traditional broad Republican agenda. In contrast,
McCain seems like a two-trick pony. On foreign affairs, he has more
expertise than almost anyone else in the race. But in his domestic
policy, all roads lead to campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   Asked a question about almost any issue, he tends to reply, in
effect: ``My friends, we can't improve our schools (or the Army, or
Social Security, or Medicare) unless we get special interests out
of politics. That means changing our system of campaign finance.''
</P>
<P>
   The message has strong electoral appeal. It acts as an
organizing principle to explain his candidacy and has merits in its
own right. Yet the claim that campaign-finance reform will
transform the prospects for other policy changes in America seems
hugely exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of the Social Security or Medicare systems are
rooted in many things, notably demography; special interests play
only a secondary role.
</P>
<P>
   Hyping up campaign reform therefore poses a risk for McCain. If
he were to become president, and the reform were shot down (as
seems likely, on past experience), the organizing principle of his
presidency would be wrecked at the start.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it were passed, it would not make much difference to
other intractable policy problems. Either way, a sense of
disappointment would be inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's traditional broad approach is not subject to the same
risks.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are also offering different approaches to the vital
question of dealing with Congress. Bush is the favorite of the
Republican establishment, backed by the vast majority of the
party's congressmen, senators and state governors; in his own
state, he commands near-universal support, even among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, McCain inspires distrust even in his own party. But
he does command the support of many independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As Oscar Wilde said of Bernard Shaw, he hasn't an enemy in the
world and none of his friends like him. This may not matter that
much.
</P>
<P>
   Packwood argues that if McCain were nominated, it would be
amazing how quickly his colleagues would discover they were friends
after all.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Chuck Hagel, one of his few Senate supporters, argues
that after 17 years there McCain would be better equipped than most
to deal with Congress. At least he knows how it works.
</P>
<P>
   All this is no doubt true, but even McCain's supporters concede
that, to build support there, he would have to rely heavily on
Democrats (as he has done over campaign-finance reform). He would
also be likely to use Reagan's tactic of appealing direct to voters
to put pressure on Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, to judge by his record in Texas, Bush would adopt
the traditional strategy of uniting his own party first and then
attracting a few centrist Democrats to plump out the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   He is by preference a deal-maker, and has used his skills in his
home state to push large tax cuts and education reform through the
legislature; though admittedly it is not clear how his experience
in Texas (where the legislature meets for only four months every
two years) will translate to the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at a time of prosperity, and in a Congress where neither
party is likely to command a big majority, Bush's deal-making
skills would seem more effective than McCain's solitary style of
leadership _ unless he gets an overwhelming mandate for change at
the polls. &QL;

<P>
   CHICAGO _ January should be a quiet time for Midwestern farmers.
Instead, they find themselves facing one of the hardest farming
decisions of the year: should they risk putting genetically
modified (GM) crops in the ground, or not?
</P>
<P>
   For some, the agronomics are easy; they believe that GM products
expand yields and lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   But if American consumers were to become suddenly concerned
about ``Frankenstein foods,'' as some Asians and Europeans already
have, then, come the autumn, farmers may be sitting on a bountiful
harvest that has lost much of its value.
</P>
<P>
   For a farmer like Darl Baumgardner, who grows maize (corn) and
soybeans in Illinois, there is much to like about GM crops.
</P>
<P>
   Bt corn, for example, uses a gene derived from a soil bacterium,
Bacillus thuringiensis, to make the whole corn plant toxic to the
corn-borer, a caterpillar that drills into the corn cob and
destroys the crop.
</P>
<P>
   Herbicide-resistant soybeans are engineered to be immune to a
powerful herbicide that will kill all other vegetation on the
cropland, making it easier for farmers to get rid of weeds.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it is hardly surprising that the percentage of
American soybean acreage planted with GM soybeans grew to over 50
percent in the four years after commercial introduction, an
adoption rate nearly twice as fast as that for the most dominant
agricultural technology of the past, hybrid corn.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Kalaitzandonakes, a professor of agribusiness at the
University of Missouri who has done those calculations, also
reckons that the benefits to farmers of GM soybean technology alone
were in the order of $400 million-$1 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   When your correspondent drove into the heartland two years ago,
farmers were effusive about the potential of biotechnology.
Consumers, particularly those outside the United States, have not
been so keen on the idea.
</P>
<P>
   There is no credible evidence yet that GM foods present a health
risk to consumers. But the European Union has withheld approval of
some GM crop varieties until exhaustive trials are done, and many
Europeans have decided that they would rather not buy those
products that have been approved. Some large supermarket chains
have refused to stock the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The EU allows GM soybeans, but it is increasingly looking to
non-GM suppliers, such as Brazil, and to alternative ingredients.
As a result, American soybean exports to the EU have plunged from
398 million bushels in 1997-98 to an estimated 221 million bushels
in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wisner, an Iowa State University economist, reckons this is
the equivalent of losing a market for one out of every three
bushels of soybeans grown in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the problem just in Europe. Both Japan and Korea have
announced plans to begin labelling certain GM commodities
(unprocessed corn and soybeans) in the spring of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Japanese soy-sauce manufacturer announced in
December that it would use non-GM soybeans in the future.
</P>
<P>
   South of the border, Mexico's largest tortilla maker has
announced that it will no longer purchase GM corn.
</P>
<P>
   American farmers find all this terribly frustrating. Hysteria,
they say, has replaced science. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Seed companies, such as Monsanto, have been ineffective in
defending their new technology; some governments are using the
biotechnology issue as an excuse for protectionism;
environmentalists are attacking GM products even though some of
them reduce the need for conventional pesticides and herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   But only one pressure group really matters to farmers. When it
comes to deciding what to plant this spring, ``the consumer is
king,'' says Neil Harl, an agricultural economist at Iowa State
University.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest consumer of all, both literally and figuratively, is
American.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is no evidence of a widespread backlash in the
United States against GM products. (Although ``organic'' standards
in America are supposed to exclude GM products, one organic food
store in Washington, D.C., happily offers fruit and vegetables
``grown without pesticides'' which, in fact, have been genetically
modified not to need them.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are small signs that should give farmers pause. In
November, a bill was introduced in Congress that would require
labelling for GM products.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue Chicken, one of America's largest poultry producers, is
positioning itself not to use any GM feed, says Harl. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A farmer with a crop six weeks in the ground may well fear that
he will wake up and read that a large American fast-food company
will no longer buy beef that has been fed GM corn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the crop's in the ground, you know, you can't back it
up,'' says Roger Janssen, an Illinois seed dealer: you are stuck
with it, like it or not. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Farmers bear the bulk of the risk as consumers sort out what
they want. Food processors do not have to commit themselves to a
price until the crop comes in.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Archer Daniels Midland, one of America's largest
food-processing firms, says the market is a ``moving target.''
</P>
<P>
   Cargill said in a December letter that it will buy whatever
American farmers grow this year, but noted that premiums may be
paid ``for identity-preserved grains and oilseeds (i.e., any grains
and oilseeds that have been handled separately from the bulk) that
meet specific customer requirements.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With farm prices at historic lows, the premium paid for growing
the right crop might mean the difference between making money and
not making money (or between losing a little money and losing a
lot).
</P>
<P>
   Baumgardner says his GM corn yielded 30 more bushels per acre
last year than the non-GM corn he planted. Still, he plans to trim
his GM corn this year from 70 percent of his acreage to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tamara White, director of commodities for the Illinois Farm
Bureau, travels around the state discussing the issue with farmers.
``Each week more people are deciding that they're not going to risk
it,'' she says. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American Corn Growers Association has predicted a 20-25
percent reduction in GM corn acreage. But picking the right crop to
grow is only the beginning of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to say, `We want all GMO-free products.' It's
another thing to deliver,'' says Baumgardner.
</P>
<P>
   All crops, conventional or GM, contaminate one another. Pollen
can drift a quarter of a mile or more; one farmer's GM crop can
cross-pollinate his neighbor's.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers selling non-GM grains are asked to certify the purity of
their product at the point of sale; they fear being held liable for
grain contaminated in storage, in transit, or at other points in
the supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   The only solution is testing for purity at every point in the
supply chain, says Harl. Even then, some level of impurity must be
tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Experts reckon a 5 percent tolerance for contamination is
feasible; the 1 percent level discussed in the EU, or the 0.1
percent level under discussion in Congress and among certain
European retail groups, may be too costly. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,275) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One possible result is that the current generation of GM
products will be driven off the farm, not because they are unsafe
or ineffective but because the costs of segregating them are too
high.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation may fare differently. By then, GM crops may
well have properties (say, medical, nutritional, or even
industrial) that will be of greater interest to consumers, and the
cost of segregating them could be passed on in the final price.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Baumgardner and his colleagues will just have to
hang on. &QL;

   For a farmer like Darl Baumgardner, who grows maize (corn) and
soybeans in Illinois, there is much to like about GM crops.
</P>
<P>
   Bt corn, for example, uses a gene derived from a soil bacterium,
Bacillus thuringiensis, to make the whole corn plant toxic to the
corn-borer, a caterpillar that drills into the corn cob and
destroys the crop.
</P>
<P>
   Herbicide-resistant soybeans are engineered to be immune to a
powerful herbicide that will kill all other vegetation on the
cropland, making it easier for farmers to get rid of weeds.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it is hardly surprising that the percentage of
American soybean acreage planted with GM soybeans grew to over 50
percent in the four years after commercial introduction, an
adoption rate nearly twice as fast as that for the most dominant
agricultural technology of the past, hybrid corn.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Kalaitzandonakes, a professor of agribusiness at the
University of Missouri who has done those calculations, also
reckons that the benefits to farmers of GM soybean technology alone
were in the order of $400 million-$1 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   When your correspondent drove into the heartland two years ago,
farmers were effusive about the potential of biotechnology.
Consumers, particularly those outside the United States, have not
been so keen on the idea.
</P>
<P>
   There is no credible evidence yet that GM foods present a health
risk to consumers. But the European Union has withheld approval of
some GM crop varieties until exhaustive trials are done, and many
Europeans have decided that they would rather not buy those
products that have been approved. Some large supermarket chains
have refused to stock the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The EU allows GM soybeans, but it is increasingly looking to
non-GM suppliers, such as Brazil, and to alternative ingredients.
As a result, American soybean exports to the EU have plunged from
398 million bushels in 1997-98 to an estimated 221 million bushels
in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wisner, an Iowa State University economist, reckons this is
the equivalent of losing a market for one out of every three
bushels of soybeans grown in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the problem just in Europe. Both Japan and Korea have
announced plans to begin labelling certain GM commodities
(unprocessed corn and soybeans) in the spring of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Japanese soy-sauce manufacturer announced in
December that it would use non-GM soybeans in the future.
</P>
<P>
   South of the border, Mexico's largest tortilla maker has
announced that it will no longer purchase GM corn.
</P>
<P>
   American farmers find all this terribly frustrating. Hysteria,
they say, has replaced science. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Seed companies, such as Monsanto, have been ineffective in
defending their new technology; some governments are using the
biotechnology issue as an excuse for protectionism;
environmentalists are attacking GM products even though some of
them reduce the need for conventional pesticides and herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   But only one pressure group really matters to farmers. When it
comes to deciding what to plant this spring, ``the consumer is
king,'' says Neil Harl, an agricultural economist at Iowa State
University.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest consumer of all, both literally and figuratively, is
American.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is no evidence of a widespread backlash in the
United States against GM products. (Although ``organic'' standards
in America are supposed to exclude GM products, one organic food
store in Washington, D.C., happily offers fruit and vegetables
``grown without pesticides'' which, in fact, have been genetically
modified not to need them.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are small signs that should give farmers pause. In
November, a bill was introduced in Congress that would require
labelling for GM products.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue Chicken, one of America's largest poultry producers, is
positioning itself not to use any GM feed, says Harl. &QL;

<P>
   A farmer with a crop six weeks in the ground may well fear that
he will wake up and read that a large American fast-food company
will no longer buy beef that has been fed GM corn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the crop's in the ground, you know, you can't back it
up,'' says Roger Janssen, an Illinois seed dealer: you are stuck
with it, like it or not. &QL;

   Farmers bear the bulk of the risk as consumers sort out what
they want. Food processors do not have to commit themselves to a
price until the crop comes in.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Archer Daniels Midland, one of America's largest
food-processing firms, says the market is a ``moving target.''
</P>
<P>
   Cargill said in a December letter that it will buy whatever
American farmers grow this year, but noted that premiums may be
paid ``for identity-preserved grains and oilseeds (i.e., any grains
and oilseeds that have been handled separately from the bulk) that
meet specific customer requirements.'' &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   With farm prices at historic lows, the premium paid for growing
the right crop might mean the difference between making money and
not making money (or between losing a little money and losing a
lot).
</P>
<P>
   Baumgardner says his GM corn yielded 30 more bushels per acre
last year than the non-GM corn he planted. Still, he plans to trim
his GM corn this year from 70 percent of his acreage to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tamara White, director of commodities for the Illinois Farm
Bureau, travels around the state discussing the issue with farmers.
``Each week more people are deciding that they're not going to risk
it,'' she says. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The American Corn Growers Association has predicted a 20-25
percent reduction in GM corn acreage. But picking the right crop to
grow is only the beginning of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to say, `We want all GMO-free products.' It's
another thing to deliver,'' says Baumgardner.
</P>
<P>
   All crops, conventional or GM, contaminate one another. Pollen
can drift a quarter of a mile or more; one farmer's GM crop can
cross-pollinate his neighbor's.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers selling non-GM grains are asked to certify the purity of
their product at the point of sale; they fear being held liable for
grain contaminated in storage, in transit, or at other points in
the supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   The only solution is testing for purity at every point in the
supply chain, says Harl. Even then, some level of impurity must be
tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Experts reckon a 5 percent tolerance for contamination is
feasible; the 1 percent level discussed in the EU, or the 0.1
percent level under discussion in Congress and among certain
European retail groups, may be too costly. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,275) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One possible result is that the current generation of GM
products will be driven off the farm, not because they are unsafe
or ineffective but because the costs of segregating them are too
high.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation may fare differently. By then, GM crops may
well have properties (say, medical, nutritional, or even
industrial) that will be of greater interest to consumers, and the
cost of segregating them could be passed on in the final price.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Baumgardner and his colleagues will just have to
hang on. &QL;

<P>
   PARIS _ Imperious, opaque and unforgiving, the Michelin Guide
seems hopelessly out of touch with the times. Yet the plump red
book with Michelin's mascot emblazoned on the cover turns 100 this
year with its status as the gastronomic world's bible firmly
intact.
</P>
<P>
   While rival guides appear regularly, none has yet been able to
generate anything like the frisson of excitement that greets
Michelin's annual arrival _ scheduled this year for Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, as always, champagne will flow in some French
kitchens while souffles fall in others.
</P>
<P>
   The power of Michelin's coveted stars, first introduced in 1926,
to make or break culinary reputations is undiminished.
Restaurateurs who reach the top of the Michelin pecking order (a
three-star rating) live in fear of falling off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure gets much worse once you earn the third star
because people then expect perfection,'' says Jean-Claude Vrinat,
the owner of Taillevent, a three-star establishment since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He reckons the loss of its third star would reduce Taillevent's
turnover by as much as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of a third star caused little less than a national
sensation in 1997, the year that Alain Ducasse, who already had
three stars to his name at Monte Carlo's Louis XV restaurant, was
pursuing the same distinction at the eponymous restaurant he had
recently opened in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   To the shock of peers and fans alike, Ducasse received top
honors for his new venture but was stripped of a star in Monte
Carlo. No reason was given for the lower mark; the guide never
explains its actions.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a short list of specialities and a range of prices,
restaurants are described only in terms of stars and crossed
utensils (a measure of service and ambience).
</P>
<P>
   Ask how many inspectors the guide employs and you are told, ``A
certain number.'' Are there women among them? ``Some.''
</P>
<P>
   And how often will Michelin call on a restaurant before
assigning it a grade? To which the reply is that favorite French
conversation stopper, ``Ca depend.''
</P>
<P>
   A few scraps are thrown to the curious: all inspectors are said
to be drawn from the hospitality industry, all work full-time for
Michelin, and all are required to have both refined palates and
discreet tongues.
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy is paramount: each inspector dines alone and
anonymously, pays just one visit to a restaurant, and is rotated
from region to region every several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Michelin's reticence gives its critics fits. In their view, its
refusal to shed light on its decisions suggests a smug contempt for
the dining public.
</P>
<P>
   There are other gripes too: the guide is considered slow to
acknowledge new restaurants and trends; its inspectors are thought
to be partial to plush settings, obliging proprietors to spend
lavish sums of money on decoration and pushing up prices; and it
allegedly saves its highest praise for restaurants turning out
classical preparations _ ``la cuisine de musee'' as it is
derisively known _ discouraging chefs from experimenting and
stifling creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Few of these claims, however, stand up to close scrutiny. For a
start, given the ingredients that typically adorn a three-star menu
_ foie gras, caviar, the finest fish and the choicest cuts of meat
_ eating at a top-rated establishment would empty most wallets
regardless of the setting.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, people who are prepared to fork out hundreds
of dollars for lunch or dinner expect their surroundings to be at
least as sumptuous as their food.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there much evidence that the guide is keeping French food
tethered to the past. Taillevent, a temple of traditional cooking
in Paris, boasts three stars, but so does the exuberantly eclectic
chef, Pierre Gagnaire.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1997, the guide awarded three stars to the country
bumpkin of haute cuisine, Michel Bras, who among other things
encourages guests at his remote restaurant in southwestern France
to use the same knife and fork throughout the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Michelin also does an able job keeping tabs on the shifting food
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the growing appetite for ethnic fare, particularly in
Paris, it has ladled out stars to Vietnamese, Chinese, and North
African restaurants. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it no longer limits itself to France. It now issues
guides to a dozen European countries, and while its annual ratings
may not inspire quite the same feverish speculation in Pisa as they
do in Paris, Michelin stars, wherever bestowed, shine in food
circles like a well-glazed sweetmeat.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the three stars awarded to El Bulli, for
example, would bon vivants be flocking to Spain's Costa Brava to
sample the comically unorthodox dishes of chef Ferran Adria, dubbed
``the Salvador Dali of the kitchen?'' Unlikely. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 975) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A high mark from Michelin, however, is no longer the guarantee
of commercial success that it once was. Although there are
currently 21 three-star restaurants in France, the most that there
have ever been, many of them are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Gagnaire, for example, is on his second set of three stars; he
was forced to give up the first trio when his restaurant in St.
Etienne went bankrupt in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   More telling still is the drop in France's overall number of
starred eateries. In 1984, there were 642; last year, just 500.
</P>
<P>
   Falling standards in the kitchen are partly to blame; but a
bigger factor has been France's economic malaise. While a strong
international clientele helps keep most three-stars afloat, one-
and two-star establishments play mainly to the home audience. And
many French diners have recently had neither the money nor the
inclination to splurge on fancy meals.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the belt-tightening, last year Michelin
introduced a new category, ``Bib Gourmand,'' consisting of
restaurants that offer good meals and good value.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the guide thrives by subtly reflecting the shifting
fortunes of France herself. &QL;

KIWI: A FINE NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTOROHANGA, New Zealand _ It isn't every day in New Zealand that
you can walk into the living room of the national symbol. Are we
dressed for the occasion? Is this an acceptable time? Will it
disdainfully give us the cold-feathered shoulder?
</P>
<P>
   Don't be nervous, says the guard. Shorts, T-shirt, and sneakers
are perfectly presentable guest attire. But no photographs, please.
</P>
<P>
   After all, New Zealand is a pretty relaxed, informal place. The
most celebrated citizen, explorer Sir Edmund Hillary _ he who made
Mount Everest seem like a walk in a chilly park in 1953 _ is listed
in the Auckland phone book. Of course, he isn't the national
symbol. If he were, the natives would call themselves Hillarys.
Maybe Eds.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they are known as Kiwis. Their nom de plumage is the way
the populace happily pays respect to a rare, cherished bird, the
kiwi, flightless figurehead of a nation. A bird unable to imagine
getting as high as Hillary, or even a foot or two in the air. Other
countries have winged symbols, but do Americans refer to themselves
as Eagles, or Chinese as Peking Ducks?
</P>
<P>
   Found only in this country (and seldom found at all), kiwis are
carefully protected and cared for. Security is tight. No armed
guards, you understand, or metal detectors when you enter the Kiwi
House in this small North Island town, Otorohanga. But, crossing
the threshold, you can feel the presence of a respected presence. I
haven't been so awed since meeting a songbird named Grace Slick of
the since-extinct Jefferson Airplane, a symbol of the '60s. One of
her tunes, ``Somebody to Love,'' would have described Kiwis'
feeling for kiwis.
</P>
<P>
   But it's mostly spiritual, and at a distance. Kiwis, secretive,
nocturnally Garboesque groundlings, treasure their privacy. They
hide out during the daytime in wilderness abodes. Lucky is the
infrequent person who sights one on its own turf. Once, about 2
a.m., I think I heard one wail like Slick, but briefly on Great
Barrier Island, a sparsely inhabited chunk of forests and mountains
about 50 miles off Auckland. At least it was identified as
kiwi-croon by a resident, Nicole Wineland-Thomson.
</P>
<P>
   Another Kiwi, friend Steve McIvor, said that a number of
contrived kiwi habitats, such as this, are located throughout the
country, ``but Otorohanga is the best to see, with the most birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, it's close to Te Awamutu, known as the `Rose Town of
New Zealand.' Also revered as the hometown of the Finn brothers,
Neil and Tim, of our most famous rock bands. Split Enz, then
Crowded House. Surely you remember their hit, `Can I Have Another
Piece of Chocolate Cake?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Uh . . . sounds devilishly tasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roses are fabulous,'' McIvor underlined, ``and, unlike the
kiwis, you can get close enough to smell 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gertrude Stein had visited Te Awamutu, the rock-and-rose
town, she mightn't have asserted, ``A rose is a rose is a rose.''
Those of the town's aromatic public garden, about 2,000 of them,
bloom tall and distinctively, each raising an intricately
expressive, gorgeous face. The startlingly lusty hues _ scarlets,
tangerines, cerise, lemon, purple, lavender, on and on _ defy a
color chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aphrodisiacal!'' proclaimed a fellow sniffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty, too,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   When they're not in bloom, a striking mural of the garden on the
public toilet building across the street preserves their best
appearance. A hundred yards away is one of New Zealand's first
churches, shingle-steepled, white frame St. John's, opened in 1854.
Curious-looking footprints on the ceiling are said to be those of
angels who inspired the carpenters. Logical, since angels have been
partial to carpenters for a couple of millenniums.
</P>
<P>
   Otorohanga's kiwis probably wouldn't like rock, roses, or
Anglican hymns. They prefer a quiet, somber, even gloomy atmosphere
such as has been created for them in their living room behind
glass. Ushering us in at noon, Susan Hancock, a keeper, says,
``You've come at the right time. Feeding time. They're up and awake
only about four hours, and sleep the other 20.''
</P>
<P>
   The darkened, temperature-controlled environment is gradually
illuminated by simulated moonlight, revealing a drab setting of
trees, brush, and dirt floor that 28 kiwis share with other
domestic birds called keas and kakas. The kiwis are moonies,
attracted to the silvery rays. Rise and shine. Sort of like
moonstruck vampires, they emerge from casket beds, stretch their
legs, shake hungry bellies.
</P>
<P>
   They are built like footballs, waddling in grayish brown coats
and the style of Groucho Marx on short, bent legs. Their long,
hooked beaks, seeming out of place on such small bodies, are
designed for digging up worms. Through a door into the living room
goes another keeper, hip-booted Louise Brady, spreading joy and
sustenance with a meal of worms and a vitamin concoction that is
good for the hearts of the housebound.
</P>
<P>
   Chow time. They peck away wholeheartedly, females
indistinguishable from males except vocally. The females utter a
throat-clearing rasp; the males cry out piercingly in a voice that
I'd heard on Great Barrier Island.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the guys are loud-mouthed showoffs. ``Typical,'' says
a woman squiring three children. ``They probably drink a lot of
beer, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The kiwis, responsible little patriots, have spawned a cottage
industry to help pay for their upkeep. The gift shop is filled with
kiwi kitsch, such as replicas of the birds in a variety of
substances including chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting time doesn't last long. Of course, we don't want to
keep them up past bedtime. The moon goes off, and so do we, pleased
to have had an audience, if impersonal, with the national symbol
that has done so much for its country. Someday, maybe, the country
can do something progressive for the kiwis _ like teaching them to
fly.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anyone who has ever hired a builder knows that even
the simplest job tends to be plagued by cost overruns and delays.
And the bigger the project, the bigger the problems: according to
one estimate, inefficiencies, mistakes and delays account for $200
billion of the $650 billion spent on construction in America every
year.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why. A building project, whether it is a hotel
or a cement plant, involves dozens of businesses _ architects,
engineers, material suppliers _ working together for month or
years. Each project entails thousands of transactions, all of them
currently recorded on paper.
</P>
<P>
   A typical $100 million building project generates 150,000
separate documents: technical drawings, legal contracts, purchase
orders, requests for information and schedules. Project managers
build warehouses just to store them.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Express reputedly garnered $500 million last year just
shipping blueprints across America.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, construction is a slow affair, regularly held up by
building regulations, stroppy unions and bad weather. Owners,
architects and engineers must physically visit sites.
</P>
<P>
   With everything still done by fax or telephone, requests for the
size of a roof tile can take weeks and seemingly minor changes can
lead to long delays as bits of paper wind through approval
processes.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, mistakes are common. Wrong supplies arrive and bills
go unpaid. Given onerous shipping costs and the high value of
commercial contracts, mistakes matter. Building is one of the
world's most litigious industries.
</P>
<P>
   Help is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   A group of new business-to-business companies plan to turn all
construction into an efficient virtual process.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Magana, chief executive of Bidcom, says his company
creates a separate Web site for every building project for clients
including the city of San Francisco, The Gap and General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone involved from the architect to the carpenters can then
have access to this site to check blueprints and orders, change
specifications and agree delivery dates. Moreover, everything from
due dates to material specifications is permanently recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Clients love this approach. Harlan Kelly, city engineer at the
city of San Francisco, says Bidcom has cut project time by six
months: ``We can do things quicker, faster and better and there are
fewer arguments about whether information has reached people.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Kuffner, Northern California business manager for
Swinerton &AMP; Walberg Builders, a large contractor, says that using
Bidcom has reduced by two-thirds the time needed to deal with
requests for information.
</P>
<P>
   Such endorsements have helped the group to attract some
blue-chip investors. On Jan. 11 Bidcom raised $46 million from,
among others, GE Capital, Oracle and Internet Capital Group, a
venture-capitalist group which owns 25 percent of the stock and is
likely to push for an early public offering.
</P>
<P>
   BuildNet _ which focuses on residential rather than commercial
construction and raised $105 million this month from investors
including Kaufman and Broad, America's biggest home builder _ takes
a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than set up Web sites for specific projects, its software
integrates the back-office systems of builders and suppliers, in
the same way that modern supermarkets and their suppliers are
linked.
</P>
<P>
   While there is some loss of flexibility _ a new supplier cannot
quickly be brought into a project _ efficiencies are potentially
huge as materials are delivered just in time and automatically,
cutting out human error and cost in the ordering process.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these companies aim to be much broader than mere
software providers. They are turning themselves into fully fledged
business-to-business Internet hubs that start by amassing content
(news, prices, gossip, job opportunities) tailored to their
industry, to draw buyers and sellers to their sites.
</P>
<P>
   Once enough are online to create liquidity, the hub turns into a
marketplace, cutting out traditional middlemen and taking a
commission from the transactions it hosts.
</P>
<P>
   The scale economies are potentially enormous. Mohanbir Sawhney,
professor of e-commerce at Kellogg School of Management and Steven
Kaplan, at the University of Chicago Business School, argue in a
recent article that the value created by business-to-business hubs,
where every buyer and seller can potentially link with every other,
vastly exceeds that of business-to-consumer models where there are
lots of buyers, but just one seller.
</P>
<P>
   The fragmented construction industry needs such a marketplace.
Unless people start living in virtual buildings, there will always
be plenty of bricks and mortar to trade. &QL;

<P>
   There is carnage in America's cinemas these days, and not all of
it is on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Having built far more cinemas in recent years than the market
can sustain, the big chains of movie theatres are leaking cash and
watching their share prices crash through the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are now swirling around the industry that one of the
companies is likely to file for Chapter 11. And, just as films
appear in Europe some time after they open in America, so the
industry's troubles threaten to cross over too.
</P>
<P>
   All good stories have a strong theme running through them. The
moral of this one is: beware the notion that big is better.
</P>
<P>
   While the business was riding high a couple of years ago, two
sorts of big were in vogue in the business: big companies and big
theatres.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinary old cinema was superseded during the second half of
the 1970s and the 1980s by the multiplex. Then, in the early 1990s,
the megaplex arrived. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 175) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Definitions are flexible, but multiplex tends to mean fewer than
15 screens, and mega more than 15; more importantly, however, mega
tends to have ``stadium seating'' _ arranged on steps, so the hat
in front does not obscure your view _ and digital sound.
</P>
<P>
   The theatre owners, who had been struggling to find ways to pep
up a slow business, were thrilled by the megaplex. They talk in
terms of how large an area a cinema can ``clear'' _ the radius of
the area that people will come from to your cinema to see a big
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Clearance zones have fallen from 15 miles (24 kilometers) in the
1960s to two or three miles now. But the first megaplexes, theatre
owners found, were clearing five-mile radiuses. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It looked as though cinemas had found their salvation. In their
enthusiasm for building new megaplexes, the theatre owners were
egged on by the shopping-mall operators.
</P>
<P>
   America's malls were having a hard time, and operators decided
that they needed ``anchor'' tenants, who would lure the crowds.
Movie theatres, everybody decided, were the thing; so the chains
were bribed to build.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Wall Street got into the theatre business.
``From a strategic financial point of view,'' says Marina Jacobson,
an analyst at Bear Sterns, ``movie theatres are attractive. They
have a huge free cash flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a buyout firm, started acquiring small
properties, and then in 1998 devised a plan with Hicks Muse Tate &AMP;
Furst to put together two of the biggest chains, Regal Cinemas and
United Artists, into one vast company.
</P>
<P>
   The United Artists deal fell through, but KKR and Hicks Muse
jointly bought Regal, stuck it together with other properties, and
created a 2,500-screen chain, making it the biggest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the buyout boys were not just acquiring a nice set of
accounts. There was a grand scheme behind these deals, too. The
financial firms reckoned that, by creating a big company, they
could reverse the traditional balance of power in movies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Hollywood screwing a fragmented theatre business, the
opposite would happen.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work out that way. For a start, the megaplex-building
went crazy. The first megaplexes, which produced such wonderful
figures, were built in the most promising markets. After that, the
returns diminished. Yet the building went on, because everybody
wanted a megaplex in the biggest markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got 30-plexes over the street from 20-plexes,'' says
Mike Patrick, chief executive of Carmike Cinemas, based in
Columbus, Ga., which is the third-largest chain.
</P>
<P>
   There was a problem with the biggest megaplexes, too. There were
not enough movies to fill them. At any one time there are around 14
movies doing business in America. That is enough to fill a
multiplex, or a small megaplex if you stick the popular films on a
couple of screens.
</P>
<P>
   The theory was that foreign films, which have never made much
headway in America, would fill the extra screens. It hasn't
happened. Patrick thinks it was a silly idea. ``If they didn't like
it before, why would they like it now?''
</P>
<P>
   As the number of screens has rocketed, so has the debt that the
cinema chains are carrying. Capacity utilization has fallen, all
four of the publicly-quoted chains lost money in their last full
recorded year, and their share prices have crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has consolidation shifted the balance of power from
Hollywood. Cinemas are paying as much for their movies as they ever
were.

Europeans have been building nearly as fast as over the past few

proportionately fewer screens than America does.

   There is carnage in America's cinemas these days, and not all of
it is on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Having built far more cinemas in recent years than the market
can sustain, the big chains of movie theatres are leaking cash and
watching their share prices crash through the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are now swirling around the industry that one of the
companies is likely to file for Chapter 11. And, just as films
appear in Europe some time after they open in America, so the
industry's troubles threaten to cross over too.
</P>
<P>
   All good stories have a strong theme running through them. The
moral of this one is: beware the notion that big is better.
</P>
<P>
   While the business was riding high a couple of years ago, two
sorts of big were in vogue in the business: big companies and big
theatres.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinary old cinema was superseded during the second half of
the 1970s and the 1980s by the multiplex. Then, in the early 1990s,
the megaplex arrived. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 175) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Definitions are flexible, but multiplex tends to mean fewer than
15 screens, and mega more than 15; more importantly, however, mega
tends to have ``stadium seating'' _ arranged on steps, so the hat
in front does not obscure your view _ and digital sound.
</P>
<P>
   The theatre owners, who had been struggling to find ways to pep
up a slow business, were thrilled by the megaplex. They talk in
terms of how large an area a cinema can ``clear'' _ the radius of
the area that people will come from to your cinema to see a big
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Clearance zones have fallen from 15 miles (24 kilometers) in the
1960s to two or three miles now. But the first megaplexes, theatre
owners found, were clearing five-mile radiuses. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It looked as though cinemas had found their salvation. In their
enthusiasm for building new megaplexes, the theatre owners were
egged on by the shopping-mall operators.
</P>
<P>
   America's malls were having a hard time, and operators decided
that they needed ``anchor'' tenants, who would lure the crowds.
Movie theatres, everybody decided, were the thing; so the chains
were bribed to build.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Wall Street got into the theatre business.
``From a strategic financial point of view,'' says Marina Jacobson,
an analyst at Bear Sterns, ``movie theatres are attractive. They
have a huge free cash flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a buyout firm, started acquiring small
properties, and then in 1998 devised a plan with Hicks Muse Tate &AMP;
Furst to put together two of the biggest chains, Regal Cinemas and
United Artists, into one vast company.
</P>
<P>
   The United Artists deal fell through, but KKR and Hicks Muse
jointly bought Regal, stuck it together with other properties, and
created a 2,500-screen chain, making it the biggest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the buyout boys were not just acquiring a nice set of
accounts. There was a grand scheme behind these deals, too. The
financial firms reckoned that, by creating a big company, they
could reverse the traditional balance of power in movies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Hollywood screwing a fragmented theatre business, the
opposite would happen.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work out that way. For a start, the megaplex-building
went crazy. The first megaplexes, which produced such wonderful
figures, were built in the most promising markets. After that, the
returns diminished. Yet the building went on, because everybody
wanted a megaplex in the biggest markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got 30-plexes over the street from 20-plexes,'' says
Mike Patrick, chief executive of Carmike Cinemas, based in
Columbus, Ga., which is the third-largest chain.
</P>
<P>
   There was a problem with the biggest megaplexes, too. There were
not enough movies to fill them. At any one time there are around 14
movies doing business in America. That is enough to fill a
multiplex, or a small megaplex if you stick the popular films on a
couple of screens.
</P>
<P>
   The theory was that foreign films, which have never made much
headway in America, would fill the extra screens. It hasn't
happened. Patrick thinks it was a silly idea. ``If they didn't like
it before, why would they like it now?''
</P>
<P>
   As the number of screens has rocketed, so has the debt that the
cinema chains are carrying. Capacity utilization has fallen, all
four of the publicly-quoted chains lost money in their last full
recorded year, and their share prices have crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has consolidation shifted the balance of power from
Hollywood. Cinemas are paying as much for their movies as they ever
were.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, an oversupplied market does not offer the best
conditions for testing the theory. But Chris Dixon, at Paine

STAYING HEALTHY IN THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Especially on a long flight, airplane air can be tough to take.
Germs may well be flying through the dry, recirculated air, and you
could begin your vacation with a cold or otherwise feel ill.
PassengerRights.com, a Web-based consumer organization, offers
these tips for staying healthy far above the ground:
</P>
<P>
   --Wash your hands with soap and hot water several times before,
during, and after your flight. Exta-careful passengers use a cloth
or paper towel to open the bathroom door because germs can be
passed on from the handle.
</P>
<P>
   --Douse a hanky or other cloth with water from a source you know
is good and cover your nose and mouth. Few may want to do this, but
it can add humidity to your lungs and prevent the spread of germs.
</P>
<P>
   --Dry cabin air can enlarge the teeny-tiny cracks in your
nostrils, making it easier for germs to creep in. Try coating the
inside of those nostrils with almond oil, olive oil, baroleum, or
other ointments.
</P>
<P>
   --Here's your chance to look like a doctor _ or perhaps Michael
Jackson: Wear a disposable surgeon's mask, available from
drugstores. Says PassengerRights.com: ``Maybe airlines will
eventually manufacture these masks with their logos.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of airlines: If you have had a problem with airline
ticket pricing or an experience involving overbooking, the US
Department of Transportation wants to hear about it, via
www.oig.dot.gov/bookjump.htm. That site also has a a link to a page
where you can share other airline experiences. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: What is the southernmost capital in the contiguous
48 states? (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: Badminton was first known as ``poona'' in India. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``A luxury resort is a place with tropical plants outside
and outstretched palms inside'' _ Anonymous. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: If you live in Maine and your Christmas
decorations are still up, you could be fined. Jan. 14 was the
removal deadline. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Well, you see, boss: St. Valentine's Day falls on a Monday this
year, so the White Barn Inn in Kennebunkport, Maine, has created an
appropriate two-night package for Feb. 13-14. Champagne and
chocolate-dipped berries will greet the couple upon arrival, a
long-stemmed rose will be placed on the pillow at turndown, and
dinner will be a romantic, four-course affair at the AAA Five
Diamond White Barn Inn Restaurant. And upon departure, guests will
receive a note on White Barn Inn stationery, explaining the guest's
absence and thanking the boss for his or her kind understanding.
(The inn does note, however, that the note is unlikely to be
accepted as a legitimate excuse ``unless one works for Cupid.'')
The package begins at $541 per couple. For more information, call
207-967-2321, visit www.whitebarninn.com, or e-mail
innkeepar(at)whitebarninn.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of romance: You and your spouse-to-be could be chosen
as one of 55 couples to be married on New York City's Top of the
World Trade Center Observatories in an individual, free ceremony.
To enter the enticingly named Make Love on Top of the World
Contest, send a letter telling why being married on top of the
world is the perfect ending to your courtship and the beginning of
the rest of your lives. You must be over 18 and have a New York
State marriage license. Send entries to Make Love on Top of the
World Contest, c/o Top of the World Trade Center Observatories,
2WTC, Suite 150, New York, NY 10048, or fax them to 212-323-2352,
attention of Make Love on Top of the World Contest. Entries must be
received by Feb. 12. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Advice to go: When visiting another country, check to see if
tipping is customary. Here's tip number 75 from the newest edition
of ``Going Abroad: 101 Tips (Plus) for Mature Travelers'': ``In
many countries, such as Singapore, China, and Tahiti, tipping is
frowned upon. In Japan and New Zealand, most tips are included in
the bill.'' The ``101 Tips'' guide is free from Grand Circle
Travel. For a copy, call 800-248-3737. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The naked truth: Donald Duck comics were once banned in Finland
because he doesn't wear pants. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mush! It's not too late to bid on a chance to ride along in
Alaska's famed Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. More than 80 mushers
are expected to sign up, race, and each will carry a winning bidder
for the first 11 miles of the 1,100- mile race. For more
information, call 907-566-7533 or visit www.iditarod.com. To bid,
check on the status of bids, or ask a specific question, call
800-566-SLED. The auction closes Jan. 28, and the race begins March
4. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Austin, Texas.

   SEATTLE _ Computer industry analysts and stock traders dithered
Friday. Does Bill Gates's move to the newly-created job of ``chief
software officer'' mean Microsoft is set for breakup, a merger with
some new media company, or simply tackling the challenge of
competing in the Internet-driven marketplace?
</P>
<P>
   For computer users, the more important question is: is this the
beginning of the end for Microsoft, or a rebirth of the 25-year-old
company?
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives insisted there were no Machiavellian plans,
that they expected neither a breakup or a merger, and their true
intent was to get Microsoft in shape for the challenges of
competing operating systems such as Linux, of wireless and handheld
devices and of emerging Internet-centered software systems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft does need to catch up fast there. Linux is used by a
growing number of companies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's operating system for handheld devices, WindowsCE, is
a poor third and losing touch in a fast-growing market. It has
struggled to make itself known in the wireless trade, forecast to
be huge in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Allen, Microsoft's co-founder, who has long since left the
company, said categorically: ``Anyone who thinks this is a reaction
to the lawsuit...is getting it completely wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's share price did nothing but rise following
Thursday's announcement, floating gently up in after-hours trading
then gaining a further two points in Friday morning's session to
around $110.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts saw Gates's decision to abandon the top slot in
favor of his deputy Steve Ballmer as a positive development. But
others wondered if the share price movement did not have more to do
with the anticipation of a corporate carve-up: if it followed the
telephone company AT&AMP;T, which was broken up in the 1980s, Microsoft
stockholders would end up even richer.
</P>
<P>
   It came at the end of a week of wild news development and even
wilder rumors.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday came the announcement of America Online's megamerger
with Time Warner; Wednesday brought whispers from the Justice
Department that it might split Microsoft into two or more pieces to
end its operating system monopoly, and late on Thursday came
Gates's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Cause and effect? Or an admission that Ballmer was a better
manager?
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists Gates will have plenty on his hands, trying to
control the work on Windows2000, a new version of the
``industrial-strength'' operating system due for release in
February. It will run the back offices of the world's banks and
businesses, but is horrendously late and bug-ridden.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also put in a touch on the tiller, saying
the whispers had been misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Gates intended to oversee the development of new technology
personally, in his twin new roles as chairman and chief software
architect, while Ballmer would conduct day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts broadly accepted this version of events. ``For
Gates, I believe that this is about making the Internet work for
Microsoft,'' said Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs. ``That's where
his heart is.''
</P>
<P>
   But one source close to the company quoted in the San Jose
Mercury News, the Silicon Valley daily, said the reshuffle at the
top might have been an attempt to reassure nervous executives as
they make contingency plans for a possible breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the team managers have plans ready...'' the source
said. ``But what they're concerned about is how Gates will react if
he's forced to do it. If he's backed into a corner, he might
explode.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts reacted with alarm at Gates' statement that ``in
the revolution ahead of us, software will be at the center,''
saying the opposite was true.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' replacement with a man of similar temperament and ideas
was thus a sign of weakness and inflexibility, they said. &QL;

&HT;     GOOD TIMES, 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ These must be good times because the nation is
torn apart over a piece of fabric, the firing of a coach, do-good
messages on television shows and a lost 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of a new century, these are the issues
proclaimed as important, so let's go with them.
</P>
<P>
   The piece of fabric is the Confederate battle flag that flies
over the South Carolina state Capitol, a flag the NAACP and many
African-American citizens of that state find offensive and would
like lowered.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? The flag was raised over the Capitol of South Carolina
for the first time in 1962 as a sign of resistance to the civil
rights movement and a symbol of ``states' rights,'' which then
meant whites' right to dominate blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Now look what happens. Arizona Sen. John McCain, who is wrong
about one divisive war (the one he fought in and thinks was a good
war that could have been won) now is wrong about an even more
divisive war. He called the Confederate battle flag a ``symbol of
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the heritage of defending slavery by rebelling against
the government McCain wishes to lead as president and a member of
the party of Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are always saying ``the party of Lincoln.'' It
should mean something.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is an honorable man, and he should go back to what he
originally said, that the flag is ``offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   But no, now he's pandering to grown men who put on gray soldier
suits and march around with muzzle-loading rifles trying to
recapture their ``heritage.'' He forgets those who marched 100
years later against that flag to recapture their dignity and human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The latter just don't happen to vote in great numbers in
Republican primaries in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the issue of that most symbolically loaded flag
``should be settled without interference from presidential
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the custody of a lost and symbolically
loaded 6-year-old, McCain and every Republican presidential
candidate is a social worker who knows what's best for the child.
</P>
<P>
   The party of family values and fathers' rights would take Elian
Gonzalez from his father because of his dad's address and his
politics.
</P>
<P>
   No, that's not it. The fanatical anti-Castro Cuban American vote
is important, so therefore it's best for the child not to go back
to dad in Havana but to stay with the cousins in Miami who shower
presents on the kid and teach him how to wave to the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress are trying to get in on the act by
granting Elian citizenship. Never have so many conservatives been
so hospitable to one boat person. And never have they cared so much
about child welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Give me your tired, your hungry and your pathetic little
political footballs. They're going to Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what the Rev. Jesse Jackson's position on Elian is.
It's the kind of situation that calls for his hostage negotiation
skills, but those wacky right-wingers in Miami probably won't deal
with Jackson. Besides, they need Elian, because they don't have
much else anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is pursuing the issue of the Confederate battle flag in
South Carolina, which makes sense. But he also has grabbed hold of
two issues that don't offer much in the way of high ground _ the
rioting kids in Decatur, Ill., who were expelled from school, and
Ray Rhodes, who was fired as coach by the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Decatur kids who beat people up in the football stands
were punished too severely. But they're not modern-day freedom
fighters like Rosa Parks, as Jackson has proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is Rhodes a martyred black leader.
</P>
<P>
   He's a coach who was hired, then fired, as justly or unjustly as
any other high-paid scapegoat with headphones.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson should do what he does so well, move on to another
issue, and quickly. Sometimes the constant effort to be in the
spotlight can be blinding.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough that the nation is mired in a racial war of
capture the flag and an international child-custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   When we flip away from the evening news to light sitcoms, we
enter a drug war zone.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Office of National Drug Policy has been
reviewing TV scripts and rewarding networks that insert anti-drug
messages.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know where they put those anti-drug messages, what with
all the messages to use guns to settle disputes, maintain absolute
faith in doctors and cops and _ if you're a young woman _ aspire to
be a sex-crazed lawyer who is as dumb and skinny as a stick.
</P>
<P>
   Still, federal narcovision is an outrageous violation of the
spirit of the First Amendment, and my right as a beer-swilling,
prescription-drugged couch potato to enjoy the worst drug of all,
television.
</P>
<P>
   What does television tell us? We have grave political problems
like idiots flying an offensive flag, coaches who get fired and a
little boy seemingly doomed to grow up as a very scuffed political
football.
</P>
<P>
   Television also tells us we have politicians who aren't up to
dealing with those issues. But already we knew that, just as we
already knew that drugs are bad for us.

HOTEL, DINING RATINGS GET TOUGHER 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mobil is shaking up the hotel and restaurant world with a fresh
look at who gets its coveted five-star ratings.
</P>
<P>
   One winner is the Four Seasons Hotel, Boston, which just
received its first five-star rating, making it the first Boston
hotel in years to hold the distinction. Mobil annually reviews
22,000 properties in the country, and this year only 42 made the
five-star list. Another 425 received four-star ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jacobson, who heads Mobil's rating system, said winners of
the five- and four-star ratings are all excellent, but the
five-star winners are ``the best of the best.'' At a five-star
hotel, Jacobson said, ``guests receive attention that is
unparalleled'' and leave with the ``most memorable experience of a
lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mobil Guides, which have become a traveler's bible for
accommodations and dining, are taking a fresh look at the food and
lodging industry, with many longstanding five-star properties being
downgraded to four-star status.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson said his job is to make the guides the preeminent
rating system in the country, and last year he embarked on ways to
improve the rating committee. He recruited travel writers,
restaurant critics, hotel school professors, and people in the
industry to upgrade the committee. Mobil does all its inspections
anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, other properties holding five stars are the
Mayflower Inn in Connecticut (five years with five stars) and Twin
Farms in Vermont (five years). The Point in Saranac Lake, N.Y.,
also continues its five-point rating (three years).
</P>
<P>
   Winning four stars for lodging in Massachusetts are the Boston
Harbor Hotel, The Eliot, and Ritz-Carlton Hotel, all in Boston;
Blantyre, Lenox; Charlotte Inn, Edgartown; the Wauwinet, Nantucket;
and the Wequassett Inn, Chatham. In Maine, four-star properties are
Bar Harbor Hotel-Bluenose Inn, Bar Harbor; Captain Lord Mansion,
Inn at Harbor Head, and The White Barn Inn, all in Kennebunkport;
and the Lodge at Moosehead Lake, Greenville. In New Hampshire, the
Balsams Grand Resort Hotel, Colebrook. In Vermont, Governor's,
Ludlow; Inn at Sawmill Farms, West Dover; Rabbit Hill Inn, Lower
Waterford; Topnotch at Stowe Resort &AMP; Spa; and Woodstock Inn &AMP;
Resort. In Connecticut, the Inn at National Hall in Westport.
</P>
<P>
   No restaurants in New England received the five-star rating.
</P>
<P>
   Winning four stars for dining in Massachusetts were Four
Seasons' Aujourd'Hui, Biba, Clio, Grill 23, Hamersley's Bistro,
L'Espalier, Radius, and Rowes Wharf, all in Boston; Chillingsworth
in Brewster; and Wheatleigh in Lenox.
</P>
<P>
   Reduced to four-star ratings were The Greenbrier in West
Virginia (38 years with five stars); The Carlyle in New York City
(a 31-year winner); Marriott's Camelback Inn in Arizona (30 years);
and the C Lazy U Ranch in Colorado (22 years).
</P>
<P>
   Longtime hotels and resorts still holding five stars are Four
Seasons Hotel, New York City (five years); Little Nell, Aspen,
Colo. (five years); Mansion on Turtle Creek, Dallas (11 years); St.
Regis, New York (5 years); The Peninsula, Beverly Hills, Calif.
(seven years); the Breakers, Palm Beach, Fla. (18 years); the
Phoenician in Arizona (seven years); and The Ritz-Carlton, Naples,
Fla. (12 years).

Safety first
</P>
<P>
   Jiminey Peak in Hancock, Mass. is going all out to reduce
accidents and provide a more enjoyable environment for skiers. The
most visible safety effort is the creation of Non-Speed Zones where
skiers and snowboarders are required to keep at the averge speed of
the users of that particular slope. On the seven trails marked,
Mountain Safety Patrol members will be giving tickets to those who
violate the rules. Consistent violators will lose their lift ticket
but get an opportunity to redeem it by watching a mountain safety
video. The safety patrol is a volunteer organization with 40
members (very visible in their bright yellow jackets) that started
five years ago. For more information, check out www.jiminypeak.com.

   Boston is known as the walking city, because it is easy to get
around on foot. One can follow the Freedom Trail and wander through
300-plus years of history in three miles or less, without strain.
Now there's a new way to discover old Boston, the Shawmut Peninsula
Walk, which traces Boston's original shoreline. The walk captures a
time when the fledgling city was a rough Colonial settlement on a
hilly promontory in Boston Harbor. The Shawmut Peninsula Walk opens
a new window onto Boston's Colonial and genealogical past, said Ann
Hershfang, president of WalkBoston, the pedestrian advocacy
organization, which produced the map. Using the self-guided map,
walkers can trace the original shoreline along present-day streets.
The map also contains lively historical notes, neighborhood
information, and transit stops. The map is $5 and can be found in
bookstores or from Bryant Altman Map and Book Distributors,
Endicott Street, Building 26, Norwood, MA 02062; telephone
781-762-3339.

EXTRA SAVINGS _ EXTRA FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking for a different cruise, one that offers extra value in
pricing, ports of call, and itinerary?
</P>
<P>
   Then this year consider a ``repositioning'' cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Every year in spring and fall most cruise lines begin to move
their ships to the waters where they will spend the season _ in
spring they sail to Europe and Alaska; in the fall, the ships
return from those ports and head to the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   What makes these cruises particularly attractive is the pricing.
Most lines offer two-for-one fares, air-inclusive offers, and a
variety of off-season pricing, according to the Cruise Lines
International Association.
</P>
<P>
   Other reasons for considering a repositioning cruise are:
</P>
<P>
   One-of-a-kind itineraries. Because ships are moving from one
geographic area to another, the combination of ports visited is
interesting and unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Trans-Atlantic crossings. Ships of all sizes and styles will be
crossing the Atlantic from the sunny waters of the Caribbean this
spring for European ports of call.
</P>
<P>
   Panama Canal transits. To begin or end their Alaskan cruise
seasons, most ships travel through the Panama Canal, visiting
Mexico and Central America along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Special themes and entertainment. Cruise lines often enhance
repositioning cruises with fun themes and out-of-the-ordinary
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   And, ``Repositioning cruises are among the most relaxing cruises
available,'' said James G. Godsman, president of CLIA. ``It's the
ideal cruise for vacationers who want to unwind, be pampered, enjoy
days at sea and interesting activities before visiting ports of
call that are truly off the beaten path.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents have details.

New canal boat
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Canal boating, long a favorite way to travel in France and
England among other European countries, is coming to New England.
The Blackstone Valley Tourism Council's 40-foot canal boat, the
Samuel Slater, has arrived in Central Falls, R.I. The boat, built
in England to ensure authenticity, will be used for sightseeing and
overnight stays on the Blackstone River, which runs through the
Blackstone Valley region of Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Plans
are to use the boat for overnight stays at a cost of $125. The boat
is named for Samuel Slater, who began America's Industrial
Revolution at a mill in Pawtucket, R.I., that is now a museum to
that period.
</P>
<P>
   One of the country's earliest canals was along the Blackstone,
providing transportation of goods from the many mills that lined
its banks. The boat will not be sailing along the rivers of nearby
Providence because, according to a story in the Providence Journal,
those waters are considered navigable waterways, which under law
allow only US-built boats to carry cargo and passengers between US
destinations. The Blackstone is not considered a navigable
waterway.
</P>
<P>
   The council is seeking period furnishings for the boat, and
plans to put the vessel into service sometime this spring.

Disney goes 7 days
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Cruise Line will be expanding its horizons this year.
In August, the line plans on offering a seven-day Caribbean cruise
to its schedule, which now consists of three- and four-day cruises.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Magic will sail Saturdays from Port Canaveral to St.
Maarten, St. Thomas, and St. John in the US Virgin Islands, and, of
course, to Disney's private island in the Bahamas, Castaway Cay.
New entertainment and shore excursions will also be introduced for
this cruise.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second change for the line, which began by offering
only a one-week package that included a three- or four-day cruise
with a stay at Disney World. Last year the line began offering
cruise-only packages.
</P>
<P>
   The line's newest ship, the Disney Wonder, will continue to
offer the three- and four-day cruises.
</P>
<P>

   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Cruises has just announced plans for its 2001 world
cruise. The Jan. 21 to April 27 sailing will boast more countries
visited than any previous Crystal cruise. The sixth world cruise of
the Crystal Symphony will visit 38 exotic ports of call in 31
countries, including rarely visited destinations in Southeast Asia,
India, the Middle East, Africa, and the Canary Islands.

   Travelers looking for a different way to see Europe might want
to consider a Crown Blue Line cruise that allows them to be captain
of their own boat as they travel the waterways of Germany, France,
Ireland, Holland, and the line's newest destinations, Italy and
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The line offers more than 500 self-skippered vessels, allowing
travelers to experience the character and charm of some of Europe's
most picturesque regions.
</P>
<P>
   Weekly prices begin at about $500 a person. For example, in
France, the four-person Tamarisi starts at $1,960 a week in low
season, and the luxurious 10-person Grand Classique is $4,980 per
week during July and August. Prices include fuel, a damage waiver,
VA,T and canal tolls.

   The Norwegian Coastal Voyage is offering senior savings of $90
to $220 to passengers 67 and older on the 1,250-mile trip along
Norway's spectacular west coast. The 11-ship fleet sails daily
year-round between Bergen in the south and Kirkenes in the north,
above the Arctic Circle. More than half the ships have been built
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Senior savings are available except from June 1 to July 15.
Fares, with the savings, begin at $1,075 a person.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian Coastal Voyage has been operating since 1893, its
ships doubling as cargo vessels and local transportation for
Norwegians. The ships call at 34 fishing villages, towns, and
cities, pausing only briefly at some places to pick up and unload
goods, and at others long enough for sightseeing and shopping.
Ports visited at night on the northbound voyage are called on in
the daytime during the southbound trip.

<P>
   Out &AMP; About, the travel newsletter for gay men and lesbians, is
giving cruise lines a low rating in its January issue.
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter gave Carnival a C, Princess an F, Crystal Cruises
a D, and Disney Cruise Line, Norwegian, and Royal Caribbean, D+.
</P>
<P>
   ``These low ratings are disappointing, but not unexpected,''
said Billy Kolber-Stuart, editor of Out &AMP; About. ``Despite enormous
growth over the past 10 years, and big profits from all-gay charter
cruises, the cruise industry has been shockingly slow in addressing
the needs and issue of its gay customers and employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter looked at cruise line policies, programs, and
procedures, ranging from hiring and benefits to marketing. Issues
of general quality, customer satisfaction, and reputation were not
considered.

<P>
   A new and innovative guest loyalty program for travelers who
sail on the six lines belonging to World's Leading Cruise Lines _
Carnival, Holland America, Windstar, Seabourn, Cunard, and Costa _
is now available.
</P>
<P>
   The program, called Vacation Interchange Privileges, provides
the same discount benefits accorded to members of each line's past
program.
</P>
<P>
   For example, guests who sail on Seabourn, Windstar, or Cunard
will not only have access to discounts offered through past-guest
programs of the Seabourn Club, Windstar Foremast Club, and Cunard
World Club, but also savings available through any of the six WLCL
member lines' repeat-passenger programs. All the cruise line
members of the WLCL are owned by Carnival.
</P>
<P>
   Savings of up to 50 percent are offered on select sailings of
Carnival, Costa, and Windstar. The discounts on Holland America are
up to 35 percent and those on Cunard, up to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain the discount, a traveler simply books a cruise through
any travel agent, who then informs the cruise line reservations
agent of the past-guest status at the time of bookings and, with
the initial deposit, supplies proof of the prior WLCL cruise. Other
restrictions may apply.
</P>
<P>
   The World's Leading Cruise Lines has a Web site that provides
information and a gateway to the Web sites of the participating

   Starting at less than $80 day, travelers can set sail on the
69-night trip from Sydney, Australia, to Southampton, England, or
the 51-night trip from Beijing to Southampton.
</P>
<P>
   The 69-day cruise from Sydney includes a four-night stay in
Sydney's Darling Harbor. The cruise from China begins with an
eight-night stay in the Forbidden City of Beijing.

SOCCER MOMS STAGE A REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EPPING, N.H. _ There are moms in shinguards everywhere you look.
Moms body-checking each other into plexiglass walls, shouting at
referees, knocking soccer balls off knees and heads.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening at the Crossroads Sports and Entertainment
Center, an indoor arena in small-town New Hampshire, mothers are
part of the indoor soccer frenzy. They play, often aggressively,
late into the night, while their children are busy with homework or
crawling into bed. Or playing games of their own. Or doing nothing
at all.
</P>
<P>
   News flash, children: One night a week, for one hour, some
mothers have their own things to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get my kids rides if there's a conflict,'' said Cecelia
Carroll, 48, a Derry teacher whose team of mostly moms won its
game, 8-2. ``I missed my daughter's winter chorus. I missed my
staff dinner for the playoffs. I guess this has been a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider it a revolt of the soccer mom, the car-pool-driving,
child-toting, husband-cheering, one-woman family support system. In
the presidential campaign four years ago, she was the bedraggled
symbol of selfless motherhood _ enabler of the affluent modern
childhood, where weeknights bring a stream of sports games, band
practices, and lessons of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as some of the mothers step back from that role, they are
admitting it feels like defiance: a shift in the family dynamic, a
modest rebellion from the idea that your children are your world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my one night,'' said one mother, who has missed a child's
basketball games for her once-a-week soccer fix. ``The kids have
their nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Some children are watching that change with bemusement. Alyssa
Park, 9, admitted she was surprised when her 35-year-old mother,
Deb, took up the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know they had older ladies' soccer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But many children are encouraging, even begging their mothers to
play, and increasingly families are viewing a once youth-centered
sport as an all-encompassing affair. As indoor arenas rise across
the country, more households find themselves focused on the same
field three or four nights a week, attending games for brothers,
sisters, fathers, and mothers.
</P>
<P>
   It's happening in earnest in places like Crossroads, the newest
indoor soccer site in a state where six arenas have sprung up in
the past six years, and at least two more are under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Like many arenas, this one looks, from the outside, like a
warehouse: a modest, no-frills metal building beside a busy
highway. Inside, it is cavernous, with two oval-shaped playing
surfaces surrounded by plexiglass walls. In the afternoons and
evenings, the fields fill and empty with mechanical precision, as
teams stream on and off for hourlong games.
</P>
<P>
   Children still make up the bulk of Crossroads' 140 soccer teams,
owner T.J. Shaughnessy said. But in numbers surprising to many,
more and more women are taking part. Two or three women's teams
quickly grew to 12 teams of women over age 30. Two years ago, he
said, many of them had never kicked a soccer ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would say, `I'm so sick of my kids playing, and my
husband playing, and I want to play,' '' Shaughnessy said.
``They're having more fun than any other group, the moms.''
</P>
<P>
   Indoor soccer is a perfect way to start the revolution,
aficionados say. It's a faster-paced version of the outdoor game.
Teams are smaller, and balls can't go out of bounds; they just
bounce off the walls and back onto the field. To participate, the
player doesn't have to be a great athlete, a fierce competitor, or
highly trained. And little time is devoted.
</P>
<P>
   At Crossroads, the teams do not practice, and they play for only
an hour a week. At the Seacoast United Soccer Club arena in
Hampton, teams of mothers take turns baby-sitting toddlers on an
Astroturf field strewn with coloring books, while other teams play
a few yards away.
</P>
<P>
   During night games at Crossroads, husbands watch, calling out
advice or keeping vigil for old injuries that could spring up
again. Children shout encouragement and explain complex rules that,
to them, are second nature.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Nelson, 13, acts as unofficial coach of the Oyster
River Hurricanes, shouting pointers to her mother, Anne, in the
goalkeeper's box.
</P>
<P>
   One of Anne Nelson's teammates recently asked Courtney if she
worried about balls flying at her mother's head. Courtney was
unmoved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she can handle birth,'' she said, ``she can handle getting
the ball in her face.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of balls in faces on indoor soccer fields, and
fingers slammed into walls, ankles swollen by errant kicks, and
women quietly cursing their opponents as they stumble off the
field. Some women say they've had to adjust to the aggression,
though they still take pride in being a different sort of player
than men.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we knock somebody down, we say, `Are you OK?' '' Deb Park
said. The men? ``They just keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the women take it easy. When the Bloomers
recently played the New England Crew at Crossroads, the game came
to a halt as the women argued with referee Michelle Weaver, 17,
over whether a kick was legal. They wouldn't continue playing until
they got a second opinion. Women tend to argue more than children,
Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   The pressures on women are different, many say, as they shed
their insecurities in favor of sneakers and shorts. Julie Spuria,
33, a newspaper columnist from Auburn, admits that she puts makeup
on her carpet-burned knees when she wears dresses.
</P>
<P>
   And image worries left the name of Deb Park's team in flux. The
players considered Blue Thunder, but worried that people would call
them Thunder Thighs. They switched to Blue Lightning, but nobody
could remember it. Finally, they settled on the Hornets.
Baggage-free.
</P>
<P>
   Generations of women, who grew up playing hopscotch while the
boys took to the sports field, have had to drop old ideas as
they've now turned to sports, said Sharlene Hess-Biber, a Boston
College sociology professor.
</P>
<P>
   In large part, she said, they've taken ideas and encouragement
from their daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The leagues are open to all women over 30, and they do not have
to be moms to qualify. But the majority of players are mothers who
have spent years watching their children and husbands play.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer-playing moms are learning a new feeling of pride; they
urge newcomers onto the field and cheer even when their teammates
fail. Spuria, a seasoned player, passed the ball repeatedly to
rookies, hoping they would have a chance to score.
</P>
<P>
   She loves to watch mothers play, she said, and hear their
children scream out support. When they yell, ``Go, Mom,'' she said,
``My heart flips.''
</P>
<P>
   But many women find that support from their teammates is enough
for now. Celeste Dietterle, 43, a Newmarket secretary, said she
tells her husband not to come to her games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They criticize you too much,'' she said. ``This is what I do,
and I don't want him. This is my thing. Go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Allen, 43, a Durham teacher, said her four daughters, all
soccer players, wanted to see her first-ever game with the
Hurricanes. She borrowed their soccer shoes and shinguards, but she
wouldn't let them come. She wanted to do it alone.
</P>
<P>
   So, for the first time, she pulled on a pink team shirt and
matching pink ponytail holder, and bounded onto the field. She
crunched her face with concentration and stabbed at the ball.
</P>
<P>
   And she made a discovery: After years of watching her children's
games, scrutinizing their teams, and tracking their successes, she
knew what she was doing. Enough to do it well, scoring one of the
team's two goals that night.
</P>
<P>
   As teammates congratulated her, Allen gave the credit to her
children. ``I've been watching for a really long time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she thought for a second and added: ``Well, it's hard to
believe they got it all from my husband.''

TV RESURRECTIONS SHOW LITTLE LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lady Macbeth would have made a lousy television executive.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, William Shakespeare's famous dragon lady was an
immoral, lethally ambitious schemer chock-full of the sorts of
character deficiencies that have served many a Hollywood suit well.
And her tendency toward the cutthroat bottom line would have come
in handy in making those tough personnel decisions: ``Out, damned
programmer! Out, I say!''
</P>
<P>
   But she is also the woman who uttered the famous line, ``What's
done is done,'' and as everyone should now understand, nothing in
TV land is ever truly done.
</P>
<P>
   These days, TV's theme song should be, ``Everything Old Is New
Again.'' If the four major networks are interested in doing
anything nowadays, it's repackaging and regurgitating the past. You
want innovative and original _ watch HBO. You want TV as dusty and
faded as an old photograph _ look no further than network
television. The most obvious and recent example is the sudden
infestation of prime-time game shows _ FOX's ``Greed,'' NBC's
``Twenty One,'' CBS's ``Winning Lines,'' and the show that began
the madness, ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' ABC's favorite
warhorse.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it is not, unfortunately, the only example. Every few years
or so, someone gets the bright idea to resurrect some long-gone TV
show in the form of a two-hour movie. The latest comes Feb. 7 with
``Mary and Rhoda.'' Yes, that's Mary as in Mary Richards, and Rhoda
as in Rhoda Morgenstern, characters made famous by Mary Tyler Moore
and Valerie Harper, respectively, in the great 1970s comedy ``The
Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' When last we saw Rhoda she was living in
New York on her eponymous sitcom, while Mary and the gang _
co-workers Lou (Ed Asner), Murray (Gavin McLeod), Ted (Ted Knight),
Sue Ann (Betty White), and Georgette (Georgia Engel) were hugging,
crying, and singing ``It's a Long Way to Tipperary,'' as they left
their WJM-TV studio for the final time in 1977. It was a perfect
ending for an often-perfect show. But for reasons someone needs to
explain, well enough could not be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, in a few weeks there will be the sight of a recently
widowed Mary living in a tony Upper West Side apartment, and a
twice-divorced Rhoda trying to settle into her hometown after
living in Paris. Both have daughters, and the old friends find
themselves trying to navigate new lives on the shady side of middle
age. To be sure, the emotional tug of seeing again Mary's too-wide
nervous smile, and hearing Rhoda's ever-present Noo Yawk accent is
inevitable. We spent seven years with these people, and came to
know them as well as members of our own families. Yet, whatever
warm feelings are generated quickly evaporate once that cheap
nostalgia high wears off.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, television isn't the only peddler of such things. The
music industry has been doing this mess for years. Numerous bands _
from the Eagles to Fleetwood Mac to Blondie to the Sex Pistols (who
were at least cheeky and upfront enough to call their reunion the
``Filthy Lucre'' tour) _ have traded on our memories to squeeze a
few more millions from their once-glorious careers. Though all
claimed they would never, ever get together again, suddenly we were
inundated with concert tours,
take-the-money-and-run-with-our-memories CDs, and TV specials, also
available with never-before-seen footage on DVD for $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   Even death isn't a deterrent as surviving Beatles Paul
McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr proved a few years ago
when they warmed up John Lennon's leftovers and released two
``new'' tracks, ``Free as a Bird'' and ``Real Love.'' The Rutles
were right _ all you need is cash.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something even more unseemly when our favorite TV
shows and characters are raised from the dead. At least with
musicians, the songs, give or take a high note here and there,
essentially remain the same. But revived TV shows try to write new
chapters for books long finished and closed. From ``Cagney and
Lacey'' to ``The Rockford Files'' to ``Mary and Rhoda,'' they
arrive in our TV sets with the conceit that if we loved them once,
we'll certainly love them again. But the stars are older and
thicker, and more often that not, the shows lack much of what made
them special the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   Television is a business, but the intimacy of the medium makes
it so much more. Yet TV execs and creators are so cynical they can
see only big ratings and ad revenue, never appreciating that TV's
greatest shows _ and our favorite characters _ are best served not
by creaky reunions but by the tender indulgence of our memories.

ITALY MEETS CALIFORNIA AT ROSE PISTOLA
</HEADLINE>
 2 takes  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've visited San Francisco's North Beach in the last year
or two, you may have run into Rose Pistola, a restaurant that has
been packing in diners since chef and restaurateur Reed Hearon
opened it in 1996. Featuring North Beach-style Italian food, the
cooking and menu are influenced by California and Liguria (on the
Northwestern coast of Italy).
</P>
<P>
   ``What's evolved here is a cuisine that's simple, pristine and
at the same time very sophisticated. The nature of the food we do
is homestyle cooking,'' says the Texas native who came to San
Francisco more than a decade ago after honing his skills in
kitchens in Austin, Denver and Sante Fe.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant was named after Rose Pistola (who passed away in
1998 at the age of 90), a colorful and feisty women who owned a bar
and was renowned in North Beach for her Italian cooking. Her
Silician father was a fisherman, and her mother was a fantastic
cook. Hearon said he loved Rose's name, her attitude, her spirit
and her joyfulness. ``She personified what I love about the
neighborhood: its bawdy sense of history and its wry acknowledgment
that it's futile to take ourselves too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's possible to sample some of Hearon's restaurant fare
with a copy of his recently released ``The Rose Pistola Cookbook,''
co-written with Peggy Knickerbocker (Broadway Books; $35). It's
filled with 140 recipes _ mostly of dishes served at the restaurant
_ that evoke the spirit of North Beach and its Italian immigrant
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are signature dishes, including a colorful array of
antipasti. You'll see many of them displayed on oval platters at
the end of the open kitchen's counter when you enter the
restaurant. Featured are Marinated Olives, Shaved Artichoke With
Fava Beans and Parmesan, Shaved Raw Mushrooms, Endive and Parmesan
and Asparagus Carpaccio along with Skillet-Roasted Mussels,
Cioppino, Roasted Fish in a Salt Crust, Stuffed Focaccia, and Goat
Cheese and Roasted Pepper Pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Hearon has tried to keep the recipes simple. ``We geared them to
the home cook and regular folks _ and they are indicative of the
food we serve _ which is home food, not restaurant-style food. The
cooking techniques in the book are based on home-cooking traditions
_ nothing fancy, nothing complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   The recipes rely on readily available ingredients _ and when
testing the recipes, the authors shopped for ingredients in local
stores rather than using items from the restaurant's kitchen. There
are some exceptions _ and in this instance mail-order sources are
included for things like beans, specialty flours, organic polenta,
hand-crafted cheeses and Ligurian olive oils _ if you feel inclined
to go to these lengths. Otherwise, Hearon gives substitutes _ or
you might search out local Italian specialty stores for products he
mentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out of the way to test each recipe thre in a
home kitchen,'' Hearon said during a recent stopover in Los
Angeles. To test the recipes, ``Peggy (Knickerbocker) and I had
dinner once a week with friends at my house.'' Hearon ad-libbed or
cooked at home from written recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Hearon believes in using the freshest seasonal ingredients in
his creations and recommends that home cooks shop before making a
dish. They should buy what's fresh, in season, local and what
catches their fancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use the recipes as guides, improvising based on what you
bought.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the warm, savory dishes in the book begin by infusing
cold oil and cold aromatics such as onions and garlic in a cold pan
over medium-high heat, allowing the ingredients to warm up in the
oil. This way, garlic and onions won't burn. Once you have the
aromatic oil base, the main ingredient of the dish is added.
</P>
<P>
   Hearon recommends using a Ligurian oil _ one that is fruity,
ripe and both delicate and full of flavor _ as often as possible in
the book's recipes. Among his favorites are Roi Mosto, Raineri and
Isnardi. He also advises saving water from cooking pasta, beans,
potatoes and vegetables and refrigerating or freezing for future
use in sauces and other dishes to integrate and bring the dish
together.
</P>
<P>
   Another frugal trick is to save rinds from Parmigiano-Reggiano
cheese. Wrap them in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator to
throw into a pot of bean soup without fish _ or to enhance other
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   He also prefers cooking with sea salt because it has a broader,
more complex range of flavors than table salt. However you can
substitute kosher salt.
</P>
<P>
   Tempt diners with this sampling of dishes from ``The Rose
Pistola Cookbook.'' You're in for some delicious eating. &QL;

ADVANCING SENSELESS VIOLENCE AS LITERARY GENRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PRAGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
AFTERBURN 
By Colin Harrison 
Farrar Straus &AMP; Giroux, 435 pp., $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before Colin Harrison begins rolling out the 400-plus pages of
mayhem and gore in his new novel ``Afterburn,'' he offers up an
enormously telling quotation from Jean-Paul Sartre that begins,
``Torture is senseless violence . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the quotation itself that's revealing, but Harrison's
decision to include it.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, it shows that he considers the gross brutality he
depicts to be integral, even central, to his creation, not just
some cheesy attempt to stir base emotion. Whether the story would
stand without the torture scenes is questionable, but they surely
are the book's most memorable passages.
</P>
<P>
   One character, Rick Bocca, loses his arm to a bad guy with a
circular saw who wants him to betray a woman he had betrayed once
before.
</P>
<P>
   His tormenters promise they'll drop him _ and his arm _ near a
hospital if he'll talk, but it turns out to be a cruel hoax; the
heavy cooler they give him to struggle with _ one-handed _ turns
out to hold only a frozen turkey. It, too, has had one wing
severed.
</P>
<P>
   Another character, Charlie Ravich, has his decades-old scar from
spinal surgery opened because the syndicate's sadist observed
spinal anesthesia once and wants to give it a whirl. The motivation
for this evil is the same: to get at the girl.
</P>
<P>
   Such machinations by bad guys is boilerplate stuff; what makes
``Afterburn'' stand out are the long and specific descriptions of
violence. Rick's torture scene, which includes having a power drill
ground into his ankle, his chest, then his mouth, lasts about a
dozen pages.
</P>
<P>
   Besides placing violence at the center by invoking Sartre,
Harrison seems to be crowning his work as high art, not just as
another mob-infested tale of sex and violence in the big city.
Unfortunately, although the tale elicits a modest urgency to see
what will come next, and offers some nice turns of phrase, what
follows does not approach the lofty goal he set.
</P>
<P>
   Substantial portions of the plot don't lead anywhere, and
although there are some amusing and perceptive characterizations,
they are of mere bit players, the main characters we have seen
before. In addition to Bocca (the muscle-headed lug trying to make
good on an old debt), and Ravich (the titan of industry with a
personal void), there's the ruthless gangster, the cop on the pad,
and a few others from central casting.
</P>
<P>
   At the center is Christina Welles, a thief and schemer who
nevertheless evokes a certain sympathy, in part because her
brilliance is all she has. Her father was the last man not to let
her down, and even he went and died on her. She fell for Bocca, a
small-time hood, but when their scam went bust, she was arrested
and he disappeared. The plot skips from one man to the next, each
one trying to get something from her.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the sex involves her, too. Although it has second
billing to the violence, it too is exaggerated. What she and Rick
used to do with, and to, each other is Olympian, as is what Rick
does with a couple of prostitutes in the hours before the torture
begins. Although it would be the last time it could ever be said,
he had both hands full.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the Sartre quotation is not a symbol of high art,
but of high pretentiousness. If it serves any purpose,
``Afterburn'' gives one author's view of how extreme sex and
violence have to be these days to make pulp fiction stand out.

MARINATED OLIVES 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Serve these with drinks before lunch or dinner. Offer a little
dish alongside for the pits. It is nice to include an assortment of
olives,with some green Bella di Cerignola mixed in with a variety
of black olives, because they look and taste so good. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound assorted olives, such as Nicoise, Gaeta, San Remo and
green olives, such as Bella di Cerignola OR Picholine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound sun-dried tomatoes, thinly sliced &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grated peel of 1 lemon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fresh basil leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drain olives and toss in a bowl with sun-dried tomatoes, olive
oil, lemon peel, garlic and basil. These can be served after
marinating overnight in refrigerator or stored for 2 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bring back to room temperature before serving. Makes 8 to 12
servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TUNA TAPENADE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This flavorful, versatile spread can be served on crostini or on
flatbread or as a dip for raw vegetables. However you plan on using
it, the flavorful spread will keep well under a float of a few
tablespoons of olive oil, well covered, in the refrigerator for up
to two weeks. Bring it back to room temperature before using. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup pitted Nicoise olives &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup pitted green olives &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons capers, drained &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon thyme leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon chopped rosemary leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 (6 1/2-ounce) can Italian olive-oil-packed tuna, drained &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grated peel and juice of 1 lemon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Cognac &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pulse olives, garlic, capers and herbs together in a food
processor. Then pulse in tuna until combined.
</P>
<P>
   Place tuna mixture in a bowl and add lemon peel, lemon juice and
Cognac. Slowly mix in olive oil, a little at a time, until tapenade
has a coarse texture. It should not be smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Cover and refrigerate until needed. Serve at room temperature.
Makes about 1 1/2 cups. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CROSTINI OF ASPARAGUS, PROSCIUTTO AND TELEME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this antipasto the asparagus is grilled, taking on a slightly
bitter, smoky flavor.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a grill lighted and ready, you can use a
stovetop grill pan or a very hot oven. Make this to nibble on while
you fix the rest of the meal. It only takes 10 minutes from start
to finish. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   12 thick asparagus spears, trimmed to about 5 inches long OR 20
pencil asparagus spears &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 long slices country-style bread, same length as asparagus &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound ripe teleme OR crescenza cheese &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 thin slices prosciutto &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a medium-hot fire in a grill, preheat stovetop grill pan
or preheat oven to 550 degrees F (or to highest setting).
</P>
<P>
   Toss asparagus with oil, then season to taste with salt and
pepper. Place asparagus on grill rack, in grill pan or on a sheet
pan in oven and cook, turning frequently, until nicely browned,
about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, toast bread on grill rack or in grill pan or oven,
turning once, until golden on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, spread each piece of toast with a thick layer of
cheese. Lay prosciutto on top and arrange grilled asparagus over
it. Makes 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MUSSEL, BROCCOLI AND POTATO SALAD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This unusual combination of flavors and textures is one of the
most deeply satisfying, warming combinations. This dish is served
as an antipasto or as a main course at Rose Pistola.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans are in the habit of barely blanching broccoli in
boiling water to cook it, but by slowly braising the broccoli its
flavors mellow and soften and gently combine with the potatoes and
mussels. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound Yellow Finn potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch
slices &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 large head broccoli, preferably romanesco OR purple Venetian,
cut into florets (reserve stalks for another use) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Water &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 anchovy fillets, chopped OR 1 tablespoon anchovy paste &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, crushed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pinch crushed red pepper flakes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound mussels, scrubbed and beards removed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dry Italian white wine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Small handful flat-leaf parsley leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a heavy flameproof casserole with a tight-fitting lid,
combine potatoes, broccoli, 2 tablespoons olive oil and 3
tablespoons water. Cover and cook over medium-low heat, without
stirring, until potatoes are tender, about 25 minutes. Drain and
toss in a salad bowl with remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, anchovies,
vinegar, garlic and crushed red pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, put mussels and white wine in a large saute pan with
a tight-fitting lid, cover and steam mussels until open over high
heat 2 to 3 minutes. Discard any that do not open.
</P>
<P>
   Add mussels and 1/4 cup steaming liquid to potato and broccoli
mixture. Toss, season to taste and toss again. Serve warm or at
room temperature, garnished with parsley. Serve mussels in shells
or remove them. Makes 4 first-course servings or 2 main-dish
servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SWORDFISH BROCHETTES WITH SALSA VERDE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When days are mild, grill these brochettes over a charcoal fire.
In the winter, you can cook them on a stovetop grill pan, although
you'll miss the flavor from the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Firm fish, such as sea bass, mackerel, salmon, mahi mahi or
halibut can be substituted. If you do not have rosemary stems for
skewering the fish, you will need to soak wooden skewers in water
for about 30 minutes before skewering so they won't burn on the
grill &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SALSA VERDE: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup loosely packed flat-leaf parsley leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon capers, rinsed and drained &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon red wine vinegar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 anchovy fillets &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dried bread crumbs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BROCHETTES: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound swordfish steak &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 sprigs rosemary (6 inches long) OR 8 wooden skewers, soaked in
water 30 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Salsa Verde, combine all salsa ingredients in a blender or
food processor and process until smooth. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   For Brochettes, prepare a fire in a charcoal grill or heat an
oiled stovtop grill pan over medium-high heat. Cut fish into
bite-size pieces, about 1x1- inch. Place fish in a bowl, add olive
oil and salt and pepper to taste and toss to coat. Thread 1 or 2
pieces of fish onto rosemary or wooden skewers.
</P>
<P>
   Place brochettes on oiled grill rack 6 to 8 inches above hot
coals and cook, turning to brown on all sides, until nearly opaque
throughout, about 1 minute per side. Or, cook brochettes on
stovetop grill pan about 1 to 3 minutes on each side.
</P>
<P>
   Serve at once on individual plates with Salsa Verde spooned over
top. Makes 4 appetizer servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Double salsa recipe and triple brochettes recipe and
thread more fish pieces on skewers if planning to serve 3 to 4 as a
main dish. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED SEA BASS WITH WILD MUSHROOMS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A variety of mushrooms would work well in this dish, such as
chanterelles, crimini or morels. If you cannot find these mushrooms
in your local market, try the dish with portobellos (with the black
gills trimmed off) or button mushrooms. Any firm mild fish, such as
halibut, that will not overpower the flavor of the mushrooms can be
substituted for the sea bass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig rosemary (about 6 inches long) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mushrooms, such as chanterelle, porcini, morel, crimini,
portobello OR button, cleaned (black gills trimmed off, if using
portobellos) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry Italian white wine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 (6-ounce) sea bass fillets &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a flameproof baking dish or ovenproof skillet just large
enough to hold fish, warm 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high
heat. Add garlic, rosemary and mushrooms and cook until mushrooms
start to brown, about 10 minutes. Add white wine and bring to a
simmer.
</P>
<P>
   Tuck fish fillets under mushrooms and season with salt.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 500-degree oven about 10 minutes or until just
cooked through.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with a drizzle of remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Makes
4 servings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SHAVED ARTICHOKES WITH FAVA BEANS AND PARMESAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is one of the most irresistible antipasti served at Rose
Pistola. Artichokes are very versatile and when thinly shaved and
served raw, they are delicious. Their crunchy, slightly bitter
flavor stimulates the appetite and palate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Water &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, halved, plus a few drops additional lemon juice &QL;
</P>
<P>
   16 baby artichokes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup fava beans &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4-pound wedge Parmigiano-Reggiano &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fill a large bowl with water and squeeze in juice from lemon,
then toss in squeezed halves. Peel off and discard outer leaves
from each artichoke until you reach part that is yellowish-green.
Trim off top, peel off tough outer layer at bottom and cut
artichoke in half lengthwise. Remove small thistle if it has
started to form in middle. As each artichoke is trimmed, place in
lemon water.
</P>
<P>
   When all artichokes are prepared, pour olive oil in a serving
bowl. Drain artichokes and lay halves, cut- side down, on a cutting
board, and, using a sharp stainless steel knife, slice into
lengthwise slices as thin as possible. Alternately, you can shave
them with a mandoline, being very careful of your fingertips. Put
slices in bowl with olive oil as you finish them, tossing to coat
to prevent discoloration.
</P>
<P>
   Add fava beans, toss well and season with salt and pepper and a
few drops lemon juice. Shave shards of cheese over top with a
vegetable peeler and serve. Makes 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SKILLET-ROASTED MUSSELS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mussels appear in cameo roles in cioppinos, pastas and
sandwiches, but at Rose Pistola, they star, pure and simple, on a
searing-hot plancha or iron skillet. This signature dish is one of
the simplest, most satisfying dishes and it's very easy to prepare
at home. The mussels' own juices provide the lovely smoky flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Today, much of the mussel crop is aquacultivated in Washington
State or along the East Coast. These cleaned and debearded mussels
generally can be purchased in little net bags. There are some great
planchas available in restaurant supply stores and gourmet stores.
They come with small wooden boards upon which rest the hot skillet
at the table and make for a great, straightforward presentation.
You can always use a cast- iron skillet.
</P>
<P>
   A chilled bottle of Barbera from California or Italy is just the
thing to go with mussels. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mussels, scrubbed and beards removed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heat plancha or cast-iron skillet over high heat (or over a hot
wood fire) until extremely hot; when a bead of water dances across
surface, it is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Spread mussels in one layer in pan: The heat will cause mussels
to open. Their juices will first pool and then burn on surface of
pan, at which point they are ready to serve, 4 to 5 minutes cooking
time. Discard any mussels that do not open.
</P>
<P>
   Season mussels generously with salt and pepper and serve from
pan at table, with melted butter on side. Makes 2 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED CHICKEN WITH TURNIPS, POTATOES AND CARROTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those dishes that evolved as a result of a trip
to the market when I was very hungry and in the mood to cook
something easy and all in one pot. It was the dead of winter and
the produce section was not terribly inspiring, but there were
beautiful baby turnips with their greens, potatoes, kale and dark
orange carrots. While this recipe should be enough for four, it was
so good that two of us ate it all up that night. For the cooking
wine, in the spirit of frugal North Beach cooks, you can use half a
bottle of leftover wine _ red or white, whatever you have. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces pancetta, cut into 1/4x1-inch strips &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig rosemary (about 6 inches long) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch kale, trimmed and coarsely chopped &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch baby turnips, greens removed and chopped and turnips
halved &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 large carrots, peeled and cut into chunks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 Yellow Finn potatoes, peeled and quartered &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 large chicken (3 to 4 pounds), quartered &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups (1/2 bottle) dry red OR white wine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a large heavy casserole, cook pancetta in olive oil over
medium-high heat until it renders its fat. Add garlic and rosemary
and cook until fragrant. Add kale, turnips, turnip greens, carrots
and potatoes. Season with salt and saute 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Generously season chicken with salt and pepper. Pour wine over
vegetables and reduce by 1/3. Put chicken legs and thigh quarters
on top of vegetables, reduce heat to low, tightly cover and cook 5
minutes. Add chicken breasts, cover and continue to cook until
chicken is tender and juices run clear, about 35 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Pour broth off vegetables and retain. Skim off any fat. Season
to taste. With a slotted spoon, arrange vegetables on a serving
platter and place chicken on top. Spoon broth (without fat) over
all. Makes 2 to 4 servings. &QL;

NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS EYE POLITICAL ADS CRITICALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOW, N.H. _ Like a lot of people in New Hampshire, Jill Hadaway
sees the political world up close and from many angles, and she
comes away with a mix of attitudes difficult for the men who would
be president to address.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ``pro-life conservative'' and registered
Independent, she nonetheless thinks the government should be more
involved in providing for education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Clerk of this little (pop. 6,500) town between Concord and
Manchester, Hadaway is an avid and critical observer of the
political advertising now bombarding anyone in the state who turns
on a television or radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ads really make or break them,'' she says between
enrolling new voters and collecting auto excise taxes in the town
offices. ``People in New Hampshire won't go by the ads (alone),
because just about anybody who wants to can meet the candidates. .
.. but the ads attract attention, they influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there has been no escaping the televised assault.
Since Nov. 9, the two Democrats and three leading Republican
contenders have spent $7.6 million to pelt New Hampshire viewers
with 3,989 minutes of paid advertising, according to a Globe
survey. This video barrage of biographies, issues talk and
occasional attacks would, if spliced onto one continous reel, run
for nearly 3 days.
</P>
<P>
   By primary day, the typical New Hampshire voter will have been
exposed to about 200 presidential campaign spots, estimates Tobe
Berkovitz, a political consultant and media buyer.
</P>
<P>
   But what do voters make of it all? Has this very costly effort
to persuade had anything like the candidates' desired effect?
</P>
<P>
   A few days with the citizens suggests that political ads, for
all the money and study that go into making them, are a decidedly
hit-or-miss affair. Some candidates have scored big, while others
seem to have struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the soccer parents, local activists and professionals
of Bow report that they have emerged from the broadcast blizzard
with an enduring hunger for a straightforward candidate with
humanity and character, with skepticism that big education and
health care problems will be solved by the proposals the candidates
are pushing, and with revulsion at even a hint of attack or
negativity.
</P>
<P>
   They also often have very clear views of what works and what
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going by the ads, (Vice President Al) Gore and (Sen. John)
McCain are the most appealing and most substantive,'' says Jack
Crisp, a lawyer in Concord who hosted a diverse group of Bow
residents at his home here last week to talk, at the Globe's
request, about the selling of this year's candidates. ``(Publisher
Steve) Forbes's ads are interestingly presented, but I don't agree.
(Former senator Bill) Bradley's are nondescript. (George W.) Bush?
His are last.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, reacting to ads is one thing and deciding whom to
vote for is another. Most opinion polls put Bradley ahead of Gore
in New Hampshire, and Bush running a close second to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in the discussion at Crisp's home, and in random
encounters around town, Bow residents consistently said they liked
McCain's ads best, and they rated the ads of the two Democrats over
the rest of the GOP field. Bush's ads were uniformly disliked, and
Forbes's generally ignored _ except for expressions of resentment
that he aired the first attack ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush ads are choppy,'' said Eric Anderson, a founder of
the Bow Republican Committee who is leaning toward Bush and is
personally acquainted with the Texas governor. ``The (Bush) ads
speak differently than the candidate. He is warmer and relates to
the voter better than his ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Town clerk Hadaway, who is undecided but leaning toward McCain,
said her attention was first drawn to the Arizona senator by a
radio ad in which his wife talked about how the McCains adopted a
young girl she brought home from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take a sick child not of your race into your home, that is
impressive to me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``comes across very scripted. McCain does a little too, but
less so,'' Hadaway said. Gore ``comes across as terribly scripted,
but Bill Bradley comes across as genuine. I think that's one of the
reasons he's gaining ground here. Forbes's ads are like he is _
unclear, boring, with kind of a raw edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Bradley comes across as sincere and committed, with
perhaps the best commercials of the campaign so far, Hadaway said,
she won't vote for him, because ``he's far too liberal for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town at Fieldhouse Sports, where the children of Bow and
surrounding communities come in winter for indoor soccer, field
hockey and lacrosse, Lorraine Fornier, 48, a nurse at Concord
Hospital and a registered Republican, sat in the bleachers and
laughed merrily when asked which ad she saw last.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have been Gore,'' she said. ``He is on all the time
now, because Bradley came on real strong, and Gore is fighting for
his life.'' But it's McCain who has caught her attention. ``You
have to put your faith in someone. You have to believe,'' Fornier
said. McCain ``is doing a real good job of making people believe in
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Stewart, 40, manager of the sports complex, is a registered
Democrat who describes himself as ``not very political.'' He did
not vote in the 1996 presidential election, and is dubious about
this year's crop of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see those ads, and what sticks in my mind'' are doubts about
the statements the candidates are making, Stewart said. ``Bush
saying `we do not give up on any child,' for example. I believe his
heart is in the right place, but that is not a feasible
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart also doubts the feasibility of the school tuition
voucher schemes some of the candidates embrace, because, he feels,
``we are all tied to paying our taxes and maintaining the public
infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the images go that the candidates are presenting in
their ads, ``I like McCain's no-holds-barred approach,'' Stewart
said. ``I think he shows his true inner self on occasion. I like
Bradley's demeanor. He's soft-spoken, looks people in the eye,
speaks from the heart. Al Gore? It's tough for him to shake the
Clinton shadow. . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Bow bears little resemblance to the stereotypical New Hampshire
town. There is no commercial center, no town green, no domination
of local affairs by crusty conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   What Bow does represent _ and why it and towns like it matter a
great deal to the political professionals who are deployed across
the state for various campaigns _ is an emerging New Hampshire, one
where natives and non-natives get along, where residents care more
about fine schools and youth programs than the low tax rate, and
where the ranks of political independents are growing at the
expense of the major parties.
</P>
<P>
   It is a growing and energized political constituency. Almost 100
percent of the adults in town are registered to vote, and Hadaway
predicts up to 80 percent will cast ballots in the primary election
on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time in memory, Republicans are not a
majority of registered voters. As of Jan. 4, they numbered 2,364;
there were 1,480 Independents and 1,019 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good microcosm of mainstream New Hampshire,'' said Mike
Murphy, a top McCain strategist. ``Not too far north, not part of
any particular region. This place feels like a lot of New Hampshire
feels. It has good Republican traditions, a lot of veterans and
Independents.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Bow residents at Crisp's had clear preferences in the
ads, there also were areas in which they felt all the ad campaigns
were lacking. One was foreign policy, to which none of the major
candidates has made substantial reference in ads; Republican Gary
Bauer on Friday began airing a pledge to get tough with China.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest shortcoming, according to members of the group, all
of whom have school-age children, is in the candidates' thoughts
and proposals regarding youth. The subject is featured in every
candidate's ads, but, says Peter Wenger, a lawyer, ``they are
missing the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Lyons, who teaches students with special needs at the White
Farm Alternative Learning Program in Concord, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the focus has to be on kids outside the schools,''
Lyons said, identifying a subject never mentioned in the ads.
``Kids get into trouble in unstructured time _ 3 to 7 p.m. Hello-o!
It's not just the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers for some of the campaigns found in focus groups
conducted many months ago that worries about youth were high on the
agendas of large segments of the voting public; this may be the
leading concern in the campaign. But, according to a source
familiar with the research, concerns range across a broad spectrum,
from empathy to fear of youth. That range makes the issue a
problematic target for advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the world is today, education is vitally important to
your kids' futures,'' Crisp said. ``And you also worry, is someone
going to wind up bringing a gun into your kids' school?''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates, Wenger said, ``are having trouble telling people
that maybe they're lousy parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group said no ads have been shown yet this year
that would make their lists of most memorable political ads.
</P>
<P>
   These, they said, include a George Bush ad attacking Democratic
nominee Michael S. Dukakis as being soft on crime, another Bush
spot showing a ridiculous-looking Dukakis riding in a tank, and a
Ross Perot infomercial in which the Texas extrepreneur, supporting
his charges with a diagram of Arkansas's poultry-based economy,
asserted that with Clinton in the White House ``we'll all be
plucking chickens for a living.''

SURVIVALIST GRITZ IN COURTROOM FIGHT TO STAY FREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENFIELD, Conn. _ Bo Gritz is, as usual, on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the former Green Beret's high-profile exploits _
searching for POWs in Laos, talking Randy Weaver down off Ruby
Ridge, scouring the North Carolina woods for accused bomber Eric
Rudolph _ he's being uncharacteristically quiet about it.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is, this time the 60-year-old celebrity freedom
fighter is fighting for his own freedom. This mission is to save
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz, a Vietnam War hero who is now a leader of the
ultraconservative Patriot Movement, is on trial here for attempted
kidnapping, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, and three other
charges that could land him in prison for up to 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem from a September 1996 incident in which Gritz
(rhymes with ``fights'') and his son were arrested in a car
registered to an alias of a Connecticut woman named Linda Wiegand.
In the months leading up to the arrests, Wiegand had become the
darling of Gritz's followers by alleging that custody of her two
sons was given to her sexually abusive, satanic former husband as
part of a government conspiracy. Her allegations, strenuously
denied by her former husband, have never been independently
verified.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz had aggressively promoted Wiegand's claims, railing about
her case on his shortwave radio show and bringing her to
survivalist conventions. He would sign up students for his
military-inspired training courses and burn the United Nations
flag, while she collected money for her legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut prosecutors allege that Gritz and his son, James R.
Gritz, 41, crossed the line from support to criminality by plotting
unsuccessfully to snatch the boys, then 10 and 7, as they left
school.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged scheme was foiled, authorities said, when a police
officer investigating an unrelated report of a suspicious vehicle
stopped the car containing Gritz and his son in the parking lot of
a middle school attended by one of Wiegand's sons. A third man,
Sheldon Robinson of Texas, a friend of Bo Gritz, was arrested in
1998 as an alleged coconspirator.
</P>
<P>
   The case is largely circumstantial; there is no evidence the
Gritzes ever came near the boys. But in the car with Gritz and his
son were two-way radios, a lock-picking device, a large knife, a
photo of the two boys, a school schedule, and other items
prosecutors said would have aided a kidnap attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with his future at stake, combined with a gag order from
the judge and a legal strategy of downplaying his swashbuckling
tendencies, Gritz has at least temporarily abandoned the
self-promotion that has been his calling card for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing fine,'' he said during a break in the trial last
week. ``But 3 1/2 years of this is a very high price to be paid to
be proven innocent.'' At that point, his lawyer, David Kritzman,
cut him off, making it possibly the briefest interview Gritz has
ever given.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz's trial is the latest chapter in a uniquely American life
that has veered from the straight lines of Army formations to a
string of freelance adventures that at times have bordered on the
absurd. Most recently, they have been embarrassing failures,
including a purported suicide attempt in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   James Gordon Gritz _ known as ``Jimbo,'' then just ``Bo'' _
joined the Army in 1957 and became one of the earliest members of
the newly formed Special Forces. ``I needed to be tested,'' he
wrote in a 1991 book, ``Called to Serve.''
</P>
<P>
   He proved his mettle during the Vietnam War, accumulating most
of his 62 career decorations, including five Silver Stars, 10
Bronze Stars, the Distinguished Flying Cross, two Purple Hearts,
and two Legion of Merit awards.
</P>
<P>
   Having risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel, Gritz retired
from the Army in 1979 and quickly embarked on a headline-grabbing
effort to find Vietnam-era American soldiers he said were still
being held prisoner in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Several early efforts were aborted or shelved, but in November
1982 he led a group of guerrillas into Laos, a misadventure that
ended when they were ambushed. The effort, called Operation
Lazarus, was later revealed to have been financed in part by actor
Clint Eastwood.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a wave of celebrity, Gritz was nominated in 1988 to run
for vice president under the Populist Party banner. He withdrew
from the race after learning that his running mate would be former
Ku Klux Klansman David Duke, but stayed with the party and ran for
president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, in 1989 he founded the Center for Action,
through which Gritz provides SPIKE Delta Force training, which is
popular among men and women who anticipate having to repel a coming
New World Order. Among other offerings, Gritz teaches a class on
``clandestine agent handling operations and government mind
control,'' according to the center's on-line catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably his biggest postwar success came in 1992, when Gritz
persuaded white separatist Randy Weaver to leave his cabin in Ruby
Ridge, Idaho, ending an 11-day siege that resulted in the deaths of
a US marshal and Weaver's wife and infant son.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, Gritz has proved far less effective. He failed
in a similar effort to end the 1996 standoff between the Montana
Freemen and federal agents. Then, in 1998, he promised to bring
accused antiabortion bomber Eric Rudolph out of the North Carolina
woods, only to leave bee-stung and empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   While Gritz was in North Carolina, his third wife filed for
divorce. When he returned to his home in Idaho and learned of her
decision, Gritz put on his uniform, loaded his Colt .45 service
pistol and shot himself in the chest, blowing several medals off
his uniform in the process. A police report said the injury
appeared to have been designed not to kill Gritz, but ``to raise
sympathy from his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz spent much of last year promoting his Y2K preparedness
courses. When chaos failed to arrive as he predicted on Jan. 1, his
detractors pounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gritz is fundamentally an opportunist, a parasite who has been
living off people's fears concerning the `End Times,' '' said Mark
Potok, editor of Intelligence Report, a magazine on the radical
right published by the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Of all Gritz's ups and downs, the Connecticut trial could prove
the most difficult. After months of jury selection and pretrial
hearings, the trial began Jan. 6 with testimony from Suffield,
Conn., police Officer David Reese, who made the arrests. Gritz is
being tried with Robinson, while Gritz's son is to be tried
separately.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz cuts the most imposing figure in the small courtroom, a
gray-haired, broad-shouldered man with a gold POW bracelet on his
wrist and two medals _ a combat infantry badge and one of his
Legion of Merit medals _ pinned to his lapel.
</P>
<P>
   Among a half-dozen or so spectators is his fourth wife, Judy,
whom he married four months ago in a ceremony officiated by a
pastor from the explicitly anti-Semitic Church of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz's lawyer, Kritzman, has sparred repeatedly with the state
prosecutor, John Malone, over Malone's attempts to show the jury of
six women and three men evidence of Gritz's training and political
views, which Kritzman calls irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in trying to introduce Gritz's martial-arts
background, Malone told Judge Nicola Rubinow he wanted to show that
Gritz ``would be the type of person who would be selected by Linda
Wiegand to undertake this kind of mission.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kritzman mocked Malone's effort as an attempt to suggest
that Gritz would have used martial arts to overpower a sixth-grade
student who tried to intervene with the alleged plot.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinow has ruled largely in Gritz's favor, finding last week
that the state ``hasn't shown a relationship between military or
paramilitary training in committing the crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear whether Gritz will testify at the trial; by some
accounts he wants to but his lawyer is against it.
</P>
<P>
   Among the spectators in court last week was Bob Noll of
Colorado, a white-bearded Gritz supporter who said he is a World
War II Navy veteran. ``I think Bo is an A-number-one man, and I see
no justification for these charges,'' Noll said.
</P>
<P>
   While Gritz remains a hero to some, his involvement with Wiegand
has caused a rift between him and other leaders of the Patriot
Movement who regard Wiegand as untrustworthy. She spent two years
on the run with her sons before linking up with Gritz.
</P>
<P>
   ``He refused to believe Linda was anything but the injured
party,'' said Clayton Douglas, publisher of ``The Free American''
magazine. ``At best, I'd like to believe he was duped.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gritz fights for his freedom, he will have to do so without
Wiegand. She has disappeared again, allegedly with thousands of
dollars of Patriot Movement contributions, rather than face a
related charge of custodial interference.

TRADITION HAS BEEN ELIMINATED FROM NFL PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Super Bowl Tournament has been pared to a final four . . .
the Tennessee Titans, Jacksonville Jaguars, St. Louis Rams, and
Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   Where have all the Cowboys gone?
</P>
<P>
   Yeesh. Tampa Bay, St. Louis, Nashville, and Jacksonville. How
did Hooterville, Dogpatch, and Bugtussle miss the cut?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but when the playoffs get to this stage,
I find myself looking for the Green Bay Packers, Chicago Bears,
Pittsburgh Steelers, and Dallas Cowboys. Where are Al Davis, Mike
Ditka, Don Shula, and Tom Landry? Where's the frozen tundra and the
Dawg Pound? Where are the Cowboy cheerleaders?
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's new world order is tough to digest for those who grew
up listening to Chris Schenkel describe the exploits of Y.A.
Tittle, Sam Huff, and Jimmy Brown. Starting with the Lions in Tiger
Stadium on Thanksgiving, late-season football was played outdoors
in cold climates by an assortment of Lions, Packers, and Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have the NFC championship being played indoors, and the
AFC title game in the tropical wasteland of Jacksonville, Fla. None
of the four cities left in the bakeoff has ever been represented in
a Super Bowl. Only Tampa has ever played host to a conference
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Any Given Sunday,'' Oliver Stone wasn't allowed to use NFL
names or logos. Stone gave us the Miami Sharks and Minnesota
Americans vying for a spot in the Pantheon Cup. That's what Titans
vs. Jags at Alltel Stadium looks and sounds like.
</P>
<P>
   This is the baseball equivalent of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays vs.
the Seattle Mariners in the ALCS, and the Florida Marlins vs. the
Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars didn't exist until 1995. The Titans were the Houston
Oilers until '97 and played as the Tennessee Oilers until this
year. The Rams were in Los Angeles until 1995. St. Louis, which
originally had the football Cardinals (now in Phoenix), never
hosted an NFL playoff game until last weekend. So of the remaining
four teams in the Super Bowl hunt, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are
most steeped in tradition. And what a tradition. The Bucs finished
in last place 11 times in their first quarter-century of existence
and didn't win their second game in January until last weekend.
Tampa would have to duplicate this year's 11-5 record for 18
consecutive seasons in order to get to .500 lifetime. Did anyone
say ``Los Angeles Clippers''?
</P>
<P>
   None of this should count against the worthy Rams, Jags, Titans,
and Bucs. It's just tough to think of an NFL playoff with so few
old-school representatives.
</P>
<P>
   As a sports town, St. Louis has the most history of the NFL's
Final Four. St. Louis had a nice century with the baseball
Cardinals, whose home baseball uniforms rival Detroit's for the
best in the game. St. Louis had Stan the Man, Bob Gibson, Dizzy
Dean, and most recently, Mark McGwire. It might be the best
baseball town in the States and had hoop and hockey success with
the Hawks and Blues. St. Louis gave Boston the draft rights to Bill
Russell and it was against the Blues that Bobby Orr won the Cup
with his flying-through-the-air goal in 1970. Let's not forgot that
the Patriots came close to moving to St. Louis before Bob Kraft
saved the day in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay has big league baseball and NHL hockey, but no
basketball and absolutely no winning tradition. It's home to Wade
Boggs, Dwight Gooden, and George Steinbrenner. It has strip malls,
strip clubs, and old people who left Northern neighborhoods to be
warm. And it has the Bucs _ who set the standard for NFL ineptitude
when they went 0-14 in their inaugural season in 1976. Tampa leads
the league in media members wearing team garb. Do you Yahoo?
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville is Worcester on the St. John River. It's what
Hartford would have been if Homer Simpson hadn't contaminated the
proposed Patriot site at Yo Adriaen's Landing. It isn't big league
in any other sport and has Tom Coughlin to thank for its premier
status in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville is Jacksonville without the sophistication. The
Titans, who were the Oilers, have played home games at Jeppensen
Stadium, Rice Stadium, and the Astrodome, all in Houston. In 1997
they were walking in Memphis at the Liberty Bowl, in '98 they
played at Vanderbilt Stadium in Nashville, and this year they moved
into Adelphia Coliseum, where they performed the miracle kickoff
lateral against Buffalo. Nashville has NHL hockey. If you know the
name of the team, you are a true Hockey Krishna.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams and Jags are this weekend's favorites, and the winners
will take their show to Atlanta. It matters little to those of us
who covet tradition. With Nashville, St. Louis, Jacksonville, and
Tampa Bay left in the mix, Super Bowl XXXIV is guaranteed to be
Yahoo Bowl I.

at the Seattle Labor Temple for a routine they have followed for
weeks: telephoning faithful Democrats to encourage them to vote for
the vice president in the Washington state caucus on March 7. By
contrast, Bill Bradley's campaign here has devoted only a week to
making telephone calls to identify its supporters. His fledgling
operation does not even have an office. The differences in the Gore

ONE PLACE RAMS CAN'T BE BEAT IS IN THE HELMET DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ A great example of the difference in sports between
the slick America of 2000 and the more basic world of half a
century ago will be apparent next Sunday when the Rams _ once of
Cleveland, then of Los Angeles and Anaheim, and now of St. Louis _
meet the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the uniforms. And, precisely, the helmets.
</P>
<P>
   It is not apocryphal that Eric Dickerson, when asked in 1983
what team he wanted to be drafted by out of SMU, said the Rams, for
a basic reason: ``I've always liked their helmets.''
</P>
<P>
   Who hasn't?
</P>
<P>
   At Rams headquarters in Earth City, Mo., there are pictures of
Rams of the distant past and Rams of the recent past, and all are
wearing the helmet with the horns on it. Bob Waterfield, Norm Van
Brocklin, Crazy Legs Hirsch, Jack Snow, Roman Gabriel, Pat Haden,
and, yes, Eric Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay will need a blizzard, a tornado, and perhaps an
earthquake or two to beat these Rams, one of the most explosive
teams in recent NFL history. As much of a handicap, though, might
be the ghastly uniforms, ghastly logo, and ghastly helmets that the
Buccaneers wear, all the creation of anonymous, modern, high-tech
graphics artists.
</P>
<P>
   In this area, for sure, the world has not improved in the last
half-century.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' horns, by contrast, were the creation of a decidedly
low-tech world, back when an individual's vision counted for so
much more than a computer's creation. The individual in question
was Clarence ``Fred'' Gerhke, a running back from Utah who played
with the Cleveland Rams in 1940 and then after World War II, from
1945-49, with the Los Angeles Rams. Gerhke was also a graphic
designer.
</P>
<P>
   Football teams back then did not have designs on their helmets,
which had just made the transition from leather to more protective
substances. But Los Angeles being Los Angeles, even in 1947, Gerhke
decided to add a touch of Hollywood style to the plain helmets the
Rams wore. That year, the Rams became the first team in pro
football to have anything on their helmets other than scratches.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhke designed a very basic, minimalist set of horns, a design
that most likely wouldn't pass muster with the high-tech artists of
today. Too simple. Too basic. Too plain.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but so perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, as Rams Mania swept over St. Louis, the art critic
of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Jeff Daniel, jumped into the
spirit. He not only defended the Ram horns as a true artistic
creation, but claimed that minimalism, op art, and pop art, all of
which followed Gerhke's creation by a decade or two, were
influenced by it.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel even cited artist Jasper Johns. ``It's long been a
rumor,'' wrote Daniel, ``but Johns supposedly said that `there are
three recognizable symbols in our culture, the American flag, the
circular target and . . . the Rams' helmet.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League lately has called on anonymous
high-tech artists to design or redesign team logos. The Patriots'
Elvis-as-patriotic-Superman is as forgettable as Seattle's seahawk,
but what defies description is Tampa Bay's depiction of a
buccaneer.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs may show that they deserve to be on the same AstroTurf
as the Rams _ not likely, but possible _ but in one area the Rams
are already _ and long have been _ in a class by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Their helmets.

in 1988 when I came to work at La Caravelle as a saucier. Not long
after that first taste I started trying to find a way to use the
same concept in a dish with Asian flavors. By Mark Bittman.
</P>
<P>
   WAITERWEAR (Undated) _ In this era of self-conscious
stylishness, waiterwear is expected to make as much of a design
statement as the matchbooks and barstools. It is now possible for
New York diners to confuse their server with a Buddhist priest, a
Benedictine monk, a garage mechanic, a chef, a dishwasher, or a
perfume ad. Anything but a waiter. By Rick Marin.

COUPLE SAY EXPERIENCE IN REMOTE PLACE IS BEST TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OPAN RUINAS, Honduras _ Friday, Alex Simon ruefully remembers,
is malaria pill day.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year-old from Newton, Mass. grinds up half a white tablet
into a teaspoon filled with orange jam. He grimaces, then downs it
as he stands in the dimly lit restaurant overlooking a town square
congested with cowboys, tiny children, and the occasional donkey.
He peers out the window when his younger brother, Ben, points out a
security guard sauntering down the street, shotgun slung across the
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   It's Day 40 of an education experiment that is pushing lessons
for Alex and his younger sister, Katie, 8 and brother, Ben, 6, out
of the classroom and into some of the most remote places on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when thousands of parents across the country are
opting for home schooling, the Simons are going a step further _
educating their children on the road, a self-styled ``adventure''
that includes some of the world's most underdeveloped places.
</P>
<P>
   Their philosophy is similar to those of other home schoolers:
They want to shape their children's lives in accordance with their
own values.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are living in Newton, the big deal can be who got the
latest Pokeman cards,'' said Dick Simon, a real estate developer
who spent a year with his wife backpacking around the world 15
years ago. ``We really believe the experiences (the children) have
will shape them.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when most parents agonize over how to protect their
children from the realities of the world, the elder Simons spent
more than a year devising a plan to expose their children to both
its starkness and richness as they travel through Central America,
Asia, Africa, and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the trip has been pockmarked with adventures of the
type most parents hope their young children never have to
experience: Thieves in Costa Rica made off with the children's
three backpacks. Among the losses were a beloved stuffed bear,
photographs of friends and favorite mementos from home.
</P>
<P>
   And danger _ from robberies to washed out roads from mudslides _
always lurks.
</P>
<P>
   But the rewards, the Simons say, will be enormous. The couple
passionately hope the trip will give their children a curiosity
that can't be found in traditional classrooms and a perspective
they'll carry for the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   They want their children to strengthen empathetic values,
realize how varied and large the world is, and embark on countless
explorations of everything from sloths to African anthropology. And
the family time, unrushed for so many months, is invaluable, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   The children spent September, October and most of November in
their classrooms at Cabot Elementary School in Newton to give them
a solid link to home, friends and the school while on the trip.
Then, lugging five pieces of luggage and two laptops, the family
left right after Thanksgiving and plan to return in late August.
</P>
<P>
   The family has a Web page _ www.simonfamily.org. Photos,
comments, and journal entries are posted regularly from the
children to classmates back home.
</P>
<P>
   There will be environmental lessons on the shores of Thailand
and cultural lessons in India's bustling small towns. Just last
week, they got a backstage view of tombs and hieroglyphics at
Copan's Mayan ruins from Newton neighbors who manage an
archeological project there.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Simons are not traveling in cocoons of
comfort in resort compounds and air-conditioned tour buses.
Instead, they are staying in local pensions and hotels to expose
their children to as much culture as possible. They change plans
when they hear of a compelling spot _ last week Mexico was delayed
five days so the family could go to an island off Honduras _ and
sometimes land in a strange country with no idea where they'll stay
for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Such travel remains a foreign concept for most American
families. Most couldn't afford the trip the Simons have embarked
on. But in many of the countries the Simons are traveling to, hotel
bills can run under $45 a night for a clean, safe room, and local
meals can run under $15 for the family.
</P>
<P>
   Expensive over time, the Simons say, but not impossible for many
upper middle class families for at least a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Education by experience, however, is traditionally reserved for
older American students in high school or college, after years in
classrooms building an academic foundation and putting the world in
context. Parents and educators appear divided over whether such an
adventure's good outweighs the danger of thrusting younger students
into a world before the child may be able to grasp the concept of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't go to Honduras because of the health risks, but I
see tremendous value in experiential learning and hands-on relative
to the real world,'' said Chuck Pretti, principal of the Lincoln
Street School in Northborough, Mass. ``I once took my kids out of
school to see whales beached on Cape Cod, and they learned more
that day than in school. But I see in a lot of parents . . . a
strong desire to protect their children from the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Simons gave up the idea of truly backpacking with the
children, traveling on local buses and staying in less expensive
hostels like they did 15 years ago. They are only upping it a notch
or two to ensure the children experience the world safely but as
realistically as possible.
</P>
<P>
   They have a backpack bulging with everything from Tylenol to
treatment for snakebites. Only the aspirin has been used so far.
The elder Simons spent weeks agonizing which shots and pills their
children should receive to protect them from dysentery and typhoid
while also preventing unnecessary doses of medicine that may have
harmful side effects.
</P>
<P>
   There only have been minor health problems like stomach aches
and the flu so far, says Alex, and the cool stuff he's seen far
outweighs those down times.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the most amazing thing the Simons have seen so far?
</P>
<P>
   ``A jaguar in the Osa Peninsula in Costa Rica,'' said Alex.
</P>
<P>
   The weirdest?
</P>
<P>
   ``People with shotguns everywhere,'' said Alex again.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's the women who are able to balance baskets on their
heads when they walk, said Ben.
</P>
<P>
   All solemnly agree the worst part of the trip was the first day
in Costa Rica when the family stopped to look at crocodiles off a
bridge shortly after 5 p.m. When they got back to their car, a
window was broken and three backbacks were taken.
</P>
<P>
   Ben cried. Timber, a stuffed bear his teacher had given him, was
taken, as were photos of all the children's friends and teachers.
So were home schooling packets for the first few weeks on the road.
</P>
<P>
   But the children recovered, they said, and even joke about it
now. The staff at the Cabot school re-sent pictures. The children
got new schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
   Homesickness rarely flares. Alex misses pizza. Katie likes to
remember her friends back home. A little tentative on the road,
Ben, a kindergartner, likes to make sure the family is together a
lot and in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Home and friends can also be fetched via the Web _ not
withstanding fallen phone lines or patchy connections.
</P>
<P>
   The children e-mail friends about Ben and Alex's birthday
parties, and in turn, their friends back home let them know the
latest news in the classroom and the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Academic lessons sometimes take a back seat to witnessing a
volcano or watching scarlet macaws, but the children catch up
during down times. The family practices letters and spelling with
Ben during long car rides from airports to rain forests or ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Alex already can recite scores of animal and insect names native
to Central America. The family stops at the sight of every strange
bug to analyze, remember, and later look up on the Web or in a book
if they can't readily identify it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as the family toured the Mayan ruins of Copan, the
children stood quietly, sometimes absorbing the tales of ball
courts, human sacrifices, and ancient rulers told by William and
Barbara Fash, the Simons' next-door neighbors in Newton.
</P>
<P>
   And as in any classroom, anywhere, the children sometimes simply
looked bored.

IN THE CBA, DJ LEARNS THE ABC'S OF COACHING 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA CROSSE, Wis. _ Time out. 6.7 seconds remaining in overtime.
99-99. The coach of the La Crosse Bobcats turns to Fort Wayne fans
Steve Jones and Pete Giokaris, seated in those Jack Nicholson kind
of seats adjacent to the Bobcats' bench, and says, ``Have you ever
had more fun than this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I remember a game against Detroit when Bird stole the
ball,' '' Jones answers.
</P>
<P>
   Good response. The head coach of the La Crosse Bobcats is Dennis
Johnson, whose personal happiness level rises significantly when La
Crosse forward Mark Davis tips in an errant shot at the buzzer to
give Coach Johnson and the rest of the Bobcats a satisfying 101-99
road victory over the Fort Wayne Fury.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't read about it, of course. This has all taken place in
the Continental Basketball Association, whose day-to-day activities
are not reported in any detail by the major media outlets of
America. But it was all very real to everyone concerned, perhaps no
one more than our old friend DJ, who is seizing this opportunity to
get himself back in the daily world of professional basketball with
all the enthusiasm of Gilbert Brown at an all-you-can-eat buffet.
</P>
<P>
   DJ was once in the loop. As an assistant coach in the Chris Ford
and M.L. Carr Boston regimes, he was gaining leaguewide respect for
both his diligence and intelligence. But he was swept out with the
tide when Rick Pitino arrived, and things got exponentially worse
on the afternoon of Oct. 20, 1997, when Orlando police responded to
a 911 call from DJ's frightened teenage son Dwayne, who had run
next door to report that his father had put his hands around his
mom's throat and was threatening her with a knife.
</P>
<P>
   This does not look good on your resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I feel bad about it?'' Johnson inquires. ``All the time.
It's not something that was pleasant for anybody. People say, `I'm
really surprised that anything like that ever happened.' I was,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fact: He did it. Fact: Donna Johnson never filed charges. Fact:
The Orange County state attorney's office dropped its case on Jan.
8, 1998, because neither Donna Johnson nor Dwayne Johnson wished to
pursue the case. Fact: Donna Johnson and children Denise, 7, and
David, 5, reside with DJ in West Salem, Wis. (Dwayne attends school
in Florida).
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Why didn't she leave you?' '' DJ continues. ``It
wasn't that simple. You've got to look at it this way: 22 years
invested in a marriage vs. 10 very bad minutes. I knew the next
year was going to be bad, and I knew it would be at least that long
before I worked again, but I decided I'd have to face the music. I
did my counseling. And I never hid. I went out. I went to Magic
games. All the time, I tried my best to repair the damage I did.''
</P>
<P>
   No one ever has said out loud that The Incident is being held
against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people do hold it against me, that's their problem now.''
he says. ``I'm doing my best to clear my name. But, overall, I
really think I'll get back into the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With or without The Incident on his record, another fact
remains: The La Crosse Bobcats represent Johnson's first head
coaching job at any level.
</P>
<P>
   And?
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of traits many NBA coaches wish they had,''
reports Bill Klucas, a dedicated basketball lifer who serves as a
combination assistant coach/traveling secretary/Yoda for both DJ in
particular and the franchise in general. ``He has the knack of
communication. It's the single biggest thing I found surprising in
him, and I think the players find it refreshing, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You always hear _ and I said it would never happen to me _ `I
don't know my role,' '' says DJ. ``That is a killer for a coach.
And it's not just a matter of saying, `This is what you should do,'
You've got to say, `What do you think of that?' And one thing I
didn't know before I took this job is how much of coaching at this
level would be about reassurance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such an intense player,'' analyzes cerebral forward
Brandon Williams, a Phillips Exeter and Davidson grad who had a
December sip of java with the Atlanta Hawks. ``I thought he would
be more of a bulldog on the sidelines. But we've learned that he
really knows how to relate to players. He talks to you the way
players talk to each other. He's not that far removed from the
game, and he still thinks a lot like a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that DJ could relate in a true sense to these players. After
all, we're talking about a five-time All-Star, a nine-time member
of either the first- or second-team All-Defensive squad, possessor
of three championships rings, and a man who was continually
referred to by Larry Bird as the ``best player I ever played
with.'' His inexplicable exclusion from the Hall of Fame is an
utter embarrassment. No La Crosse Bobcat of his will ever be half
the player Dennis Johnson was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't put myself in their shoes,'' he acknowledges. ``I was
a very good player, and I excelled also because I hustled all the
time. That's something a few of these guys have to learn. Every
time you're on the court you've got to leave it all on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   But the issue isn't developing Dennis Johnsons. The issue is
developing spare parts for the NBA. In some sense, every player
here is incomplete. He needs either one more skill or a better work
ethic or a different attitude in general. These people have all
been humbled and wounded, because until this point their athletic
lives have been ones of achievement and continual upward
progression. And when the big moment comes, and the NBA calls, more
disappointment awaits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very seldom you go there to be a star,'' DJ points out.
``You're going up to be a role player. There lies the problem with
a lot of them. They can't handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   A CBA squad is notoriously difficult to make into a legitimate
t-e-a-m, because every player in the league has the same thought;
namely, ``What can I do to get me out of here on the next plane?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jamel Thomas was called up by the Celtics,'' Johnson
explains, ``Dontae Jones went crazy. `I've got to call my lawyer
and have him get me out of here,' he was screaming. I told him,
`Dontae, there are two ways to get out of here. You can walk out,
or I can get you out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Every coach in the league tells a similar story. CBA players
scour the daily ``Transactions,'' and if a CBA player has received
an NBA call-up, it's an instant and major cell phone alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can they call him up? I kicked his butt in high school! I
kicked his butt in college! I kicked his butt in training camp! I
need to get me a new agent!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It could never be like college or the NBA,'' assesses
Williams, ``because everyone's ultimate goal is to get out of here.
I don't think anyone ever looks at the 56-game schedule and says,
`Let's hope we're No. 1 on April 1.' Everyone is thinking, `I hope
I'm in an NBA playoff game on April 1.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So a coach's task is to find some way to get 11 unhappy people
to put their personal agendas aside for at least two hours a few
times a week in order to put something together that looks like a
basketball team. If it happens, then the coach looks good, and
let's never forget that he has his agenda, too, and it seldom
involves buying, as opposed to renting, a house in La Crosse,
Yakima, Sioux Falls, or Fort Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like everyone else here,'' concedes DJ. ``The only
difference is they don't call up coaches at midseason, the way they
do players. I wish they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaching in the CBA is now an acceptable avenue toward an NBA
job. Phil Jackson, George Karl, and Flip Saunders are all CBA
alumni, and any of them could tell you that if you can coach in
this peculiar environment, you can coach anywhere. As Klucas, a
true CBA expert, explains, ``There are two basic rules in the CBA.
The first is that the only constant is change. The second is that
this truly is a `today' league. You can lose two players at 4
o'clock. You learn to make adjustments here. Look at Flip Saunders
(now coach of the Timberwolves). He's the personification of it. He
loses (Stephon) Marbury, and he goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all those NBA guys could do what Dennis is doing,''
asserts Klucas. ``Norm Van Lier lasted 12 games. And don't even get
me started about Rick Barry.''

ITALY MEETS CALIFORNIA AT ROSE PISTOLA
</HEADLINE>
 2 takes  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've visited San Francisco's North Beach in the last year
or two, you may have run into Rose Pistola, a restaurant that has
been packing in diners since chef and restaurateur Reed Hearon
opened it in 1996. Featuring North Beach-style Italian food, the
cooking and menu are influenced by California and Liguria (on the
Northwestern coast of Italy).
</P>
<P>
   ``What's evolved here is a cuisine that's simple, pristine and
at the same time very sophisticated. The nature of the food we do
is homestyle cooking,'' says the Texas native who came to San
Francisco more than a decade ago after honing his skills in
kitchens in Austin, Denver and Sante Fe.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant was named after Rose Pistola (who passed away in
1998 at the age of 90), a colorful and feisty women who owned a bar
and was renowned in North Beach for her Italian cooking. Her
Silician father was a fisherman, and her mother was a fantastic
cook. Hearon said he loved Rose's name, her attitude, her spirit
and her joyfulness. ``She personified what I love about the
neighborhood: its bawdy sense of history and its wry acknowledgment
that it's futile to take ourselves too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's possible to sample some of Hearon's restaurant fare
with a copy of his recently released ``The Rose Pistola Cookbook,''
co-written with Peggy Knickerbocker (Broadway Books; $35). It's
filled with 140 recipes _ mostly of dishes served at the restaurant
_ that evoke the spirit of North Beach and its Italian immigrant
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are signature dishes, including a colorful array of
antipasti. You'll see many of them displayed on oval platters at
the end of the open kitchen's counter when you enter the
restaurant. Featured are Marinated Olives, Shaved Artichoke With
Fava Beans and Parmesan, Shaved Raw Mushrooms, Endive and Parmesan
and Asparagus Carpaccio along with Skillet-Roasted Mussels,
Cioppino, Roasted Fish in a Salt Crust, Stuffed Focaccia, and Goat
Cheese and Roasted Pepper Pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Hearon has tried to keep the recipes simple. ``We geared them to
the home cook and regular folks _ and they are indicative of the
food we serve _ which is home food, not restaurant-style food. The
cooking techniques in the book are based on home-cooking traditions
_ nothing fancy, nothing complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   The recipes rely on readily available ingredients _ and when
testing the recipes, the authors shopped for ingredients in local
stores rather than using items from the restaurant's kitchen. There
are some exceptions _ and in this instance mail-order sources are
included for things like beans, specialty flours, organic polenta,
hand-crafted cheeses and Ligurian olive oils _ if you feel inclined
to go to these lengths. Otherwise, Hearon gives substitutes _ or
you might search out local Italian specialty stores for products he
mentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out of the way to test each recipe three times in a
home kitchen,'' Hearon said during a recent stopover in Los
Angeles. To test the recipes, ``Peggy (Knickerbocker) and I had
dinner once a week with friends at my house.'' Hearon ad-libbed or
cooked at home from written recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Hearon believes in using the freshest seasonal ingredients in
his creations and recommends that home cooks shop before making a
dish. They should buy what's fresh, in season, local and what
catches their fancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use the recipes as guides, improvising based on what you
bought.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the warm, savory dishes in the book begin by infusing
cold oil and cold aromatics such as onions and garlic in a cold pan
over medium-high heat, allowing the ingredients to warm up in the
oil. This way, garlic and onions won't burn. Once you have the
aromatic oil base, the main ingredient of the dish is added.
</P>
<P>
   Hearon recommends using a Ligurian oil _ one that is fruity,
ripe and both delicate and full of flavor _ as often as possible in
the book's recipes. Among his favorites are Roi Mosto, Raineri and
Isnardi. He also advises saving water from cooking pasta, beans,
potatoes and vegetables and refrigerating or freezing for future
use in sauces and other dishes to integrate and bring the dish
together.
</P>
<P>
   Another frugal trick is to save rinds from Parmigiano-Reggiano
cheese. Wrap them in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator to
throw into a pot of bean soup without fish _ or to enhance other
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   He also prefers cooking with sea salt because it has a broader,
more complex range of flavors than table salt. However you can
substitute kosher salt.
</P>
<P>
   Tempt diners with this sampling of dishes from ``The Rose
Pistola Cookbook.'' You're in for some delicious eating. &QL;

MARINATED OLIVES 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Serve these with drinks before lunch or dinner. Offer a little
dish alongside for the pits. It is nice to include an assortment of
olives,with some green Bella di Cerignola mixed in with a variety
of black olives, because they look and taste so good. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound assorted olives, such as Nicoise, Gaeta, San Remo and
green olives, such as Bella di Cerignola OR Picholine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound sun-dried tomatoes, thinly sliced &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grated peel of 1 lemon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fresh basil leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drain olives and toss in a bowl with sun-dried tomatoes, olive
oil, lemon peel, garlic and basil. These can be served after
marinating overnight in refrigerator or stored for 2 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bring back to room temperature before serving. Makes 8 to 12
servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TUNA TAPENADE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This flavorful, versatile spread can be served on crostini or on
flatbread or as a dip for raw vegetables. However you plan on using
it, the flavorful spread will keep well under a float of a few
tablespoons of olive oil, well covered, in the refrigerator for up
to two weeks. Bring it back to room temperature before using. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup pitted Nicoise olives &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup pitted green olives &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons capers, drained &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon thyme leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon chopped rosemary leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 (6 1/2-ounce) can Italian olive-oil-packed tuna, drained &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grated peel and juice of 1 lemon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Cognac &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pulse olives, garlic, capers and herbs together in a food
processor. Then pulse in tuna until combined.
</P>
<P>
   Place tuna mixture in a bowl and add lemon peel, lemon juice and
Cognac. Slowly mix in olive oil, a little at a time, until tapenade
has a coarse texture. It should not be smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Cover and refrigerate until needed. Serve at room temperature.
Makes about 1 1/2 cups. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CROSTINI OF ASPARAGUS, PROSCIUTTO AND TELEME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this antipasto the asparagus is grilled, taking on a slightly
bitter, smoky flavor.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a grill lighted and ready, you can use a
stovetop grill pan or a very hot oven. Make this to nibble on while
you fix the rest of the meal. It only takes 10 minutes from start
to finish. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   12 thick asparagus spears, trimmed to about 5 inches long OR 20
pencil asparagus spears &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 long slices country-style bread, same length as asparagus &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound ripe teleme OR crescenza cheese &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 thin slices prosciutto &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a medium-hot fire in a grill, preheat stovetop grill pan
or preheat oven to 550 degrees F (or to highest setting).
</P>
<P>
   Toss asparagus with oil, then season to taste with salt and
pepper. Place asparagus on grill rack, in grill pan or on a sheet
pan in oven and cook, turning frequently, until nicely browned,
about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, toast bread on grill rack or in grill pan or oven,
turning once, until golden on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, spread each piece of toast with a thick layer of
cheese. Lay prosciutto on top and arrange grilled asparagus over
it. Makes 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MUSSEL, BROCCOLI AND POTATO SALAD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This unusual combination of flavors and textures is one of the
most deeply satisfying, warming combinations. This dish is served
as an antipasto or as a main course at Rose Pistola.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans are in the habit of barely blanching broccoli in
boiling water to cook it, but by slowly braising the broccoli its
flavors mellow and soften and gently combine with the potatoes and
mussels. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound Yellow Finn potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch
slices &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 large head broccoli, preferably romanesco OR purple Venetian,
cut into florets (reserve stalks for another use) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Water &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 anchovy fillets, chopped OR 1 tablespoon anchovy paste &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, crushed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pinch crushed red pepper flakes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound mussels, scrubbed and beards removed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dry Italian white wine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Small handful flat-leaf parsley leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a heavy flameproof casserole with a tight-fitting lid,
combine potatoes, broccoli, 2 tablespoons olive oil and 3
tablespoons water. Cover and cook over medium-low heat, without
stirring, until potatoes are tender, about 25 minutes. Drain and
toss in a salad bowl with remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, anchovies,
vinegar, garlic and crushed red pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, put mussels and white wine in a large saute pan with
a tight-fitting lid, cover and steam mussels until open over high
heat 2 to 3 minutes. Discard any that do not open.
</P>
<P>
   Add mussels and 1/4 cup steaming liquid to potato and broccoli
mixture. Toss, season to taste and toss again. Serve warm or at
room temperature, garnished with parsley. Serve mussels in shells
or remove them. Makes 4 first-course servings or 2 main-dish
servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SWORDFISH BROCHETTES WITH SALSA VERDE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When days are mild, grill these brochettes over a charcoal fire.
In the winter, you can cook them on a stovetop grill pan, although
you'll miss the flavor from the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Firm fish, such as sea bass, mackerel, salmon, mahi mahi or
halibut can be substituted. If you do not have rosemary stems for
skewering the fish, you will need to soak wooden skewers in water
for about 30 minutes before skewering so they won't burn on the
grill &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SALSA VERDE: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup loosely packed flat-leaf parsley leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon capers, rinsed and drained &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon red wine vinegar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 anchovy fillets &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dried bread crumbs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BROCHETTES: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound swordfish steak &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 sprigs rosemary (6 inches long) OR 8 wooden skewers, soaked in
water 30 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Salsa Verde, combine all salsa ingredients in a blender or
food processor and process until smooth. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   For Brochettes, prepare a fire in a charcoal grill or heat an
oiled stovtop grill pan over medium-high heat. Cut fish into
bite-size pieces, about 1x1- inch. Place fish in a bowl, add olive
oil and salt and pepper to taste and toss to coat. Thread 1 or 2
pieces of fish onto rosemary or wooden skewers.
</P>
<P>
   Place brochettes on oiled grill rack 6 to 8 inches above hot
coals and cook, turning to brown on all sides, until nearly opaque
throughout, about 1 minute per side. Or, cook brochettes on
stovetop grill pan about 1 to 3 minutes on each side.
</P>
<P>
   Serve at once on individual plates with Salsa Verde spooned over
top. Makes 4 appetizer servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Double salsa recipe and triple brochettes recipe and
thread more fish pieces on skewers if planning to serve 3 to 4 as a
main dish. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED SEA BASS WITH WILD MUSHROOMS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A variety of mushrooms would work well in this dish, such as
chanterelles, crimini or morels. If you cannot find these mushrooms
in your local market, try the dish with portobellos (with the black
gills trimmed off) or button mushrooms. Any firm mild fish, such as
halibut, that will not overpower the flavor of the mushrooms can be
substituted for the sea bass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig rosemary (about 6 inches long) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mushrooms, such as chanterelle, porcini, morel, crimini,
portobello OR button, cleaned (black gills trimmed off, if using
portobellos) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry Italian white wine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 (6-ounce) sea bass fillets &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a flameproof baking dish or ovenproof skillet just large
enough to hold fish, warm 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high
heat. Add garlic, rosemary and mushrooms and cook until mushrooms
start to brown, about 10 minutes. Add white wine and bring to a
simmer.
</P>
<P>
   Tuck fish fillets under mushrooms and season with salt.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 500-degree oven about 10 minutes or until just
cooked through.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with a drizzle of remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Makes
4 servings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SHAVED ARTICHOKES WITH FAVA BEANS AND PARMESAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is one of the most irresistible antipasti served at Rose
Pistola. Artichokes are very versatile and when thinly shaved and
served raw, they are delicious. Their crunchy, slightly bitter
flavor stimulates the appetite and palate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Water &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, halved, plus a few drops additional lemon juice &QL;
</P>
<P>
   16 baby artichokes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup fava beans &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4-pound wedge Parmigiano-Reggiano &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fill a large bowl with water and squeeze in juice from lemon,
then toss in squeezed halves. Peel off and discard outer leaves
from each artichoke until you reach part that is yellowish-green.
Trim off top, peel off tough outer layer at bottom and cut
artichoke in half lengthwise. Remove small thistle if it has
started to form in middle. As each artichoke is trimmed, place in
lemon water.
</P>
<P>
   When all artichokes are prepared, pour olive oil in a serving
bowl. Drain artichokes and lay halves, cut- side down, on a cutting
board, and, using a sharp stainless steel knife, slice into
lengthwise slices as thin as possible. Alternately, you can shave
them with a mandoline, being very careful of your fingertips. Put
slices in bowl with olive oil as you finish them, tossing to coat
to prevent discoloration.
</P>
<P>
   Add fava beans, toss well and season with salt and pepper and a
few drops lemon juice. Shave shards of cheese over top with a
vegetable peeler and serve. Makes 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SKILLET-ROASTED MUSSELS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mussels appear in cameo roles in cioppinos, pastas and
sandwiches, but at Rose Pistola, they star, pure and simple, on a
searing-hot plancha or iron skillet. This signature dish is one of
the simplest, most satisfying dishes and it's very easy to prepare
at home. The mussels' own juices provide the lovely smoky flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Today, much of the mussel crop is aquacultivated in Washington
State or along the East Coast. These cleaned and debearded mussels
generally can be purchased in little net bags. There are some great
planchas available in restaurant supply stores and gourmet stores.
They come with small wooden boards upon which rest the hot skillet
at the table and make for a great, straightforward presentation.
You can always use a cast- iron skillet.
</P>
<P>
   A chilled bottle of Barbera from California or Italy is just the
thing to go with mussels. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mussels, scrubbed and beards removed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heat plancha or cast-iron skillet over high heat (or over a hot
wood fire) until extremely hot; when a bead of water dances across
surface, it is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Spread mussels in one layer in pan: The heat will cause mussels
to open. Their juices will first pool and then burn on surface of
pan, at which point they are ready to serve, 4 to 5 minutes cooking
time. Discard any mussels that do not open.
</P>
<P>
   Season mussels generously with salt and pepper and serve from
pan at table, with melted butter on side. Makes 2 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED CHICKEN WITH TURNIPS, POTATOES AND CARROTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those dishes that evolved as a result of a trip
to the market when I was very hungry and in the mood to cook
something easy and all in one pot. It was the dead of winter and
the produce section was not terribly inspiring, but there were
beautiful baby turnips with their greens, potatoes, kale and dark
orange carrots. While this recipe should be enough for four, it was
so good that two of us ate it all up that night. For the cooking
wine, in the spirit of frugal North Beach cooks, you can use half a
bottle of leftover wine _ red or white, whatever you have. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces pancetta, cut into 1/4x1-inch strips &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig rosemary (about 6 inches long) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch kale, trimmed and coarsely chopped &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch baby turnips, greens removed and chopped and turnips
halved &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 large carrots, peeled and cut into chunks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 Yellow Finn potatoes, peeled and quartered &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 large chicken (3 to 4 pounds), quartered &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups (1/2 bottle) dry red OR white wine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a large heavy casserole, cook pancetta in olive oil over
medium-high heat until it renders its fat. Add garlic and rosemary
and cook until fragrant. Add kale, turnips, turnip greens, carrots
and potatoes. Season with salt and saute 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Generously season chicken with salt and pepper. Pour wine over
vegetables and reduce by 1/3. Put chicken legs and thigh quarters
on top of vegetables, reduce heat to low, tightly cover and cook 5
minutes. Add chicken breasts, cover and continue to cook until
chicken is tender and juices run clear, about 35 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Pour broth off vegetables and retain. Skim off any fat. Season
to taste. With a slotted spoon, arrange vegetables on a serving
platter and place chicken on top. Spoon broth (without fat) over
all. Makes 2 to 4 servings. &QL;

&HT;     SAN ANTONIO ZOO OFFERS A WARM LOVE NEST FOR THE ANIMAL
KINGDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JACQUE CROUSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ San Antonio is a romantic city. Strolls on the
River Walk. Moonlit rides in horse-drawn carriages. Leisurely
drinks and meals at patio cafes.
</P>
<P>
   Or an intimate tryst in a dusty exhibit at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the San Antonio Zoo is a productive honeymoon spot for
the animal kingdom. It was the first zoo to successfully breed
white rhinos in the 1960s, and has since proved one of the most
prolific breeding grounds for the endangered snow leopard.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo helped breed golden lion tamarins, which have been
released to restart wild populations in Brazil, and was a factor in
the resurgence of the Arabian oryx.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably because of the climate, we do well as a breeding
zoo,'' said Terry Fisher, a zoologist who keeps records of all
movements of animals to and from the San Antonio Zoo. ``Zoos all
across the country do this. We all help breed many types of
animals. The American Zoological and Aquarium Association has
committees of experts which decide who needs to be bred, when and
where, in order to keep populations alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even the experts can predict chemistry, and sometimes this
zoological match-making does not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like people who date, sometimes the animals just take one
look at each other and are not interested,'' Fisher said.
``Luckily, it doesn't happen that often.''
</P>
<P>
   While a handful of animals may need a cooler climate to breed,
those are few and far between, Fisher said. Even snow leopards, it
seems, prefer this balmy habitat to their cold native soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be like a honeymoon vacation to Bermuda for them to
come here, because they breed like crazy,'' Fisher said. ``Since
1970, 58 cubs have been born here. They have been shipped to places
like Japan, Finland and Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   The zoo's young Sumatran tiger cubs, Maluka Khan and Melu Khan,
are the progeny of the San Antonio meeting of father Manfred from
the Rotterdam Zoo and mother Malaya from the San Diego Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher explained that the experts on tiger populations decided
Manfred and Malaya should breed, and they picked San Antonio as the
place.
</P>
<P>
   Now, mother and cubs remain together while Manfred is in a
separate area. Big cats are much the same as their household
counterparts in that males may kill their young offspring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only 50 Sumatran tigers left in the wild, and 250 in
captivity,'' Fisher said. ``After the cubs are older, we will move
them and mate the parents again, probably in March. It's a good
step in assuring the survival of the subspecies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, animals were bred in captivity with the aim of
releasing them into the wild, but Fisher said that is becoming less
likely in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Brazil a couple of years ago working with the man who
was releasing the golden lion tamarins,'' he said. ``They were
trying to find real estate to buy to be able to release more. But
there was no land to be had. The wild areas, which are the
tamarins' natural habitat, are pretty much gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The other obstacle to endangered species being released in the
wild is poachers. Fisher said poachers are the primary reason for
the demise of various rhino species.
</P>
<P>
   ``The herds of Arabian oryx that were released on the Arabian
Peninsula are guarded, 24 hours a day, by soldiers carrying
automatic weapons,'' Fisher said. ``Before, the goal was always to
release back into the wild. Now, we realize that may not always be
the best idea.''

MARINATED OLIVES 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Serve these with drinks before lunch or dinner. Offer a little
dish alongside for the pits. It is nice to include an assortment of
olives,with some green Bella di Cerignola mixed in with a variety
of black olives, because they look and taste so good. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound assorted olives, such as Nicoise, Gaeta, San Remo and
green olives, such as Bella di Cerignola OR Picholine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound sun-dried tomatoes, thinly sliced &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grated peel of 1 lemon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fresh basil leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drain olives and toss in a bowl with sun-dried tomatoes, olive
oil, lemon peel, garlic and basil. These can be served after
marinating overnight in refrigerator or stored for 2 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bring back to room temperature before serving. Makes 8 to 12
servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TUNA TAPENADE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This flavorful, versatile spread can be served on crostini or on
flatbread or as a dip for raw vegetables. However you plan on using
it, the flavorful spread will keep well under a float of a few
tablespoons of olive oil, well covered, in the refrigerator for up
to two weeks. Bring it back to room temperature before using. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup pitted Nicoise olives &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup pitted green olives &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons capers, drained &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon thyme leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon chopped rosemary leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 (6 1/2-ounce) can Italian olive-oil-packed tuna, drained &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grated peel and juice of 1 lemon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Cognac &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pulse olives, garlic, capers and herbs together in a food
processor. Then pulse in tuna until combined.
</P>
<P>
   Place tuna mixture in a bowl and add lemon peel, lemon juice and
Cognac. Slowly mix in olive oil, a little at a time, until tapenade
has a coarse texture. It should not be smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Cover and refrigerate until needed. Serve at room temperature.
Makes about 1 1/2 cups. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CROSTINI OF ASPARAGUS, PROSCIUTTO AND TELEME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this antipasto the asparagus is grilled, taking on a slightly
bitter, smoky flavor.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a grill lighted and ready, you can use a
stovetop grill pan or a very hot oven. Make this to nibble on while
you fix the rest of the meal. It only takes 10 minutes from start
to finish. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   12 thick asparagus spears, trimmed to about 5 inches long OR 20
pencil asparagus spears &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 long slices country-style bread, same length as asparagus &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound ripe teleme OR crescenza cheese &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 thin slices prosciutto &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a medium-hot fire in a grill, preheat stovetop grill pan
or preheat oven to 550 degrees F (or to highest setting).
</P>
<P>
   Toss asparagus with oil, then season to taste with salt and
pepper. Place asparagus on grill rack, in grill pan or on a sheet
pan in oven and cook, turning frequently, until nicely browned,
about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, toast bread on grill rack or in grill pan or oven,
turning once, until golden on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, spread each piece of toast with a thick layer of
cheese. Lay prosciutto on top and arrange grilled asparagus over
it. Makes 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MUSSEL, BROCCOLI AND POTATO SALAD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This unusual combination of flavors and textures is one of the
most deeply satisfying, warming combinations. This dish is served
as an antipasto or as a main course at Rose Pistola.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans are in the habit of barely blanching broccoli in
boiling water to cook it, but by slowly braising the broccoli its
flavors mellow and soften and gently combine with the potatoes and
mussels. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound Yellow Finn potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch
slices &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 large head broccoli, preferably romanesco OR purple Venetian,
cut into florets (reserve stalks for another use) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Water &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 anchovy fillets, chopped OR 1 tablespoon anchovy paste &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, crushed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pinch crushed red pepper flakes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound mussels, scrubbed and beards removed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dry Italian white wine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Small handful flat-leaf parsley leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a heavy flameproof casserole with a tight-fitting lid,
combine potatoes, broccoli, 2 tablespoons olive oil and 3
tablespoons water. Cover and cook over medium-low heat, without
stirring, until potatoes are tender, about 25 minutes. Drain and
toss in a salad bowl with remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, anchovies,
vinegar, garlic and crushed red pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, put mussels and white wine in a large saute pan with
a tight-fitting lid, cover and steam mussels until open over high
heat 2 to 3 minutes. Discard any that do not open.
</P>
<P>
   Add mussels and 1/4 cup steaming liquid to potato and broccoli
mixture. Toss, season to taste and toss again. Serve warm or at
room temperature, garnished with parsley. Serve mussels in shells
or remove them. Makes 4 first-course servings or 2 main-dish
servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SWORDFISH BROCHETTES WITH SALSA VERDE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When days are mild, grill these brochettes over a charcoal fire.
In the winter, you can cook them on a stovetop grill pan, although
you'll miss the flavor from the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Firm fish, such as sea bass, mackerel, salmon, mahi mahi or
halibut can be substituted. If you do not have rosemary stems for
skewering the fish, you will need to soak wooden skewers in water
for about 30 minutes before skewering so they won't burn on the
grill &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SALSA VERDE: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup loosely packed flat-leaf parsley leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon capers, rinsed and drained &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon red wine vinegar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 anchovy fillets &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dried bread crumbs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BROCHETTES: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound swordfish steak &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 sprigs rosemary (6 inches long) OR 8 wooden skewers, soaked in
water 30 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Salsa Verde, combine all salsa ingredients in a blender or
food processor and process until smooth. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   For Brochettes, prepare a fire in a charcoal grill or heat an
oiled stovtop grill pan over medium-high heat. Cut fish into
bite-size pieces, about 1x1- inch. Place fish in a bowl, add olive
oil and salt and pepper to taste and toss to coat. Thread 1 or 2
pieces of fish onto rosemary or wooden skewers.
</P>
<P>
   Place brochettes on oiled grill rack 6 to 8 inches above hot
coals and cook, turning to brown on all sides, until nearly opaque
throughout, about 1 minute per side. Or, cook brochettes on
stovetop grill pan about 1 to 3 minutes on each side.
</P>
<P>
   Serve at once on individual plates with Salsa Verde spooned over
top. Makes 4 appetizer servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Double salsa recipe and triple brochettes recipe and
thread more fish pieces on skewers if planning to serve 3 to 4 as a
main dish. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED SEA BASS WITH WILD MUSHROOMS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A variety of mushrooms would work well in this dish, such as
chanterelles, crimini or morels. If you cannot find these mushrooms
in your local market, try the dish with portobellos (with the black
gills trimmed off) or button mushrooms. Any firm mild fish, such as
halibut, that will not overpower the flavor of the mushrooms can be
substituted for the sea bass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig rosemary (about 6 inches long) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mushrooms, such as chanterelle, porcini, morel, crimini,
portobello OR button, cleaned (black gills trimmed off, if using
portobellos) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry Italian white wine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 (6-ounce) sea bass fillets &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a flameproof baking dish or ovenproof skillet just large
enough to hold fish, warm 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high
heat. Add garlic, rosemary and mushrooms and cook until mushrooms
start to brown, about 10 minutes. Add white wine and bring to a
simmer.
</P>
<P>
   Tuck fish fillets under mushrooms and season with salt.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 500-degree oven about 10 minutes or until just
cooked through.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with a drizzle of remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Makes
4 servings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SHAVED ARTICHOKES WITH FAVA BEANS AND PARMESAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is one of the most irresistible antipasti served at Rose
Pistola. Artichokes are very versatile and when thinly shaved and
served raw, they are delicious. Their crunchy, slightly bitter
flavor stimulates the appetite and palate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Water &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, halved, plus a few drops additional lemon juice &QL;
</P>
<P>
   16 baby artichokes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup fava beans &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4-pound wedge Parmigiano-Reggiano &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fill a large bowl with water and squeeze in juice from lemon,
then toss in squeezed halves. Peel off and discard outer leaves
from each artichoke until you reach part that is yellowish-green.
Trim off top, peel off tough outer layer at bottom and cut
artichoke in half lengthwise. Remove small thistle if it has
started to form in middle. As each artichoke is trimmed, place in
lemon water.
</P>
<P>
   When all artichokes are prepared, pour olive oil in a serving
bowl. Drain artichokes and lay halves, cut- side down, on a cutting
board, and, using a sharp stainless steel knife, slice into
lengthwise slices as thin as possible. Alternately, you can shave
them with a mandoline, being very careful of your fingertips. Put
slices in bowl with olive oil as you finish them, tossing to coat
to prevent discoloration.
</P>
<P>
   Add fava beans, toss well and season with salt and pepper and a
few drops lemon juice. Shave shards of cheese over top with a
vegetable peeler and serve. Makes 4 servings. &QL;

   SKILLET-ROASTED MUSSELS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mussels appear in cameo roles in cioppinos, pastas and
sandwiches, but at Rose Pistola, they star, pure and simple, on a
searing-hot plancha or iron skillet. This signature dish is one of
the simplest, most satisfying dishes and it's very easy to prepare
at home. The mussels' own juices provide the lovely smoky flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Today, much of the mussel crop is aquacultivated in Washington
State or along the East Coast. These cleaned and debearded mussels
generally can be purchased in little net bags. There are some great
planchas available in restaurant supply stores and gourmet stores.
They come with small wooden boards upon which rest the hot skillet
at the table and make for a great, straightforward presentation.
You can always use a cast- iron skillet.
</P>
<P>
   A chilled bottle of Barbera from California or Italy is just the
thing to go with mussels. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mussels, scrubbed and beards removed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heat plancha or cast-iron skillet over high heat (or over a hot
wood fire) until extremely hot; when a bead of water dances across
surface, it is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Spread mussels in one layer in pan: The heat will cause mussels
to open. Their juices will first pool and then burn on surface of
pan, at which point they are ready to serve, 4 to 5 minutes cooking
time. Discard any mussels that do not open.
</P>
<P>
   Season mussels generously with salt and pepper and serve from
pan at table, with melted butter on side. Makes 2 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED CHICKEN WITH TURNIPS, POTATOES AND CARROTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those dishes that evolved as a result of a trip
to the market when I was very hungry and in the mood to cook
something easy and all in one pot. It was the dead of winter and
the produce section was not terribly inspiring, but there were
beautiful baby turnips with their greens, potatoes, kale and dark
orange carrots. While this recipe should be enough for four, it was
so good that two of us ate it all up that night. For the cooking
wine, in the spirit of frugal North Beach cooks, you can use half a
bottle of leftover wine _ red or white, whatever you have. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces pancetta, cut into 1/4x1-inch strips &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig rosemary (about 6 inches long) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch kale, trimmed and coarsely chopped &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch baby turnips, greens removed and chopped and turnips
halved &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 large carrots, peeled and cut into chunks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 Yellow Finn potatoes, peeled and quartered &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 large chicken (3 to 4 pounds), quartered &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups (1/2 bottle) dry red OR white wine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a large heavy casserole, cook pancetta in olive oil over
medium-high heat until it renders its fat. Add garlic and rosemary
and cook until fragrant. Add kale, turnips, turnip greens, carrots
and potatoes. Season with salt and saute 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Generously season chicken with salt and pepper. Pour wine over
vegetables and reduce by 1/3. Put chicken legs and thigh quarters
on top of vegetables, reduce heat to low, tightly cover and cook 5
minutes. Add chicken breasts, cover and continue to cook until
chicken is tender and juices run clear, about 35 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Pour broth off vegetables and retain. Skim off any fat. Season
to taste. With a slotted spoon, arrange vegetables on a serving
platter and place chicken on top. Spoon broth (without fat) over
all. Makes 2 to 4 servings. &QL;

&HT;     EDITOR FACES JAIL TIME FOR PROTECTING SOURCES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC BRAZIL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The editor and publisher of a small-town
newspaper in Northern California is prepared to spend five days in
jail rather than reveal the names of two confidential sources five
years after they told him that a lawman was suspected of stealing a
pistol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being held in contempt of court for refusing to name
sources on a story I didn't run until four years later,'' said an
unrepentant Tim Crews, 57. ``Is that not bizarre?''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Tehama County Superior Court Judge Noel Watkins found
Crews in contempt last week. Sentencing was delayed until Friday,
when Crews re-takes the witness stand in the preliminary hearing
for Highway Patrol officer Dewey Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is accused of grand theft of a .38-caliber pistol,
receiving stolen property and possessing a weapon with an
obliterated serial number. He has pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The weapon was seized as evidence by the Tehama County
Interagency Drug Enforcement Unit. Anderson, who was then the
county's undersheriff, said it accidentally became mixed in with
his personal equipment, and he forgot to return it when he left the
unit in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The pistol popped up last year in the possession of the
boyfriend of Anderson's daughter at a Shasta County high school,
and it was traced to Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Crews recently wrote an article in his twice-weekly Sacramento
Valley Mirror mentioning that he had been tipped off in 1995 by two
law enforcement officers who said that Anderson had stolen the
pistol, but that he did not report the tip at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I had enough information to say the
undersheriff is a thief,'' Crews said Monday. One of the officers
actually read him a report written on the loss of the weapon that
had been sent to then-Glenn County Sheriff Kevin Donnelly, he said.
``But I never saw a copy of the report.''
</P>
<P>
   Crews' disclosure that he had received a tip about the theft was
seized upon by Anderson's lawyer, William Malloy of Redding, who
contends that it proves that officials knew about the theft more
than four years ago and that the statute of limitations on the
felony grand theft charge has expired.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins ordered Crews to disclose the names of his informants,
adding: ``I make a finding that revealing your sources will not
impair your news gathering ability.''
</P>
<P>
   When Crews refused, the judge found him in contempt of court and
sentenced him to five days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our part of the world _ Glenn County has only 27,000 people
_ we have to have confidential sources. If we don't use them, we'd
have to go back to just printing pablum, but we're expected to
report the news and raise hell. ... I'm not giving up these
sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Crews, who has edited and published the Valley Mirror in the
little Glenn County town of Artois since 1991, is a former editor
for newspapers in Aberdeen and Olympia, Wash. In 1997, he was a
winner of the First Amendment Coalition's Beacon Award for
courageous reporting.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Crews has not been represented by a lawyer. He said he
would have to address that problem fast. ``I won't be going there
(court) naked on Friday,'' he said.

   WAR-CRIMINALS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Five years ago Nazi
hunter Eli Rosenbaum sat in the Fort Myers, Fla., airport amid a

homebuilder, the grandfather had fled his adopted country and
retired to Marco Island after Canadian officials discovered he once
belonged to a Nazi death squad under the notorious Einsatzgruppen.
Now Rosenbaum, having obtained deportation orders, was escorting
Helmut Oberlander out of the country. Like other snowbirds, Nazis
have flocked to this sunny land of leisure over the years. So, too,
have modern-day oppressors: Salvadoran generals accused of
orchestrating the murder of three nuns and a social worker, members
of Haiti's bloody paramilitary unit- FRAPH, which killed up to
6,000 in the early 1990s, and one of Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet's elite secret police, a squad responsible for at least 72
deaths. Many have been allowed into the U.S. because weak

MCCAIN'S TAX-CUT PROPOSAL LACKS COURAGE, INSIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT ROBB  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In his tax-cut speech, John McCain invoked the legacy
of Ronald Reagan while repudiating one of its central planks:
expanding economic growth by reducing marginal tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   And he called for courage on Social Security while demonstrating
none.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's tax-cut plan abandons Republican claims to be the party
of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the repeated canard that we are in the midst of an
``unprecedented'' economic expansion, this is an underperforming
economy. The Congressional Budget Office projects economic growth
of 2.5 percent a year. During the 50s and 60s, the economy grew at
a rate of 4 to 5 percent a year, and it grew nearly 4 percent a
year during the Reagan tax-cut era.
</P>
<P>
   While George W. Bush accepted the CBO estimate as a constraint
in fashioning his tax-cut plan, he made it clear in an interview
last month with ``''``The Arizona Republic'' editorial board that
his plan is designed, in part, to grow the economy more than that
through across-the-board reductions in marginal personal income tax
rates, returning them to near the Reagan levels.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's tax-cut plan is more of a social program than an
economic growth strategy. He expands the current 15 percent tax
bracket and includes a hodgepodge of other tax credits and breaks.
But he does nothing to reduce punitive and economically
unproductive high marginal tax rates, or percentage of tax paid on
the next dollar earned. Under current law, that can be as high as
39.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he cites the relatively minuscule tax relief his plan
offers high-income Americans compared to Bush's as one of its
virtues, and resorts to the language of economic envy by
dismissively referring, in one comparison, to a ``lucky
millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to someone whose only private sector experience consists
of a short stint in a makeshift job provided by his father-in-law,
it seems that people become millionaires in America through luck.
In reality, most millionaires in America get there through hard
work, by creating a product or service people want, and by
providing employment and economic opportunity to others.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's populist cant betrays an ignorance of the stake low-
and middle-income Americans have in economic expansion fueled by
reductions in high marginal tax rates. Real incomes for both groups
increased more during the Reagan tax-cut era than they have during
the current expansion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain asserts that Bush's tax cut is fiscally irresponsible
because it largely consumes the projected non-Social Security
surplus over the next decade. McCain says he would use 62 percent
of that surplus to pay Social Security benefits when Social
Security taxes will no long cover the bill, currently projected to
occur sometime after 2014.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain doesn't say exactly how he proposes to save today's
surplus to pay tomorrow's Social Security benefits, undercutting
his claim to be responsible and courageous on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Unless something is done with surplus monies, 100 percent of
them will go to reducing the federal debt, not just the 5 percent
McCain says he intends to be used for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also proposes using non-Social Security
surpluses to pay future Social Security benefits, but he has
identified a mechanism by which to do it: Put the surpluses in the
Social Security Trust Fund and invest them in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   That would give the federal government a large position in the
equity and debt of American companies, a dangerous federal presence
in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   This would be hugely unpopular with Republican primary voters,
but it is difficult to see how McCain can use near-term non-Social
Security surpluses to pay long-term Social Security benefits
without doing something similar.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said his tax-cut plan was also crafted to help young
people ``threatened by a potential future of crushing debt of $5.6
trillion.'' Yet his plan would reduce the cumulative national debt
only by about 1 percent over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of saddling young people with a $5.6 trillion debt,
McCain would saddle them with a $5.54 trillion debt. Why? So McCain
can pander to the senior vote, promising no reduction in Social
Security benefits ever, regardless of how small the reduction, or
how wealthy the senior.
</P>
<P>
   In this speech, McCain proved that when it comes to tax cuts,
he's no Ronald Reagan. And when it comes to Social Security reform,
he's no profile in courage. &QL;

CUBAN DAD CAN'T MATCH UNCLE SAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
   
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
 (EDITORS: This article also moving in the ``K'' category)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Them communists in Cuba still don't get it so I figure we have
no choice but to send in the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   That's about the only way we'll convince every cussed madre and
padre on the island to hand over their children so we can ship 'em
north to be raised properly in the land of the free and the home of
the Atlanta Braves. Or, in the case of young Elian Gonzalez, the
Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Marxist muchachos seem to believe a boy is better
off living in the home of his father rather than here, the Home of
the Whopper.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, some bureaucrats in the U.S. government agree
with the reds. They want to ship the 6-year-old back, talking
nonsense about how Elian's father loves him and wants him home.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you and I and every other real live nephew of our
Uncle Sam must let the Cubans know the only people capable of
raising a child are Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't tell 'em about Elizabeth Whittle.
</P>
<P>
   She's an American mother in Phoenix going to jail for 172{ years
for brutalizing her beautiful baby quadruplets. No need to bore the
Bolsheviks with little problems like that.
</P>
<P>
   All we need to do is tell 'em how much better it is for every
child in America than it is for every child in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   There's no reason to mention Patricia Moreno Oakes, the mother
from Phoenix who turned her 6-year-old daughter into a prostitute
to feed her drug habit.
</P>
<P>
   Also, please, don't bring up the unfortunate story of
6-month-old Denzel Garland, a Phoenix boy who was left in the care
of a teenage cousin only to wind up dead in a dumpster with his
throat slashed.
</P>
<P>
   Those examples are from just one city. Imagine how confusing it
will be if reports from other towns start leaking out? Instead,
simply remind the honchos in Havana about our shopping malls and
video games and Peter Piper Pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   We're under no obligation to tell them about the National Center
for Injury and Prevention Council report showing how unintentional
and intentional firearm injuries are the leading causes of death
for American youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   And we shouldn't cloud the issue with the Hudson Institute study
showing that, among long-term prison inmates, 70 percent grew up
without fathers, including 60 percent of the rapists and 75 percent
of adolescents charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Or that fatherless children are three times more likely to fail
in school or commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Or that kids living without their dads are 40 times more likely
to suffer child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   We should listen instead to Sen. John McCain, who said of Elian,
``I have had some experience with communist governments, and there
are millions of Americans that have, too. Ask any of them who lived
under it what it was like and whether we should condemn that young
boy to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine anything worse than being condemned to live with
your dad?
</P>
<P>
   Still, I imagine the pinkos will try to twist things around by
using McCain's own autobiography, ``Faith of My Fathers.'' They'll
point out that McCain called his dad and granddad the most
important influences in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, they were AMERICAN men. Only U.S. fathers count.
That's what McCain and the others keep trying to explain to Elian
Gonzalez's daddy? You'd figure he would of gotten the message by
now?
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with them idiot Cubans? Don't they understand
English? &QL; Reach Montini at Ed.Montini(at)ArizonaRepublic.com or

MARINATED OLIVES 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Serve these with drinks before lunch or dinner. Offer a little
dish alongside for the pits. It is nice to include an assortment of
olives,with some green Bella di Cerignola mixed in with a variety
of black olives, because they look and taste so good. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound assorted olives, such as Nicoise, Gaeta, San Remo and
green olives, such as Bella di Cerignola OR Picholine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound sun-dried tomatoes, thinly sliced &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grated peel of 1 lemon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fresh basil leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drain olives and toss in a bowl with sun-dried tomatoes, olive
oil, lemon peel, garlic and basil. These can be served after
marinating overnight in refrigerator or stored for 2 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bring back to room temperature before serving. Makes 8 to 12
servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TUNA TAPENADE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This flavorful, versatile spread can be served on crostini or on
flatbread or as a dip for raw vegetables. However you plan on using
it, the flavorful spread will keep well under a float of a few
tablespoons of olive oil, well covered, in the refrigerator for up
to two weeks. Bring it back to room temperature before using. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup pitted Nicoise olives &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup pitted green olives &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons capers, drained &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon thyme leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon chopped rosemary leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 (6 1/2-ounce) can Italian olive-oil-packed tuna, drained &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grated peel and juice of 1 lemon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Cognac &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pulse olives, garlic, capers and herbs together in a food
processor. Then pulse in tuna until combined.
</P>
<P>
   Place tuna mixture in a bowl and add lemon peel, lemon juice and
Cognac. Slowly mix in olive oil, a little at a time, until tapenade
has a coarse texture. It should not be smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Cover and refrigerate until needed. Serve at room temperature.
Makes about 1 1/2 cups. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CROSTINI OF ASPARAGUS, PROSCIUTTO AND TELEME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this antipasto the asparagus is grilled, taking on a slightly
bitter, smoky flavor.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a grill lighted and ready, you can use a
stovetop grill pan or a very hot oven. Make this to nibble on while
you fix the rest of the meal. It only takes 10 minutes from start
to finish. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   12 thick asparagus spears, trimmed to about 5 inches long OR 20
pencil asparagus spears &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 long slices country-style bread, same length as asparagus &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound ripe teleme OR crescenza cheese &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 thin slices prosciutto &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a medium-hot fire in a grill, preheat stovetop grill pan
or preheat oven to 550 degrees F (or to highest setting).
</P>
<P>
   Toss asparagus with oil, then season to taste with salt and
pepper. Place asparagus on grill rack, in grill pan or on a sheet
pan in oven and cook, turning frequently, until nicely browned,
about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, toast bread on grill rack or in grill pan or oven,
turning once, until golden on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, spread each piece of toast with a thick layer of
cheese. Lay prosciutto on top and arrange grilled asparagus over
it. Makes 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MUSSEL, BROCCOLI AND POTATO SALAD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This unusual combination of flavors and textures is one of the
most deeply satisfying, warming combinations. This dish is served
as an antipasto or as a main course at Rose Pistola.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans are in the habit of barely blanching broccoli in
boiling water to cook it, but by slowly braising the broccoli its
flavors mellow and soften and gently combine with the potatoes and
mussels. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound Yellow Finn potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch
slices &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 large head broccoli, preferably romanesco OR purple Venetian,
cut into florets (reserve stalks for another use) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Water &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 anchovy fillets, chopped OR 1 tablespoon anchovy paste &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, crushed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pinch crushed red pepper flakes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound mussels, scrubbed and beards removed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dry Italian white wine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Small handful flat-leaf parsley leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a heavy flameproof casserole with a tight-fitting lid,
combine potatoes, broccoli, 2 tablespoons olive oil and 3
tablespoons water. Cover and cook over medium-low heat, without
stirring, until potatoes are tender, about 25 minutes. Drain and
toss in a salad bowl with remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, anchovies,
vinegar, garlic and crushed red pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, put mussels and white wine in a large saute pan with
a tight-fitting lid, cover and steam mussels until open over high
heat 2 to 3 minutes. Discard any that do not open.
</P>
<P>
   Add mussels and 1/4 cup steaming liquid to potato and broccoli
mixture. Toss, season to taste and toss again. Serve warm or at
room temperature, garnished with parsley. Serve mussels in shells
or remove them. Makes 4 first-course servings or 2 main-dish
servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SWORDFISH BROCHETTES WITH SALSA VERDE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When days are mild, grill these brochettes over a charcoal fire.
In the winter, you can cook them on a stovetop grill pan, although
you'll miss the flavor from the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Firm fish, such as sea bass, mackerel, salmon, mahi mahi or
halibut can be substituted. If you do not have rosemary stems for
skewering the fish, you will need to soak wooden skewers in water
for about 30 minutes before skewering so they won't burn on the
grill &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SALSA VERDE: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup loosely packed flat-leaf parsley leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon capers, rinsed and drained &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon red wine vinegar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 anchovy fillets &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dried bread crumbs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BROCHETTES: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound swordfish steak &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 sprigs rosemary (6 inches long) OR 8 wooden skewers, soaked in
water 30 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Salsa Verde, combine all salsa ingredients in a blender or
food processor and process until smooth. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   For Brochettes, prepare a fire in a charcoal grill or heat an
oiled stovtop grill pan over medium-high heat. Cut fish into
bite-size pieces, about 1x1- inch. Place fish in a bowl, add olive
oil and salt and pepper to taste and toss to coat. Thread 1 or 2
pieces of fish onto rosemary or wooden skewers.
</P>
<P>
   Place brochettes on oiled grill rack 6 to 8 inches above hot
coals and cook, turning to brown on all sides, until nearly opaque
throughout, about 1 minute per side. Or, cook brochettes on
stovetop grill pan about 1 to 3 minutes on each side.
</P>
<P>
   Serve at once on individual plates with Salsa Verde spooned over
top. Makes 4 appetizer servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Double salsa recipe and triple brochettes recipe and
thread more fish pieces on skewers if planning to serve 3 to 4 as a
main dish. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED SEA BASS WITH WILD MUSHROOMS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A variety of mushrooms would work well in this dish, such as
chanterelles, crimini or morels. If you cannot find these mushrooms
in your local market, try the dish with portobellos (with the black
gills trimmed off) or button mushrooms. Any firm mild fish, such as
halibut, that will not overpower the flavor of the mushrooms can be
substituted for the sea bass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig rosemary (about 6 inches long) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mushrooms, such as chanterelle, porcini, morel, crimini,
portobello OR button, cleaned (black gills trimmed off, if using
portobellos) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry Italian white wine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 (6-ounce) sea bass fillets &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a flameproof baking dish or ovenproof skillet just large
enough to hold fish, warm 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high
heat. Add garlic, rosemary and mushrooms and cook until mushrooms
start to brown, about 10 minutes. Add white wine and bring to a
simmer.
</P>
<P>
   Tuck fish fillets under mushrooms and season with salt.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 500-degree oven about 10 minutes or until just
cooked through.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with a drizzle of remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Makes
4 servings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SHAVED ARTICHOKES WITH FAVA BEANS AND PARMESAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is one of the most irresistible antipasti served at Rose
Pistola. Artichokes are very versatile and when thinly shaved and
served raw, they are delicious. Their crunchy, slightly bitter
flavor stimulates the appetite and palate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Water &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, halved, plus a few drops additional lemon juice &QL;
</P>
<P>
   16 baby artichokes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup fava beans &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4-pound wedge Parmigiano-Reggiano &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fill a large bowl with water and squeeze in juice from lemon,
then toss in squeezed halves. Peel off and discard outer leaves
from each artichoke until you reach part that is yellowish-green.
Trim off top, peel off tough outer layer at bottom and cut
artichoke in half lengthwise. Remove small thistle if it has
started to form in middle. As each artichoke is trimmed, place in
lemon water.
</P>
<P>
   When all artichokes are prepared, pour olive oil in a serving
bowl. Drain artichokes and lay halves, cut- side down, on a cutting
board, and, using a sharp stainless steel knife, slice into
lengthwise slices as thin as possible. Alternately, you can shave
them with a mandoline, being very careful of your fingertips. Put
slices in bowl with olive oil as you finish them, tossing to coat
to prevent discoloration.
</P>
<P>
   Add fava beans, toss well and season with salt and pepper and a
few drops lemon juice. Shave shards of cheese over top with a
vegetable peeler and serve. Makes 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SKILLET-ROASTED MUSSELS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mussels appear in cameo roles in cioppinos, pastas and
sandwiches, but at Rose Pistola, they star, pure and simple, on a
searing-hot plancha or iron skillet. This signature dish is one of
the simplest, most satisfying dishes and it's very easy to prepare
at home. The mussels' own juices provide the lovely smoky flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Today, much of the mussel crop is aquacultivated in Washington
State or along the East Coast. These cleaned and debearded mussels
generally can be purchased in little net bags. There are some great
planchas available in restaurant supply stores and gourmet stores.
They come with small wooden boards upon which rest the hot skillet
at the table and make for a great, straightforward presentation.
You can always use a cast- iron skillet.
</P>
<P>
   A chilled bottle of Barbera from California or Italy is just the
thing to go with mussels. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mussels, scrubbed and beards removed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heat plancha or cast-iron skillet over high heat (or over a hot
wood fire) until extremely hot; when a bead of water dances across
surface, it is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Spread mussels in one layer in pan: The heat will cause mussels
to open. Their juices will first pool and then burn on surface of
pan, at which point they are ready to serve, 4 to 5 minutes cooking
time. Discard any mussels that do not open.
</P>
<P>
   Season mussels generously with salt and pepper and serve from
pan at table, with melted butter on side. Makes 2 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED CHICKEN WITH TURNIPS, POTATOES AND CARROTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those dishes that evolved as a result of a trip
to the market when I was very hungry and in the mood to cook
something easy and all in one pot. It was the dead of winter and
the produce section was not terribly inspiring, but there were
beautiful baby turnips with their greens, potatoes, kale and dark
orange carrots. While this recipe should be enough for four, it was
so good that two of us ate it all up that night. For the cooking
wine, in the spirit of frugal North Beach cooks, you can use half a
bottle of leftover wine _ red or white, whatever you have. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces pancetta, cut into 1/4x1-inch strips &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig rosemary (about 6 inches long) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch kale, trimmed and coarsely chopped &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch baby turnips, greens removed and chopped and turnips
halved &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 large carrots, peeled and cut into chunks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 Yellow Finn potatoes, peeled and quartered &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 large chicken (3 to 4 pounds), quartered &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups (1/2 bottle) dry red OR white wine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a large heavy casserole, cook pancetta in olive oil over
medium-high heat until it renders its fat. Add garlic and rosemary
and cook until fragrant. Add kale, turnips, turnip greens, carrots
and potatoes. Season with salt and saute 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Generously season chicken with salt and pepper. Pour wine over
vegetables and reduce by 1/3. Put chicken legs and thigh quarters
on top of vegetables, reduce heat to low, tightly cover and cook 5
minutes. Add chicken breasts, cover and continue to cook until
chicken is tender and juices run clear, about 35 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Pour broth off vegetables and retain. Skim off any fat. Season
to taste. With a slotted spoon, arrange vegetables on a serving
platter and place chicken on top. Spoon broth (without fat) over
all. Makes 2 to 4 servings. &QL;

ITALY MEETS CALIFORNIA AT ROSE PISTOLA
</HEADLINE>
 2 takes  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've visited San Francisco's North Beach in the last year
or two, you may have run into Rose Pistola, a restaurant that has
been packing in diners since chef and restaurateur Reed Hearon
opened it in 1996. Featuring North Beach-style Italian food, the
cooking and menu are influenced by California and Liguria (on the
Northwestern coast of Italy).
</P>
<P>
   ``What's evolved here is a cuisine that's simple, pristine and
at the same time very sophisticated. The nature of the food we do
is homestyle cooking,'' says the Texas native who came to San
Francisco more than a decade ago after honing his skills in
kitchens in Austin, Denver and Sante Fe.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant was named after Rose Pistola (who passed away in
1998 at the age of 90), a colorful and feisty women who owned a bar
and was renowned in North Beach for her Italian cooking. Her
Silician father was a fisherman, and her mother was a fantastic
cook. Hearon said he loved Rose's name, her attitude, her spirit
and her joyfulness. ``She personified what I love about the
neighborhood: its bawdy sense of history and its wry acknowledgment
that it's futile to take ourselves too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's possible to sample some of Hearon's restaurant fare
with a copy of his recently released ``The Rose Pistola Cookbook,''
co-written with Peggy Knickerbocker (Broadway Books; $35). It's
filled with 140 recipes _ mostly of dishes served at the restaurant
_ that evoke the spirit of North Beach and its Italian immigrant
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are signature dishes, including a colorful array of
antipasti. You'll see many of them displayed on oval platters at
the end of the open kitchen's counter when you enter the
restaurant. Featured are Marinated Olives, Shaved Artichoke With
Fava Beans and Parmesan, Shaved Raw Mushrooms, Endive and Parmesan
and Asparagus Carpaccio along with Skillet-Roasted Mussels,
Cioppino, Roasted Fish in a Salt Crust, Stuffed Focaccia, and Goat
Cheese and Roasted Pepper Pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Hearon has tried to keep the recipes simple. ``We geared them to
the home cook and regular folks _ and they are indicative of the
food we serve _ which is home food, not restaurant-style food. The
cooking techniques in the book are based on home-cooking traditions
_ nothing fancy, nothing complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   The recipes rely on readily available ingredients _ and when
testing the recipes, the authors shopped for ingredients in local
stores rather than using items from the restaurant's kitchen. There
are some exceptions _ and in this instance mail-order sources are
included for things like beans, specialty flours, organic polenta,
hand-crafted cheeses and Ligurian olive oils _ if you feel inclined
to go to these lengths. Otherwise, Hearon gives substitutes _ or
you might search out local Italian specialty stores for products he
mentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out of the way to test each recipe three times in a
home kitchen,'' Hearon said during a recent stopover in Los
Angeles. To test the recipes, ``Peggy (Knickerbocker) and I had
dinner once a week with friends at my house.'' Hearon ad-libbed or
cooked at home from written recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Hearon believes in using the freshest seasonal ingredients in
his creations and recommends that home cooks shop before making a
dish. They should buy what's fresh, in season, local and what
catches their fancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use the recipes as guides, improvising based on what you
bought.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the warm, savory dishes in the book begin by infusing
cold oil and cold aromatics such as onions and garlic in a cold pan
over medium-high heat, allowing the ingredients to warm up in the
oil. This way, garlic and onions won't burn. Once you have the
aromatic oil base, the main ingredient of the dish is added.
</P>
<P>
   Hearon recommends using a Ligurian oil _ one that is fruity,
ripe and both delicate and full of flavor _ as often as possible in
the book's recipes. Among his favorites are Roi Mosto, Raineri and
Isnardi. He also advises saving water from cooking pasta, beans,
potatoes and vegetables and refrigerating or freezing for future
use in sauces and other dishes to integrate and bring the dish
together.
</P>
<P>
   Another frugal trick is to save rinds from Parmigiano-Reggiano
cheese. Wrap them in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator to
throw into a pot of bean soup without fish _ or to enhance other
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   He also prefers cooking with sea salt because it has a broader,
more complex range of flavors than table salt. However you can
substitute kosher salt.
</P>
<P>
   Tempt diners with this sampling of dishes from ``The Rose
Pistola Cookbook.'' You're in for some delicious eating. &QL;

MARINATED OLIVES 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Serve these with drinks before lunch or dinner. Offer a little
dish alongside for the pits. It is nice to include an assortment of
olives,with some green Bella di Cerignola mixed in with a variety
of black olives, because they look and taste so good. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound assorted olives, such as Nicoise, Gaeta, San Remo and
green olives, such as Bella di Cerignola OR Picholine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound sun-dried tomatoes, thinly sliced &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grated peel of 1 lemon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fresh basil leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drain olives and toss in a bowl with sun-dried tomatoes, olive
oil, lemon peel, garlic and basil. These can be served after
marinating overnight in refrigerator or stored for 2 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bring back to room temperature before serving. Makes 8 to 12
servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TUNA TAPENADE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This flavorful, versatile spread can be served on crostini or on
flatbread or as a dip for raw vegetables. However you plan on using
it, the flavorful spread will keep well under a float of a few
tablespoons of olive oil, well covered, in the refrigerator for up
to two weeks. Bring it back to room temperature before using. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup pitted Nicoise olives &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup pitted green olives &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons capers, drained &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon thyme leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon chopped rosemary leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 (6 1/2-ounce) can Italian olive-oil-packed tuna, drained &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grated peel and juice of 1 lemon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Cognac &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pulse olives, garlic, capers and herbs together in a food
processor. Then pulse in tuna until combined.
</P>
<P>
   Place tuna mixture in a bowl and add lemon peel, lemon juice and
Cognac. Slowly mix in olive oil, a little at a time, until tapenade
has a coarse texture. It should not be smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Cover and refrigerate until needed. Serve at room temperature.
Makes about 1 1/2 cups. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CROSTINI OF ASPARAGUS, PROSCIUTTO AND TELEME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this antipasto the asparagus is grilled, taking on a slightly
bitter, smoky flavor.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a grill lighted and ready, you can use a
stovetop grill pan or a very hot oven. Make this to nibble on while
you fix the rest of the meal. It only takes 10 minutes from start
to finish. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   12 thick asparagus spears, trimmed to about 5 inches long OR 20
pencil asparagus spears &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 long slices country-style bread, same length as asparagus &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound ripe teleme OR crescenza cheese &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 thin slices prosciutto &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a medium-hot fire in a grill, preheat stovetop grill pan
or preheat oven to 550 degrees F (or to highest setting).
</P>
<P>
   Toss asparagus with oil, then season to taste with salt and
pepper. Place asparagus on grill rack, in grill pan or on a sheet
pan in oven and cook, turning frequently, until nicely browned,
about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, toast bread on grill rack or in grill pan or oven,
turning once, until golden on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, spread each piece of toast with a thick layer of
cheese. Lay prosciutto on top and arrange grilled asparagus over
it. Makes 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MUSSEL, BROCCOLI AND POTATO SALAD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This unusual combination of flavors and textures is one of the
most deeply satisfying, warming combinations. This dish is served
as an antipasto or as a main course at Rose Pistola.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans are in the habit of barely blanching broccoli in
boiling water to cook it, but by slowly braising the broccoli its
flavors mellow and soften and gently combine with the potatoes and
mussels. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound Yellow Finn potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch
slices &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 large head broccoli, preferably romanesco OR purple Venetian,
cut into florets (reserve stalks for another use) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Water &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 anchovy fillets, chopped OR 1 tablespoon anchovy paste &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, crushed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pinch crushed red pepper flakes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound mussels, scrubbed and beards removed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dry Italian white wine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Small handful flat-leaf parsley leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a heavy flameproof casserole with a tight-fitting lid,
combine potatoes, broccoli, 2 tablespoons olive oil and 3
tablespoons water. Cover and cook over medium-low heat, without
stirring, until potatoes are tender, about 25 minutes. Drain and
toss in a salad bowl with remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, anchovies,
vinegar, garlic and crushed red pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, put mussels and white wine in a large saute pan with
a tight-fitting lid, cover and steam mussels until open over high
heat 2 to 3 minutes. Discard any that do not open.
</P>
<P>
   Add mussels and 1/4 cup steaming liquid to potato and broccoli
mixture. Toss, season to taste and toss again. Serve warm or at
room temperature, garnished with parsley. Serve mussels in shells
or remove them. Makes 4 first-course servings or 2 main-dish
servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SWORDFISH BROCHETTES WITH SALSA VERDE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When days are mild, grill these brochettes over a charcoal fire.
In the winter, you can cook them on a stovetop grill pan, although
you'll miss the flavor from the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Firm fish, such as sea bass, mackerel, salmon, mahi mahi or
halibut can be substituted. If you do not have rosemary stems for
skewering the fish, you will need to soak wooden skewers in water
for about 30 minutes before skewering so they won't burn on the
grill &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SALSA VERDE: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup loosely packed flat-leaf parsley leaves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon capers, rinsed and drained &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon red wine vinegar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 anchovy fillets &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dried bread crumbs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BROCHETTES: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound swordfish steak &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 sprigs rosemary (6 inches long) OR 8 wooden skewers, soaked in
water 30 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Salsa Verde, combine all salsa ingredients in a blender or
food processor and process until smooth. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   For Brochettes, prepare a fire in a charcoal grill or heat an
oiled stovtop grill pan over medium-high heat. Cut fish into
bite-size pieces, about 1x1- inch. Place fish in a bowl, add olive
oil and salt and pepper to taste and toss to coat. Thread 1 or 2
pieces of fish onto rosemary or wooden skewers.
</P>
<P>
   Place brochettes on oiled grill rack 6 to 8 inches above hot
coals and cook, turning to brown on all sides, until nearly opaque
throughout, about 1 minute per side. Or, cook brochettes on
stovetop grill pan about 1 to 3 minutes on each side.
</P>
<P>
   Serve at once on individual plates with Salsa Verde spooned over
top. Makes 4 appetizer servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Double salsa recipe and triple brochettes recipe and
thread more fish pieces on skewers if planning to serve 3 to 4 as a
main dish. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED SEA BASS WITH WILD MUSHROOMS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A variety of mushrooms would work well in this dish, such as
chanterelles, crimini or morels. If you cannot find these mushrooms
in your local market, try the dish with portobellos (with the black
gills trimmed off) or button mushrooms. Any firm mild fish, such as
halibut, that will not overpower the flavor of the mushrooms can be
substituted for the sea bass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig rosemary (about 6 inches long) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mushrooms, such as chanterelle, porcini, morel, crimini,
portobello OR button, cleaned (black gills trimmed off, if using
portobellos) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry Italian white wine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 (6-ounce) sea bass fillets &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a flameproof baking dish or ovenproof skillet just large
enough to hold fish, warm 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high
heat. Add garlic, rosemary and mushrooms and cook until mushrooms
start to brown, about 10 minutes. Add white wine and bring to a
simmer.
</P>
<P>
   Tuck fish fillets under mushrooms and season with salt.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 500-degree oven about 10 minutes or until just
cooked through.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with a drizzle of remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Makes
4 servings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SHAVED ARTICHOKES WITH FAVA BEANS AND PARMESAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is one of the most irresistible antipasti served at Rose
Pistola. Artichokes are very versatile and when thinly shaved and
served raw, they are delicious. Their crunchy, slightly bitter
flavor stimulates the appetite and palate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Water &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, halved, plus a few drops additional lemon juice &QL;
</P>
<P>
   16 baby artichokes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup fava beans &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4-pound wedge Parmigiano-Reggiano &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fill a large bowl with water and squeeze in juice from lemon,
then toss in squeezed halves. Peel off and discard outer leaves
from each artichoke until you reach part that is yellowish-green.
Trim off top, peel off tough outer layer at bottom and cut
artichoke in half lengthwise. Remove small thistle if it has
started to form in middle. As each artichoke is trimmed, place in
lemon water.
</P>
<P>
   When all artichokes are prepared, pour olive oil in a serving
bowl. Drain artichokes and lay halves, cut- side down, on a cutting
board, and, using a sharp stainless steel knife, slice into
lengthwise slices as thin as possible. Alternately, you can shave
them with a mandoline, being very careful of your fingertips. Put
slices in bowl with olive oil as you finish them, tossing to coat
to prevent discoloration.
</P>
<P>
   Add fava beans, toss well and season with salt and pepper and a
few drops lemon juice. Shave shards of cheese over top with a
vegetable peeler and serve. Makes 4 servings. &QL;

<P>
   SKILLET-ROASTED MUSSELS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mussels appear in cameo roles in cioppinos, pastas and
sandwiches, but at Rose Pistola, they star, pure and simple, on a
searing-hot plancha or iron skillet. This signature dish is one of
the simplest, most satisfying dishes and it's very easy to prepare
at home. The mussels' own juices provide the lovely smoky flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Today, much of the mussel crop is aquacultivated in Washington
State or along the East Coast. These cleaned and debearded mussels
generally can be purchased in little net bags. There are some great
planchas available in restaurant supply stores and gourmet stores.
They come with small wooden boards upon which rest the hot skillet
at the table and make for a great, straightforward presentation.
You can always use a cast- iron skillet.
</P>
<P>
   A chilled bottle of Barbera from California or Italy is just the
thing to go with mussels. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mussels, scrubbed and beards removed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heat plancha or cast-iron skillet over high heat (or over a hot
wood fire) until extremely hot; when a bead of water dances across
surface, it is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Spread mussels in one layer in pan: The heat will cause mussels
to open. Their juices will first pool and then burn on surface of
pan, at which point they are ready to serve, 4 to 5 minutes cooking
time. Discard any mussels that do not open.
</P>
<P>
   Season mussels generously with salt and pepper and serve from
pan at table, with melted butter on side. Makes 2 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED CHICKEN WITH TURNIPS, POTATOES AND CARROTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those dishes that evolved as a result of a trip
to the market when I was very hungry and in the mood to cook
something easy and all in one pot. It was the dead of winter and
the produce section was not terribly inspiring, but there were
beautiful baby turnips with their greens, potatoes, kale and dark
orange carrots. While this recipe should be enough for four, it was
so good that two of us ate it all up that night. For the cooking
wine, in the spirit of frugal North Beach cooks, you can use half a
bottle of leftover wine _ red or white, whatever you have. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces pancetta, cut into 1/4x1-inch strips &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig rosemary (about 6 inches long) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch kale, trimmed and coarsely chopped &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch baby turnips, greens removed and chopped and turnips
halved &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 large carrots, peeled and cut into chunks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 Yellow Finn potatoes, peeled and quartered &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosher OR sea salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 large chicken (3 to 4 pounds), quartered &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freshly cracked black pepper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups (1/2 bottle) dry red OR white wine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a large heavy casserole, cook pancetta in olive oil over
medium-high heat until it renders its fat. Add garlic and rosemary
and cook until fragrant. Add kale, turnips, turnip greens, carrots
and potatoes. Season with salt and saute 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Generously season chicken with salt and pepper. Pour wine over
vegetables and reduce by 1/3. Put chicken legs and thigh quarters
on top of vegetables, reduce heat to low, tightly cover and cook 5
minutes. Add chicken breasts, cover and continue to cook until
chicken is tender and juices run clear, about 35 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Pour broth off vegetables and retain. Skim off any fat. Season
to taste. With a slotted spoon, arrange vegetables on a serving
platter and place chicken on top. Spoon broth (without fat) over
all. Makes 2 to 4 servings. &QL;

COOKIES ARE A RECIPE FOR KITCHEN SKIRMISHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were not the sounds that I usually associate with baking. I
was expecting whirring and stirring with perhaps the occasional
sound of a cabinet door opening and closing. You know, the
customary Mom's-in-the-kitchen type sounds that precede the
delicious aroma of fresh-baked cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there was a lot of banging, clanging and sawing going
on in the kitchen. Even for two boys, it seemed like a lot of noise
just to make a few dozen sugar cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, I'm not an expert on these things. For me, it's just
too easy to swing by the bakery and pick up a cake. However,
because my mother inspects my kitchen periodically, I try to keep
the basic ingredients for baking in the cupboards. I even use them
sometimes _ just not often.
</P>
<P>
   So, when my two sons asked me to help them bake some sugar
cookies one evening, I was flattered. Unfortunately, because of a
looming deadline on an important project, I had to decline with
regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do it tomorrow,'' I offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all right, Mom,'' Junior said. ``It's a simple recipe.
I think we can do it, if it's OK with you. I'll read the directions
and my brother can mix it all up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, go ahead,'' I said, reminding myself how good they'd
gotten at microwave bacon and French toast. ``Remember to turn the
oven on first, and clean up the kitchen when you're done. I'm
sorry, but I really need to finish this work so don't disturb me
unless it's really important.''
</P>
<P>
   I should have defined ``really important.''
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the banging. I think they opened and closed
every cabinet in the kitchen. Then, there was this long, loud
argument about who was in charge. I couldn't hear all of it, but I
heard enough of it. After about 10 minutes of bickering, I yelled,
``I'm in charge tonight. Junior, read the directions. Kevin, mix
everything together and then you can both take turns with the
blender. Now, keep it down! You're baking cookies, it's a quiet
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, they whispered their argument.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, there was a knock on my bedroom door. It
was Junior. ``Mom, do we have any vanilla?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's in the cabinet near the salt, far left, small
red-and-white box.''
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, Junior returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, do we have any almond extract or tartar sauce?''
</P>
<P>
   I had to smile at that question.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we don't have almond extract or cream of tartar. The
cookies will taste fine without it.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, just because I don't bake often doesn't mean that I don't
know how to bake. In fact, I'm also quite good with a sewing
machine, but don't tell your father. Listen, all you need for sugar
cookies is: sugar, butter, vanilla, an egg, flour, and baking soda.
And before you ask, the baking soda is in a red can near the
vanilla. Do not use that baking soda in the yellow box in the
refrigerator. It's a deodorizer, and it's been in there a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Impressed by my culinary expertise, he turned to leave the room.
Imagine my joy.
</P>
<P>
   I returned to my project with total concentration. I had a good
20 minutes of peace before I heard the electric chain saw. We own
so few power tools that I immediately recognized the sound. I ran
into the kitchen. Kevin had my best cookie sheet perched on the
sink and he was preparing to amputate a big section of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop!'' I screamed. ``What are you doing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't fit in the oven,'' he said. ``I have to cut some of
it off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you try turning it sideways?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked around. There was flour and sugar everywhere. The oven
was on 375 degrees and ``broil.'' The hand blender had only one of
the two metal stirrey things in it. And there seemed to be a lot of
egg shells for a recipe that required only one egg.
</P>
<P>
   I turned the oven dial to ``bake'' and washed my hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about your project?'' Kevin asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do it later. This project looks like a lot more fun,'' I
said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I was trying to save my cookie sheet and avoid a visit to
the ER. Yes, I was up well into the AM trying to beat that
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, those were the best sugar cookies I've ever had.

&HT;     AD CAMPAIGN AIMS AT ENCOURAGING CHILDREN TO READ 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GEORGE RAINE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Vexed with abysmal reading scores in schools,
California is undertaking a funny, clever advertising campaign that
encourages children to read and reminds their parents what a
difference reading makes.
</P>
<P>
   A little girl can teach Sparky new tricks once she reads a book
about dog tricks. A young man is advised he will be sentenced to
spend the rest of his life living with his couch-bound parents if
he doesn't read.
</P>
<P>
   The state is spending $4 million in the year-long campaign that
begins this month to spread the word in both English and Spanish
about the benefits of reading. It is a multimedia campaign with a
sense of urgency as it coincides with recent reports showing an
ever-widening wage gap in the new California economy.
</P>
<P>
   Focused in Fresno, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego and San
Francisco, the campaign is part of Gov. Gray Davis' educational
reform package that in part was written in the embarrassing light
of reading scores in the state.
</P>
<P>
   While California students have shown some improvement in reading
scores since 1994, the state ranks near the bottom of a nationwide
federal assessment of reading skills of students in the fourth,
eighth and 12th grades.
</P>
<P>
   The National Assessment of Educational Progress, in a report
last March, found that 52 percent of California fourth-graders
scored below a basic skill level in reading; 28 percent scored at a
basic level; 16 percent were proficient or showing solid academic
performance, and 4 percent were advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 39 percent of fourth-graders were below basic; 31
percent were at a basic level; 23 percent were proficient and 6
percent were advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not fail an entire generation of children,'' Davis, a
Democrat, said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Davis proposed a bill, sponsored by Assemblywoman Kerry Mazzoni,
D-San Rafael, that funded the ``Read California'' public reading
initiative approved by the Legislature last year.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative calls for television and radio commercials,
hand-painted wallscapes on buildings, advertisements in Parade
magazine and in bus shelters, billboards and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is the creation of the advertising agency Lawrence,
Mayo and Ponder of Newport Beach, which conducted focus groups to
learn how people interpreted the ad tagline: ``Read today. See
where it takes you.'' They found it had a double meaning: In some
people it evoked a sense of adventure, while for others it implied
success in life.
</P>
<P>
   School drop-out rates, often reflecting students with lower
reading skills, tell the tale: In 1993, about 381,000 students
dropped out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   Over their lifetimes, said the Educational Testing Service,
these dropouts will earn $212,000 less than students who finished
high school, $384,000 less than people with some college education,
$812,000 less than college graduates, and $2.4 million less than
people with professional or advanced degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a major report issued on Labor Day, organized
labor found that education is increasingly necessary for success.
The income chasm is particularly broad in California, said the
AFL-CIO report, because the high-tech economy was born and reared
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   California Secretary for Education Gary Hart said: ``We know the
important benefits of reading, and it is crucial now to really
focus as a state and encourage reading skills on a very active
basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading outside of the classroom really does make a
difference. It's like compound interest on a savings account. Those
who read a lot will enhance their academic skills. In other words,
amount counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers are paying $4,million for the campaign, but other
costs are covered by donations from corporate sponsors.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The United States has found it exceedingly difficult to define
its ``national interest'' in the absence of Soviet power.
</P>
<P>
   That we do not know how to think about what follows the
U.S.-Soviet confrontation is clear from the continued references to
the ``post-Cold War period.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet such periods of transition are very important because they
offer strategic opportunities. During these fluid times, one can
affect the shape of the world to come. The enormity of the moment
is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union was more than just a traditional global
competitor. It strove to lead a universal socialist alternative to
markets and democracy. The Soviet Union quarantined itself and many
of its often unwitting captives and clients from the rigors of
international capitalism. In the end, it sowed the seeds of its own
destruction, becoming in isolation an economic and technological
dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   America has emerged as both the principal benefactor of this
revolution and the beneficiary. American values are universal.
Their triumph is most assuredly easier when the international
balance of power favors those who believe in them. But sometimes
that favorable balance of power takes time to achieve, both
internationally and within a country, and in the meantime, it is
simply not possible to ignore and isolate other powerful states.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War is a good example. Few would deny that the collapse
of the Soviet Union profoundly transformed the picture of democracy
and human rights in eastern and central Europe and the former
Soviet territories. Nothing improved human rights as much as the
collapse of Soviet power.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, the United States pursued a policy that
promoted political liberty, using every instrument from the Voice
of America to direct presidential intervention on behalf of
dissidents. But it lost sight neither of the importance of the
geopolitical relationship with Moscow nor of the absolute necessity
of retaining robust American military power to deter an all-out
military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, President Reagan's challenge to Soviet power was
both resolute and well timed. It included intense substantive
engagements with Moscow across the entire range of issues captured
in a classic ``four-part agenda'' _ arms control, human rights,
economic issues and regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration then focused greater attention on
rolling back Soviet power in central and eastern Europe. As the
Soviet Union's might waned, it could no longer defend its interests
and gave up peacefully (thankfully) to the West _ a tremendous
victory for Western power and also for human liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States is fortunate to count among its
friends several great powers, it is important not to take them for
granted _ so that there is a firm foundation when it comes time to
rely on them.
</P>
<P>
   Today Russia presents a different challenge. It still has many
of the attributes of a great power: a large population, vast
territory and military potential. But its economic weakness and
problems of national identity threaten to overwhelm it.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is determined to assert itself in the world and often
does so in ways that are at once haphazard and threatening to
American interests. The picture is complicated by Russia's own
internal transition _ one that the United States wants to see
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The old Soviet system has broken down, and some of the basic
elements of democratic development are in place. People are free to
say what they think, vote for whom they please, and (for the most
part) worship freely. But the democratic fragments are not
institutionalized _ and with the exception of the Communist Party,
political parties are weak.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in his last months as president, few paid attention
to Boris Yeltsin's decrees. Arguably, the Russian government has
been mired in inaction and stagnation for at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic troubles and its high-level corruption have
been widely discussed. Its economy is not becoming a market but is
mutating into something else. Widespread barter, banks that are not
banks, billions of rubles stashed abroad and in mattresses at home,
and bizarre privatization schemes that have enriched the so-called
reformers give Moscow's economy a medieval tinge.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for U.S. policy is that the Clinton administration's
ongoing embrace of Yeltsin and those who were thought to be
reformers around him quite simply failed. Clearly the United States
was obliged to deal with the head of state, and Yeltsin was
Russia's president.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. support for democracy and economic reform became
support for Yeltsin. His agenda became the American agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The United States certified that reform was taking place in
Russia where it was not, continuing to disburse money from the
International Monetary Fund in the absence of any evidence of
serious change.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, some curious privatization methods were hailed as economic
liberalization; the looting of the country's assets by powerful
people either went unnoticed or was ignored. The realities in
Russia simply did not accord with the administration's script about
Russian economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should not be faulted for trying to help. But,
as the Russian reformer Grigori Yavlinsky has said, the United
States should have ``told the truth'' about what was happening. Now
we have a dual credibility problem _ with Russians and with
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of life in the Russian economy. The financial
crash of August 1998 forced import substitution, and domestic
production has increased as the resilient Russian people have taken
matters into their own hands. Rising oil prices have helped as
well.
</P>
<P>
   But these are short-term fixes. There is no longer a consensus
in America or Europe on what to do next with Russia. Frustrated
expectations and ``Russia fatigue'' are direct consequences of the
``happy talk'' in which the Clinton administration engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic future is now in the hands of the Russians.
The country is not without assets, including its natural resources
and an educated population. It is up to Russia to make structural
reforms, particularly concerning the rule of law and the tax codes,
so that investors _ foreign and domestic _ will provide the capital
needed for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   That opportunity will arise after the March 26 election when
there is a new government. But the cultural changes ultimately
needed to sustain a functioning civil society and a market-based
economy may take a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Western openness to Russia's people, particularly its youth, in
exchange programs and contact with the private sector and
educational opportunities can help that process. It is also
important to engage the leadership of Russia's diverse regions,
where economic and social policies are increasingly pursued
independently of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, U.S. policy must concentrate on the important
security agenda with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, it must recognize that American security is threatened
less by Russia's strength than by its weakness and incoherence.
This suggests immediate attention to the safety and security of
Moscow's nuclear forces and stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   The Nunn-Lugar program should be funded fully and pursued
aggressively. (Because American contractors do most of the work,
the risk of the diversion of funds is low.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, Washington must begin a comprehensive discussion with
Moscow on the changing nuclear threat. Much has been made by
Russian military officials about their increased reliance on
nuclear weapons in the face of their declining conventional
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian deterrent is more than adequate against the U.S.
nuclear arsenal, and vice versa. But that fact need no longer be
enshrined in a treaty that is almost 30 years old and is a relic of
a profoundly adversarial relationship between the United States and
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was intended to prevent the
development of national missile defenses in the Cold War security
environment. Today, the principal concerns are nuclear threats from
the Iraqs and North Koreas of the world and the possibility of
unauthorized releases as nuclear weapons spread.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, in fact, lives closer to those threats than Washington
does. It ought to be possible to engage the Russians in a
discussion of the changed threat environment, their possible
responses, and the relationship of strategic offensive-force
reductions to the deployment of defenses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Moscow should understand that any possibilities for
sharing technology or information in these areas would depend
heavily on its record _ problematic to date _ on the proliferation
of ballistic-missile and other technologies related to weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   It would be foolish in the extreme to share defenses with Moscow
if it either leaks or deliberately transfers weapons technologies
to the very states against which America is defending.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, the United States needs to recognize that Russia is a
great power, and that we will always have interests that conflict
as well as coincide. The war in Chechnya, located in the oil-rich
Caucasus, is particularly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, Vladimir Putin used the Chechnya war to stir
nationalism at home while fueling his own political fortunes. The
Russian military has been uncharacteristically blunt and vocal in
asserting its duty to defend the integrity of the Russian
Federation _ an unwelcome development in civil-military relations.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Putin is acting president, the long-term effect of the
war on Russia's political culture should not be underestimated.
This war has affected relations between Russia and its neighbors in
the Caucasus, as the Kremlin has been hurling charges of harboring
and abetting Chechen terrorists against states as diverse as Saudi
Arabia, Georgia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   The war is a reminder of the vulnerability of the small, new
states around Russia and of America's interest in their
independence. If they can become stronger, they will be less
tempting to Russia. But much depends on the ability of these states
to reform their economies and political systems _ a process, to
date, whose success is mixed at best.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile America can exercise power without arrogance and
pursue its interests without hectoring and bluster. That has been
America's special role in the past, and it should be again as we
enter the new century.

<P>
   The United States has found it exceedingly difficult to define
its ``national interest'' in the absence of Soviet power.
</P>
<P>
   That we do not know how to think about what follows the
U.S.-Soviet confrontation is clear from the continued references to
the ``post-Cold War period.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet such periods of transition are very important because they
offer strategic opportunities. During these fluid times, one can
affect the shape of the world to come. The enormity of the moment
is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union was more than just a traditional global
competitor. It strove to lead a universal socialist alternative to
markets and democracy. The Soviet Union quarantined itself and many
of its often unwitting captives and clients from the rigors of
international capitalism. In the end, it sowed the seeds of its own
destruction, becoming in isolation an economic and technological
dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   America has emerged as both the principal benefactor of this
revolution and the beneficiary. American values are universal.
Their triumph is most assuredly easier when the international
balance of power favors those who believe in them. But sometimes
that favorable balance of power takes time to achieve, both
internationally and within a country, and in the meantime, it is
simply not possible to ignore and isolate other powerful states.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War is a good example. Few would deny that the collapse
of the Soviet Union profoundly transformed the picture of democracy
and human rights in eastern and central Europe and the former
Soviet territories. Nothing improved human rights as much as the
collapse of Soviet power.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, the United States pursued a policy that
promoted political liberty, using every instrument from the Voice
of America to direct presidential intervention on behalf of
dissidents. But it lost sight neither of the importance of the
geopolitical relationship with Moscow nor of the absolute necessity
of retaining robust American military power to deter an all-out
military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, President Reagan's challenge to Soviet power was
both resolute and well timed. It included intense substantive
engagements with Moscow across the entire range of issues captured
in a classic ``four-part agenda'' _ arms control, human rights,
economic issues and regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration then focused greater attention on
rolling back Soviet power in central and eastern Europe. As the
Soviet Union's might waned, it could no longer defend its interests
and gave up peacefully (thankfully) to the West _ a tremendous
victory for Western power and also for human liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States is fortunate to count among its
friends several great powers, it is important not to take them for
granted _ so that there is a firm foundation when it comes time to
rely on them.
</P>
<P>
   Today Russia presents a different challenge. It still has many
of the attributes of a great power: a large population, vast
territory and military potential. But its economic weakness and
problems of national identity threaten to overwhelm it.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was only six years ago that Subcomandante Marcos and his
masked Zapatista rebels rose up in Chiapas, Mexico, ostensibly
against NAFTA, or the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On the very eve the trade treaty became law, the army of peasant
guerillas marched into the plaza of San Cristobal de las Casas, in
Mexico, identifying themselves and declaring open war on the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free trade agreement is a death certificate for the Indian
peoples, which are expendable for the government of Carlos Salinas
de Gortari,'' Marcos said, catching the pro-NAFTA patriciate
off-guard.
</P>
<P>
   By now, of course, the insurgents and their revolutionary
movement leaders have tailored their demands to more modest aims,
hidden their dismally few weapons and essentially gone back into
the hills. As such, the Chiapas rebellion belongs more to Mexico's
history books than to its everyday political life. And an
assessment of its impact is more properly a historical exercise
than a political one.
</P>
<P>
   But part of the Zapatista rebellion's legacy lives on, if only
through its promise, in recent events in Seattle: the
demonstrations and riots during the Nov. 30-to-Dec. 3 World Trade
Organization meeting. Once again the protest was, at least in part,
about the enormous gap between the have-nots and the beneficiaries
of world ``free'' trade.
</P>
<P>
   There always was a missing party during the entire 1992-'93
NAFTA debate involving Mexico, the United States and Canada. The
latter two nations were aptly represented not merely by governments
and industry but also by social and political forces such as
grassroots activists, NGOs or non-govermental organizations, labor
unions and environmental groups. But where were their Mexican
counterparts?
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions _ a scattering of women's and human-rights
groups, a tiny band of intellectuals, occasionally Mayor Cardenas
of Mexico City and his Party of the Democratic Revolution _ the
civil society and political forces of Mexico did not participate in
the NAFTA debate.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe the reason for this absence was the fact that all
Mexican interests were totally identified with those of the former
Salinas administration and the business community. Why, even
environmentalists and maquiladora workers found themselves
``represented'' by the Salinas technocrats and plutocrats or the
Monterrey magnates.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that the social silence and absence sprung from
the repressive remnants of the Mexican authoritarian political
system.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, there certainly were critics of the free-trade
treaty in Mexico. They supported, for example, the inclusion in
NAFTA of chapters on stringent protection for labor, environmental,
human and consumer rights, with real sanctions and teeth in them.
They also advocated transparent, expeditious and accessible
mechanisms for complaint and conflict resolution. Ironically, these
critics and their demands enjoyed far more support in Washington
than in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until Marcos and his troops burst forth upon the scene.
</P>
<P>
   As Tim Golden wrote in The New York Times on Jan. 9, 1994, ``In
timing their strike to NAFTA's implementation, the rebels took aim
at the official faith that by fixing their economic destiny to that
of wealthier nations, all Mexicans would be raised into a modernity
of more jobs ... and a fuller democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now this was a strange occurrence, in certain ways, because one
might have imagined that the best way to accomplish, for example,
the unionization of more than 1 million maquiladora workers in
northern Mexico, given the difficulties of prying open the Mexican
labor movement, would be through international means. But it did
not happen at the time.
</P>
<P>
   And it did not really happen in Seattle either. All the
governments from the rich ``North'' and the poor ``South'' were at
the event. Every protester and his or her cousin from the United
States and Western Europe, it seemed, was also there, clamoring at
the convention center against corporate greed, global
commercialism, the rich-poor gap and so forth. But grassroots
organizers, non-governmental organizations, ``greens,'' labor
unions, consumer protection groups _ as well as women's-rights,
child-labor and student activists from the South were largely
absent.
</P>
<P>
   Partly this relates to cost and distance. For many, the plane
fare is too expensive; so are hotel rooms and accompanying travel
costs. But there are social factors too, such as the well-founded
fears of many Indonesian, Pakistani and Egyptian activists to
openly voice their complaints. Also a nationalistic reluctance in
many left-wing quarters of the ``South'' to acknowledge any
international alliances as totally kosher.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, what Seattle and other global venues (such as the 50th
anniversary World Bank celebration) have shown is quite instructive
_ for instance, that if Indonesian workers organizing for better
conditions in local sports-shoe factories are to find any allies,
it will be most likely among the up-scale consumers of Nike
footwear in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles _ though not
necessarily among the teen-agers in the projects and ghettoes.
</P>
<P>
   Or that if sweatshop workers in El Salvador fighting for their
basic rights are to have any chance of winning their struggles, it
will likely be thanks to consumers boycotting GAP jeans and
clothing in the United States. Or that if child-labor adversaries
in Pakistan and India are to find support, it will probably be from
groups that force governments to compel Pakistani or Hindu
importers to desist from employing children _ those under 14, at
least.
</P>
<P>
   Or that if indigenous groups in Chiapas, Ecuador or the Amazon,
or environmentalists in Mexico and Brazil, or fruit pickers in
Chile are to make any headway in their demands, it largely will be
as a result of alliances with consumer groups, ``greens,'' labor
unions and citizens' organizations in the ``North'' who, for their
own reasons, and with their own agendas, will bring their
burgeoning power to bear on the defects of the globalization
process.
</P>
<P>
   Capital has become fluid and terribly footloose today, mobile
and transient across state and continental borders. That, we are
told by economists and globalization boosters, is why any form of
national regulation, taxation, protection or ambition is hopelessly
condemned to irrelevance. However self-serving or plainly false
such an argument may be, it does contain a grain of truth, as well
as several positive implications.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, indeed, capital can move anywhere, and make it possible
to manufacture elegant leather goods or trendy clothes, exotic
fruits and cheap but sophisticated electronics. But there are only
a limited number of consumers of these items, and they are all
grouped together in 20-or-so nations. Moreover, these consumers are
linked by the same networks _ of advertisers, activists, Internet
servers and lifestyles; they belong to the same ``niches'' for
marketing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In these countries, small, active and dedicated groups of
minorities can move mountains _ particularly if they are made up of
social strata with increasing leisure time, money to spend, causes
to back and '60s nostalgia and liberal ideals to nourish.
</P>
<P>
   At some point soon _ maybe at the next round of WTO talks _
those folks who were so notably absent from the Seattle summit will
show up. Perhaps they'll meet their U.S. and European counterparts
and begin to bridge the gaps between North and South in a way few
would have imagined just a few years ago _ for instance, the way in
the Seattle streets the protesting Teamsters allied with
environmentalist supporters of an international ban on the kinds of
tuna nets that pick up turtles.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, the labor, consumer, environmental,
human-rights, gender and generational rules in international trade
treaties will begin to bite. Their advocates will no longer be
written off as misguided anti-trade protectionists or blind
isolationists.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was only six years ago that Subcomandante Marcos and his
masked Zapatista rebels rose up in Chiapas, Mexico, ostensibly
against NAFTA, or the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On the very eve the trade treaty became law, the army of peasant
guerillas marched into the plaza of San Cristobal de las Casas, in
Mexico, identifying themselves and declaring open war on the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free trade agreement is a death certificate for the Indian
peoples, which are expendable for the government of Carlos Salinas
de Gortari,'' Marcos said, catching the pro-NAFTA patriciate
off-guard.
</P>
<P>
   By now, of course, the insurgents and their revolutionary
movement leaders have tailored their demands to more modest aims,
hidden their dismally few weapons and essentially gone back into
the hills. As such, the Chiapas rebellion belongs more to Mexico's
history books than to its everyday political life. And an
assessment of its impact is more properly a historical exercise
than a political one.
</P>
<P>
   But part of the Zapatista rebellion's legacy lives on, if only
through its promise, in recent events in Seattle: the
demonstrations and riots during the Nov. 30-to-Dec. 3 World Trade
Organization meeting. Once again the protest was, at least in part,
about the enormous gap between the have-nots and the beneficiaries
of world ``free'' trade.
</P>
<P>
   There always was a missing party during the entire 1992-'93
NAFTA debate involving Mexico, the United States and Canada. The
latter two nations were aptly represented not merely by governments
and industry but also by social and political forces such as
grassroots activists, NGOs or non-govermental organizations, labor
unions and environmental groups. But where were their Mexican
counterparts?
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions _ a scattering of women's and human-rights
groups, a tiny band of intellectuals, occasionally Mayor Cardenas
of Mexico City and his Party of the Democratic Revolution _ the
civil society and political forces of Mexico did not participate in
the NAFTA debate.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe the reason for this absence was the fact that all
Mexican interests were totally identified with those of the former
Salinas administration and the business community. Why, even
environmentalists and maquiladora workers found themselves
``represented'' by the Salinas technocrats and plutocrats or the
Monterrey magnates.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that the social silence and absence sprung from
the repressive remnants of the Mexican authoritarian political
system.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, there certainly were critics of the free-trade
treaty in Mexico. They supported, for example, the inclusion in
NAFTA of chapters on stringent protection for labor, environmental,
human and consumer rights, with real sanctions and teeth in them.
They also advocated transparent, expeditious and accessible
mechanisms for complaint and conflict resolution. Ironically, these
critics and their demands enjoyed far more support in Washington
than in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until Marcos and his troops burst forth upon the scene.
</P>
<P>
   As Tim Golden wrote in The New York Times on Jan. 9, 1994, ``In
timing their strike to NAFTA's implementation, the rebels took aim
at the official faith that by fixing their economic destiny to that
of wealthier nations, all Mexicans would be raised into a modernity
of more jobs ... and a fuller democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now this was a strange occurrence, in certain ways, because one
might have imagined that the best way to accomplish, for example,
the unionization of more than 1 million maquiladora workers in
northern Mexico, given the difficulties of prying open the Mexican
labor movement, would be through international means. But it did
not happen at the time.
</P>
<P>
   And it did not really happen in Seattle either. All the
governments from the rich ``North'' and the poor ``South'' were at
the event. Every protester and his or her cousin from the United
States and Western Europe, it seemed, was also there, clamoring at
the convention center against corporate greed, global
commercialism, the rich-poor gap and so forth. But grassroots
organizers, non-governmental organizations, ``greens,'' labor
unions, consumer protection groups _ as well as women's-rights,
child-labor and student activists from the South were largely
absent.
</P>
<P>
   Partly this relates to cost and distance. For many, the plane
fare is too expensive; so are hotel rooms and accompanying travel
costs. But there are social factors too, such as the well-founded
fears of many Indonesian, Pakistani and Egyptian activists to
openly voice their complaints. Also a nationalistic reluctance in
many left-wing quarters of the ``South'' to acknowledge any
international alliances as totally kosher.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, what Seattle and other global venues (such as the 50th
anniversary World Bank celebration) have shown is quite instructive
_ for instance, that if Indonesian workers organizing for better
conditions in local sports-shoe factories are to find any allies,
it will be most likely among the up-scale consumers of Nike
footwear in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles _ though not
necessarily among the teen-agers in the projects and ghettoes.
</P>
<P>
   Or that if sweatshop workers in El Salvador fighting for their
basic rights are to have any chance of winning their struggles, it
will likely be thanks to consumers boycotting GAP jeans and
clothing in the United States. Or that if child-labor adversaries
in Pakistan and India are to find support, it will probably be from
groups that force governments to compel Pakistani or Hindu
importers to desist from employing children _ those under 14, at
least.
</P>
<P>
   Or that if indigenous groups in Chiapas, Ecuador or the Amazon,
or environmentalists in Mexico and Brazil, or fruit pickers in
Chile are to make any headway in their demands, it largely will be
as a result of alliances with consumer groups, ``greens,'' labor
unions and citizens' organizations in the ``North'' who, for their
own reasons, and with their own agendas, will bring their
burgeoning power to bear on the defects of the globalization
process.
</P>
<P>
   Capital has become fluid and terribly footloose today, mobile
and transient across state and continental borders. That, we are
told by economists and globalization boosters, is why any form of
national regulation, taxation, protection or ambition is hopelessly
condemned to irrelevance. However self-serving or plainly false
such an argument may be, it does contain a grain of truth, as well
as several positive implications.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, indeed, capital can move anywhere, and make it possible
to manufacture elegant leather goods or trendy clothes, exotic
fruits and cheap but sophisticated electronics. But there are only
a limited number of consumers of these items, and they are all
grouped together in 20-or-so nations. Moreover, these consumers are
linked by the same networks _ of advertisers, activists, Internet
servers and lifestyles; they belong to the same ``niches'' for
marketing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In these countries, small, active and dedicated groups of
minorities can move mountains _ particularly if they are made up of
social strata with increasing leisure time, money to spend, causes
to back and '60s nostalgia and liberal ideals to nourish.
</P>
<P>
   At some point soon _ maybe at the next round of WTO talks _
those folks who were so notably absent from the Seattle summit will
show up. Perhaps they'll meet their U.S. and European counterparts
and begin to bridge the gaps between North and South in a way few
would have imagined just a few years ago _ for instance, the way in
the Seattle streets the protesting Teamsters allied with
environmentalist supporters of an international ban on the kinds of
tuna nets that pick up turtles.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, the labor, consumer, environmental,
human-rights, gender and generational rules in international trade
treaties will begin to bite. Their advocates will no longer be
written off as misguided anti-trade protectionists or blind
isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want a more humanitarian, balanced and
environment-friendly type of free trade will perhaps become part of
the same globalized world that today's corporate beneficiaries are
so enthusiastically promoting.

&HT;     PRIEST FACES TRIAL FOR WRESTLING WITH RECTORY WORKER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Note optional trim.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two years after a Roman Catholic parish in
Burlingame was stunned by disclosures of a nocturnal wrestling
match between the church's pastor and a teen-age male rectory
worker, the case is heading to trial in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Mediation late last year failed to settle differences in a
personal injury lawsuit lodged by the teen _ who is now an adult _
against the Archdiocese of San Francisco and the priest, the Rev.
James Aylward.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit contends that the teen was ``physically and mentally
abused'' by the priest for more than a year while working in the
rectory of St. Catherine of Siena Church, and that the archdiocese
sanctioned the misconduct by failing to discipline the priest.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims damages of more than $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Archdiocesan officials and Aylward, who have maintained that the
improper conduct consisted of a single incident of ``horseplay and
wrestling,'' vehemently deny the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   And law enforcement officials who investigated the accusations
said they lacked enough evidence to file charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing happened,'' said Paul Gaspari, the lawyer who is
representing the archdiocese and Archbishop William Levada, who as
head of the Catholic Church in San Mateo, San Francisco and Marin
counties, also is a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The case achieved notoriety in part because of the way the
incident was discovered and because of the odd circumstances that
transpired afterward.
</P>
<P>
   A parish priest, who had worked as a federal prosecutor prior to
his ordination, stumbled upon the encounter in a darkened rectory
room and reported it to both church and civil authorities. Soon
afterward, that priest, the Rev. John Conley, was placed on
administrative leave. The archdiocese said Conley was disciplined
for previous transgressions and for insubordinate and disrespectful
behavior toward his bishop.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly unusual move, Conley then sued his own religious
superiors, maintaining that he was defamed and penalized for
reporting suspected child abuse. That lawsuit was dismissed in San
Francisco last year and is on appeal. Conley remains on
administrative leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't do what they are asking him to do, which is to submit
to psychological counseling,'' said Michael Guta, the lawyer
representing Conley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our contention that what happened to Father Conley was
an attempt to neutralize the witness to a boy being molested. They
figured the best way to do that is to say that Father Conley is
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Aylward, now 61, publicly apologized for his ``foolishness and
imprudence'' for engaging in conduct that is forbidden by
archdiocesan policy, and said he was seeking counseling. About
seven months after the incident was exposed, Aylward _ who was
ordained in 1964 and appointed to St. Catherine's in 1996 _
resigned from the parish, attributing his departure to ``personal
and administrative pressures'' and to health reasons. He has since
served at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Mill Valley as
associate pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the teen, a former altar boy, filed suit. Because
he was a minor at the time, his identity is being protected by the
court.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is scheduled for April in San Francisco Superior
Court.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, called John Doe in the suit, was hired by Aylward
in August 1996 when he was 15 to work three evenings a week
answering phones at the parish rectory. According to the lawsuit,
young women and young men were hired for clerical work at the
rectory before Aylward became pastor, but that employment was
limited to young males during Aylward's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his hiring, Aylward began making inappropriate
advances to the teen, the lawsuit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aylward would hold Doe hostage by massaging his neck, rubbing
his back, placing him in head lock, clasping him to his chest in
tight hugs, and rubbing his penis and/or buttocks against Doe's arm
and other body areas,'' the lawsuit alleges. ``Aylward committed
these acts to gratify his sexual desires.''
</P>
<P>
   As time passed, Aylward's alleged advances became more
aggressive, the lawsuit contends.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining that the archdiocese was responsible for providing
its young employees with a ``safe place to work,'' the lawsuit
contends that Aylward should have been immediately removed from
contact with the youth. Yet the lawsuit says Aylward continued to
engage in improper conduct, even after discovery, for two
additional weeks until the teen quit his job on Nov. 19, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of his encounters with the priest, the young man has
suffered ``extreme emotional distress,'' said Justine Durrell, a
San Francisco lawyer representing the former altar boy.
</P>
<P>
   After Conley reported the incident, the archdiocese has said it
conducted its own investigation and concluded that Aylward's
conduct was inappropriate but not sexual. The archdiocese said it
strongly disapproved of a priest wrestling with a youth, but termed
Aylward's conduct a lapse in judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The San Mateo district attorney's office declined to file
charges in the case.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney James Fox said in an interview last week that
the young man told both his investigator and the police that his
physical encounter with the priest was limited to a single
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concluded we would not be able to meet the burden of proof
beyond a reasonable doubt,'' Fox said. ``We did not believe it
appropriate to file criminal charges based on our evaluation of the
available evidence.''

   ESTHER DYSON, TECHNO AGE THINKER,
</P>
<P>
   TO WRITE ``RELEASE 3.0''
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES SYNDICATE
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK, Jan. 18, 2000 -- Esther Dyson, one of the world's
foremost authorities on emerging digital technology, is writing
``Release 3.0,'' an every-other-week column for The New York Times
Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Release 3.0,'' available in English and Spanish, charts the
impact of technology on daily life, and on the world's social,
political and financial fabric.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this column to be full of 'for instances' -- a running
commentary on the wonderful, alarming, funny, curious things that
technology leads to,'' Dyson says. ``It won't tell you what
products to buy or how to use the technology, but I hope it will
make you think about it -- to examine your own choices, to consider
the consequences on politics, business, education.''
</P>
<P>
   The title ``Release 3.0'' follows Dyson's practice of naming her
projects like new computer-product iterations: Release 1.0, the
highly influential monthly newsletter Dyson has edited for nearly
20 years, and ``Release 2.0: A Design for Living in the Digital
Age'' (Broadway, $26) published in 1997 and translated into 20
languages. (The paperback edition, published in 1998, is ``Release
2.1.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Esther Dyson's word on something is what computer industry
insiders everywhere wait for,'' Joan Nassivera, executive editor of
the Syndicate, says. ``She has a well-deserved reputation as a
critic, a seer and a matchmaker who brings together the pioneers
who are creating the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Wired magazine called Dyson a ``one-woman think-tank.'' Fortune
magazine named her one of the 50 most influential women in American
business.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson is chairman EDventure Holdings, a New York City-based
research firm specializing in emerging technologies worldwide.
EDventure publishes Release 1.0 and stages two annual conferences,
PC Forum in the United States and High-Tech Forum in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Fluent in Russian, Dyson has taken special interest in
technology development in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson chairs the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers, a gatekeeper for the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of an English physicist and a Swiss mathematician,
Dyson graduated from Harvard with an economics degree in 1974.
Recently she wrote that she has ``devoted her life to discovering
the inevitable and promoting the possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyson joins a distinguished roster of Syndicate columnists,
including Mikhail Gorbachev, Salman Rushdie and Martha Stewart.

   ESTHER DYSON, TECHNO AGE THINKER,
</P>
<P>
   TO WRITE ``RELEASE 3.0''
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES SYNDICATE
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK, Jan. 18, 2000 -- Esther Dyson, one of the world's
foremost authorities on emerging digital technology, is writing
``Release 3.0,'' an every-other-week column for The New York Times
Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Release 3.0,'' available in English and Spanish, charts the
impact of technology on daily life, and on the world's social,
political and financial fabric.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this column to be full of 'for instances' -- a running
commentary on the wonderful, alarming, funny, curious things that
technology leads to,'' Dyson says. ``It won't tell you what
products to buy or how to use the technology, but I hope it will
make you think about it -- to examine your own choices, to consider
the consequences on politics, business, education.''
</P>
<P>
   The title ``Release 3.0'' follows Dyson's practice of naming her
projects like new computer-product iterations: Release 1.0, the
highly influential monthly newsletter Dyson has edited for nearly
20 years, and ``Release 2.0: A Design for Living in the Digital
Age'' (Broadway, $26) published in 1997 and translated into 20
languages. (The paperback edition, published in 1998, is ``Release
2.1.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Esther Dyson's word on something is what computer industry
insiders everywhere wait for,'' Joan Nassivera, executive editor of
the Syndicate, says. ``She has a well-deserved reputation as a
critic, a seer and a matchmaker who brings together the pioneers
who are creating the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Wired magazine called Dyson a ``one-woman think-tank.'' Fortune
magazine named her one of the 50 most influential women in American
business.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson is chairman EDventure Holdings, a New York City-based
research firm specializing in emerging technologies worldwide.
EDventure publishes Release 1.0 and stages two annual conferences,
PC Forum in the United States and High-Tech Forum in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Fluent in Russian, Dyson has taken special interest in
technology development in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson chairs the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers, a gatekeeper for the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of an English physicist and a Swiss mathematician,
Dyson graduated from Harvard with an economics degree in 1974.
Recently she wrote that she has ``devoted her life to discovering
the inevitable and promoting the possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyson joins a distinguished of Syndicate columnists,
including Mikhail Gorbachev, Salman Rushdie and Martha Stewart.

<P>
   The New York Times Syndicate distributes more than 70 special

ABILENE LOSES BIT OF HISTORY, AND TOWN'S BEST DINING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abilene is not Abilene anymore. Not the real West Texas city
where oilmen swap lies and belly laughs with cattle ranchers, and
then go with bankers to the Petroleum Club for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The Petroleum Club in Abilene has closed.
</P>
<P>
   It was two days before Christmas when the doors slammed shut for
the last time on the Abilene Petroleum Club, and some people here
on the West Texas plains have yet to adjust. Abilene and oil have
always mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel lost,'' said Flossie Osborn, a longtime oil patch
character. ``I feel like a man without a country. It's where I went
for TLC, for fellowship. I met a lot of people there.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborn won't give her age, said she never does: ``I'm an old
lady, but I don't admit it. I try to stay as young as I can.'' But
she will admit to eating at the club twice a day for the past 20
years. ``I was the unofficial mother of the club,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Petroleum Club existed for a half-century in Abilene. It was
in three locations over its lifetime, but the final resting place
was high atop the Bank of America Tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have our own place down on North First,'' Osborn
said. ``Then the bankers talked them into moving to the new bank
and paying rent and utilities. That didn't make any sense to me,
but times were good, and they thought it would never end.''
</P>
<P>
   It did.
</P>
<P>
   Osborn was a part of the oil boom in Abilene. She managed a
company called Grand Mud for 13 years. She was the lone woman boss
over 53 oilfield workers who carted chemicals to more than 70 oil
rigs throughout the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me how I could manage those men,'' Osborn
remembered. ``I always answer: `We had an understanding.'''
</P>
<P>
   She said she wasn't a lady while running Grand Mud. There wasn't
time or a need for it. ``If you're raised in the country and work
like the devil all your life, you learn how to handle yourself,''
she said. ``Sometimes the guys liked me, and sometimes they didn't.
But they always worked hard for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil business crashed in Abilene several years ago, just like
it did everywhere else. Business at the club fell off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a beautiful pla flowers on the tables _ the
prettiest place in town,'' Osborn said. ``That's no lie.''
</P>
<P>
   And the food? ``Honey, I ate it all, I'm not fat but I should
be,'' she said. There was one item she never got around to, though.
The club was known for its ``chicken-fried lobster,'' but Osborn
never got a taste. Never wanted one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an honest steak woman,'' she said defiantly. ``I'm from
dry land. I'm not a fish person.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborn tthe club would survive the hard times, hoped it
would. And when the oil business began its recent recovery, she
looked for a return to the Petroleum Club's glory.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't happen. City clubs and private clubs faced a tough
battle against upscale restaurants and burgeoning country clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The clients moved away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they could pull it out,'' she said. ``I thought that
if you cared enough about something, you could save it. I guess I
was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It's over now, she admits, and there'll never be another one
like it. It is a part of her life she'll never be able to replace,
though she is still looking hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying every place,'' she said. ``I guess I'll join
the country club. I've never been a member out there, but who
knows, maybe I'll join and I'll be able to get my groove back. I
kind of need some culture.''

ROBISON'S DECISION PROVIDES A COMFORTING THOUGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was good news and bad news on the criminal justice front
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Good: Multiple murderer Larry Keith Robison instructed his
lawyers and his family to stop appealing his death sentence and
allow him to keep his appointment with the Texas executioner this
Friday. Robison slaughtered five people near Lake Worth more than
17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bad: A judge in Michigan sentenced 13-year-old killer Nathaniel
Abraham to while away his youth in a juvenile detention center,
which is to say that the kid will be unleashed on society when he
reaches the age of 21. The judge could have imposed a sentence that
would have made Abraham's release contingent upon his
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   This way, the people of Michigan must hope that the revolting
little sociopath will mend his ways and will resist any future
urges to practice his shooting skills on human targets.
</P>
<P>
   The kid's lawyer _ revolting-in-his-own-right Geoffrey Fieger _
has been saying in media interviews that his client was just
``playing with a gun'' in 1997 when he fatally shot 18-year-old
Ronnie Greene Jr. outside a convenience store in Pontiac, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Just playing? That puts a new twist on the phrase ``Boys will be
boys,'' doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   If the judge had gone the other way _ if he had chosen the
``blended sentence'' recommended by prosecutors _ the state of
Michigan could have kept Abraham under wraps in juvenile detention
until he was 21 and then decided whether he should be released or
ordered to serve some time in an adult prison.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Michigan Legislature opined on one of the
morning TV gabfests that the judge was more concerned about the
welfare of the convict than the welfare of Michigan's law-abiding
citizens. Imagine that: a legislator who knows what he's talking
about.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the downside of the justice system. That mess-up in
Michigan is clearly outweighed by the welcome news that Larry Keith
Robison has decided to stop stalling and accept the punishment that
he has so long deserved.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Robison was willing to take that last walk _ he
said he was, anyway _ way back in August. But the brain-dead Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals blocked the execution and ordered a
hearing to determine whether Robison was mentally competent enough
to understand that ``lethal injection'' is a synonym for ``dead.''
</P>
<P>
   He was. And he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competency hearing wasn't my idea,'' Robison said during
testimony at the November hearing. ``There are people out there who
love me ... and they want me to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Robison's mother loves him, and she said so in no uncertain
terms during a segment of the TV show ``48 Hours'' on Thursday
night. Because her son was a lovable little boy _ and because she
adores him, no matter how brutally he murdered those folks in 1982
_ Lois Robison is of the opinion that the state of Texas should
show him some mercy.
</P>
<P>
   She was hoping for mercy when she walked into the courthouse for
her son's competency hearing, but she wasn't counting on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much faith left in the criminal justice system,''
she told ``48 Hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironic, isn't it? That's exactly what the loved ones of Larry
Robison's victims have been saying about a system that allowed a
vicious killer to dodge the executioner all these years, appeal
after appeal and delay after delay.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand a mother's anguish over the impending
death of her son. It's also easy to understand the anguish of those
who have waited so long for justice to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Give Robison credit for wanting to get it over with.
</P>
<P>
   His mother would keep fighting, if he would give her the
go-ahead. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram quoted her:
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still some things we could have done in the courts
to try to stop this, but Larry has made it clear that he does not
want us to continue. We felt like we have to honor his wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   By all means. If Larry Keith Robison wishes, at last, to get
what's coming to him, we should definitely honor his wishes.

JAPANESE CULT SAYS FOUNDER WAS PROBABLY INVOLVED IN CRIMES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult said Tuesday for the
first time that its founder and leader, Shoko Asahara, was probably
involved in the fatal nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system
in 1995 and other criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
   The religious group distanced itself from Asahara and said that
he would no longer serve as its leader, but that its members would
continue to follow his spiritual teachings. Asahara is on trial for
masterminding the sarin gas attack in March 1995 that killed 12
people and injured 5,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we cannot say for sure, since the trial is still
going on, we have come to a consensus that Asahara was likely
involved in the series of crimes he is charged with,'' the group's
senior members said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But the members avoided addressing the question of their own
complicity in the crimes. Many ordinary Japanese regarded the
reorganization announced by the cult Tuesday as largely cosmetic,
and expressed skepticism that it would be any less dangerous. The
cult was widely seen as trying to evade new legislation that would
allow the government to curb its activities.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the group's own statement went on to assert that
``Asahara is a genius in yoga and Buddhist meditation methods and
we will continue to practice those methods inherited from him.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the subway attack, Asahara, 44, is also on trial
for 16 other crimes, including murder, attempted murder, a separate
nerve gas attack and production of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The religious cult also announced a series of what it called
``drastic reforms,'' including changing part of its name from Aum
to Aleph, which is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and
purging itself of teachings that condoned murder for the benefit of
the cult.
</P>
<P>
   Aleph, which the cult members said signifies renewal, is also
the name of a company affiliated with the cult, which is believed
to have about 2,100 followers.
</P>
<P>
   Fumihiro Joyu, the group's former spokesman and now its second
highest official, apologized to victims of the crimes linked to Aum
and said that the cult would raise money to compensate them through
the sale of real estate and other assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to give a deep apology to the victims and bereaved,
and say that I feel personally responsible as one who belonged to
the same religious group,'' said Joyu, 37, who returned to the cult
last month after serving a three-year jail term for perjury.
</P>
<P>
   While Joyu is widely seen as the cult's de facto leader, the
religious group said Tuesday that its acting head Tatsuko Muraoka,
49, would immediately assume the leadership mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Muraoka said in a statement Tuesday that the cult still
considered Asahara as ``a spiritual being'' but that he no longer
had the authority to direct cult members.
</P>
<P>
   She said that all followers had been instructed to abandon any
dogma considered dangerous and that the new group would pose ``no
threat to society.''
</P>
<P>
   By dismissing Asahara as its leader and undertaking a broad
restructuring, the religious cult is hoping to stave off a move by
the government to closely restrict the group's activities and
finances.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Japan passed legislation that gives its security
forces broad powers to monitor and curtail the activities of
organizations that have committed ``indiscriminate mass murder''
and those whose leaders hold strong influence over its members.
</P>
<P>
   The laws allow the security forces and police to inspect such a
group's facilities at any time and make it easier for victims of
crimes committed by the group to gain compensation.
</P>
<P>
   While the legislation did not mention Aum by name, lawmakers
said it was specifically aimed at the religious cult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aum knows that it cannot escape the introduction of the new
law and this is their way of trying to avoid it,'' said Shoko
Egawa, a freelance journalist who is known for her coverage of Aum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Externally, they may have changed their name, but internally
everything is the same. They are meditating to Asahara,'' said Ms.
Egawa, whose friend, a lawyer who had sought to convince followers
to leave the cult, was slain by Aum members.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Hideo Usui said in an interview with reporters
that the government would ``carefully watch'' the cult's activities
to determine whether the reforms were intended to escape the
application of the new laws.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation came in response to growing public concerns in
Japan over Aum's increasing membership and commercial activities in
the past year.
</P>
<P>
   As the group acquired new buildings to accommodate followers and
operations across Japan, local residents and municipal governments
held protests and refused to allow cult members to register as city
residents, in an effort to drive them away.
</P>
<P>
   Television news programs Tuesday night showed citizens protest
groups camped outside Aum facilities. The groups said that they
still considered the cult dangerous and vowed to continue their
protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has changed except for the name,'' said a woman in
Otawara, a farming village 80 miles north of Tokyo, where residents
have staged huge protests outside an Aum residence.
</P>
<P>
   Kenji Utsunomiya, who heads a group of lawyers representing
victims of the subway attack, said that unless the cult ``severs
itself from Asahara and his teachings, we can't trust them.''
</P>
<P>
   Utsunomiya said that the cult had not yet fully disclosed all
its assets, which he contends should be used to pay the claims of
victims and their relatives.

VINCENT `THE CHIN' GIGANTE LOSES FINAL APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He once wandered the streets of Greenwich Village
in pajamas and bathrobe in what his pursuers said was an attempt to
show that he was mentally incompetent to stand trial for
mob-related crimes. In behaving that way, Vincent Gigante sparked a
lot of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he lost his final appeal when the U.S. Supreme Court
refused to hear his case. The justices turned him down without
saying a word.
</P>
<P>
   So Gigante, now in his early 70s and by all accounts a shell of
the frightening man he once was, will continue to serve a 12-year
prison sentence for racketeering and murder-conspiracy charges.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal that the High Court turned away contended that
Gigante was denied a fair trial before his 1997 federal court
conviction because a key government witness testified from a remote
location via two-way closed-circuit television.
</P>
<P>
   Gigante's lawyers had contended that the closed-circuit
arrangement violated his constitutional right to face his accusers.
No, a federal appeals court declared; the televised testimony was
close enough to a live courtroom appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant's lawyers had also contended that their client
suffered because the jurors improperly discussed the case among
themselves throughout the trial. That contention also was rejected
last year by the trial judge, Jack B. Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Gigante's pajamas-and-bathrobe routine was ridiculed by the
authorities, but it worked _ and for quite a while. He was able to
stave off a trial for seven years while lawyers argued over whether
he was truly incompetent to stand trial or simply pretending.
</P>
<P>
   He was simply pretending, the courts finally ruled. Forced to
stand trial at last, Gigante was portrayed as a cold-blooded
gangster.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997 the jurors found that, among other things, he had
plotted unsuccessfully to kill John Gotti, the head of the rival
Gambino crime family, in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And they found Gigante guilty of plotting to kill other gangland
figures and of running lucrative rackets as one of the leaders of
the notorious Genovese crime family. The jurors acquitted him of
having ordered three slayings and could not agree on four other
murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   When the verdict was read, Gigante's eyes widened briefly,
though he managed to keep the same blank expression he had worn
through the trial, and for that matter while he was wandering the
streets like a sleepwalker in his nightclothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``His criminal charade is over,'' a jubilant prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   So, in a way, was an era, or at least part of one. Vincent
Gigante in his prime could have played a role in ``The Godfather''
without acting. He had a good gangster nickname _ The Chin, because
he had a prominent one _ and he had a brother who was a priest.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the last word on Vincent Gigante came not from the
Supreme Court on Tuesday but from Weinstein, when he sentenced
Gigante late in 1997. ``This defendant must be sentenced both for
what he was and for what he is,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Age was indeed catching up with the old mobster, manifesting
itself in heart disease, weight loss and other ailments. ``He is a
shadow of his former self,'' the judge said. ``An old man finally
brought to bay in his declining years.''

A GERMAN WINE IN AN ALSATIAN TOUCH MADE IN AUSTRALIA WITH LABELS IN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Unexpected pleasure is one of the joys of tasting wine. That is
why I was so happy to discover Australian rieslings, whose finesse
and crisp, refreshing flavors took me by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Riesling is a great white grape (many say the greatest) but it
has never had the popularity of chardonnay or even sauvignon blanc
in the United States. This is mostly because rieslings soar to
their greatest heights in Germany and Alsace, wine regions that
many Americans regard as alien and intimidating. The United States
produces some decent rieslings (Bonny Doon's come to mind), but
never good enough or in sufficient quantity to make a dent in the
American market.
</P>
<P>
   Australia has long had its own market for rieslings, but they
have generally been the kind of dismal wines sold in cartons and
poured through a spigot. Over the last few years, though,
Australian wineries have changed their approach, tearing out vines
from hot, irrigated areas and replanting in cooler regions, where
riesling is more likely to flourish. Areas to look for on labels
include the Clare Valley in South Australia and the Margaret River
in Western Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The results speak for themselves: wines made more in the
Alsatian style than the German, meaning dry and beautifully
scented, steely rather than luscious, and with more alcohol and
less sugar than is typical in Germany. Perhaps most comforting for
Americans, the labels are in English.
</P>
<P>
   The six wines here are listed in order of preference. A
suggestion: While the tendency is to serve white wines cold, these
wines almost always taste better slightly warmer, say, 20 to 30
minutes out of the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Leeuwin Estate, Margaret River, 1997 $22 &QL; 
Floral aromas, complex well-balanced peach and pear flavors. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ God is in the details, the architects say. And if
you're a restaurateur opening a hot, cool-looking new place, He may
be in the waiters' cobalt-blue utility belts.
</P>
<P>
   That was Diane Ghioto's thinking when she designed the
Ultrasuede belts to match the two-tone tile in Isla, her new
Cuban-themed restaurant on Downing Street in Manhattan. As a former
accessories editor for Elle, Ms. Ghioto thought long and hard about
The Look of the '50s-modern decor and the 2000-modern staff.
</P>
<P>
   She tried guayabera shirts for the first couple of nights, then
decided they looked like a Cuban cliche. Now, as long as her
servers wear saturated black, they pass muster. ``I have a really
big problem with faded black things,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And they must wear the blue utility belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one thing that sets apart the servers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Setting them apart isn't as easy as it once was. The old
modified penguin has been extinct at cutting-edge establishments at
least since the '60s, when waiters started wearing love beads.
Later came the khakis and button-downs. But in this era of
self-conscious stylishness, waiterwear is expected to make as much
of a design statement as the matchbooks and bar stools. It is now
possible for New York diners to confuse their server with a
Buddhist priest, a Benedictine monk, a garage mechanic, a chef, a
dishwasher or a perfume ad. Anything but a waiter.
</P>
<P>
   Take Local. There's nothing Asian about this newish haute diner
in the theater district. But the waiters wear black
mandarin-collared jackets that evoke an Eastern devotional
aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't want to do a tie and a traditional shirt,''
said David Napolitan, the managing partner of Local. He said he
didn't think of the jackets as devotional, but as a futuristic
``Star Trek'' thing, though he does think they emphasize ``the
sanctity of the food.''
</P>
<P>
   They were designed with the aid of a Broadway costume designer,
Stev Taylor, for $60 to $70 each, Napolitan said _ a midrange price
for high-end waiterwear. Local also recently costumed the servers
working the long chef's counter in tie-dyed blue and green chef's
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchenwear as waiter attire is another mini-movement away from
the traditional tie-and-vest uniform. At Beacon, the waiters wear
chef's coats. Buttons on the side. Everything but a toque on top.
The subliminal message seems to be, This place is so good, our
waiters could drop their note pads and grill a quail on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Waldy Malouf, the actual chef at Beacon, explained his concept.
``I wanted the uniforms to be unique,'' he said, an extension of
the open kitchen that would make the customer feel ``part of what
was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   This gimmick, Malouf said, ``has been thought of as brilliant,
and it's also been thought of as ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the chefs at Beacon do not wear waiter uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Lupa, Mario Batali's new Greenwich Village osteria, takes this
look a little further down the culinary food chain. The servers
sport loose-fitting white smocks that are either ``butchers'
jackets,'' as one of the owners, Jason Denton, said, or
dishwashers' shirts, which they also strongly resemble.
</P>
<P>
   All black, the New Yorker's staple uniform, is still alive and
well from the Village (EQ, Coup) to the Upper East Side (the black
pants and long-sleeve polo shirts worn at Nicole's are conveniently
for sale in the Nicole Farhi store upstairs: $100 for the polo
shirts, $170 for the pants).
</P>
<P>
   For Icon, in the new W Court hotel at 39th Street and Lexington
Avenue, Michael Trenk, the general manager, considered the mandarin
collar. ``I almost went that way,'' he said. ``But they didn't look
that good on our wait staff. They looked sloppy, like a bunch of
ninjas running around.'' He switched to black miniskirts with a
slit up the side and black scoop-necked stretch tops. ``Sexy but
not too revealing,'' Trenk said. ``Right on the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it goes without saying that 95 percent of Trenk's servers
are women. The men wear black pants, and black DKNY shirts with
gray Calvin Klein T-shirts underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of gray, wasn't it supposed to be the new black? It is
at two very designy new places: Quantum 56 and the Brasserie. Axel
Rudolph, the general manager at Quantum 56, in the Drake hotel,
described his wide-collared gray shirts as ``shimmery gray.''
</P>
<P>
   Together with black pants or skirts and long black vests, they
are intended to match the gray leather chairs in the restaurant's
neo-Bauhaus design. ``It's not a monkey costume,'' Rudolph said.
White, he added with a note of disdain, ``would have been too crass
in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brasserie, which reopened last week in the Seagram Building,
was designed by the architecture firm of Diller &AMP; Scofidio. To
complement the curvy wood walls and video monitors that show
pictures of patrons coming through the front door, Liz Diller, a
partner in the firm, chose charcoal-gray shirts (mandarin-collared)
and aprons with a gray plastic pouch for pads, pens and such,
attached with Velcro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to keep it very simple but to have some elements
to make it distinctive,'' said Ms. Diller, who was especially happy
with the plastic pouch.
</P>
<P>
   Are all these vagaries of wardrobe overthink merely harmless
affectations? Or could taking liberties with the monkey suit
further undermine the ever-eroding distinction between server and
servee?
</P>
<P>
   Anne Hollander, the art historian who wrote ``Sex and Suits''
(Alfred A. Knopf, 1994), is a believer in the traditional garb
favored at the bistro around the corner from her apartment in
Paris: black jackets and bow ties, waistcoats, apron. ``It shows
they are willing to work, not just posing and looking decorative,''
she said. ``One of the things waiters do badly is casual _ telling
jokes and being too friendly. They must always be impersonal, so a
costume that shows they can be impersonal is preferable.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an expectations game. You might think waiters clad in a
monastic shirt or jacket will bring you sanctified food or you
might think you've entered the dining hall of a California cult.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Tihany, the architect and restaurateur, has overseen his
share of uniform designs. Also a shirt-and-tie traditionalist, he
said, ``My first and foremost direction is, Make sure the staff
looks like the staff and doesn't look like the customer.'' He
added, ``There's got to be a very strong element of practicality,
not so much because of use and abuse, but because the staff changes
so fast.'' A designer outfit, he said, ``looks good on good-looking
people, but it's not just like anyone can wear a Prada suit and
look fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the servers at Pop on Lafatette Street all appear
to be biding their time between fashion shoots. Sackcloth would
look good on them. (Better than it does on the frites-bearing monks
at Belgo, down the street.)
</P>
<P>
   Roy Liebenthal, Pop's owner, decided garage mechanic coveralls
were the way to go for his retro-mod dining room. What he called
``the whole `Dr. No' vibe'' is accentuated by the telephone
headsets worn by the waiters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a nice way to have uniformity and equality
for male and female,'' Liebenthal said of his grease-monkey suits.
</P>
<P>
   They only cost $30. &QL;

   McCAIN-2000 (Nashua, N.H.) _ When John McCain talks about taxes
or education on the campaign trail these days he frequently tosses
in the observation that ``there is a growing inequity between the
haves and have nots.'' While such remarks would not be

GINGER AND STAR ANISE HELP GIVE AN ASIAN TWIST TO DUCK CONFIT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the French dishes that have always amazed me
is duck confit. I loved it as soon as I first tasted it, in 1988
when I came to work at La Caravelle as a saucier.
</P>
<P>
   At my previous restaurant job, the cooking was very high-end
nouvelle, and I had never encountered anything as rustic as these
slow-cooked duck legs. They were a revelation _ how could duck be
so tender and crisp at the same time, and so wonderfully flavored,
with nothing to it but meat? Not long after that first taste I
started trying to find a way to use the same concept in a dish with
Asian flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Duck, of course, is common in several Asian cuisines, but there
is no tradition I know of where it is cooked like confit. The
traditional French method of simmering duck legs in rendered fat
tenderizes them.
</P>
<P>
   My method is not traditional, but it is easy _ you can almost
ignore the bird as it simmers _ and after the duck has been
refrigerated for a day, you can crisp the skin right before
serving.
</P>
<P>
   My technique differs from the classic French method, which calls
for curing the meat in salt and spices like thyme and allspice for
a day or more before cooking it. The salt cure preserves the duck,
but I dispense with that step.
</P>
<P>
   The French idea is that the salting draws out unnecessary water,
which is replaced first by salt and later by fat. But I think it
also takes out some of the juices, and therefore some of the duck's
natural flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I simply season the duck, add the spices to the fat and
cook it, which gives the meat plenty of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the traditional French seasonings for confit, thyme and
cloves, work perfectly in my Asian-oriented version. To those, I
add two ingredients almost always identified with Asian cooking,
star anise and ginger. The ginger becomes the dominant flavor and
really gives the confit spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Many chefs use confited legs in one dish and the duck's breast
in another, but I combine them. For one thing, it's much easier to
buy a whole bird than parts. I prefer an ordinary Pekin (Long
Island) duck for this dish, because more expensive ducks are no
more flavorful in confit.
</P>
<P>
   You can use the fat and excess skin from the duck to make your
own fat for the confit. Just combine them in a saucepan with a
tablespoon or two of water to keep them from burning, and cook over
low heat until the fat is mostly liquid, with a few pieces of skin
floating in it. (Or you can buy duck fat at some supermarkets and
most specialty markets and butchers.)
</P>
<P>
   I cook the confit in the oven in a covered saucepan, because
it's very easy to regulate the heat. It usually takes four to five
hours at a very low temperature. From that point on, the legs must
be handled gently. If you refrigerate them in the fat, let them
come to room temperature before reheating, so that the fat softens
and the meat can be removed without falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   The breast is already tender, and is best served medium-rare, so
it doesn't make sense to confit it. I simply roast it on the bone,
as I cook all my meat, so that it stays juicy. Carving it will take
just a minute. Since the breast takes only a few minutes to cook,
the timing with the reheated confit is nearly perfect.
</P>
<P>
   To make the Asian theme of this dish more complex, I create a
quick sauce based on wasabi and watercress. The watercress mimics
the wasabi flavor and some of the same heat, and their colors also
match. Fresh wasabi is hard to find and very expensive; wasabi
powder works fine. A touch of soy sauce completes the sauce, which
cuts through the richness of the duck while intensifying its
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   We serve the duck with buckwheat spatzle, but any fresh egg
noodle, tossed with a little butter, would be a lovely side dish.
</P>
<P>
   Asian Duck Confit with Roasted Duck Breast and Wasabe Sauce
</P>
<P>
   Total time: 24 hours (1 hour active work time)
</P>
<P>
   1 4- to 5-pound duck
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 cups (about 1/2 pound) duck fat, or a bit more
</P>
<P>
   10 nickel-size slices of ginger
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves
</P>
<P>
   5 star anise
</P>
<P>
   3 sprigs thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 small bunch watercress, about 2 ounces, stems removed
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon wasabe powder
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup duck or chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Remove the duck legs. Cut
off the second and third joints of the wings and discard or use for
stock. Return the carcass, with the breast still on it, to the
refrigerator. Salt the legs well and put them in a saucepan with
the duck fat, ginger, cloves, anise, and thyme. Bring to a boil,
make sure the meat is submerged in fat (add more fat if necessary),
then cover the pan with foil, and put in the oven for 4 to 5 hours,
or until the duck offers almost no resistance to a thin-bladed
knife or skewer. Cool, then refrigerate, fat and all, for at least
a day. Bring to room temperature before proceeding with the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   2. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Score the duck breast in a
cross-hatch pattern at 1/4-inch intervals, and season well with
salt and pepper. Put the tablespoon of olive oil in an ovenproof
skillet over high heat and wait a minute, then brown the duck on
the meat side, shifting it from one side to the other, for about 4
minutes, moving it occasionally so that it doesn't stick. Turn it
meat-side up and transfer to the oven. Roast, meat side up, for
about 15 minutes, or until the meat is browned and medium-rare (an
instant-read thermometer will register about 130 degrees). Keep
warm while you complete the recipe, but do not carve yet.
</P>
<P>
   3. While the duck is roasting, make the sauce: Blanch the
watercress in boiling salted water to cover for about 30 seconds.
Drain, then rinse in cold water and squeeze dry. Put it in a
blender with salt, pepper, wasabe, stock, soy sauce, and remaining
olive oil and puree until very smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning _
it should be quite hot.
</P>
<P>
   4. Gently and carefully remove the confited from their fat _
they will each stay in one piece if the fat is soft enough. (You
can reheat, strain, and store the fat for a month or longer; use it
for sauteing or more confit.) Brown the skin side with just the fat
that remains clinging to it _ you can do this under the broiler or
in a skillet over medium-high heat; either way, it will take less
than 5 minutes. Remove the duck breast from the bone and slice
thinly. Arrange on a plate with some of the confit and spoon the
wasabe sauce around all.

WINE TOO GOOD TO LET SLIP BY UNHERALDED 
</HEADLINE>

 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the course of time and columns, good wines come along that
seem to defy pigeonholing. Some don't fit into any category I'm
writing about at the moment; some don't fit into any category at
all. So they slip by unreported. Here are a few wines that deserved
a better fate.
</P>
<P>
   A HANDMADE FRENCH SYRAH
</P>
<P>
   The first is from the Languedoc, the ancient French region that
extends along the Mediterranean coast from the Rhone to Narbonne
and beyond. Historically the source of much of France's vin
ordinaire, it became, in the 1970s and 1980s, the scene of a major
agricultural revolution, as thousands of vineyard acres were
replanted with the so-called noble varieties _ cabernet, merlot and
chardonnay among them.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting wines were far better than what had come before,
but they were commercial wines, for the most part, produced on a
huge scale. More recently, small estates have begun to flourish in
the region, much as they do in Burgundy and the Rhone Valley. Many
of the winemakers have come from the Rhone, bringing their grape
varieties with them. Syrah is the favorite grape among the
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clos des Truffiers is an estate in the hill town of
St.-Pargoire, overlooking the city of Beziers and the
Mediterranean. The wine from the Clos is made from syrah vines
planted in the 1960s, long before the current vogue for the grape
in the Languedoc. In a region where big yields are expected from
vines, the 1997 Clos des Truffiers was made from an incredibly
small harvest of one ton an acre. The grapes were picked, sorted
and destemmed by hand and crushed by foot, still one of the
gentlest ways to extract the juice but not the bitterness of the
grapes.
</P>
<P>
   After 17 months in new oak, the wine was bottled unfiltered. It
is a rich, concentrated, altogether remarkable wine with layers of
flavor. Only 3,200 bottles were produced; if you can find one, it
will cost about $100.
</P>
<P>
   AN OUTSTANDING PINOT NOIR
</P>
<P>
   Argyle is one of those wine names without a modifier. It isn't
Argyle Cellars or Argyle Vineyards _ it's just Argyle. Actually,
it's the principal label of the Dundee Wine Co. in Dundee, Oregon,
and it has every right to stand on its own. A succession of
outstanding pinot noirs have appeared in recent years under the
Argyle label. Outstanding for quality and for price.
</P>
<P>
   I have been enjoying the 1996, a lighter-bodied and less intense
wine compared with the fine 1994 Oregon pinots. But great
Burgundies are often surprisingly light-bodied; one doesn't look
for zinfandel thickness in a good pinot noir. Not a wine for the
ages, this 1996 should probably be drunk over the next two or three
years. But at around $15, it offers the enjoyment of many a
Burgundy at twice the price.
</P>
<P>
   AN EXCEPTIONAL CABERNET
</P>
<P>
   Giorgio Grai is one of the legendary winemakers of Italy but is
almost unknown in this country. The late Sheldon Wassermann, who
wrote extensively about Grai in ``Italy's Noble Red Wines''
(Macmillan, 1991), once said: ``Giorgio is only interested in
making the wine. Selling it interests him not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather like an appellate court judge, Giorgio Grai is rarely
involved in the early stages of winemaking. He has never owned
vineyards, but he does make wine, for many different cantine, or
wineries. For his own label he prefers to buy finished wines and
blend them. He is from the Alto Adige in the far north of Italy,
but he makes wine in Tuscany, the Piedmont and as far south as
Apulia.
</P>
<P>
   His cabernet sauvignon is considered by many Italians to be the
best produced in that country. It is full-bodied with classic
black-currant flavors, but its elegance and long finish are neither
Bordeaux-like nor Italian. It is an exceptional wine, and most
unusual. It, too, is difficult to find; around $30.
</P>
<P>
   A cabernet Grai makes for Marina Danieli, a winery in Friuli, is
in the Grai style but less intense and slightly easier to find. It
is the classic Bordeaux blend of cabernet sauvignon with cabernet
franc and petit verdot. The 1997 sells for about $10.
</P>
<P>
   A FULL-BODIED SPANISH MERLOT
</P>
<P>
   Vega Sindoa wines from Spain are almost unknown in this country,
but they won't be for long. Produced by Bodegas Nekeas in the
province of Navarre, they represent some of the best values in the
wine market, not just from Spain but from any wine-producing
region. With all the junky merlot around these days, this $10
bottle (as low as $8 in some shops) is a revelation. Full-bodied
with just enough oak, it puts more than a few American merlots to
shame.
</P>
<P>
   A tip: Navarre is noted for its rose. If you like the merlot,
try Vega Sindoa's rose. It's about $7.
</P>
<P>
   AN IMPRESSIVE BORDEAUX
</P>
<P>
   It's what's in the bottle that counts, right? Well, there are
times when the bottle itself can be pretty impressive. I'm thinking
of a double magnum of Chateau Malmaison I shared with some friends
recently. Malmaison is in Moulis, a town near Margaux in Bordeaux.
That big bottle _ the equivalent of four regular bottles _ was as
much fun as the wine.
</P>
<P>
   Moulis wines will never equal the best Margaux, but they can be
attractive when well made. Along with Chateau Clarke, which it
adjoins, Malmaison was owned by the late Baron Edmond de
Rothschild. Before his death in 1997, he turned Malmaison over to
his wife, Nadine, who has continued his tradition of impeccable
winemaking. Malmaison will never be another Lafite (nor will
Clarke), but it will always be a better than average Bordeaux, at a
reasonable price. A double magnum of the 1995 sells for about $80.
</P>
<P>
   A GREAT CALIFORNIA ZINFANDEL
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a winery returns _ excuse the expression _ to its
roots. Sutter Home Winery in the Napa Valley was once known for a
zinfandel it made from grapes from the Deaver Ranch in Amador
County. This was a big, rustic zinfandel that set a pattern for
other zinfandel producers.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter Home bought Montevina in Amador some years ago and more
recently added a zinfandel made from Deaver grapes to the Montevina
line. There are plenty of great zinfandels coming out of California
these days; one produced from Deaver vineyard old vines deserves
its place among them. It's about $15. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Stone Cold Steve Austin, the bad boy of
professional wrestling, is recovering at a San Antonio hospital
after undergoing surgery to correct years of head-butting,
body-beating behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Austin, aka the Texas Rattlesnake, had surgery Monday at
Methodist Hospital to relieve chronic pain in his neck, arms and
legs. During the nearly three-hour procedure, surgeons removed bone
spurs, or abnormal growths, from vertebrae in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lloyd Youngblood, chief of neurosurgery at the hospital,
said Austin's bruising lifestyle in the ring contributed to the
condition. He speculated that the macho muscled machine could be
sidelines for up to a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were an office worker, he'd be back at work in two to
three weeks,'' he said, ``but strenuous physical activity takes
longer. What we're looking for is solid healing of the bone, and
that takes a matter of several months.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the bone heals, Austin should be able to enter the ring
with the vengeance that's made him famous, Youngblood said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no complications during surgery, he said. Still, it
took a little longer than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's built a little more strongly and solidly than most
patients we operate on,'' Youngblood said of the 6-foot-2-inch,
252-pound Austin.
</P>
<P>
   After the procedure, Austin stood up on his own and attempted to
walk a few steps, Youngblood said. He should be able to leave the
hospital within the next few days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like the champ that he is,'' Youngblood said. ``He's
doing super.''
</P>
<P>
   During the procedure, Youngblood made an incision in the front
side of Austin's neck. The cervical disks were taken out so the
team of surgeons could access and remove the bone spurs irritating
nerves along the spinal canal.
</P>
<P>
   The wrestling star, who has inspired everything from T-shirts to
action figures to video games, continued living the rough life in
the ring until he couldn't ignore the pain and slight weakening the
bone spurs caused, Youngblood said. Without the surgery, he would
have weakened further and had numbness throughout his body, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he minimizes pain. He just tunes it out,'' Youngblood
said.

A CREAMY ANSWER TO FLAVORED YOGURT 
</HEADLINE>

 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Flavored yogurts have never done it for me. They fill
the void and are easy to eat, but they always seem pretty limp.
I've preferred to buy plain whole-milk yogurt and mix in some fruit
myself.
</P>
<P>
   Then I came across Petit Montebourg fresh cheese with fruits.
The cheese, whipped smooth, is what I've always thought yogurt
should be: incredibly creamy, tangy and round in flavor with none
of the sour, chalky taste of other yogurts.
</P>
<P>
   And the cheeses actually taste like the flavors printed on the
tiny yogurtlike packages (about one-third the size of an individual
yogurt pot). The six-cheese packages have two portions each of
berry, peach-pear and banana-strawberry, or strawberry, ap2icot and
pineapple-vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   Peach-pear is the best. It's pure tasting and not too sweet,
though I wouldn't refuse the others.
</P>
<P>
   The big difference between these and real yogurt is the fat
content. These contain cream, unlike most virtuous and dull yogurts
made with low-fat milk. Another surprise: they're not made in
America. They come from a place where people understand the virtues
of cream: France.
</P>
<P>
   Petit Montebourg fresh cheese wat( fruit is $3.59 for a package
of six at Fairway, 2127 Broadway, in Manhattan; (212) 595-1888.

   NEW YORK _ No one can accuse restaurant designers of throwing in
everything but the bathroom sink. The one detail some diners never
see has suddenly become a statement.
</P>
<P>
   At the redesigned and reopened Brasserie in the Seagram
Building, a troughlike sink, fabricated of red resin, runs in one
long unit through the wall between the men's and women's restrooms.
</P>

A BUSY MAN'S INDULGENCE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Back in the old days, when I thought no steps were
too many in a recipe, I made a wonderful roasted monkfish with meat
sauce. It was an understated dish, but absurdly tiresome to cook.
</P>
<P>
   The sauce alone was a reduction that began with meat bones,
continued with roasted vegetables and required a total of four or
five steps over two days. The result was delicious, but so ordinary
looking that only the best-trained palates ever picked up on how
ridiculously complex it was.
</P>
<P>
   When my children were born, this kind of dish fell out of my
repertory as quickly as sleeping through the night. But the concept
is a solid one. Monkfish, sometimes called ``poor man's lobster''
but better described as ``veal of the sea,'' has a meaty texture
and mild flavor that makes it the perfect foil for a deep, rich
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge was how to update the dish and make it possible to
prepare in 40 minutes rather than 40 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious shortcut was canned stock. But when I reduced beef
stock to a glossy sauce, it was too salty and one-dimensional. I
could taste beef (a mild but pleasant surprise), but the flavor
lacked depth.
</P>
<P>
   I thought back to the original process and remembered that the
complexity of roasted meat stocks, or of any stock for that matter,
comes not only from the long, slow cooking of meat and bones, but
also from the vegetables added to them.
</P>
<P>
   So I started by pan-roasting vegetables, just darkly browning
onion, carrot and celery in a little bit of butter, a process that
took less than 10 minutes. Next, I added a spoonful of tomato
paste, for smoothness, body and color (you don't really need it),
and finally a can of beef stock.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later I had my glaze, and although it did not
have the richness of my original work of art, no one I served both
to could tell the difference with any certainty. Water would not
work in place of beef broth _ you need the gelatin that only meat
can give _ but chicken broth would. In fact, when I made this with
homemade chicken broth, the sauce was paler but more flavorful.
</P>
<P>
   The monkfish itself is roasted with salt, pepper and a tiny bit
of olive oil, and its juices are added to the simmering sauce about
five minutes before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Large pieces of monkfish _ those weighing more than a pound _
should be split down the middle lengthwise to make two fillets
before cooking. And remove the thin membrane clinging to them
before cooking so it doesn't seize up and toughen. Just pull and
tug on it while cutting through it with a paring knife; you don't
have to be too compulsive, but try to get most of it off.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most whitefish, monkfish is not better when slightly
undercooked. It requires thorough cooking, to the point where it is
opaque and tender throughout.

COMMENTARY: HEY, STEVE CASE, GIVE ME A CALL: YOU'VE GOT MY MONEY

<P>
   I wasn't quite sure what to make of the America Online merger
with Time Warner Inc. _ the thought of $165 billion changing hands
mostly made me woozy _ until I heard that Ted Turner, one of the
biggest shareholders in the transaction, had said the deal was as
exciting as the first time he had sex.
</P>
<P>
   I think we all have to agree that the shy, retiring Turner has
once again managed to put everything in perspective. This is indeed
as exciting to the rest of us as, yawn, the first time Ted Turner
had sex.
</P>
<P>
   Really now, what's all the commotion about? So what if this sale
creates another incomprehensibly huge media conglomerate that will
determine a large share of what will appear on our TVs, our
computers, our movie screens, our CD players and our coffee tables?
</P>
<P>
   So what if the deal is so big the existing incomprehensibly huge
media conglomerates can't figure out whether the sales price is
$165 billion (New York Times), $156.14 billion (Wall Street
Journal) or $183 billion (Washington Post)?
</P>
<P>
   So what if the new AOL Time Warner will be worth an estimated
$350 billion, which, I'm guessing, is more than the value of some
small continents? So what if this vast wealth will be controlled by
AOL founder Steve Case, whose greatest gift to modern American
culture thus far is the chat room?
</P>
<P>
   So what if this creates the possibility of an annual Christmas
special, simulcast on cable and online, featuring Fred Flintstone,
Wolf Blitzer, the Atlanta Braves, whoever's on the cover of People
magazine that month, and colorized, bootleg film of the first time
Ted Turner ever had sex (hey, this is the Internet)?
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I'm underwhelmed. I'm much more worked up about a
merger now under way in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   A little town called Halfway, it seems, has cut a deal with a
little Internet company called Half.com. This deal, I think, also
will have great big repercussions across this great, big, greedy
land of ours.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wired magazine, which _ who the devil can keep
track? _ may well be owned by AOL Time Warner, the Halfway town
council has voted to change the town's name to Half.com.
</P>
<P>
   To seal the deal, Half.com, a small e-commerce company in
Philadelphia, offered an array of goodies, including stock options
and (woo wee!) six months of subsidized Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway Mayor Dick Crow told Wired that the town, population
360, hopes the name-change will boost tourism. ``Being the first
`dot-com' city in America will ... introduce our rustic beauty to
the country,'' Crow crowed.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which chose Halfway after searching the Internet
for towns with ``half'' in their name, is hoping for big things,
too. ``It's a great opportunity for both sides,'' Joshua Kopelman,
the CEO of Half.com, said. ``We want to boost their tourism (and)
we get a level of attention and publicity and recognition as
`out-of-the-box' thinkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kopelman points out the town's location is perfect. ``They're
within four miles of the 45th parallel, which makes it halfway
between the equator and the North Pole,'' he told Wired
``excitedly.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, some folks might quibble with whether it's appropriate for
a town to surrender its identity, its history, to a company in
exchange for cash and a little publicity.
</P>
<P>
   But that's in-the-box thinking. This is, as Steve Case says,
``the Internet Century.'' We've got to toss out our old,
fuddy-duddy, 20th century way of doing things and ask ourselves,
``Hey, how can I make a buck off this?''
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, I've decided to join the mad dash for cash.
Herewith, I put all incomprehensibly huge conglomerates on notice
that I'd be happy to change my name to whatever they wish. I'll go
by Halfbaked.com, ``You've Got My Money,'' or _ oh, why not? _ Jane
Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, there's not much in this for the conglomerates,
except that I do write a lot of checks to pay my bills, so my name
_ their name _ would be widely circulated among other
incomprehensibly huge conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a bargain. I'm not asking for $165 billion, or anything
ridiculous like that. We can flip the ``b'' to an ``m.'' Heck, at
this point, I'd be willing to settle for something much simpler
from the conglomerates: How about lower prices?

&HT;     THE CONFEDERATE FLAG VS. SCHOOL VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Martin Luther King's birthday was celebrated Monday
in a variety of appropriate ways honoring his nonviolent crusade
for civil rights, from the massive rally in South Carolina
protesting the Confederate battle flag to special community service
projects in cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson used the occasion
to jointly promote a new administration program that would give
additional tax credits to businesses that invest in the nation's
poorest areas, which are often black ghettos. Jackson, a fringe
figure in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People's boycott of South Carolina for flying the Confederate flag
over its statehouse, also spoke at the rally and vowed to spread
the boycott to Georgia, which incorporates the confederate symbol
into its state flag.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson, a former presidential candidate who is arguably the
best-known African-American in public life, has spent more energy
hyping a cause that King would undoubtedly have disapproved.
Jackson led a rally marking King's birthday in Decatur, Ill., last
weekend on behalf of six black students who were expelled from high
school there for a brawl in the bleachers that terrified hundreds
of fans at a school football game.
</P>
<P>
   As rallies go, this was peanuts, attracting only a few hundred
supporters. The cause isn't worth it and Jackson ought to drop it.
</P>
<P>
   But he is trying to turn the incident into a racial issue,
claiming that such punishment is unfairly meted out more often to
blacks than to whites. He points to statistics that indicate a
higher percentage of African-American students were penalized last
year by several big city schools than were white students.
</P>
<P>
   Such statistics, however, do not prove racism. All they prove is
that schools are getting tougher on students who disrupt classrooms
and student activities, take guns to school, peddle drugs and
terrify their peers. This is not about racial discrimination. This
is about controlling and trying to end violence in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson should be preaching individual accountability for
actions that hurt others, not defending thugs on the basis of their
skin color. King was willing to go to jail for his beliefs but
Jackson doesn't want the brawling students to be disciplined for
their violence. In this instance, he makes a mockery of his
mentor's message of peace and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Michael McCuskey ruled last week that the
Decatur school board had the right to expel the students involved
in the fight that sent terrified football fans fleeing and that
left eight people wounded. The judge said the melee stemmed from a
confrontation between members of two rival gangs; this was no
innocent fistfight but one gang seeking revenge by attacking a
student from the rival group.
</P>
<P>
   The frightening scene was taped by a parent and repeatedly
replayed for the nation on television. This was clearly not
acceptable, normal teen-age behavior that could be ignored. Noting
that the school board had never discussed the students' race, the
judge said he was ruling on the case at hand and not upon
``statistical speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   School boards nationwide have been cracking down on miscreants
to reassure parents and students that it is safe to get an
education. The Decatur board and others have adopted zero-tolerance
policies toward violence of any kind. Sometimes this has led to
overzealous enforcement, such as punishing a student for bringing a
nail-clipper to class, but it sends a strong message to students
that they will be held accountable for wild behavior that scares or
harms others.
</P>
<P>
   It is baffling that Jackson doesn't get this. He called
McCuskey's ruling a ``disgrace'' and threatened to appeal the court
decision.
</P>
<P>
   This is nuts. It's a ``disgrace'' to be concerned for the safety
and security of the peaceful majority of students who deserve a
right to attend school events without fear?
</P>
<P>
   During Jackson's first protests against the expulsions, he said
the issue was not about race but fairness, portraying the students
as victims of ``a national intolerance of our kids'' rather than as
the chronic truants and bullies they really were. At last weekend's
rally, however, he tried to transcend the unattractive individual
trees by dragging in the whole forest, claiming zero-tolerance
school policies were discriminatory because they supposedly affect
black students disproportionately.
</P>
<P>
   This will not fly. And speaking of flying, Jackson ought to
concentrate on something that does have public resonance, that
offensive Confederate flag in South Carolina. It was hoisted in
1962 to protest the civil rights movement and waves over the state
Capitol, implying official approval of the slavery policy that
provoked the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   But the NAACP seized the leadership on this one, and Jackson is
left with a marginal role, trying to expand the protests to
Georgia. His problem is that he'd rather star in a bad cause than
be a bit player in a meaningful one.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Almost by definition, stew means meat. Beef, veal and
lamb are the usual foundation of stews, the heartiest food of
winter. But lately, chefs around New York have been creating
intensely flavored stews made with vegetables only. And not just
vegetarians are ordering them.
</P>
<P>
   At Prune in the East Village, Gabrielle Hamilton says she
includes vegetable and bean ragouts on her menu because they are
what she likes to eat. ``I'm a serious meat lover, but I also love
to make a meal out of nothing but vegetables,'' Ms. Hamilton said.
Stews are an obvious one-dish solution.
</P>
<P>
   The trick with vegetable stews is to add as much flavor as
possible to seasonal ingredients, making them heartier and more
satisfying, though based on vegetable broths, rather than beef or
chicken stock. Spices, and plenty of them, are the key. Roasting
also intensifies the vegetable flavor and adds an illusion of
meatiness.
</P>
<P>
   Prune's menu changes every few weeks, but it now includes an
oniony stew of flageolets and chanterelles, enhanced with leeks and
thyme, and a fragrant chickpea stew with North African spices.
</P>
<P>
   At Five Points, Marc Meyer serves a stew of roasted carrots,
onions and turnips with chickpea vegetable puree and risotto
fritters spiced with cardamom. At 21, Eric Blauberg uses
traditional saffron in a bouillabaisse of vegetables like fennel,
artichokes, celeriac, broccoli rab, tomatoes and zucchini, instead
of shellfish, and serves it with classic rouille on toasts.
</P>
<P>
   At Heartbeat, Michel Nishan makes a squash-based winter stew
seasoned with raz al hanout, a North African mixture usually made
with cumin, coriander, ginger, turmeric, cardamom, nutmeg,
cinnamon, cayenne and rosebuds. The stew itself is served inside a
large roasted Hubbard squash. As portions are ladled out, slices of
the squash are cut from the rim and sprinkled with raz el hanout
and fresh herbs like chives and mint. The spices set off the
natural sweetness of the squash, while adding depth of flavor and a
touch of heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrific banquet dish, but takes a little finesse to
serve,'' Nishan said.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Meyer roast some of the vegetables in their stews
(375 degrees until they are tender). Winter root vegetables, like
parsnips, celeriac, turnips, rutabagas and carrots, as well as
winter squash and onions, caramelize in high heat, adding still
another layer of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   At Quantum, Joseph Fortunato roasts tomatoes at this time of
year to concentrate their less-than-summery flavor. He then simmers
them with chickpeas and garlic in vegetable broth to make a robust
stew.
</P>
<P>
   In general, vegetable stews are made like the meat versions. A
base of chopped vegetables is sauteed, then liquid is added, and
the mixture is simmered until soft. This part can take as little as
20 minutes, compared with hours for beef. Starchy ingredients like
rice or dried beans take longer to cook, but they will help thicken
the broth to make what is essentially a rich sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs choose either harmonious vegetables _ all from the cabbage
family, for instance _ or mix-and-match flavors, as with peppery
mustard greens and sweet onions. While many stew-making chefs limit
themselves to seasonal produce, Odette Fada of San Domenico
combines fava beans, peas, artichokes and asparagus with wine and
olive oil in a mellow stew garnished with sharp, salty pecorino
Romano. Called scafata, it is traditionally a spring dish served
when the first new vegetables appear in the markets, but with
high-quality frozen fava beans and imported vegetables it also
works out of season.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Telepan of Judson Grill prefers the seasonal approach,
because he thinks sturdy vegetables are better suited to cold
weather. His vegetable stew reflects the Greenmarkets: turnips,
cabbage, carrots, potatoes, parsnips, celeriac and leeks.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Forley of Verbena takes a different approach with the
stews on her vegetable tasting menu. She often focuses on one
assertive vegetable and builds the flavors around it. In her wild
mushroom stew, for instance, she starts with earthy portobellos,
hen of the wood, shiitakes and other wild mushrooms and accentuates
their flavors with fresh greens and herbs like spinach, chickweed
and parsley. Amaranth adds body and absorbs the dark, rich broth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot of vegetable eaters in here, but they are not
necessarily vegetarians,'' she said. ``It's mostly people who want
to have a vegetable option, even if they do end up ordering the
meat.''

&HT;     AZINGER REMEMBERS PAYNE STEWART AT PEBBLE BEACH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service subscribers)  
 &HT;     By BRIAN MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ One week ago, Paul Azinger sat alone in a
room, his head in his hands, his heart in his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   He had just seen the practice green at the Sony Open in
Honolulu, filled with professional golfers laughing, chatting,
chipping and putting. Full of life. Which was the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like everybody had forgotten,'' Azinger said. ``Life
was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, life was going on without Payne Stewart. Life was going on
without one of the PGA Tour's most popular players. Life was going
on without one of Azinger's closest buddies, who died last year in
a plane crash that brought a premature end to a 42-year-old life
filled with joy.
</P>
<P>
   All of which led Azinger to leave the practice green. He stared
at the floor in a room off the pro shop, wondering if he, too,
could go on. It was Azinger, remember, who gave the most memorable
eulogy at Stewart's emotional funeral last year. It was Azinger who
put on a cap and argyle socks at the service, in tribute to the
outrageous fashion sense of his departed friend. It was Azinger who
wondered why no one was still mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Then he went and did the best possible thing to bring back the
memory of Stewart: He won his first PGA Tour event in seven years,
and dedicated the win to, among others, the Stewart family and
Payne's widow, Tracey.
</P>
<P>
   And in a gesture rich with personal meaning, he boarded a
red-eye flight to California to show up at a press conference
advancing next month's AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. The press
conference, held at Stanford Golf Course on Monday, always features
the defending champion.
</P>
<P>
   The defending champion is Payne Stewart, who had committed to
attend the media day just before his death. Sitting in Stewart's
chair Monday was Paul Azinger, keeping alive the memory.
</P>
<P>
   That Azinger overcame cancer in his back and chemotherapy from a
1993 diagnosis was secondary, the golfer said. More important to
him was the remembrance of things past, and of Stewart'spassing.
It was Azinger who called the promoters of the popular tournament
formerly known as the Crosby and volunteered to make the long
journey. Azinger arrived _ at 5 a.m. on the mainland after his
emotional win in Hawaii _ to stand in Stewart's place.
</P>
<P>
   ``That accident changed the way I look at life,'' Azinger said.
``I always saw the world through rose-colored glasses, even through
cancer. I was confident I'd survive cancer. I was very emotional in
January of 1994 when I saw the tour go on without me. But I knew
I'd get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about Tracey Stewart (on Sunday), at the realization
that the tour is going on. They're similar events, but in a much
worse way. The tour is going on without Payne Stewart.''
</P>
<P>
   Memories stay alive in the eeriest of ways. Stewart so loved
Pebble Beach that Tracey Stewart told Azinger in a Monday morning
phone chat that Stewart would have played his last round ever at
Pebble if he had had a choice. Now, not only will Stewart's name be
remembered during the Pro-Am from Feb. 3-6, but also during the
U.S. Open in June, also to be held at Pebble Beach. Stewart, after
all, would have been the defending champion at that event, too.
</P>
<P>
   Azinger began the healing process last week when he vanished
from the practice green in Honolulu. A friend came in and asked if
Azinger were all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not all right,'' Azinger said. ``It's like everybody's
forgotten. They just went on.''
</P>
<P>
   The friend told Azinger that his fellow pros hadn't forgotten,
and would always remember Stewart on the inside.
</P>
<P>
   Strengthened by the thought, Azinger went back outside and was
greeted by well-wishers. Azinger was buoyed by the moment, and went
on to play the best post-cancer golf of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Then he came to the Bay Area on Monday and stood in his buddy's
place, stronger and sadder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never look at the world through rose-colored glasses
again,'' Azinger said. ``I know that now, really, there is the
potential for a lot of sadness in life. Yes, there's potential for
happiness, too, but I thought of Tracey Stewart (on Sunday), and
that life is going on without her husband.''

   COKE-STAHL _ Coca-Cola's board meets today. Directors are
expected to select Jack Stahl as president and chief operating
officer. Watching other developments throughout the day. (Unger,
Atlanta journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   w/COKE-ANALYST _ A well-respected Wall Street analyst predicted
Coca-Cola will be undergoing ``the greatest sea change in its
business in 20 years,'' including cutting as many as 2,000 jobs
from its global workforce. Sanford Bernstein analyst Bill
Pecoriello estimated that about 600 jobs would be eliminated in
Atlanta. ``That's my own analysis, not the company's,'' Pecoriello
said Monday. (Unger, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   ECOMMERCE _ For traditional retailers, e-commerce has become a
question of when, not if. Almost all of them agree that the
Internet represents both an opportunity and a necessity. Where
there was panic a year ago after the financialcommunity began
keeping score of online sales, today there is a sense of caution.
Retailers feel they have their very brands, many of which were
carefully built long before the World Wide Web was created, at
stake. The only thing worse than not being on the Internet is doing
it badly. (Pletz, Austin American-Statesman). 18.
</P>
<P>
   DELL-DECADE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The story of Dell Computer Corp.'s
rise during the 1990s is sprinkled liberally with superlatives like
``first,'' ``most'' and ``youngest.'' A look at the decade of Dell.

Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   DELTA-PROFITS _ Delta profits fall nearly 10 percent in the
quarter ended Dec. 31 but the carrier still beats Wall Street
estimates. The airline says long-term contracts for fuel have
minimized the effect of higher oil prices _ for a few more months,
anyway. (Thurston, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   WEATHER-CHANNEL _ The Weather Channel is changing like a hard
frost in the midday sun. You still won't find pretty faces
chitchatting about tornados on the Atlanta-based cable TV channel.
But it has added sharper, better detailed local maps, news driven
shows and sweeping sunrises as background sets. Anchoring the
Weather Channel's changing look and programming is a revamped prime
time morning show called ``Your Weather Today.'' Running between 7
a.m. And 9 a.m. Every weekday morning, the show represents stark
break with Weather Channel tradition. (Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 25.

   BELLSOUTH _ Bell South has launched a speech-enabled service
that lets anyone call into a 404 number and _ by speaking _ get the

   ECOMMERCE _ For traditional retailers, e-commerce has become a
question of when, not if. Almost all of them agree that the
Internet represents both an opportunity and a necessity. Where
there was panic a year ago after the financialcommunity began
keeping score of online sales, today there is a sense of caution.
Retailers feel they have their very brands, many of which were
carefully built long before the World Wide Web was created, at
stake. The only thing worse than not being on the Internet is doing
it badly. (Pletz, Austin American-Statesman). 18.

 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I laid two halves of a duck skin side down in a cold pan with a
few unpeeled cloves of garlic and some thyme, covered the pan,
placed it over low heat and went into another room to read.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, I turned the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   And an hour after that, I lifted out four of the most heavenly
pieces of duck I have ever tasted. The slow, enclosed heat had
steamed the meat and softened it like confit. The fat had rendered
and, along with the generous amount of salt I had seasoned the duck
with, had turned the skin chestnut brown with delicious,
caramelized edges.
</P>
<P>
   I crisped the skin in some hot oil, and tasted it right on my
cutting board. It was better than many restaurant dishes, and I had
actually gotten past a table of contents while making it. My only
regret was that I hadn't learned to cook duck this way sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Duck is long beyond its days as the stuffy fare of French
restaurants, and has taken on life in all forms on restaurant
menus. In fact, there are few menus without duck. Slivers of confit
are cradled in spring rolls; wild duck is roasted rare and paired
with things like berries and root vegetables; duck breasts are
turned into a salty, satiny ``prosciutto''; there's even duck
sausage.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, it's hardly a mainstream household food. I've never
been served duck at someone's house, and I rarely cook it at home
myself. Home cooks seem to regard it in the same way they do a
souffle: an appealing idea but a hassle to make.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, duck at home is often a disappointment. Most
cooks roast a duck like a chicken. Its skin browns. It cooks
through. But it is as tough as leather next to a roasted chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Duck needs to be treated differently in order to get the meat
tender and moist, and the skin thin and crisp like a tuile. And as
I discovered recently by cooking ducks _ many, many ducks _ there
are a number of ways to achieve this, and none are the daunting,
messy tasks they threaten to be. As Julia Child, who taught many
Americans which way is up on a duck, said by telephone last week,
it's more interesting and much more forgiving than chicken.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't agree more. But I would also add that the two are
barely comparable. The price difference alone could tell you that:
a roasting chicken is about $1.39 a pound; duck is $2.99 a pound.
But duck is not just fattier; it is actually a red meat. It has a
deep, richly flavored flesh that can be served rare or well done.
And its skin, lined with a healthy layer of fat, crisps in a way
that lean chicken never can.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant chefs tend not to roast it, instead sauteeing the
breasts rare and often roasting or braising the legs until they are
tender. If they do roast it, they usually roast it for just a short
while, and then remove the breasts while they are still rare and
return the legs to the oven to finish cooking.
</P>
<P>
   At home, this method is simply ridiculous. No one is going to
take a 400-degree duck from the oven, grab hold of it and carve off
the breast meat. Besides, I don't agree that this is the best way
to eat this bird. When duck is cooked slowly, its fat renders out
entirely. As it does, it runs over and through the meat, cooking it
and achieving the kind of succulence lamb shanks have when braised
for a long time. As the fat melts from below the skin, the skin
toasts and crisps, for a great skin without having to sear it in a
pan or blast it under a hot broiler.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how I came to the version braised over the stove.
Spencer Hugh Levy, the chef at Spencer, in New York near Irving
Place, prefers to begin duck breasts and legs on the stove over low
heat. He renders the fat, and then finishes the breasts in the
oven, serving them medium rare, and braises the legs.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Pepin demonstrates a similar method in his book ``The
Art of Cooking'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1988). He first cooks the duck
pieces over medium heat to render the fat, and then covers them and
braises them over low heat until they are cooked through, letting
the heat from the fat steam the meat.
</P>
<P>
   I cooked mine longer and more slowly, until the meat was very
tender. And I left it covered the entire time, eliminating the
typical grease-fest of open cooking.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, though, it was not the only way to achieve the
results I wanted.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Union Square Cafe, one of the few restaurants
to roast its ducks whole, without interruption, has served the same
roasted duck dish for more than 11 years. I figured the method was
worth a try. Michael Romano, the chef, roasts the duck until it is
nearly done, and then lets it cool and quarters it. These steps can
be done up to a day ahead of time. To serve, he heats a saute pan,
puts the pieces in, skin side down, to begin crisping them, and
then covers them and transfers them to a hot oven to heat through.
</P>
<P>
   It's foolproof. When I did it at home, the meat was tender, not
meltingly soft. But the skin was as dark as a hazelnut and crunched
like a potato chip. And there was no worry of having to wrestle the
carcass while carving it as people were waiting at the table.
</P>
<P>
   A friend mentioned the slow-roasting method. I liked the image
of putting the duck in the oven and letting it do its thing. I
modeled my method after one by Greg Sonnier, the chef at both
Gabrielle and Gamay Bistro, in New Orleans, who keeps slow-roasted
duck on the menus.

 UNDATED: the menus.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   His recipe, with a sauce of orange juice, sherry and soy sauce,
was a little more complex than what I was looking for. I just
stuffed the duck with root vegetables _ carrots, turnips, garlic,
shallots, beets _ and placed it in a roasting pan, surrounded by
more vegetables. Those inside helped keep the breast moist; those
outside roasted slowly in the fat.
</P>
<P>
   After covering the duck with foil, I began roasting it in a very
hot oven _ 500 degrees _ for 10 minutes, and then dropped the heat
to a temperature even lower than what I use to toast nuts, to 300
degrees. Then I roasted it for four and a half hours, the last hour
without the foil, to crisp the skin.
</P>
<P>
   What came out of the oven was a revelation. The duck had nearly
collapsed under its own weight. Its skin had given up most of its
fat and had reduced to a thin, chewy layer, the color of caramel.
The meat, moist and slippery like buttery rillettes, fell from the
bone. The vegetables had cooked tender in the duck fat, shrinking a
little. I had hardly done a thing, and my oven did not look as if a
fat bomb had exploded in it.
</P>
<P>
   But divine as it was, it had a rival.
</P>
<P>
   I had called Nina Simonds, the author of several books on
Chinese cooking, including ``Asian Wraps'' (William Morrow, $23),
to ask her how to make Peking duck, prepared with the skin
separated from the flesh and the entire duck coated in maltose
syrup and then hung to roast. It's difficult to do at home, she
told me, and instead she suggested a Sichuan dish called ``crispy
skin duck.'' The name was all I needed to hear.
</P>
<P>
   The duck is marinated in rice wine, scallions, ginger, star
anise and Sichuan peppercorns. Then it is steamed whole in a
covered wok for nearly two hours. As it steams, its fat melts,
falling into the water, and the meat relaxes until it weeps.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the challenge is to refrain from eating it as is
(it could, in fact, be served like this without the skin). Steaming
forces the aroma of scallions, ginger and peppercorns to permeate
the bird like a vanilla bean infusing warm cream.
</P>
<P>
   I forged on. Ms. Simonds' recipe next instructs you to coat the
entire duck in soy sauce and cornstarch, and then to fry it whole
in peanut oil. ``Traditionally, it's deep-fried twice, and it gets
so crisp,'' she said. ``But who wants to bother with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Who wants to bother with that once? This seemed not only
dubious, but also frighteningly messy. I did just half the bird.
</P>
<P>
   It was delicious, indeed, and incredibly crunchy. But the mess
was as awful as I had imagined. My sofa across the room still
smells of duck a week and a half later.
</P>
<P>
   For the remaining half, I went back to the Union Square Cafe
method of pan-roasting it at the last minute. As the pieces touched
down on the pan, they sizzled and immediately began crisping and
browning. And by the time they emerged from the oven, they looked
as if they'd been lacquered.
</P>
<P>
   The duck was perfect: the skin was crisp and deliciously salty,
the meat was moist, and its rich flavor had melded completely with
the scallion, ginger and peppercorns.
</P>
<P>
   And I was speechless. What  &UR; was &LR;  I doing all those years
roasting duck like chicken?

   DIFFERENCE IS IN THE BREED
</P>
<P>
   By AMANDA HESSER &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike chicken, where variety is almost always dependent on size
(a roaster or broiler, for example) or how it is raised (in a pen
or free range), ducks vary by breed. And each breed has distinctive
taste and cooking qualities.
</P>
<P>
   PEKIN, a medium-size bird, usually four and a half to six
pounds, is the most widely available. Fed on corn and soy, it has
meat milder than that of other ducks, and less of it. The bones are
heavy, and it's a fatty bird with proportionately less meat for its
size. A four-and-a-half-pound chicken feeds four; the same-size
duck, two or three. The Pekin was used for the recipes in this
article.
</P>
<P>
   MUSCOVY, originally from South America and one of the oldest
duck species, is small and gamy. Used mainly in restaurants, it is
also in specialty stores. Dense, sweet and not very fatty, it is
best cooked pink or rare. One three- to three-and-a-quarter-pound
bird serves two.
</P>
<P>
   MALLARD is a wild breed that is also raised outdoors in
controlled areas. It is hard to come by; you have to hunt it or buy
it from a specialty purveyor. Closer in size to a Cornish hen, it
tastes deeply of liver and is at once sweet and gamy. It should be
cooked medium rare.
</P>
<P>
   MOULARD , a cross between a female Pekin and male Muscovy, is
used for foie gras. Because it is fattened, it grows large, about
twice the size of a Pekin. The breasts, or magrets, are like
steaks, only chewier, with thick fatty skin. Though not very
flavorful, they are on menus everywhere. The breasts are best
sauteed medium rare. The dense, muscular legs are good for braising
and ideal for confit.
</P>
<P>
   Muscovy and mallard ducks and moulard breasts are at specialty
shops and butchers. The ducks are about $24 each; the breasts
(usually two pounds) about $19. Mallards are $28 each; six moulard
legs are $18.25.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: WHEN CORPORATE SYNERGY BECOMES MANIFEST
DESTINY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a scoop for Jim Lehrer. Within hours of the announcement
of America Online's agreement to purchase Time Warner, the two
chief mergees showed up for an interview. (In an image reversal,
America Online's Steven Case was the one with the necktie, Time
Warner's Gerald Levin the one without, inviting speculation that
the $165 billion purchase price had included his tie.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead of further torturing the technological ramifications of
this marriage of the Internet to an entertainment and information
empire and its implications for the stock market, which had been
occupying the cable business channels since the announcement,
Lehrer, in his customary common-sense way, wanted to know what the
merger meant for the mere television viewer.
</P>
<P>
   What difference would it make, for instance, to the PBS
``NewsHour'' fan who has found that an hour a day of discussion of
serious events was worth more than the hours and hours of
repetitious CNN reporting, commentary and Larry King, or to people,
if there are any, who can't get excited at the prospect of buying
twice as much stuff in half the time with a click or two?
</P>
<P>
   Well, what he learned was that the merger had nothing to do with
money and power. No, it was a public service, a liberation for
consumers that promised to enrich all our lives. ``This is not
trying to have control for some self-serving reason,'' said Case.
Levin was reading from the same inspirational script. ``In
business,'' he explained, ``you can have a social commitment.'' He
went on, ``This company is going to operate in the public
interest.'' He went further, ``We want to make a better world.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a revivalist sing-along, lacking only the tribute to a
higher power. Case said he was committed to creating ``the most
respected company in the world.'' Levin was carried away by a
strange image of gobbling up all the information and entertainment
that he foresees flooding America, digitally or otherwise: ``I want
to ingest it'' and ``embrace it'' and ``consume it.'' He sounded
like a commercial for Pepcid AC. He did his own diagnosis and
discovered that his genetic makeup assured ``first-quality
journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a cynic to have trouble swallowing such
image-embellishing claims. These advertisements for themselves,
after all, come from men running institutions with a record. Time
Warner's record these days ranges from respectable but rarely
outstanding news coverage that plays hard on diversions like Monica
Lewinsky. As for entertainment, it swings between the best of HBO
and plenty of pop clutter. (With all appreciation for ``The
Sopranos,'' only in the dim world of television could that show
have created quite such a sensation.)
</P>
<P>
   As for the Internet, with its grand vision as a fount of
information, for America Online subscribers it turns out to be
mainly an engine of marketing. The special appeal of Time Warner to
Case is, he confessed, ``the power of established media brands and
the customer relationships that those brands represent.'' Will the
Internet's much hailed role as an idea exchange be more stimulating
than a typical cable call-in show? What can the vaunted promise
that consumers will now be able to make their own choices really
mean as long as the menus are cooked up by Time Warner and America
Online?
</P>
<P>
   In trying to imagine the secret, tough, complex, high-powered
negotiations that must have gone into their deal, it is difficult
to see Levin and Case, not to mention their advisers from Salomon
Smith Barney, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and other bottom-line
professionals, pausing to worry about pledges of service to the
world. It was complicated enough to figure out how the assets and
the control should be shared without taking time out for mutual
flattery.
</P>
<P>
   The quotations from lesser corporate players prove more to the
point. Executives regaled reporters with the prospect of CNN's
cashing in on America Online's 22 million subscribers and America
Online cashing in on CNN's ``global brand,'' with Time Warner's
enhanced ability to deliver saleable music online and America
Online's ability to carry movies and other features concocted by
Time Warner. Such are the calculations of a culture in which
everything is merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   It is also easy to appreciate the enthusiasm of Ted Turner, Time
Warner's vice chairman and its biggest shareholder, who said,
``When I cast my vote for 100 million shares, I did it with as much
excitement as I felt the first time I made love some 42 years
ago.'' The rise in Time Warner stock immediately after the merger
announcement brought him a paper profit of $2.53 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But what will all this do for Lehrer's viewers? Will the visions
being floated by Case and Levin include the enrichment and
upgrading of the nation's sorry array of television offerings? Will
the new megacompany find it economically inviting to compete with
``NewsHour'' in an upscale interview program? Will it find room for
unprofitable documentaries? Will it take more chances on innovative
entertainments?
</P>
<P>
   Worries have been voiced by the merger's critics that the
movement toward ever larger conglomerates will result in more
uniformity instead of the diversity that the Internet is supposed
to exemplify. But even if that does not happen, the Case-Levin duet
does not inspire confidence. In at least one respect the changes
they envision in the way information and entertainment are
delivered will probably come to pass: There will be more brand
names like Warner and Time, more readily available for Case to
promote. But nothing about this merger offers the likelihood of
higher-quality, pardon the expression, merchandise.

   More than 85 percent of Americans put their photographs in
albums. That's still easy to do for those who use point-and-shoot
cameras and traditional developing at photo labs.
</P>
<P>
   But photos are more often coming in other forms _ something that
America Online users know since AOL became partners with Kodak to
place a ``You've Got Pictures!'' icon on the AOL welcome screen.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that service is not used, it is possible to scan photos
and send them over the Internet, or to have the roll of film
processed and the pictures turned on photo paper and floppy disk
(or CD-ROM).
</P>
<P>
   American Greetings Scrapbooks &AMP; More (Broderbund; Windows; about
$30) can handle pictures in many ways. It has thousands of
ready-to-print projects, so users can create not only album pages,
but photo cubes and keepsake boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Once pictures are in the electronic album, they can be organized
so pictures are easier to locate in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures can be used to make scrapbooks, pop-up albums, shaped
cards, organizers and photo frames. The program also has hundreds
of captions and sentiments from American Greetings' writers, along
with a large collection of drawings and clip art to use with
projects.
</P>

cracks and scratches in old photos and improve contrast.

   BERLIN _ Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl resigned his post as
honorary chairman of Germany's Christian Democrats on Tuesday after
the party's leadership turned on him with extraordinary vehemence
and accused him of ``violating his duties'' by refusing to name
people who secretly gave him money.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's resignation came shortly after the executive committee of
the party instructed him to give up his post if he persisted in his
refusal to clarify the source of secret payments of more than $1
million he received when he was chancellor and party leader during
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The party statement, made after a five-hour emergency meeting of
the leadership, amounted to a rebuke of a man whose stature
appeared untouchable just two months ago. But it was far from clear
whether Kohl's resignation would arrest the party's rapid political
slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to resign is not an easy one,'' Kohl said in a
statement. ``I have been a member of the Christian Democratic party
for 50 years. The party is and will remain my political home.''
</P>
<P>
   Indicating his continuing defiance, Kohl added: ``But I am in no
position to meet the party's demand that I break the promise I made
to those who financially supported my work in the Christian
Democratic party.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's fall from grace amounts to one of the most precipitous in
modern European politics. As the chancellor of German and European
unification, he had towered above his contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday he said: ``I have served in important offices over four
decades. In so doing, I have also made mistakes which I have
publicly acknowledged. I have always tried to do my duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats are in the midst of what the party
leader, Wolfgang Schaeuble, Tuesday called ``one of the worst
crises of our history'' as a result of the revelation of secret
cash payments, overseas accounts and other irregularities during
the 16-year rule of Kohl that ended in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble, who has himself admitted accepting a bag containing
100,000 marks ($52,000) from a fugitive arms broker, had been
widely expected to resign Tuesday. But a statement expressed the
``full confidence'' of the executive committee in Kohl's
57-year-old successor.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Schaeuble's position still appears acutely vulnerable.
His survival, pending a party congress in April, appears to owe
more to the absence of a viable successor than to any real
confidence in him. Two members of the 17-member executive committee
voted against the motion supporting him and one abstained.
</P>
<P>
   Bungled explanations this week attributing some of the money
found overseas to contributions by Jews have further compounded the
party's plight and poisoned the atmosphere with accusations of
anti-Semitism. The party Tuesday took the unusual step of
apologizing ``to our Jewish compatriots.''
</P>
<P>
   The disarray has been such that Germany's normally tight-knit
political system, marked by cozy arrangements between banks,
industry and political parties, has shown signs of unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble tried hard Tuesday to focus attention on his longtime
mentor, Kohl, who has admitted accepting more than $1 million in
secret payments to the party during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The former chancellor, who unified Germany and then hitched the
country to the fate of Europe by abandoning the mark in favor of
the euro, is under criminal and parliamentary investigation for
taking the secret payments, but has said he will not violate the
``word of honor'' he gave to the contributors that their identity
would not be revealed. Under German law, any donation to a party
that exceeds $10,500 must be declared.
</P>
<P>
   Some newspaper and television channels have taken to calling the
once sacrosanct Kohl ``Don Kohleone,'' a reference to the
corruption scandals, some of them Mafia-linked, that brought down
Italy's Christian Democrats in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But there is as yet no evidence that Kohl put the money to any
uses beyond that of cementing loyalty and bolstering local branches
within the party. Only if the identities of donors eventually
become known might it be possible to establish links between
payments and favors.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats are well aware that Kohl's defiance is
intensely damaging to them because it makes a swift conclusion to
the scandal impossible and provides cheap ammunition to the Social
Democratic chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, now revived as a leader
after a generally dismal first year in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The executive is convinced that Helmut Kohl is violating his
duties as honorary chairman if he continues to refuse to contribute
to the resolution of the crisis and the clarification of errors,''
the party statement said. ``As long as he does not make this
contribution, he should lay down his post as honorary chairman.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble, who uses a wheelchair since he was injured in an
assassination attempt a decade ago, said he had spoken to Kohl by
telephone before the meeting. ``His response made this statement
necessary,'' Schaeuble said, suggesting growing exasperation with
Kohl's defiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is respect for the law,'' he added. ``And that
goes for the honorary chairman, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Volker Ruehe, a former defense minister in Kohl's Cabinet, is
among the many leading Christian Democrats anxious for decisive
action to resolve the scandal. Long the favorite to win an
important state election next month in Schleswig-Holstein, he is
now trailing the Social Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   It is this sort of political repercussion that has made a host
of younger Christian Democrats anxious for change, including
Schaeuble's departure. One of them, Christian Wulff, has called for
a wave of resignations. In effect, the party's crisis is now
certain to last until the congress in April.
</P>
<P>
   `` Mr. Kohl's silence exposes the party to the wildest
speculation and damages it greatly,'' said Heiner Geisler, the
former secretary-general of the Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The party Tuesday apologized ``to our Jewish compatriots'' over
its hapless attempt to explain the illegal use of foreign bank
accounts by the leadership in the state of Hesse. Earlier this
week, the longtime treasurer of the party in Hesse, Casimir Prinz
zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, said the money came from bequests from
``Jewish citizens who passed away and wanted to show their
appreciation for the old city of Frankfurt.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the money, totaling about 17 million marks ($8.8
million) represented the untaxed capital gains on money illegally
smuggled out the country under the former Christian Democrat leader
in Hesse and former interior minister, Manfred Kanthner. The funds
appears to have no link to Jews or to Jewish contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Kanthner resigned from the Bundestag on Monday, saying that he
was determined ``to end the witch hunt.'' Tuesday the party said:
``The German Christian Democratic Party, as well as the Hesse
branch, apologizes to our Jewish compatriots for the gaffe with
regard to foreign bank accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveying this general disintegration of what has long been
Germany's best-oiled political machine, Schroeder Tuesday allowed
himself a tone verging on smugness: ``These decisions have neither
contributed to a clarification nor to the advancement of the
housecleaning of the Christian Democrats. The government will see
to it that the image of the Federal Republic abroad is not
damaged.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain will once again batter western Oregon and portions of
northern California on Wednesday as a powerful jet stream
disturbance spirals into the Northwest Coast. Rainfall will locally
exceed an inch from north of San Francisco to south of Portland,
Ore. As the plume of moist air ascends the higher terrain of the
interior, the stage will be set for heavy snow in the southern
Cascades, Klamath and Sierra mountains, where totals could exceed 2
feet by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A tandem of jet stream disturbances will reach the Middle West
on Wednesday, causing a swath of inclement weather from the upper
Mississippi Valley to the northern Tennessee Valley. Several inches
of snow could whiten the ground across Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa
and Illinois on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, a wedge of milder air riding up and over chillier
air near the ground will cause the snow to change to freezing rain
near the Ohio River. In the warmer air to the south, light rain is
likely near the Tennessee Valley. Wednesday night, the jet stream
disturbances will merge near Ohio, bringing snow to the central
Appalachians and Middle Atlantic states. Indeed, several inches of
snow could fall by morning in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Abundant sun will cover New England on Wednesday as the gusty
breezes from the northwest relinquish their assault on the region.
Elsewhere, unseasonably warm conditions will persist in Texas and
the western Gulf Coast. Amid plentiful sun, afternoon readings will
surpass 80 degrees in many locations.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Icy Mixture  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Icy precipitation fell in the Carolinas on Tuesday morning as a
mound of cold air moved slowly to the south. In winter, almost all
precipitation begins as snow 10,000 to 20,000 feet aloft. In the
rainy areas of coastal South Carolina, a layer of mild air more
than 5,000 feet thick melted the falling flakes before they reached
the ground. Farther northwest, in some valleys where a shallow
layer of sub-freezing air clung to the ground, raindrops froze on
cold objects, causing an icy glaze. Elsewhere, a thin warm layer
aloft melted the flakes, but the drops refroze into pellets of ice
called sleet.  &QL;

WINE TOO GOOD TO LET SLIP BY UNHERALDED

<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the course of time and columns, good wines come along that
seem to defy pigeonholing. Some don't fit into any category I'm
writing about at the moment; some don't fit into any category at
all. So they slip by unreported. Here are a few wines that deserved
a better fate.
</P>
<P>
   A HANDMADE FRENCH SYRAH
</P>
<P>
   The first is from the Languedoc, the ancient French region that
extends along the Mediterranean coast from the Rhone to Narbonne
and beyond. Historically the source of much of France's vin
ordinaire, it became, in the 1970s and 1980s, the scene of a major
agricultural revolution, as thousands of vineyard acres were
replanted with the so-called noble varieties _ cabernet, merlot and
chardonnay among them.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting wines were far better than what had come before,
but they were commercial wines, for the most part, produced on a
huge scale. More recently, small estates have begun to flourish in
the region, much as they do in Burgundy and the Rhone Valley. Many
of the winemakers have come from the Rhone, bringing their grape
varieties with them. Syrah is the favorite grape among the
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clos des Truffiers is an estate in the hill town of
St.-Pargoire, overlooking the city of Beziers and the
Mediterranean. The wine from the Clos is made from syrah vines
planted in the 1960s, long before the current vogue for the grape
in the Languedoc. In a region where big yields are expected from
vines, the 1997 Clos des Truffiers was made from an incredibly
small harvest of one ton an acre. The grapes were picked, sorted
and destemmed by hand and crushed by foot, still one of the
gentlest ways to extract the juice but not the bitterness of the
grapes.
</P>
<P>
   After 17 months in new oak, the wine was bottled unfiltered. It
is a rich, concentrated, altogether remarkable wine with layers of
flavor. Only 3,200 bottles were produced; if you can find one, it
will cost about $100.
</P>
<P>
   AN OUTSTANDING PINOT NOIR
</P>
<P>
   Argyle is one of those wine names without a modifier. It isn't
Argyle Cellars or Argyle Vineyards _ it's just Argyle. Actually,
it's the principal label of the Dundee Wine Co. in Dundee, Oregon,
and it has every right to stand on its own. A succession of
outstanding pinot noirs have appeared in recent years under the
Argyle label. Outstanding for quality and for price.
</P>
<P>
   I have been enjoying the 1996, a lighter-bodied and less intense
wine compared with the fine 1994 Oregon pinots. But great
Burgundies are often surprisingly light-bodied; one doesn't look
for zinfandel thickness in a good pinot noir. Not a wine for the
ages, this 1996 should probably be drunk over the next two or three
years. But at around $15, it offers the enjoyment of many a
Burgundy at twice the price.
</P>
<P>
   AN EXCEPTIONAL CABERNET
</P>
<P>
   Giorgio Grai is one of the legendary winemakers of Italy but is
almost unknown in this country. The late Sheldon Wassermann, who
wrote extensively about Grai in ``Italy's Noble Red Wines''
(Macmillan, 1991), once said: ``Giorgio is only interested in
making the wine. Selling it interests him not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather like an appellate court judge, Giorgio Grai is rarely
involved in the early stages of winemaking. He has never owned
vineyards, but he does make wine, for many different cantine, or
wineries. For his own label he prefers to buy finished wines and
blend them. He is from the Alto Adige in the far north of Italy,
but he makes wine in Tuscany, the Piedmont and as far south as
Apulia.
</P>
<P>
   His cabernet sauvignon is considered by many Italians to be the
best produced in that country. It is full-bodied with classic
black-currant flavors, but its elegance and long finish are neither
Bordeaux-like nor Italian. It is an exceptional wine, and most
unusual. It, too, is difficult to find; around $30.
</P>
<P>
   A cabernet Grai makes for Marina Danieli, a winery in Friuli, is
in the Grai style but less intense and slightly easier to find. It
is the classic Bordeaux blend of cabernet sauvignon with cabernet
franc and petit verdot. The 1997 sells for about $10.
</P>
<P>
   A FULL-BODIED SPANISH MERLOT
</P>
<P>
   Vega Sindoa wines from Spain are almost unknown in this country,
but they won't be for long. Produced by Bodegas Nekeas in the
province of Navarre, they represent some of the best values in the
wine market, not just from Spain but from any wine-producing
region. With all the junky merlot around these days, this $10
bottle (as low as $8 in some shops) is a revelation. Full-bodied
with just enough oak, it puts more than a few American merlots to
shame.
</P>
<P>
   A tip: Navarre is noted for its rose. If you like the merlot,
try Vega Sindoa's rose. It's about $7.
</P>
<P>
   AN IMPRESSIVE BORDEAUX
</P>
<P>
   It's what's in the bottle that counts, right? Well, there are
times when the bottle itself can be pretty impressive. I'm thinking
of a double magnum of Chateau Malmaison I shared with some friends
recently. Malmaison is in Moulis, a town near Margaux in Bordeaux.
That big bottle _ the equivalent of four regular bottles _ was as
much fun as the wine.
</P>
<P>
   Moulis wines will never equal the best Margaux, but they can be
attractive when well made. Along with Chateau Clarke, which it
adjoins, Malmaison was owned by the late Baron Edmond de
Rothschild. Before his death in 1997, he turned Malmaison over to
his wife, Nadine, who has continued his tradition of impeccable
winemaking. Malmaison will never be another Lafite (nor will
Clarke), but it will always be a better than average Bordeaux, at a
reasonable price. A double magnum of the 1995 sells for about $80.
</P>
<P>
   A GREAT CALIFORNIA ZINFANDEL
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a winery returns _ excuse the expression _ to its
roots. Sutter Home Winery in the Napa Valley was once known for a
zinfandel it made from grapes from the Deaver Ranch in Amador
County. This was a big, rustic zinfandel that set a pattern for
other zinfandel producers.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter Home bought Montevina in Amador some years ago and more
recently added a zinfandel made from Deaver grapes to the Montevina
line. There are plenty of great zinfandels coming out of California
these days; one produced from Deaver vineyard old vines deserves
its place among them. It's about $22. &QL;

HILLERMAN'S NAVAJO HEROES LIVE ON _ FOR NOW, AT LEAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tony Hillerman doesn't have specific plans to stop writing
mysteries featuring Navajo policemen Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee _
not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But he says he's continually evaluating his work for signs of
burnout, and, after a dozen bestsellers based on the same main
characters, the 74-year-old Hillerman doesn't plan to disappoint
his audience by letting the series go on too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, every book is harder,'' Hillerman says on the phone
from his New Mexico home. ``You don't want to repeat yourself. I
think I'll reach the time the quality is diminished. I'm concerned
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Hillerman's fans are concerned, at least, there's no
reason he should worry. ``Hunting Badger'' (HarperCollins, $25),
released in December, continues to hold a high place on every
national bestseller list. It moves at a brisk pace and is
characterized, as always, by the author's insights into tribal
culture. It bespeaks the care Hillerman took to make it at least a
little different from previous Leaphorn/Chee adventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep moving (the main characters) all around the
reservation,'' he says. ``This one takes place in the north area.
When I write these books, I write them with maps of the reservation
spread all around me. Readers do pay close attention. I get letters
from ones who just read to find errors. They'll say I have
characters going in the wrong direction to get to a place. And
they're probably right _ I have a habit of meaning left and saying
right.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Hillerman notes, he writes about New Mexico and its Navajo
reservation because it's geography he knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this land, I really do,'' Hillerman says. ``I first
came here on furlough after World War II. I became a reporter for
the United Press International bureau in Santa Fe, and then became
bureau manager in 1952. I also taught for 20 years. My first book
was published in 1970. But writing, whether news stories or, later,
books, is the thing I do naturally. That's my work and hobby. I
can't imagine playing golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillerman spends a lot of his time studying writing technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go back and read the guys and gals who make magic with
words,'' he says. ``Joan Didion, for the way she establishes mood.
Tom Wolfe, just for the way he uses words. I want to be conscious
of when I fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillerman tries to be his own toughest critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``For each book, I always start out with a grandiose notion, and
I read it when I'm done and try to grade how far it falls short,''
he says, chuckling. ``I haven't written anything I think is perfect
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   His plot inspirations, Hillerman says, come from reading and
from simply looking around as he goes about normal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the next Navajo book I'm going to write,'' he says. ``I
was sitting in church one day at Mass, and we were rereading from
the Old Testament, a passage where a prophet is waiting for word
from God, not an earthquake but a tiny whisper. I love that
passage. So in the next book Leaphorn, feeling bored after
retirement, hears the tag end of a conversation, a whisper, and it
somehow reminds him of an old case where he wasn't sure the guy who
got convicted was really guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillerman says he'll tie that opening scene into another
involving a fingerprinting technique he has read about: ``That on
rough surfaces, fingerprints last for years. See, I'm always
collecting ideas like that. At some point, you can usually use what
you've picked up on.''
</P>
<P>
   With another Leaphorn/Chee adventure in the works, Hillerman
says he'll simply work from book to book until he decides he no
longer is delivering the quality his readers deserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when that happens, I'll stop the series,'' he says firmly.
``I don't want readers to ever say, `These aren't as good as they
used to be.'''

WB TRIES FOR A LAUGH WITH RETOOLED `NORMAL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Everyone likes a good laugh. The folks at The
WB will pay serious money for one.
</P>
<P>
   Susanne Daniels, president of entertainment at the network
currently known for smart dramas about young adults, goes so far as
to say: ``Our future programming plans are largely dedicated to
creating a breakthrough half-hour series.'' Translation: We need a
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, ``comedy'' has become a dirty word because the
traditional sitcom format featuring joke/punchline/laughter hasn't
been hugely successful the past few seasons. So producers and
executives are careful to distance themselves from the genre,
preferring to focus on shows that might be funny but also poignant,
pithy and provocative.
</P>
<P>
   One such series, The WB hopes, is ``Brutally Normal,''
premiering next Monday night. Shot with a single camera, like a
movie, rather than several cameras in front of an audience, like
most sitcoms, ``Brutally Normal'' follows the lives of _ surprise!
_ four teenage friends as they negotiate the confusing pathways to
young adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The show's own gestation has been a confusing one. Originally
conceived as a single-camera half hour in the fall of 1998, it was
transformed into a one-hour dramedy because, in the words of one of
the producers, the marketplace was ``inhospitable'' to
single-camera half hours at the time. ABC bought the hourlong
concept but chose to pass after the pilot was filmed. Enter The WB,
which liked the show but wanted it as a half-hour series.
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer Greer Shephard is happy to be back with the
original concept, which is a lightly shaded treatment of the events
in a teenager's life. ``They may be fairly minuscule,'' she said,
``but in their minds they sort of expand to hyperbolic, operatic
proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   _The WB and its rival netlet, UPN, are celebrating their fifth
anniversaries this month, and that's pretty much where the
similarity ends. While UPN has finally found direction in catering
to young males, The WB continues with a schedule that still skews
decidedly female. Besides ``Brutally Normal,'' new for the
midseason and summer at The WB are ``D.C.,'' an ensemble drama from
producer Dick Wolf (``Law &AMP; Order'') about five twentysomethings
trying to make it in the nation's capital; ``Baby Blues,'' an
animated comedy based on the popular comic strip about new parents,
and ``Young Americans,'' a semi-steamy drama series set at a New
England boarding school, and specifically earmarked for a summer
launch. Also returning are three shows The WB took off the air for
retooling/repositioning: the Harry Hamlin comedy ``Movie Stars,''
the animated comedy ``Mission Hill,'' and the kids-in-the-hallway
comedy ``Zoe,'' which used to be ``Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP; Jane'' but
now has a shorter name and a more mature story line (the kids are
in college instead of high school).

THE FED GRANTS A LOAN TO SPAIN. HOW MUCH CASH? NONE.

   MADRID, Spain _ The Federal Reserve Board in Washington is known
for setting monetary policy, not for its modest art collection. But
for the first time the Fed has allowed part of that collection,
which is dominated by American paintings, to be shown beyond its
own headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Washington, the public rarely sees the Fed's art because
it hangs in offices and private reception areas. But 34 of the
Fed's 270 artworks are on view in a show through Jan. 30 at the
Banco de Espana, Spain's central bank. The exhibition,
``Architecture and Paintings From the Federal Reserve Board,''
includes a 19th-century landscape of New York state by Alexander
Lawrie that normally adorns the office of Alan Greenspan, the Fed
chairman, and other works by William de Leftwich Dodge and William
Trost Richards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been done before,'' said Mary Anne Goley, the Fed's
fine arts director, of the overseas show. Although the Fed
exhibited 55 recent acquisitions at its Washington headquarters in
1996, this is the first time that any part of the collection has
traveled anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Madrid show is a double payback to Spain's central bank,
which inspired the Fed to build its own collection and lent 13 old
masters, including three Goyas, for an exhibition at the Fed last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Such exchanges are still rare, although several European central
banks _ those in Britain and France, for instance _ have
collections that dwarf the Fed's. The Bank of Spain owns 3,500
works, including eight oils by Goya, who was commissioned in 1783
to paint portraits of the bank's senior officials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 Arthur Burns, then chairman of the Fed and an avid
amateur painter, saw the Spanish bank's art treasures during a
visit to Madrid and returned to Washington determined to expand the
Fed's collection, which then consisted of four paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the central bank of a great democracy, and he wanted to
have something that spoke about our culture,'' Ms. Goley said. With
Burns' influence, the bank soon borrowed five paintings, three from
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and two from a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed acquired its own art slowly after Ms. Goley was hired in
1975 as its first fine arts director. Most of the collection, she
said, has come from tax-deductible donations, although the Fed does
not accept gifts from those it regulates.
</P>
<P>
   She also made numerous purchases over the years, especially from
Manhattan dealers, and these works include some of the standouts at
the Madrid show, like the Richards gouache on paper ``Entrance to
West Cove, Conanicut Island, R.I.,'' from 1882.
</P>
<P>
   It depicts a rocky green terrain with grazing sheep in the
foreground and sailboats in the distance. Ms. Goley said that she
purchased it in 1979 from the Manhattan dealer Gil Einstein for
$5,000 and that it was insured for $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   She also bought a Dodge oil on canvas, ``Midocean.'' Painted in
1896, it shows the deep-blue sea meeting a sky filled with purplish
clouds, a scene inspired by Dodge's crossings between New York and
Paris, where he studied art.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the Madrid exhibition features 19th-century American art
because it is little known in Spain, said Jose Maria Vinuela, the
Spanish bank's curator, who organized the show. ``I wanted a
representation of the 19th-century landscape, which is really the
century of creation of American painting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the other half of the show, he chose such works as the
richly drawn renderings by the architect Paul Cret for the
construction of the Fed's current headquarters in Washington in the
mid-1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``These architectural drawings are a cut above,'' Ms. Goley
said, ``and of a certain date that really fell into the category of
art, because of the shading and the projection of shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the renderings show intricate details, including the
wall decorations in the Fed's boardroom, a plaster ceiling ornament
and the elevations for doors and a fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goley said she would like the Madrid show, which is open
daily at the central bank at 50 Alcala St., to be the start of
other tours for the Fed's collection, with certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's logical to assume that someone else would ask us, and our
first question would be about the facility and can they guarantee
the safety of the art objects,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She complained that the frames of a few works suffered nicks
during transportation to Spain. The Fed's collection is still not
large enough to allow for a big loan of works without the risk of
bare walls in Washington, she added.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such problem in Greenspan's office, which sent the
Lawrie oil on canvas, ``Pleasant Valley,'' painted in 1867. The Fed
chairman replaced it with a 19th-century John Tullidge landscape,
``The Great Salt Lake.''

`SIMPLE STORIES': FACES GLIMPSED IN AN EAST GERMANY OF SHIFTING
SHADOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD EDER  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another title for ``Simple Stories,'' East German short fiction
by the lethally acute Ingo Schulze, could be ``Stories of a Face.''
Whose face? Any one of many among the millions who lived in the
compressions of the old German Democratic Republic and now struggle
with the decompression bends.
</P>
<P>
   But take one face that appeared in the news last week: the
weary, cynical and infinitely creased countenance of Egon Krenz,
the last boss left shakily standing in the final post-Wall days of
the communist regime. He was off to jail after years of prosecution
as one of those responsible, in the heyday of power and the wall,
for the killings of would-be jumpers. If a face can be a shrug it
is his.
</P>
<P>
   Read the messages signaled from Krenz's creases:
</P>
<P>
   This was the reality. Someone had to run things. It didn't
delight me. I couldn't help it. Our goals were good. It could have
been worse. Once or twice I helped it be a little less worse. I had
to think of my family. What I really like is gardening. Yes. I was
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Finally: So were all of you.
</P>
<P>
   The miles of archives compiled by the Stasi, or secret police,
and since made public, list millions of East Germans as agents,
informers, cooperators. The gradations can be as indistinct as the
words heard in an insomniac's nightmare: Which is sleep and which
waking, which is dreamt, which real? Is that a gun or a glass of
water? How much disgrace was it to be listed: a lot, a little, not
necessarily any?
</P>
<P>
   Daylight, which ends most nightmares, has prolonged and twisted
this one. The Stasi was a brand upon the national soul; disclosure,
with its shame and doubts, has been another.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the society of shadows pursued in the 29 sections of
``Simple Stories.'' They are each fragments _ a scene, a
conversation _ in the lives of a dozen characters connected with
one another directly, or at a remove or two, during the last
decade. They could be the text to Krenz's creases, and to all those
others that crisscross life among the Ossies, as citizens are
called in the eastern part of Germany's disunited unity.
</P>
<P>
   There is Ernst Meurer, whom we meet traveling with his wife,
Renate, on a cheap bus tour to Italy in 1990. The wall is down but
the Communists still hold porous power; the trip is technically
illegal and the travelers carry faked passports procured with only
a little wangling.
</P>
<P>
   It is transition time: a few years earlier the excursion would
have been impossible, and a few years later no artifice would have
been needed. Still, though, the Meurers travel in traditional
communist-bloc fashion, packing their own sausage, butter, bread
and canned fruit _ a dietary iron curtain against subverting
flavors. Peeling an orange is the first daring taste of abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Such unerring detail is just the beginning of Schulze's design.
He will introduce a startling break _ an incident or bit of speech
_ that barely hints what is afoot, but will be amplified in a later
sketch. Often this is only in part, so we are left with the ominous
uncertainties that his characters live among.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern is followed with the Meurers. In Perugia, a fellow
tour passenger named Schubert clambers to a church ledge and
launches into a hysterical denunciation of ``Red Meurer.'' All we
get at this point is Renate's reflection: ``It had all happened
long ago. And Ernst didn't like doing it at the time, I'm sure of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes two more sketches, scattered among the others, before
the full story is told. Meurer _ a mini-Krenz _ had been a school
principal and middle-ranking party loyalist. He had denounced
Schubert, one of his teachers, when a suspect remark was found in a
student's notebook. Schubert was sent to the coal mines for three
years before getting a desk job. Later came democracy and
denunciations. After the incident in Italy, Meurer is pilloried in
the press, loses his post (abandoned by party officials too scared
by now to help him) and ends up in a psychiatric institution.
</P>
<P>
   Schubert will have kinky sex with a young drifter and die of a
heart attack fishing for oddly big carp near a nuclear power plant.
Innocence as well as evil has its banality. Meurer's wife gets a
new hairdo. Irony, yet also something more. The ``so were all of
you'' of the Krenz creases has a double edge for Schulze, a former
East German. Compassion broadens judgment without sparing it. A
woman, even at 70 and despite everything, rearranges her hair.
Consider the ``do'' in hairdo.
</P>
<P>
   There is little unalloyed rage in ``Simple Stories'': the least
alloyed is directed West. A property speculator who crosses over to
the eastern town of Altenburg begins by seducing a local waitress
(Schubert's niece) and ends by raping her. The national message
here and in the Meurer stories may seem overexplicit, but Schulze
leavens it with a fertile wealth of stylistic implication.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pieces are about private lives; the public climate
drifts through the windows like smog. There is Hanni, whose shadowy
purge as director of a small museum is followed by her obsessive
sexual exploring and an unexpectedly peaceful outcome; Frank, a new
Green politician afraid to deal with Nazi punks; Barbara, his wife,
who manages _ we smell a new-style corruption _ to cover up the
hit-and-run death of a woman.
</P>
<P>
   There is Martin, Meurer's stepson, who is crowded out of his art
history post by better qualified western Germans _ the economic
destabilizing of the post-unification east is a pervading theme _
and ends up dressed as a frogman flapping through Berlin to
advertise a seafood restaurant. His story is mournful but not quite
tragic; he holds on to a raffish humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a whiff of Brecht, Schulze's disconnections, ellipses
and alienations, sometimes comic, suggest a Raymond Carver or a
Frederick Barthelme: the bad air of the contemporary world and the
odd deformations that it produces. Here the pollutant _ the mark
left by the Cold War and its aftermath upon a divided Germany _ is
more evident. The stories make up in necessity where they may fall
a little short (only a little) of the artfulness of these masters.

EATING WELL: LENTILS FOR THE UNLEISURELY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lentils have been around for thousands of years, but
in this country, lentil soup excepted, they are considered an
exotic component of ethnic cuisine, much too difficult and
time-consuming to make at home. The most popular lentils here,
which are light brown with a greenish cast, take about 40 minutes
to cook, longer than most people have for a weeknight dinner.
</P>
<P>
   And ``popular'' is probably too strong a word. Americans eat,
per capita, a little more than a sixth of a pound of lentils a
year, a fraction of what is eaten elsewhere. In Spain, for example,
the figure is four pounds a year.
</P>
<P>
   But lentils are actually an easy alternative to rice and pasta,
and should be high on everyone's must-eat list. There are, in fact,
quick-cooking lentils.
</P>
<P>
   And these legumes have many other attributes, like a slightly
earthy but mostly neutral flavor, which combines well with almost
anything. They are also an excellent source of protein and come in
a variety of colors _ yellow, red, dark green, light green, brown,
black and white _ which makes them an intriguing addition to meals.
</P>
<P>
   For people in a hurry, lentils that are sold without the skin _
red, yellow and white ones _ are of particular interest, because
they cook in a fraction of the time of other lentils. I use red
lentils in recipes, like the one below, that I make after work.
These lentils cook so quickly, about 10 minutes, that they must be
watched carefully because they turn to mush in the blink of an eye,
which is great in soup or a sauce.
</P>
<P>
   In experimenting with lentils I tried a trick I often use with
brown rice to make it cook quickly: I soaked whole lentils that
still had their skins for eight hours and then cooked them in the
soaking water. The soaked French green lentils, also called du
Puys, cooked in 10 minutes; a type of black lentil called Urad
cooked in 12 minutes and needed a little additional water, as did
large green lentils, which took 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Once cooked, lentils make a delicious salad with goat cheese and
tomatoes, or can be combined, as they are in India, with potatoes,
peas and tomato sauce. There is even a baba gannouj in which
lentils replace the usual chickpeas.
</P>
<P>
   Lentils have lots of nutritional goodies: half a cup cooked
contains 8 grams of protein, 2 milligrams of sodium, 20 grams of
carbohydrates, 115 calories and no fat. Skinless lentils have only
about 2 grams of fiber per half-cup serving; with the skin, they
have about 7 grams.
</P>
<P>
   Lentils also contain iron, potassium and a B vitamin that is not
so easy to come by, folic acid or folate. An adequate intake of
folate by women of childbearing age is important to prevent neural
tube defects in infants, and it is also important for older people
because it greatly reduces the risk of heart attacks. The
recommended daily consumption of folate is 180 micrograms for
adults (400 micrograms for women of childbearing age). Half a cup
of cooked lentils contains 180 micrograms.
</P>
<P>
   Lentils provide complete protein when any of the following foods
are eaten on the same day (not necessarily in the same meal):
grains, seeds, nuts, meat, eggs or dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   Brown lentils are sold everywhere, and specialty markets carry
some others. A wide variety is available at Kalustyan's, 123
Lexington Avenue (28th Street), (212) 685-3451, and from Legumes
Plus, (800) 845-1349, www.legumesplus.com.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Smokey Joe's Cafe,'' the musical revue of songs by
Leiber and Stoller, closed on Sunday after a nearly five-year run,
but over the final weekend at the Virginia Theater there were
rehearsals going on. Not onstage: The cast members had their parts
pretty well in hand.
</P>
<P>
   But with nine cameras in the auditorium, a 10th backstage, and
sound and camera trucks outside on West 52nd Street, a new company
called the Broadway Television Network was getting its act
together. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights they honed their
cues during performances, and during the Sunday matinee they filmed
the show, preserving its farewell.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend was a run-through for the company's main business,
an enterprise never before attempted: the regular live presentation
of Broadway productions on pay-per-view television. As early as
this fall and through the next five years, the company plans to
start bringing the first of a dozen Broadway shows to the home
screen as they are being performed in the theater. It is a
multimillion-dollar experiment in expanding the reach of live
theater to the remote and modest-income markets it has yet to
penetrate, as well as an effort to promote the Broadway brand name.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway Television Network is one of two new ventures that are
seeking to meld Broadway and television and to secure for the
theater the place it has never had in the electronic entertainment
universe. The second venture, a different approach to melding the
two media, is Broadway Digital Entertainment, and it has the
backing of Michael Fuchs, the former chairman of HBO. It does not
plan to present live Broadway on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no business in just doing Broadway pay-per-view, or I
guarantee I'd have been in the business at HBO,'' Fuchs said. But
Broadway Digital does intend to enter another dicey arena,
producing new shows for Broadway that it will sell to home viewers
as part of a subscription package.
</P>
<P>
   The companies share the belief that widening access to the
Internet and to the broad-band technology that promises more varied
and efficient options for delivery of home entertainment will make
the packaging of live and home theater economically viable.
</P>
<P>
   Their chief executives sound many of the same notes. ``If there
are 30 or 40 million people worldwide who love the theater, they
will all, eventually, be going to Web sites that deal with the
theater,'' said Basil Hero, president of Broadway Digital. ``There
are so many people out there who are not being served.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Brandwen, president of Broadway Television, added, ``Our
concept is to add the electronic component to Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadway producers and theater owners have long understood the
power of television to market their product: The reason a Tony
nomination is seen as so crucial for a musical has less to do with
the honor conferred than with the opportunity to present a number
from the show on the awards broadcast. But they also fear
television as an alien being. From the television side, the theater
is often seen as archaic, and the commingling of the two as a
mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, about entertainment nobody knows anything,'' said
Brian Grazer, the chairman of Imagine Films, which also produces
television shows like ``Felicity'' and ``Sports Night.'' ``But the
arrows of our culture, whether in music or television or movies,
are all pointing younger and more conceptual. One would have to
ask, `Is theater on television in that direction?'''
</P>
<P>
   The theater has a rich and venerable history as television
programming fodder, from a 40-minute adaptation of a spy story,
``The Queen's Messenger,'' which was broadcast from a studio in
Schenectady, N.Y., in 1928, to the production of ``Death of a
Salesman,'' which was filmed in a special performance just after
its closing in November and broadcast on Showtime this month. But
current shows have rarely appeared on the air in anything other
than excerpts, and live presentations from Broadway have long faced
skepticism, if not downright opposition, from theater owners and
theater unions.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this conflict is that Broadway's live
entertainment is attenuated on the screen. ``It's not live when you
see it on TV,'' said Emanuel Azenberg, a producer who expressed
frustration at Broadway's inability to use television to its
advantage. ``It's not dead. But it's not live.''
</P>
<P>
   The second reason is the fear that once a show appears on
television, people will be less likely to buy a ticket, potentially
shortening a performance's run and undermining the appeal of a road
production. The last time a Broadway show ran live on television
was in 1982, a pay-per-view broadcast of ``Sophisticated Ladies.''
Since then attempts by producers to arrange pay-per-view broadcasts
of two shows, ``Jelly's Last Jam'' and ``Damn Yankees,'' have been
squelched by labor and rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   To address such concerns, Brandwen and his company (its
chairwoman is Kay Koplovitz, who founded the USA Networks) will
seek to supplement the Broadway shows with something that situates
the customer midway between conventional television viewing and
being in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the widespread availability of improved technology,
its broadcasts will deliver the shows in high-definition television
format and surround sound. For, say, $34.95, it will bring viewers
extras that they do not get on Broadway, like a half-hour of
precurtain interviews and profiles, a 15-minute presentation during
intermission and perhaps most alluringly, glimpses backstage during
scenery changes. The model is sports programming, with its analysts
and ``up close and personal'' features.
</P>
<P>
   To assuage concerns that a live presentation will shorten a
show's life, no production that has run for less than six months
will be featured. ( Brandwen also considers six months enough time
to determine whether a show has the appeal to draw television
audiences.) No shows have been selected, but the obvious choices _
hit musicals like ``Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Kiss Me, Kate'' _
are being considered.
</P>
<P>
   To placate the unions, all 13 of which have signed agreements
with Broadway Television, Brandwen has agreed to pay penalties to
workers if a show closes within 72 days of a broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The price is relatively high to avoid devaluing the enterprise
and to underscore that the shows are events. (Live! From Broadway!
One night only!) As for the audience niche, pay-per-view event
programming, Ms. Koplovitz said, is almost all boxing and
wrestling. ``The product offering is almost entirely aimed at
males,'' she added. ``This is the first series of events that women
and families can be brought to.''
</P>
<P>
   The untested market is huge. In 1982, when ``Sophisticated
Ladies'' drew 95,000 customers, there were 600,000 homes wired for
pay-per-view television. Now there are 45 million homes on 2,200
pay-per-view systems. Each system keeps half the $34.95 viewer's
fee; in exchange, the show gets 300 30-second commercial spots in
the weeks preceding the broadcast, which Broadway Television has
pitched to theater owners as $27 million worth of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the enterprise will be profitable, whether it will make
celebrities of Broadway stars and whether it will help Broadway
sell tickets is the wager. But the idea has intrigued Broadway's
most traditional skeptics of television, theater owners. All of
them _ the Shubert Organization, Jujamcyn Theaters, the Nederlander
Organization and SFX _ have invested in Broadway Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it works it's worth the investment,'' said Gerald
Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, which owns 16
Broadway theaters. ``If it doesn't, it would be good to know.
You're dealing in no man's land.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Broadway Digital's strategy is less risky, at least up front. It
has put its initial resources into acquiring a
theater-on-television archive _ some 300 stage comedies and dramas
that have been broadcast (many only once) during the last 45 years
on television _ digitally restoring and encoding the tapes to
accommodate advancing technology. The idea is to use the archive as
a revenue producer, for the moment through video sales and
broadcast syndication, and later through the sale of digital
videodiscs and a broad-band delivery service.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of the plan is more speculative. The archive
revenue would finance new shows shot for television in a studio and
then produced on Broadway. The shows would have limited runs, which
would attract Hollywood stars to appear in them, in turn attracting
viewers to the television production that would be available after
the live show closed.
</P>
<P>
   Hero, the company president, said that the goal was to start a
subscription series similar to that of a regional theater or opera
company; four shows a year, available on television (or computer
screen) for a total of $125 to $150.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so difficult to open a show on Broadway,'' Hero said.
``You need great publicity or great reviews. We're reversing the
model. The television filming, with a major star, would collect the
publicity, break the buzz, and the television show would be presold
to a subscription audience. Then we open in the theater.''

`LATE SHOW' TAKES A BREAK  
 THE ULTIMATE ANSWER 
`MALCOLM' IN THE CHIPS 
BOB DOLE, COMIC
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (rk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite rampant speculation _ and apparently numerous volunteers
_ there are no plans at the moment for anyone to serve as a
substitute host for David Letterman during his convalescence from
heart bypass surgery last week.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, CBS will keep offering reruns of ``Late Show'' while
Letterman continues his recovery, which, by a number of accounts
from people close to him, is going well.
</P>
<P>
   But because he has never before missed a scheduled appearance,
his emergency leave has raised a number of questions centering
mainly on how long the show might be able to go before it became
necessary to call on one of those many volunteers. (Among those who
have publicly raised their hands as being ready to step in for
Letterman are Rosie O'Donnell and Regis Philbin.)
</P>
<P>
   CBS released a statement indicating that its main concern was
Letterman's health and saying that the only current plan was to
broadcast reruns. Some of those may be specially packaged, with
some guests doing newly recorded introductions to memorable shows.
``Late Show'' may, for example, repeat Letterman's prime-time
specials.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking seems be that should Letterman progress rapidly, as
he seems to be doing, it will not be necessary to go to any
substitute hosts. If his time away from the show extends to several
months, that position might be reconsidered. But the reconsidering
would have to be done by Letterman, who owns his show through his
company, Worldwide Pants. He will be the one to decide the issue of
substitute hosts.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, another question concerns what will happen to
the show's staff and crew. The staff _ writers, producers, guest
bookers, clerical staff, Paul Shaffer and his band _ all work for
Worldwide Pants. One staff member said Letterman had passed word to
them that nobody would miss a paycheck. This week the staff has
been shooting comedy pieces that can work around Letterman's
absence.
</P>
<P>
   The technical crew is a different matter because its members
work for CBS. Depending again on the length of Letterman's absence,
the network might try to reassign some of them to other shows
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   The Ultimate Answer
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' magic struck again Monday night for ABC as a
second contestant in the brief history of ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' hit the jackpot, winning $1 million for knowing that
the sun is 93 million miles from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In a show that was actually taped on Saturday, Dan Blonsky, a
34-year-old lawyer from Miami, sailed through the list of questions
unscathed, though he was compelled to seek help from a law partner
on the $500,000 question: Who appeared on the cover of the first
issue of People magazine? Answer: Mia Farrow.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC quiz show is shattering every recent rating standard,
and another million-dollar winner surely will not hurt. Behind the
strength of ``Millionaire,'' ABC is moving closer to first place
among the networks in the seasonlong ratings, its first such
victory in six years. But ABC's top entertainment executives, Lloyd
Braun and Stu Bloomberg, said at a news conference last week that
they were not predicting any seasonal victory yet.
</P>
<P>
   As happened the first time the show had a million-dollar winner,
the timing was all but ideal. The first time, the winner came
toward the end of the show's 18-night run in the November sweep
month. The new top-dollar success took place on the first night of
the show's new three-times-a-week format.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, where the show originated in 1998, nobody has ever
won 1 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   `Malcolm' in the Chips
</P>
<P>
   As big a hit as ``Millionaire'' is, it may have a rival for hit
show of the season. ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' a new series on Fox,
posted spectacular ratings numbers for a second week on Sunday
night. The show already has the look of the first true runaway
comedy hit of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcolm'' has already done some things Fox has rarely, if
ever, seen before, like improving on a lead-in from ``The
Simpsons'' two weeks in a row and pulling in even more people in
its second week on the air than it did for its heavily promoted
premiere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcolm'' was so big last week that only the mighty ``E.R.''
beat it in the ratings among 18-to-49-year-old viewers, the
measurement that Fox, NBC, and ABC all live and die by.
</P>
<P>
   In that category, ``Malcolm'' was the top-rated comedy last
week, beating ``Friends,'' ``Frasier'' and all the rest. It also
beat every edition of ``Millionaire'' last week among those
viewers. With those between 18 and 34, ``Malcolm'' was totally
supreme, beating every other show, including ``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   The other hit show whose ratings were much anticipated this
weekend was ``The Sopranos,'' but because of Monday's holiday, HBO
does not yet have any national rating results for the show. They
are expected to be available later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, Comic
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central, which has gained a reputation for skewering
election coverage on presidential election-year specials titled
``Indecision,'' named a new comic Tuesday to its roster for
``Indecision 2000'': Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, the former Senate majority leader and presidential
candidate, who has been droll in a number of talk show appearances
since his failed run for the presidency in 1996, will join the cast
of the comedy channel's nightly satire on the news, ``The Daily
Show,'' with Jon Stewart as host.
</P>
<P>
   Dole is expected to serve as a political commentator for the
coverage, providing analysis from the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia as well as during other events in the
political year, ending with the Election Night edition of ``The
Daily Show.''
</P>
<P>
   In a news release the channel quoted Dole as saying, ``After all
the campaigns I've been through, it'll be nice to be on the other
side for this one.''
</P>
<P>
   No one at Comedy Central could say what the channel might do if
Dole's wife, Elizabeth, winds up on the Republican ticket as the
vice presidential candidate.

 &HT;    TECH INDUSTRY HAS A LONG WISH LIST FOR CONGRESS THIS YEAR
 &HT;    With TECH-CONGRESS. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Jan. 23.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last year, Congress got beyond its partisan rancor
long enough to pass a number of laws sought by the nation's booming
high-tech companies. This year, the tech titans expect even more
out of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On trade, taxes, visas, digital signatures and many other
issues, the owners of technology-driven companies will be pushing
for far-reaching bills when the 106th Congress reconvenes Monday.
With lawmakers planning to recess in late July to attend political
party conventions and launch re-election campaigns, the pressure to
get bills passed early in the year will be intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just say, 'OK, this is a short year, so let's just
put these bills in a drawer,' `` said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.,
co-chair of the Congressional Internet Caucus. Rather than dismiss
2000 as a do-nothing election year, tech supporters will ``be
pushing every step of the way,'' he said. ``You have to build
momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1998, technology-related issues were not particularly hot
topics in Washington, both because most lawmakers were unfamiliar
with the Internet and because many tech entrepreneurs were too busy
making money to care about politics.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Web has woven itself into the workplaces and homes of
tens of millions of Americans, tech legislative issues have shot to
the top of the agenda on the Hill. And in places like Austin, Palo
Alto, Boston, Seattle, Atlanta and Northern Virginia, entrepreneurs
now realize their fortunes may be determined in large part by
Congress's action or lack of it.
</P>
<P>
   With tech companies hiring lobbyists at a frantic pace and
lawmakers eagerly listening to them, bills have been moving along
in a surprisingly bipartisan fashion. In less than two years, the
Republican-led Congress and Democratic White House have agreed to
impose a three-year moratorium on taxes on electronic commerce,
increase the number of visas issued to highly skilled immigrants,
limit lawsuits against companies involved with Y2K-related software
flaws, and extend copyright protections to material published on
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the tech agenda is even more aggressive. Of course,
electronic-commerce companies, chip makers and other sectors of the
diverse high-tech business community have different priorities, but
companies propelled by new technologies generally want lawmakers to
help them by:
</P>
<P>
   _ Expanding global trade.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, high-tech products have been the leading U.S.
exports. To increase growth, computer makers, chip manufacturers,
software developers and others want greater access to foreign
markets, especially China.
</P>
<P>
   Tech companies want Congress to grant permanent normal trade
relations status to China. That's not a simple matter in an
election year because labor unions, a core Democrat constituency,
oppose expanded trade. So do some conservatives who believe China
never lives up to its agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Tech companies also are demanding that government further loosen
controls on the export of high-performance computers. Again, this
is a touchy issue because many legislators fear that equipment
vital to our national security will end up illegally in the hands
of Chinese military officials.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increasing the pool of highly skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are desperate for more engineers and programmers. They
want Congress to increase the number of H-1B temporary work visas
used by companies and universities to hire foreign workers with
specialized skills. Industry was successful in boosting the visa
level two years ago, but opposition from labor unions will be stiff
in this election year. Anti-immigration Republicans may oppose the
visa increase as well.
</P>
<P>
   Tech employers also want the government to bolster U.S. schools
by providing development grants for teachers who want more computer
training and scholarships for students pursuing technology-related
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spurring research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Tech-driven entrepreneurs want a permanent extension of the
research and development tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encouraging the growth of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest issue is whether to allow state and local
governments to collect sales taxes from online purchases.
Currently, most shoppers pay no sales taxes on Internet purchases
because of a temporary tax moratorium imposed by Congress. But as
e-commerce grows, more mayors and governors are clamoring for the
right to collect sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   This may be too hot of a potato for Congress to hold in an
election year, so the moratorium may be extended to bump the issue
into 2001. But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a vocal opponent of
Internet taxes, could push for a permanent ban to attract attention
to his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Tech companies also want Congress to move on a number of other
issues, such as approving the use of electronic signatures to allow
more business dealings over the Internet, and settling a number of
thorny privacy issues involving transfers of financial data and
medical records.

 &HT;    HIGH-TECH ECONOMY BENEATH THE NOTICE OF MANY IN CONGRESS
 &HT;    With TECH-AGENDA and TECH-LIST. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Jan. 23.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The stock market may be racing along on ``Internet
time,'' but many members of Congress still seem to set their pace
by an old-fashioned pocket watch attached to a long chain of
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   While new technologies are transforming the U.S. economy, many
lawmakers continue to focus on decades-old issues such as
protecting agricultural subsidies, imposing steel quotas and
preserving banking regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 535 members of Congress, only a few dozen have carved out
a reputation for understanding legislation important to
technology-driven companies. And those few who have become
technology-savvy are not widely dispersed geographically.
</P>
<P>
   Most lawmakers recognized by industry as tech leaders come from
just two states: California, home of Silicon Valley, and Virginia,
birthplace of America Online and many other Internet-driven
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But tech leadership may begin growing as Congress reconvenes
this year. Now courted by hordes of high-paid tech lobbyists and
eager to win the support of entrepreneurs making money and creating
jobs, more members of Congress are educating themselves on
tech-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in Congress, regardless of party, are starting to
recognize how important technology is to the country,'' said Marc
Brailov, a spokesman for the American Electronics Association, a
trade group. ``They know it has been driving the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   And even more legislators will be paying attention once the
results of the 2000 census are revealed, predicted Rep. James
Moran, D-Va., who has witnessed the phenomenal growth in tech jobs
in Northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians ``are going to see that not a lot of people are
doing manual labor any more,'' Moran said. ``The census will help
us identify the sources of employment, and people (in Congress) are
going to realize they have more tech workers than they ever
imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Until very recently, technology-driven changes in the economy
have not been widely recognized by lawmakers, who often appear more
comfortable with 20th-century industries _ or even 19th-century
ones _ than with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For example, about 104 members of Congress continue to keep
alive the Steel Caucus, which tries to block foreign competition.
That's about the size of the informal Congressional Internet
Caucus, which tries to help legislators learn more about the online
world.
</P>
<P>
   But the steel industry has nearly evaporated from the U.S.
economy. The combined market value of the nation's top steel
companies _ USX Steel Group Inc., Bethlehem Steel Corp. and LTV
Corp. _ amounts to about $4 billion, while Yahoo!, just one
Internet-focused company, has a market value exceeding $90 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for devotion to venerable causes such as steel or
peanut subsidies is that lawmakers ``still envision their districts
as industrial or agricultural centers,'' Moran said. Even states
that have gained the most from the technology boom, such as Texas,
Massachusetts and Washington, do not have congressional delegations
that are recognized as tech leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The most frequently cited reasons for the lack of enthusiasm
among lawmakers for tech issues are age and professional
background. Legislators tend to be older and have educations in
law, not engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started the Internet Caucus about four years ago,
(lawmakers) didn't have e-mail addresses or Web sites,'' said Rep.
Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. That has changed, with virtually all
legislators having some online presence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goodlatte, widely recognized as one of the most knowledgeable
lawmakers on technology issues, said Congress is now moving beyond
the basics of sending e-mail and getting down to the difficult work
of shaping laws for the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that Congress will do so not by creating any new
structures, such as a Senate Technology Committee on a par with the
Senate Banking Committee, because the influence of new technologies
is too diffuse and widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every committee is going to have to deal with these issues''
of how powerful technologies are transforming commerce, medicine,
communications and more, Goodlatte said. ``I don't think you could
devise a single committee that could handle all of it.''

 &HT;    83-year-old gardener Margaret Moseley's recipe for beating the
winter blahs
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Jan 20.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Margaret Moseley lies awake at night, pondering
whether to transplant a sasanqua closer to her gingko so that in
fall the shrub's yellow-centered flowers will accent the tree's
yellow leaves.
</P>
<P>
   By 5 a.m., this 83-year-old dynamo hits the floor running to get
her housework out the way so that by daybreak she can be where she
really wants to be _ in her South DeKalb County, Ga., garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to get up every morning!'' says the
great-grandmother of nine. ``At my age, I have friends who don't
know they're in the world. Or are in nursing homes. Or have died.
But I feel great. When I think of all my friends who have no
interests in life, I just don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   What's clear is that gardening keeps her young.
</P>
<P>
   And, at a time of year when many folks battle the blahs, this
gardener couldn't be more hyped if it were spring. That's because
she's filled her three-quarter acre garden with plants sure to
bring a smile in the dead of winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the only person I know who will call me at 8 a.m. on a
bleak, cold and miserable day in January and say, `You ought to see
my garden this morning. It's the most beautiful I've ever seen
it,''' says Martha Tate, a longtime friend and garden writer.
``Here I am looking outside at gray, maybe a few evergreens, and
her garden is full of color.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Margaret planned it that way; the seasonal color,
she admits, is by accident. She simply plants what she likes. And
for more than 30 years, her shopping list has included trees,
shrubs and perennials that put on a show in late fall, winter and
early spring _ especially camellias, sasanquas and viburnums.
</P>
<P>
   A self-taught gardener, Margaret has built a reputation for
having the vision to introduce Atlantans to both old-fashioned and
new plants. Knowing nothing about design, she's managed to mix
those plants in pleasing color combinations, a feat even some
artists find a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone who claims she didn't know what she was doing,
she's done a masterful job,'' says Sandra Jonas, an Atlanta
landscape designer. ``It makes me think, why did I spend five years
in school for this?''
</P>
<P>
   Jonas is among the army of friends Margaret has made through
gardening _ ones with whom she readily shares her arsenal of
treasured plants upon visits to her garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have twin daughters who are both interested in gardening,''
Margaret says with pride. ``When I find plants I like or that I
think they or my friends might not come across, I buy two _ one for
me and one for them. I love that, because then they get so excited
just like I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I enjoy about gardening.''
</P>
<P>
   A middle-age discovery: Margaret's backyard garden was nothing
more than the ubiquitous pines, azaleas and honeysuckle when she
and her husband, Lamar, built their home 35 years ago. At the time,
she was too busy making clothes for their four daughters to fret
over yardwork.
</P>
<P>
   But once the last of the girls had left for college, Margaret,
then 52, was hungry for a hobby, so she took up gardening. She
joined a garden club and took a class in flower arranging. ``That
was for the birds,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret just wanted to dig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started with 25 feet of old-fashioned zinnias and marigolds,
and it just grew and grew from there,'' she recalls, waving her
perfectly manicured hands above her red head.
</P>
<P>
   The site, once a cotton field, proved ideal, with rich soil,
proper drainage and exposure to both full sun and partial shade.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret began by removing many of the pines and encircling the
rest with stones she hauled in from vacant lots to create island
beds. ``There was no plan to it,'' she recalls. ``Every plant here
has been moved at least five times _ too much sun, too much shade.
But, you know, I don't know of many plants I've lost.''
</P>
<P>
   She discovered most of her plants by getting to know employees
at nurseries, such as Hall's Flower Shop. ``She came in every
Friday, and we would fight over who got to wait on her because we
all just learned so much by walking around with her, with that
eagle eye of hers for plants,'' says Atlanta garden designer Tara
Dillard, who once worked at Hall's. ``Margaret started gardening
before most of her plants could be bought in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   By asking a nursery to order a plant she'd read about, Margaret
introduced many varieties to Atlantans. ``I'd get so excited about
a plant, I'd just have to have it,'' she says. ``Then I'd have to
go to bed to think about where to plant it!''
</P>
<P>
   Her addiction to gardening became rivaled only by her passion
for shopping. To support her habits, she sold impatiens and poppy
seeds for 15 years through the Farmers &AMP; Consumers Market Bulletin,
which became an outlet for meeting more gardeners.
</P>
<P>
   Through Dillard, Margaret met Penny McHenry, a.k.a. Atlanta's
Hydrangea Lady and founder of the American Hydrangea Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman is much older than I,'' joked McHenry, who turns 75
in March, ``but what an incredible mind she has and such vision.
She's certainly become an expert on viburnum and camellias.''
</P>
<P>
   Wintertime extravaganza: What Margaret loves about those plants
is they provide color in winter when most of the garden is dormant.
</P>
<P>
   In October, her garden becomes a dazzling stage, with Camellia
sasanquas such as `Cotton Candy', `Pink Snow' and `Sparkling
Burgundy'. Even after blooming, the shrubs _ some reaching 25 feet
_ continue to provide color by shedding carpets of pink or white
petals at their feet. ``People who don't plant sasanquas don't know
what they're missing,'' Margaret says.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the sasanquas share the spotlight with their
cousins, the camellias, though some varieties, such as her red
Camellia japonica `Daikagura', bloom as early as October.
</P>
<P>
   In December, a late-blooming sasanqua, `Yuletide' _ the one with
red flowers and yellow centers she planted near her ginkgo tree _
makes a special appearance, and in January, Margaret's favorite
camellia, `Fragrant Pink', bursts onto stage with the fresh scent
of springtime.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the patches of pink, lavender and purple pansies she
planted in fall for instant color are complemented by the pink
blossoms of daphne and hellebores, followed by those show-stopping
harbingers of spring, the daffodils.
</P>
<P>
   In March and April, Margaret's garden gleams in white with
Chinese Snowball viburnum and 20 other varieties, white flowering
quince and the `Kwanzan' Japanese cherry tree's canopy of popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her passion for color, Margaret is painfully reminded
each time she adds a new plant that she risks overdoing it. Her
best gardening advice, she says, came from her favorite author and
biggest inspiration, garden writer Elizabeth Lawrence: ``Once I had
a lovely garden, and I ruined it with plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Her second best advice comes from experience: ``If you don't
like to weed, don't garden,'' says Margaret, who for the past six
years has employed a helper to mow the grass and move large plants
when she gets the notion.
</P>
<P>
   And the notion strikes often. Tate recalls that on one visit to
the garden a 10-foot-tall viburnum she once photographed was
missing. Surely Margaret didn't lose one of her oldest shrubs, she
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I just moved it,'' she told Tate. ``I didn't like it
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman's prerogative?
</P>
<P>
   That and just trial and error, Margaret's secret to a
half-century of success.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT OTHER GARDENERS SAY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Margaret once had this pink camellia I was crazy about, and
she wanted to give me one for my birthday but couldn't find one in
bloom. So she bought me one anyhow and picked and Scotch-taped
blooms from her camellia onto mine!'' _ Penny McHenry, Atlanta
gardener and founder of the American Hydrangea Society
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Margaret has too much to do in her garden to grow old. She's
constantly refining it and passes along garden knowledge with a
story attached. When the conversation strays from gardening, she
will pull you by the arm and say, `Come on, I want to show you
something.''' _ Tara Dillard, Atlanta garden designer
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``If she reads about a new plant, she's making calls to
nurseries before she's through with the sentence. But she's also
got her grandmother's pink rose and other plants that have stood
the test of time, things that are native to the South and to this
region.'' _ Martha Tate, Atlanta gardener and producer of HGTV's
``A Gardener's Diary''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``She's just the kindest, most generous person; Penny McHenry
calls her `The Original Pass-
</P>
<P>
   along Lady.' I don't think I've ever been to her garden when
I've left empty-handed. I'm now building my own garden with her
plants.'' _ Sandra Jonas, Atlanta landscape designer

   HOW TO GROW THE 'ROSE OF WINTER'
</P>
<P>
   One of Margaret Moseley's favorite plants is a shrub that gives
her garden the most color in winter _ the camellia.
</P>
<P>
   The Camellia japonica, which blooms from October to March, also
provides glossy evergreen foliage at a time when most of the
landscape is brown. Although they are coastal flowers that thrive
in termperatures from 40 to 60 degrees, camellias do well in
Atlanta area gardens, given the right conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the American Camellia Society, headquartered at
Massee Lane Gardens south of Fort Valley, Ga., recommends:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to plant: Partial shade and well-drained soil
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When to plant: Late fall through early spring
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How to plant: Dig a hole 1 to 2 feet wider than the root ball.
Place the ball so that its top is slighlty higher than soil level.
Fill the hole with a mixture of top soil, coarse sand and organic
matter (peat moss, leaf mold, sawdust or cow manure mixed with
soil). Build a berm of soil around the plant 3 feet in diameter to
prevent runoff when watering. Mulch with pine straw or other
organic matter and water well after planting, then about once a
week during dry spells.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How to feed: With good soil, one application of 10-10-10
fertilizer in spring should be adequate.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Which to plant: A few include Camellia japonica 'Professor
Charles S. Sargent,' an old-fashioned red; C. japonica 'Debutante,
pink; C. japonica 'Pink Perfection'; and C. japonica 'White
Empress.'
</P>

</P>
<P>
   MARGARET'S PICKS FOR FALL, WINTER
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hellebores. A perennial with dark green foliage that bears
large clusters of pale green, pink and burgundy flowers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Arum. A foliage plant, Arum italicum 'Pictum' dies back in
summer but in late fall begins yielding lush green arrow-shaped
leaves with creamy white veins that last until spring.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sasanquas. An evergreen shrub, Camellia sasanqua offers pink,
white or red flowers from late September through December.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Confederate rose. An old Southern favorite that's actually a
hibiscus, Hibiscus mutabilis is a large shrubby perennial that in
early fall produces creamy white flowers that turn pink and finally
deep red.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Flowering apricot. One of the few winter-blooming trees is
Prunus mume, the Japanese flowering apricot, which has pink or
white flowers in January and February.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Daphne. Daphne odora, a low-growing evergreen shrub with
coarse green leaves outlined in cream, offers fragrant clusters of
white or pink flowers, typically beginning in mid-February.

   Shopping for new shoes? These are some of the latest trends,
designed to freshen up your fringed jeans, floral sun dresses and
basic black ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sequins: These little sparklers are showing up in solid colors
and floral designs in dainty evening shoes with sling backs and
small heels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Animal prints: Leopard is still looking hot, but newer prints
are pony, cow and zebra, seen on a variety of fabrics from faux fur
to velveteen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Florals: Think of Carmen Miranda and the tropics, and look for
large blooms in hot-house colors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Far East themes: Mystical dragons, Asian-inspired cat prints,
Indian sari fabrics and wooden beads with Chinese writing are what
you'll find on casual footwear.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sculpted heels: Shoes with a profile are back, often carved
out of wood with a see-through center like free-form sculptures or
resembling wooden clogs. Other heel novelties include balls, cubes
and cylinders, as well as stilettos and their shorter variation
called a ``Sabrina'' heel after the shoes worn by Audrey Hepburn in
the film ``Sabrina.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Decorative shoe beds: In a season of barely there shoes
(thongs, slides and mules) the area that your foot rests on is
covered in bright contrasting colors, as well as painted with
flowers or dragons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Loud colors: Hot pink, orange, turquoise and red are now
standard equipment in the shoe biz. Some are solid tones, but the
newest designs feature contrasting colors in whip-stitching on shoe
beds or heels.

 &HT;    TECH INDUSTRY HAS A LONG WISH LIST FOR CONGRESS THIS YEAR
 &HT;    With TECH-CONGRESS. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Jan. 23.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last year, Congress got beyond its partisan rancor
long enough to pass a number of laws sought by the nation's booming
high-tech companies. This year, the tech titans expect even more
out of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On trade, taxes, visas, digital signatures and many other
issues, the owners of technology-driven companies will be pushing
for far-reaching bills when the 106th Congress reconvenes Monday.
With lawmakers planning to recess in late July to attend political
party conventions and launch re-election campaigns, the pressure to
get bills passed early in the year will be intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just say, 'OK, this is a short year, so let's just
put these bills in a drawer,' `` said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.,
co-chair of the Congressional Internet Caucus. Rather than dismiss
2000 as a do-nothing election year, tech supporters will ``be
pushing every step of the way,'' he said. ``You have to build
momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1998, technology-related issues were not particularly hot
topics in Washington, both because most lawmakers were unfamiliar
with the Internet and because many tech entrepreneurs were too busy
making money to care about politics.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Web has woven itself into the workplaces and homes of
tens of millions of Americans, tech legislative issues have shot to
the top of the agenda on the Hill. And in places like Austin, Palo
Alto, Boston, Seattle, Atlanta and Northern Virginia, entrepreneurs
now realize their fortunes may be determined in large part by
Congress's action or lack of it.
</P>
<P>
   With tech companies hiring lobbyists at a frantic pace and
lawmakers eagerly listening to them, bills have been moving along
in a surprisingly bipartisan fashion. In less than two years, the
Republican-led Congress and Democratic White House have agreed to
impose a three-year moratorium on taxes on electronic commerce,
increase the number of visas issued to highly skilled immigrants,
limit lawsuits against companies involved with Y2K-related software
flaws, and extend copyright protections to material published on
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the tech agenda is even more aggressive. Of course,
electronic-commerce companies, chip makers and other sectors of the
diverse high-tech business community have different priorities, but
companies propelled by new technologies generally want lawmakers to
help them by:
</P>
<P>
   _ Expanding global trade.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, high-tech products have been the leading U.S.
exports. To increase growth, computer makers, chip manufacturers,
software developers and others want greater access to foreign
markets, especially China.
</P>
<P>
   Tech companies want Congress to grant permanent normal trade
relations status to China. That's not a simple matter in an
election year because labor unions, a core Democrat constituency,
oppose expanded trade. So do some conservatives who believe China
never lives up to its agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Tech companies also are demanding that government further loosen
controls on the export of high-performance computers. Again, this
is a touchy issue because many legislators fear that equipment
vital to our national security will end up illegally in the hands
of Chinese military officials.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increasing the pool of highly skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are desperate for more engineers and programmers. They
want Congress to increase the number of H-1B temporary work visas
used by companies and universities to hire foreign workers with
specialized skills. Industry was successful in boosting the visa
level two years ago, but opposition from labor unions will be stiff
in this election year. Anti-immigration Republicans may oppose the
visa increase as well.
</P>
<P>
   Tech employers also want the government to bolster U.S. schools
by providing development grants for teachers who want more computer
training and scholarships for students pursuing technology-related
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spurring research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Tech-driven entrepreneurs want a permanent extension of the
research and development tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encouraging the growth of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest issue is whether to allow state and local
governments to collect sales taxes from online purchases.
Currently, most shoppers pay no sales taxes on Internet purchases
because of a temporary tax moratorium imposed by Congress. But as
e-commerce grows, more mayors and governors are clamoring for the
right to collect sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   This may be too hot of a potato for Congress to hold in an
election year, so the moratorium may be extended to bump the issue
into 2001. But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a vocal opponent of
Internet taxes, could push for a permanent ban to attract attention
to his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Tech companies also want Congress to move on a number of other
issues, such as approving the use of electronic signatures to allow
more business dealings over the Internet, and settling a number of
thorny privacy issues involving transfers of financial data and
medical records.

 &HT;    HIGH-TECH ECONOMY BENEATH THE NOTICE OF MANY IN CONGRESS
 &HT;    With TECH-AGENDA and TECH-LIST. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Jan. 23.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The stock market may be racing along on ``Internet
time,'' but many members of Congress still seem to set their pace
by an old-fashioned pocket watch attached to a long chain of
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   While new technologies are transforming the U.S. economy, many
lawmakers continue to focus on decades-old issues such as
protecting agricultural subsidies, imposing steel quotas and
preserving banking regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 535 members of Congress, only a few dozen have carved out
a reputation for understanding legislation important to
technology-driven companies. And those few who have become
technology-savvy are not widely dispersed geographically.
</P>
<P>
   Most lawmakers recognized by industry as tech leaders come from
just two states: California, home of Silicon Valley, and Virginia,
birthplace of America Online and many other Internet-driven
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But tech leadership may begin growing as Congress reconvenes
this year. Now courted by hordes of high-paid tech lobbyists and
eager to win the support of entrepreneurs making money and creating
jobs, more members of Congress are educating themselves on
tech-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in Congress, regardless of party, are starting to
recognize how important technology is to the country,'' said Marc
Brailov, a spokesman for the American Electronics Association, a
trade group. ``They know it has been driving the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   And even more legislators will be paying attention once the
results of the 2000 census are revealed, predicted Rep. James
Moran, D-Va., who has witnessed the phenomenal growth in tech jobs
in Northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians ``are going to see that not a lot of people are
doing manual labor any more,'' Moran said. ``The census will help
us identify the sources of employment, ale (in Congress) are
going to realize they have more tech workers than they ever
imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Until very recently, technology-driven changes in the economy
have not been widely recognized by lawmakers, who often appear more
comfortable with 20th-century industries _ or even 19th-century
ones _ than with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For example, about 104 members of Congress continue to keep
alive the Steel Caucus, which tries to block foreign competition.
That's about the size of the informal Congressional Internet
Caucus, which tries to help legislators learn more about the online
world.
</P>
<P>
   But the steel industry has nearly evaporated from the U.S.
economy. The combined market value of the nation's top steel
companies _ USX Steel Group Inc., Bethlehem Steel Corp. and LTV
Corp. _ amounts to about $4 billion, while Yahoo!, just one
Internet-focused company, has a market value exceeding $90 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for devotion to venerable causes such as steel or
peanut subsidies is that lawmakers ``still envision their districts
as industrial or agricultural centers,'' Moran said. Even states
that have gained the most from the technology boom, such as Texas,
Massachusetts and Washington, do not have congressional delegations
that are recognized as tech leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The most frequently cited reasons for the lack of enthusiasm
among lawmakers for tech issues are age and professional
background. Legislators tend to be older and have educations in
law, not engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started the Internet Caucus about four years ago,
(lawmakers) didn't have e-mail addresses or Web sites,'' said Rep.
Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. That has changed, with virtually all
legislators having some online presence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goodlatte, widely recognized as one of the most knowledgeable
lawmakers on technology issues, said Congress is now moving beyond
the basics of sending e-mail and getting down to the difficult work
of shaping laws for the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that Congress will do so not by creating any new
structures, such as a Senate Technology Committee on a par with the
Senate Banking Committee, because the influence of new technologies
is too diffuse and widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every committee is going to have to deal with these issues''
of how powerful technologies are transforming commerce, medicine,
communications and more, Goodlatte said. ``I don't think you could
devise a single committee that could handle all of it.''

 &HT;    More `Millionaire' makes ABC merry
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ ABC executives like to joke that they're
thinking of changing the name of their network to MBC, the
``Millionaire'' Broadcasting Co., and why shouldn't they?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' continues to rack up ratings
at a truly amazing clip; last week's run averaged more than 27
million viewers a night and placed several shows in the Nielsen Top
10 for the week (see ratings below). It's singlehandedly made ABC
competitive again, even though most of its new fall shows were
Nielsen flops. Now the game show phenomenon has moved to three
nights a week _ Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays _ and executive
producer Michael Davies is looking for ways to make sure the public
doesn't tire of it.
</P>
<P>
   First up are special themed shows. The Jan. 29 show will focus
on the Super Bowl and feature pro football questions. The second
themed show will air in March before the Academy Awards and deal
with movie questions.
</P>
<P>
   Davies says he's also toying with special ``Millionaires'' in
which celebrities would play for charity, and a
tournament-of-champions competition that would bring back winners.
</P>
<P>
   But Davies knows that one of the show's attractions is the
possibility of contestants losing most of their money, and that's a
problem for the charity shows he's mulling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just worry that if you do a celebrity `Millionaire,'''' he
says, ``it's very difficult to tell someone who is playing for
charity, `Well, I'm sorry, you just lost $468,000. And now you're
just going home with $32,000.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So we have to figure a way to make the show work for that
format. But we've got an idea up our sleeve,'' which, of course, he
wouldn't divulge at this early stage.
</P>
<P>
   Davies also has another idea that he's already sold to ABC _ an
American version of another British game show _ ``Mastermind.''
It's been a hit in England for years, and is noted for its
extremely hard questions, much like the U.S. game shows of the late
'50s. He says he's developing it slowly, and hopes to have it on
sometime this year.

WHAT'S AFOOT FOR SUMMER 2000

(Eds: With FASHION-SHOES-SIDE)

<P>
   Pink pony-print boots with square toes and heels.
</P>
<P>
   Dainty slides decorated with silk flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Platforms wrapped in denim and lined in red gingham.
</P>
<P>
   Could these cobblers' cream puffs really knock black stilettos
off their heels?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, without so much as a scuffed toe.
</P>
<P>
   At the Los Angeles Shoe Market, held this week at the downtown
CaliforniaMart, 125 shoe manufacturers displayed their wares for
spring and summer, and nobody asked, ``Does it come in black?''
</P>
<P>
   At the sight of so many pink, orange, turquoise and red shoes,
hundreds of black-clad fashionistas (otherwise known as buyers and
trend analysts) left their urban edge at the door. They clutched
wooden slides handpainted with pink and yellow canaries, stroked
the mother-of-pearl inlay on highly varnished red wooden sandals
and even slipped their feet into sequined mules. They showed no
shame, no remorse as they marched past prim-and-proper pumps to
ogle the latest trends.
</P>
<P>
   And those trends, says Jeff Yeh, a designer for N.Y.L.A. shoes,
which are sold at Nordstrom and shoe boutiques, include mirrors,
Asian prints, painted wood and sequins. ``Anything with a novel
approach, like our Furby or Chia Pet-inspired shoes with pink fake
fur,'' he says, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   The shoes that are getting the most interest _ and orders _ he
says, are the Ducky wedge, named for the little birds painted on
them, and also his evening shoes with floral designs stitched in
sequins. These are fantasy shoes, for sure, but their suggested
retail price of $70 makes them wearable.
</P>
<P>
   Last year fashion critics claimed the platform style was dead,
that flat was phat and stilettos still sexy. But don't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still jumping on them (platforms) because they're
comfortable and because they like being five inches taller,'' says
Yeh.
</P>
<P>
   Animal prints on platforms, boots and sandals are the buzz at
the Sacha London booth. According to Sacha representative Vince
Sorge, we're reliving the days of disco when gaudy was good. And
the hot tickets? A pair of hot pink-and-black pony-print ankle
boots trimmed in pink lizard-print leather, sporting squared toes
and heels. ``Pointed toes are sexier, but the boxy toe is a lot
more comfortable,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Another detail that's new, says Sorge, is the barber pole or
cylinder-shaped heel, done in stripes of color such as orange, pink
and red.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Ackerman, a designer for the Yellow Box Shoe Co. based in
Westlake Village, said it's the Asian influence that's hot for
spring. He's ready with plenty of thongs accented with beads,
flowers and dragons. Like other designers, he's carving his shoes
out of wood and varnishing them like fine furniture. But it's his
Jasmine design, inlaid with mother-of-pearl in floral designs,
that's attracting the crowds and getting the orders. As retail
buyers for trendy shops such as Madison's in Beverly Hills place
their orders, Ackerman explains that the shoes are highly lacquered
and then topped with resin like a surfboard, so there's no chance
that a bare foot will wear the design off.
</P>
<P>
   More woodworks are spotted at numerous manufacturers' booths,
some sculpted from a block of wood to create a stunning profile,
others modeled after classic Birkenstocks, all topped with strips
of decorative fabric across the toes.
</P>
<P>
   More fabric, less leather, seems to be where shoe fashion is
headed _ and leading the way are floral prints, followed by denim.
</P>
<P>
   At Bebe, salesman Brad Bailey says his tropical floral shoes are
retro-inspired, just the thing for a '50s bathing beauty. And over
at the Hype counter are brightly colored slides with big silk
flowers on the toes that look like they'd be perfect with those
floral circle skirts worn by Gwyneth Paltrow in ``The Talented Mr.
Ripley.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking equally fresh is red gingham paired with denim and white
leather at NaNa Shoes. Designed for rockabilly music fans, the
shoes are platforms, sometimes accented with embroidered flames on
the back (think '50s dragster), or beaded with conversational
comments such as ``yes'' on one foot and ``no'' on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Those, said the salesman, come in black. &QL;

THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE SLEUTH IN THE MEANTIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KARL E. MEYER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Of the singular mysteries addressed by Sherlock
Holmes, perhaps none is more intriguing than ``The Case of the
Undying Detective.'' His creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, vowed to
kill him in the 1890s and turned to the archcriminal Professor
Moriarty to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't! You can't! You musn't!'' the author's mother
protested. Holmes survived, only to face rival creations by others
who shamelessly copied his methods, and a legion of parodists who
trifled with his name. Nevertheless Holmes is entering a third
century, standing taller than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred Americans and a sprinkling of foreign guests
gathered in Manhattan over the weekend to salute the master
detective on his 146th birthday. For more than half a century this
has been an annual rite, organized by the Baker Street Irregulars,
the organization of Holmes devotees. The observances have by
degrees grown more elaborate: a full-dress banquet (no longer stag,
but still strictly by invitation), an endowed lecture, a theatrical
performance, cocktail parties, special breakfasts and a book bazaar
with 20-odd booths at the Algonquin Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia for childhood or for a past perceived as more
agreeable help propel these festivities. But something else is
involved, the allure of stories whose characters somehow become
part of the reader's extended family.
</P>
<P>
   Irregulars claim that Holmes and his friend and narrator, Dr.
John H. Watson, were actual people, that Conan Doyle was simply
Watson's literary agent. Some claim that Holmes, in defiance of
mortality tables, is still alive, his eyesight dimmer but his wit
as nimbly astringent as ever. Having long since retired from active
practice at 221B Baker St. in London (though letters to him still
arrive at that address), he now lives in Sussex, England, where he
keeps bees and is completing his life's work, ``The Whole Art of
Detection.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless this is a game, but to devotees _ outwardly Middle
American, male and female, mostly white and nearly all bookish _ it
is a high and serious sport. They engage in recondite arguments
about inconsistencies in the Canon, also known as the Sacred
Writings, the four novels and 56 short stories mundanely ascribed
to Conan Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Whelan, president of the Irregulars, says there are now
some 300 local Holmesian societies in the United States, so many
that he has lost count and sends a boilerplate letter, merely
wishing good luck to new groups seeking recognition. Writing about
the writings inspired by the Canon has itself become a cottage
industry. Jon L. Lellenberg, a Pentagon official, is completing a
history of the Irregulars, packed with insider correspondence, that
has implausibly grown into five thick paperback volumes bound in
scarlet. So far, the opus extends only to the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   The organization evolved from an impromptu dinner summoned in
1934 by the literary essayists Christopher Morley and Vincent
Starrett followed by the adoption of an eccentric constitution,
proposed by the journalist Elmer Davis, with its celebrated final
clauses _ ``4. All other business shall be left to the monthly
meeting; 5. There shall be no monthly meeting'' _ lines declaimed
at every Irregulars dinner.
</P>
<P>
   What lent life to the sport was the happy discovery that Conan
Doyle, who died in 1930, was so absent-minded that contradictions
permeate his tales. Was Watson wounded in his arm or leg while
serving in Afghanistan? And who, pray, was the second Mrs. Watson,
the unnamed successor to his deceased first wife? Similar riddles
inspired hundreds of essays ranging from the solemn to the
outrageous. Rex Stout famously claimed that Watson was a woman, and
others held that Holmes invented Professor Moriarty to explain away
his own failures.
</P>
<P>
   The flood has since widened and deepened. In 1972, Ronald Burt
de Waal listed 6,221 items in his World Bibliography of Sherlock
Holmes and Dr. Watson. This total has at least doubled. New
book-length pastiches appear monthly, and every imaginable
variation has been explored. Holmes has by now encountered Freud
and Marx, has solved the Jack the Ripper killings and has hurtled
into outer space, the last being the theme of an anthology edited
by Isaac Asimov, an Irregular.
</P>
<P>
   Movies and television have kept apace. Holmes is the most
portrayed character in movie history; he has been played by 75
actors in 211 films. He has danced in a Sadler's Wells ballet, sung
in a Broadway musical (``Baker Street,'' with Fritz Weaver) and is
the main character in more than 50 plays, most recently David
Stuart Davies' ``Sherlock Holmes _ The Last Act!,'' a one-man show
given its American debut for the Irregulars on Saturday. It
features an aging and gloomy Holmes, portrayed by the British actor
Roger Llewellyn.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to be a new path was opened last fall by a West
Hartford clergyman, Stephen Kendrick, who contends in ``Holy Clues:
The Gospel According to Sherlock Holmes'' (Pantheon) that Holmes,
the icy rationalist, is also a spiritual master with Zen-like
insights, doubtless the result of his secret sojourn in Lhasa,
itself the subject of at least three books, including the most
recent, by a Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Holmes and Watson attained immortality almost against the wishes
of their creator. As a young doctor with a slow practice, Conan
Doyle wrote in his spare time, introducing the pair in ``A Study in
Scarlet'' (1887) and ``The Sign of the Four'' (1890). He then
reached a mass audience with short stories serialized in the newly
established Strand magazine and gathered in ``The Adventures'' and
``Memoirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as early as 1891, Conan Doyle confided to his mother, ``I
think of slaying Holmes in the last'' story ``and winding him up
for good and all,'' because ``he takes my mind from better
things,'' provoking her incredulous protest.
</P>
<P>
   Conan Doyle persevered in his homicide, inventing the Napoleon
of crime, Moriarty, who in ``The Final Problem'' plunges with
Holmes into the seething waters of Reichenbach Falls in
Switzerland. But the outcry was so universal and so sustained that
the author relented and raised his creation from the dead in ``The
Return of Sherlock Holmes.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's readers tend to forget the originality of Conan Doyle's
achievement. He introduced the sidekick formula into crime fiction.
Hence Hercule Poirot and Hastings, Chief Inspector Morse and
Sergeant Lewis, among the many in a vast legion, and, at a
different level, William of Baskerville and the monk Adso in
Umberto Eco's ``Name of the Rose,'' clearly a homage to Sherlock
Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, despite these innumerable clones, the Canon is imbued
with inimitable magic. The critic Edmund Wilson, who loathed
detective stories, allowed a glowing exception for Sherlock Holmes.
He confessed to reading himself to sleep with tales he had not read
since childhood. And in an essay titled ``Mr. Holmes, They Were the
Footprints of a Gigantic Hound!,'' he judged the stories genuine
literature, ``on a humble but not ignoble level.''
</P>
<P>
   That gigantic hound haunting the moors around Baskerville Hall
has probably bitten deeper into the imagination of more young
readers than any other creature in fiction. This year's Irregular
lecturer, Michael Dirda, a critic for The Washington Post, recalled
``the sheer animal joy'' of reading, with blanket, flashlight and
candy bars, ``The Hound of the Baskervilles'' while a youngster in
an Ohio mill town.
</P>
<P>
   There is a further subtext. The Canon takes American readers
back to 1895, when, as Dirda noted, ``all was right with the world,
and the British Empire in particular.'' For some Americans, jostled
by change, it is a comfort to look back upon Victorian Britain,
seemingly stable and solid, mistress of the greatest overseas
empire in history, a financial superpower, aloof from messy foreign
quarrels, protected by a moat and a mighty navy.
</P>
<P>
   To the British, and indeed to their rivals, this order seemed
permanent and final. Yet it was an illusion. The historian Arnold
Toynbee recalled that as a child he was a marveling spectator at
Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee in 1897, when Britain appeared
``to be standing still in the midst of Heaven, as it had once stood
there at the bidding of Joshua.'' Young Toynbee could scarcely have
foreseen that the entire imperial edifice would crumble in his
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of the master detective: ``We reach, we grasp and
what is left in our hands in the end? A shadow.''

 &HT;    Analyst predicts Coke in for big changes
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A well-respected Wall Street analyst predicted
Coca-Cola will be undergoing ``the greatest sea change in its
business in 20 years,'' including cutting as many as 2,000 jobs
from its global workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Bernstein analyst Bill Pecoriello estimated that about
600 jobs would be eliminated in Atlanta alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my own analysis, not the company's,'' Pecoriello said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Robert Baskin said ``management is taking a
look at every aspect of operations. We have no further comment on
rumor and speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   And Coke director Jimmy Williams said the board discussed ``all
aspects of the company's business'' at its meeting Tuesday in
Atlanta. He said a clearer picture of the financial strategy will
emerge when earnings are released Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Pecoriello said he intentionally did not wait for the company to
announce its new strategy before issuing his report.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is risk in waiting,'' he said, because the new
management team is not pursuing the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Pecoriello upgraded the stock Tuesday to ``outperform'' from
``neutral.'' He predicted the stock will rise to $71 during the
next 12 months, with an upside chance of reaching $77.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't sit on the sidelines and wait for Doug Daft and Jack
Stahl to communicate this message to investors because it will be
too late,'' Pecoriello wrote, referring to the two executives who
will run the company. ``We believe Coca-Cola's new strategy will
become apparent to the market over the coming hours/days/weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   He said reducing the number of jobs globally to about 27,000
from 29,000 is more than just a move to cut labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes it's about trimming the fat from an organization that
hasn't gone on a diet in quite some time, but it's also about
changing the way Coke does business around the world and allocates
its resources,'' Pecoriello wrote.
</P>
<P>
   By closing and moving office locations, as well as undergoing a
``significant house cleaning'' among mid-level managers, the
company would have a clean start regarding its new strategic
directives, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Pecoriello said those new strategies include:
</P>
<P>
   _ More realistic growth goals. ``We believe Coke will shift from
chasing volume and (market) share at any cost to realistic volume
goals the system can support,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the company has told Wall Street it can produce an
average annual increase in case sales of 7 percent to 8 percent. It
also has said that would generate earnings per share growth of 15
percent to 20 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has not been able to hit those targets recently,
and several Wall Street analysts have questioned whether those are
realistic goals over the long-term.
</P>
<P>
   Pecoriello believes the goals will be revised downward to 6
percent average annual volume growth and 13 percent annual
earnings-per-share growth over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   More realistic goals would help both Coca-Cola and its global
network of bottlers financially because less money would be
invested in new plant and equipment going forward, which would
improve the return on capital, he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Better resource allocation. He believes the company will more
wisely spend its marketing dollars where it will be getting the
most bang for its bucks. ``On the margin, the incremental capital
and marketing dollars spent in certain markets in recent years ...
reduced shareholder value,'' Pecoriello wrote.
</P>
<P>
   _ More local decision-making. He said the new management team
will move more decisions from Atlanta to local operations around
the world, where executives have more firsthand knowledge of
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Taking write-downs on troubled overseas assets, such as the
company's Russian bottling operations. ``By cleaning house on the
balance sheet ... Coke positions itself to deliver more consistent
profit growth,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Pecoriello said the main risk to the company comes in
implementing the new strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the biggest risk is execution, with new management in
every senior position that has inherited operating plans from their
predecessors,'' he wrote. ``Turning a ship the size of Coke isn't
an easy task.''
</P>
<P>

Atlanta, Ga.

 &HT;     BRADLEY CONCEDES HE'S A LONGSHOT TO DEFEAT GORE IN IOWA   (For
use by New York Times News Service clients.)    By DAN
FREEDMAN  c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  INDIANOLA, Iowa _ Bill Bradley,
<TEXT>
seeking to lower expectations on his chances for victory in Iowa,
conceded Tuesday that he was unlikely to beat Vice President Al
Gore in the all-important Iowa caucuses next week.
<P>
   Bradley said he would be content to exceed 31 percent of the
vote in Monday's Democratic caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult state when you're up against an entrenched
power,'' said Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey. ``We are
reaching out to as many people as possible. We don't have the
apparatus, the apparatus is with the vice president. But we do have
a lot of enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., won 31 percent of the party vote
in Iowa in his short-lived effort to challenge President Jimmy
Carter in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do better than expected in Iowa. I look at the
historical performance of insurgents in Iowa, which is Ted Kennedy
in 1980,'' Bradley told reporters in Iowa City.
</P>
<P>
   With the strong backing of organized labor, Gore consistently
has led Bradley in most polls in Iowa, a pivotal state because a
victory there can boost the national standing of the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris LeHane dismissed Bradley's concession as an
effort to soften an inevitable defeat. Several weeks ago ``they
thought they could win Iowa,'' he said, adding that Kennedy's
performance in 1980 ``was not thought of as a particularly strong
showing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore kicked off a day of campaigning in southern Iowa with a
rally in Indianola, a town of 11,300 southeast of Des Moines. As
part of his strategy to abandon at least some of the trappings of
high office, Gore doffed his suit coat as he took the microphone in
the Simpson College gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must recognize our obligation to extend the power of the
American dream to all Americans, because that's what we're all
about in this country,'' Gore told the crowd evenly divided between
college students in sweatshirts and baseball caps, and senior
citizens, including a contingent of war veterans.Elementary-age
children ringed the running-track balcony of the gymnasium holding
Gore campaign signs.The vice president entered to the music of Tina
Turner wailing ``simply the best, better than all the rest,'' and
Paul Simon's ``Call me Al.''``The presidency is a day-by-day fight
for real people with real problems,'' Gore said. ``Elect me
president of the United States and I'll fight my heart out for
you.''Gore broke no new ground in the speech. Indeed, LeHane said
it followed a standard script of speeches he would give in nearby
Knoxville, Ottumwa and Burlington, which is on the Mississippi
River in southeast Iowa. In Knoxville, the American Federation of
Government Employees endorsed the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has worked hard to turn back the popular image of him as a
stiff, wooden speaker immersed in the technicalities of government.
He grew up primarily in Washington, D.C., as a senator's son and
served in Congress 16 years before becoming vice president in
1993.But as part of his image-softening offensive, he was part
inspirational speaker and part talk-show host as he called out for
veterans of World War II, Korea and Vietnam to raise their hands in
sequence.After mentioning that he and his wife Tipper became
grandparents last year, he asked grandparents to raise their
hands.Then he asked for the hands of those with 10 grandchildren,
with 11 grandchildren, with 12 children and so on. He got to 21
before one particular grandmother put her hand down. ``Twenty
grandchildren!'' Gore said as the crowd clapped.
``Congratulations!''Gore got in only one mild jibe against Bradley
when he said the 40 million Americans who receive Medicaid should
not lose it to a ``highly inadequate substitute.'' That was a
reference to Bradley's health plan, which would replace Medicaid
with a income-based subsidy aimed at bringing the poor into the
mainstream of health care.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates sparred over the same issue Monday night
during their final face-to-face debate before the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   In that debate, Bradley defended his plan, saying that ``only
politicians in Washington think Medicaid is a great system.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gore talked about his family's roots in Tennessee,
his own bitterness over politics in the wake of his Vietnam War
service and the Watergate scandal in the early 1970s. And he talked
about his reawakening to politics as a young reporter covering
local and state government in Tennessee.The vice president also
found time for the local issues. ``Keeping our prosperity going and
using it as a foundation for these sweeping changes means also
making changes to bring everybody into the prosperity,'' Gore said.
``And the number one group left out is farmers. We need to have
profitability restored on the farm.''

<P>
   Many of the college students appeared to be Gore supporters. But
Jay Shearer, a 21-year-old junior from Farragut, described himself
as a Republican leaning toward Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He attended the rally because ``I want to have an open
opinion.'' Would he ever consider supporting Gore? ``Yeah, there's
a good chance if he's that impressive.''Bart Elliott, a 20-year-old
junior from Melcher-Dallas, said he was leaning toward Gore because
of what the vice president had to say about rebuilding schools,
connecting them to the Internet, and providing smaller classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said a lot of good things,'' said Elliott, who is thinking
about a teaching career and whose parents are teachers. ``I guess
it depends on whether he can come through with it.''With the polls
showing Gore comfortably ahead of Bradley, ``It's basically
non-stop for here on out,'' LeHane said. ``You enter the last six
days with the basic goal of mobilizing your forces, energizing
them. We're going to fight for every single vote we can.''As the
crowd cheered for Gore's entrance, LeHane pointed and said: ``Look!
Energy!''

AT VATICAN'S INTERFAITH CEREMONY, RIFTS REMAIN OBVIOUS
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Indulgences, the Roman Catholic practice of remitting
punishment for sins in exchange for prayer, repentance and, in the
Middle Ages, even money, helped set off the Protestant Reformation.
</P>
<P>
   Five hundred years later, indulgences remain a sticking point
between Catholics and Protestants. On Tuesday, a few of the world's
largest Protestant denominations boycotted a religious ceremony
that the Vatican described as the ``most significant ecumenical
event'' of this Holy Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it was. Metropolitan Athanasios, a representative
of the orthodox patriarch of Constantinople, and George Carey,
archbishop of Canterbury, helped Pope John Paul II push open the
Holy Door of St. Paul Outside the Walls Basilica.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth and final such ceremony celebrating the start
of a Jubilee, or Roman Catholic Holy Year. On Christmas Eve, the
pope opened doors at St. Peter's Basilica, and subsequently opened
doors at two other major basilicas in Rome where Catholic pilgrims
can earn indulgences during the Holy Year. Tuesday's ceremony was
the only one that actively involved non-Catholic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from 22 Christian churches, including the
Lutheran World Federation, attended the service, one of the largest
interfaith gatherings since the Second Vatican Council. But some
Protestant leaders, among them Baptists, Presbyterians and
Calvinists, chose to skip an event they viewed as an affront.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reformation was provoked by an indulgence campaign, so
associating a jubilee indulgence with Holy Year celebrations seemed
like a retrograde step by the Vatican,'' explained the Rev. Paraic
Reamonn, spokesman for the World Alliance of Reform Churches, based
in Geneva, which represents 75 million Protestants, mostly
Presbyterian and Calvinist.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony signaled both the progress of interfaith dialogue
over the last 30 years and some of the stumbling blocks. But it
also illustrated the contradictions that have run through John Paul
II's papacy. No pope has worked harder to mend the rifts between
Christian churches. The presence of so many Orthodox religious
leaders, as well as the head of the Lutheran church worldwide,
testified to his diplomacy. At the same time, however, John Paul II
has rigidly upheld church dogma and Catholic traditions, including
indulgences, that antagonize other faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Anglican Church, which is closer to Rome than most
Protestant denominations, conceded that deep divisions simmer
beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was important to work toward a closer
relationship between our two churches,'' said the Rev. Paul Avis,
general secretary of the Church of England's Council on Christian
Charity, explaining the archbishop of Canterbury's participation,
``without concealing that serious difficulties remain to be
overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The Anglican decision to ordain women is one source of friction
with Rome, but there are others, including the authority of the
pope.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the Vatican and Lutheran World Federation signed a
landmark joint declaration, saying they were in agreement on most
major points of doctrine, though not all. But many Lutheran
churches refused to go along. The more outspoken critics, including
the second largest American branch, the Lutheran Church-Missouri
Synod, said they were not invited to the event Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has stressed that he wants ecumenicism to be a keynote
of the Jubilee, and that was the main reason he twinned Tuesday's
ecumenical service with the opening of a Holy Door. Since the first
Jubilee in 1300, popes have granted plenary indulgences to pilgrims
who visit holy sites in Rome. The sale of indulgences, which helped
drive Martin Luther to break with Rome in 1517, was stopped soon
after, but their religious value was reaffirmed at the Council of
Trent. Especially after the Second Vatican Council reforms,
progressive Catholics sought to play down indulgences, viewing them
as hindrances to ecumenical dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   For the year 2000, however, John Paul II has highlighted the
importance of indulgences, broadening the ways they can be earned,
including attendance at Tuesday's ceremony at St. Paul Outside the
Walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, that was a bit much,'' said the Rev. Domenico
Tomasetto, a Baptist pastor who is president of the Federation of
Evangelical Churches in Italy and declined to attend. ``The
Protestant church was born to protest indulgences.''
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old pope was clearly elated by Tuesday's ceremony,
walking at an unusually brisk pace down the aisle of St. Paul's,
and delivering his homily on the need to repent for divisions
within Christianity in a clear, firm voice. He improvised a new
ending to his prepared remarks, saying, ``Unity, unity, maybe even
we, leaving this basilica, can say unity.''
</P>
<P>
   But some still detected roots of division. ``The Vatican seems
to be facing in two directions: there are genuine ecumenical
feelers, and there are unilateral steps that go backward,'' Reamonn
said. ``Sometimes it seems that for at least some in the Vatican,
Christian unity can be achieved by everybody else becoming Roman
Catholic.''

 &HT;    Delta profits dip as fuel prices take off
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Profits at Delta Air Lines fell nearly 10 percent
during its second fiscal quarter, as higher fuel prices pushed
industry earnings into a descent.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines reported a 50 percent drop in quarterly
profits and announced plans for a $20 per round-trip ``fuel
surcharge'' to offset higher fuel costs, driven by the upturn in
oil prices since the middle of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The two big carriers posted earnings Tuesday, as did Southwest
Airlines, which also saw profits decline.
</P>
<P>
   Airline profits are expected to fall in 2000 after several
high-flying years. Fuel costs are a big factor, and industry
capacity growth is forcing more low-ball pricing to fill seats,
also hurting profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Continental surcharge _ essentially a fare hike listed as a
separate fee _ takes effect Feb. 1. But Continental could be forced
to scrub the surcharge if other major airlines don't match it by
then. None did so on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Continental said fuel costs rose 49 percent in the quarter that
ended Dec. 31, and warned it might lose money in the current
quarter without relief. Fuel is the second-highest expense after
labor at most carriers.
</P>
<P>
   At Delta the damage was less severe, with fuel costs rising 9.4
percent. Delta bought most of its fuel under purchasing contracts
negotiated while prices were low. It paid an average of 53.6 cents
a gallon, vs. 67 cents for Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Chief Executive Leo Mullin said he was pleased with the
quarterly report and remains optimistic about the carrier's 2000
outlook. But he acknowledged Delta could face worse fuel inflation
as some of the hedging contracts expire later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If fuel prices do stay high...it would become a cost
challenge,'' Mullin said in an appearance on CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Delta posted a profit of $172 million, excluding
special items, or $1.24 a share in the quarter ended Dec. 31, down
from $194 million, or $1.29 a share, a year earlier. The results
easily beat the Wall Street estimate of $1.15 a share. Revenue rose
7.7 percent to $3.71 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Delta shares jumped $2.56 1/4 to $52.56 1/4 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's quarterly numbers showed a slight drop in passenger
yield, reflecting a weaker fare mix. Labor costs rose almost 10
percent, contributing to a 2 percent uptick in unit costs. On the
other hand, Delta enjoyed a 16 percent drop in commission costs as
it continues to cut travel agent payments. Like all airlines, Delta
endured a Y2K-induced slump in holiday travel that carried into
early January.
</P>
<P>
   Delta recorded one-time gains totaling $649 million, mostly from
the sale of shares in Priceline.com. It took a charge of $320
million for the planned early retirement of MD-90 and MD-11 jets,
although those planes will remain in its fleet for several years.
Including those items, Delta's quarterly profit was $352 million.
</P>
<P>
   Separately on Tuesday, Continental said it is in talks to buy
back the stake held by Northwest Airlines since a 1998 deal that
formed a marketing alliance between the two.
</P>
<P>
   Continental said it wants to continue the alliance but without
Northwest's ownership position. Northwest's 14 percent stake
carries 51 percent voting rights, although the deal was structured
to prevent Northwest from exerting management control.
</P>
<P>
   Continental chose the deal with Northwest over a buyout bid from
Delta. Continental's repurchase of the stake could raise questions
of whether it would become an acquisition target once again. But
analysts consider that unlikely for now, citing Continental's
stronger financial position and likely government opposition to
major airline mergers.
</P>
<P>
   A Delta spokesman declined comment.

BRITAIN MOVES TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM PARENTAL HITTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British government said Tuesday it wanted to make
it illegal for parents to hit their children on the head, &UR;  &LR; but will
uphold the right of parents to smack kids elsewhere using only
their bare hands.
</P>
<P>
   The government said its proposals, called ``Protecting Children,
Supporting Parents,'' were a compromise made necessary after the
European Court of Human Rights ruled the Victorian-era law
governing child discipline in England was outdated and inhumane.
</P>
<P>
   While the government said it would consult child welfare
advocates before submitting the proposals to Parliament, officials
said the 1860 law governing the discipline of children would be
amended to enshrine the right of parents to hit their children, but
would ban the use of any implements and make it illegal to strike a
child anywhere on the face or head.
</P>
<P>
   Child welfare advocates criticized the proposals, saying they
did not go far enough to protect children, while others dismissed
the plans as the latest example of a meddlesome ``nanny state''
that tries to police every facet of life.
</P>
<P>
   The government's proposals, and the reaction to them, underscore
how sensitive the punishment of children is in Europe in general
and Britain in particular. The hitting of children by adults as a
form of discipline or punishment is outlawed in eight European
countries, Austria, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Latvia,
Norway and Sweden, and bans are under consideration elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But British Health Minister John Hutton, who unveiled the
government's plans Tuesday, rejected the idea of a ban, saying that
extensive polling shows there is little public support for a ban
that would be unpopular and unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must recognize both the rights of parents to exercise their
parental responsibility and to bring up children safely, and as
they think best, without undue interference from the state, while
the rights of children remain protected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals, almost certain to become law because the ruling
Labor Party has an overwhelming majority in Parliament, will outlaw
caning, a practice in which children are beaten with sticks.
Outlawed in public schools a decade ago, caning has a long
tradition here and remained legal in private British schools up
until two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was a caning administered by a man to his 9-year-old stepson
that forced the government to step into an area it would rather
avoid. The man, who used a three-foot pole to beat the boy, was
acquitted by an English jury after he cited the ``reasonable
chastisement'' law of 1860 that gives parents the right to punish
their children physically.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the boy took their case to the European Court of
Human Rights in Strasbourg, which ruled that the English law did
not protect the rights of children and had to be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming that at least one child dies every week in Britain
after being beaten by an adult, child welfare advocates here have
called for a ban on all forms of physical punishment of children.
In Sweden, child advocates argue, only four children have died at
the hands of abusive adults since corporal punishment was outlawed
there some 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Tissier, a spokesman for the National Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children, said his group wants the
government to bring English law in to line with progressive
European thinking. He said the proposals leave children vulnerable
and adults unclear on what they can and cannot do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a recipe for confusion,'' said Tissier. ``We are hugely
disappointed at the government's refusal to scrap this Victorian
defense. At the beginning of the 21st century, children should have
the same legal protection against assault as adults.''
</P>
<P>
   But Liam Fox, a physician who is the health spokesman for the
opposition Conservative Party, said the proposals were unnecessary
and evidence of the government's ``obsessive nannying.'' Fox said
``smacking'' was often ``a necessary if painful'' task for parents.

   The proposals unveiled Tuesday apply only to England. A
spokesman for Hutton said local assemblies for Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland are obliged to make similar proposals as a result
of the Strasbourg court ruling handed down 16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's recommendation by the government to change the law
governing child discipline is just the latest in a series of
societal changes being wrought in Britain and other European
countries because of the Strasbourg court's interpretation of the
European Convention of Human Rights. Earlier this month, the
British government dropped its ban against gay people serving in
the military after the Strasbourg court ruled the ban violated the
convention's provisions on privacy.

American-Statesman). 40.
</P>
<P>
   ISSUEADS _ Amidst the commercials from the major presidential
candidates, independent lobbying groups are also filling the
airwaves in New Hampshire with unregulated political
advertisements. The Sierra Club is running a ``voter education'' ad
attacking the environmental record of Gov. George W. Bush, and a
conservative tax group is attacking Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) on
campaign finance reform. So far, however, independent groups appear
to be playing only a minor role in the New Hampshire primary.
(Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush may have coined a new term to
describe his brand of ideology _ compassionate conservatism _ but
John McCain is exploiting a new brand of conservatism as well:
Anti-establishment populism unfettered by the rigid social
conservatism that usually accompanies it. It seems to have found an
audience. (Sherman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.
</P>
<P>
   FORBES _ With poor poll numbers in New Hampshire, Steve Forbes

   STORM-SCHOOLS _ GREENVILLE, N.C. _ School officials are already
dealing with a shortage of make-up days as a result of last year's
flooding. Today's storm and school closings will add to this
probelm. (Batchelor, Daily Reflector).
</P>
<P>
   DAVIDIANS _ WACO, Texas _ Tuesday is the day the evidence is due
in the Davidian case. Checking on how much information government
turns over to plaintiffs. Will weave into story motion by
plaintiffs' attorney Mike Caddell questioning whether the Justice
Department is turning over original evidence or copies. Also,
Caddell filed a motion asking the court to make government agencies
state for the record whether any of their employees fired shots at
Mount Carmel. Only the FBI has said its agents didn't fire a shot
on April 19, 1993. (England, Waco Tribune-Herald)
</P>
<P>
   TRUCKSTOP-FIRE _WACO, TEXAS _ Look at cause and investigation
into fire at Elm Mott truck stop on I-35 north of Waco early
Tuesday morning. Two bodies have been located, presumably employees
who slept at the truck stop. Fire started about 2 a.m. A trucker
smelled smoke in a restroom. A waitress was sent to warn the two
employees. But the lounge area was hot and full of smoke. There was
no answer when the employees' names were called out.(England/GaaR,
Waco Tribune-Herald).

<P>
   WAR-CRIMINALS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Five years ago Nazi
hunter Eli Rosenbaum sat in the Fort Myers, Fla., airport amid a
clutch of spring-break tourists. Sitting beside him was a
grey-haired grandfather returning to Canada. Once a prominent
homebuilder, the grandfather had fled his adopted country and
retired to Marco Island after Canadian officials discovered he once
belonged to a Nazi death squad under the notorious Einsatzgruppen.
Now Rosenbaum, having obtained deportation orders, was escorting
Helmut Oberlander out of the country. Like other snowbirds, Nazis
have flocked to this sunny land of leisure over the years. So, too,
have modern-day oppressors: Salvadoran generals accused of
orchestrating the murder of three nuns and a social worker, members
of Haiti's bloody paramilitary unit- FRAPH, which killed up to
6,000 in the early 1990s, and one of Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet's elite secret police, a squad responsible for at least 72
deaths. Many have been allowed into the U.S. because weak
immigration laws require that war crimes rise to the level of
genocide _ not mere atrocities like the torture of a few innocent
people. But that could soon change. (Staletovich, Palm Beach Post)

   LUNAR-ECLIPSE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Schoolkids across the
country have the perfect excuse to stay up past midnight Thursday.
Their science teachers will tell them to. The entire western
hemisphere will see a total lunar eclipse, when the Earth passes
between the sun and the moon, blocking the sun's rays from reaching
the moon. (O'Meilia, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT CLAIMS NO ANTITRUST FAULT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. told a federal judge Tuesday that
the federal government has failed to prove a breach of the
antitrust laws, even though the judge has branded Microsoft a
predatory monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   In a 70-page filing rebutting the government's claims,
Microsoft's lawyers said the Justice Department and 19 states had
``failed to establish the requisite causal connection between the
allegedly anti-competitive acts and the maintenance of the alleged
monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 5, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued a
far-reaching set of ``findings of fact'' _ the first part of what
is to be a two-part ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In that finding, Jackson declared Microsoft held a monopoly in
personal-computer operating systems and that it had leveraged its
power illegally to harm consumers, thwart competition and halt
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft respectfully disagrees with many of the court's
findings of fact and believes they are unsupported by the record,''
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The main purpose of Microsoft's filing Tuesday was to respond to
proposed ``conclusions of law'' _ the second part of Jackson's
ruling _ that the government submitted last month, arguing that
Microsoft had violated antitrust laws in at least four ways. The
government will respond to Microsoft's own submission this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having an extremely popular product does not make a company a
monopolist,'' Microsoft said of its Windows operating system, which
powers 95 percent of the world's personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's bottom line: even if the facts as presented by the
court are accepted for the sake of argument, the ``plaintiffs still
have not satisfied their burden under the governing law on any of
their claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief also cites Jackson's view that Microsoft's integration
of Web browsing software into its Windows operating system
benefited millions of consumers. That was one of the few nuggets in
his long ruling that gave the company any relief.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Microsoft attorneys went to Chicago to meet with a
court-appointed federal mediator in a bid to settle the antitrust
lawsuit before Jackson issues his final ruling and, presumably,
begins to review proposed remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Those talks remain embittered even though the government has
denied several press accounts that will it seek to break up
Microsoft, either into separate operating divisions or into
similar-sized competitive chunks.
</P>
<P>
   While top Justice Department officials know these accounts of
its position on proposed remedies to be incomplete and
ill-informed, they say that they cannot discuss their true position
without violating a mutual secrecy pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the current posture of the case it would be
inappropriate for us to debate the merits of any particular
remedy,'' said Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Ballmer, speaking at a press conference last week called
to announce his succession as Microsoft's new chief executive
officer, said it ``would be absolutely reckless and irresponsible
for anyone to try and break up this company.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a teleconference with Wall Street analysts, Ballmer
said he believed the talk of a breakup was purposely leaked by
Justice Department officials in hopes of pressuring Microsoft to
settle quickly. ``I believe the leaks are deliberate. I don't think
there's any doubt about that,'' Ballmer said.
</P>
<P>
   If no settlement is reached, Jackson is set to hear oral
arguments Feb. 22.

   LAPD-CRASH (Los Angeles) -- The Los Angeles Police Department's
anti-gang unit CRASH would be renamed and its officers rotated
through with more frequency to save them from the lure of
criminality, under a recommendation stemming from the Rampart
Division corruption scandal. ``We don't want officers to stay too
long to become overly familiar with a particular criminal
element,'' said Los Angeles police Cmdr. Dave Kalish. The
recommendation comes from the Los Angeles police Board of Inquiry,
which proposes merging and renaming CRASH and the career criminal,
special problems and the narcotics enforcement units as the Special
Enforcement Unit. By Lisa Van Proyen. (Will move on the ``n''

   GUNSHOW-TAXES (Los Angeles) -- L.A. County will give the L.A.
Fairplex up to $2.7 million in the next 6 years to cover revenue
shortfalls resulting from the supervisors' recent decision to ban
gun shows, a bill that has taxpayer groups and others firing mad.
``What is suggests to me is that the ordinance was pursued for
blatantly political reasons without regard for the financial
consequences to the county,'' said Jon Coupal, president of the
Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association. ``This is what we get when the
county engages in social engineering. By Troy Anderson. (Will move

   CORTINES-LAUSD (Los Angeles) -- Keeping his promise of

street to make room for the new Mazda line. Owner Bert Boeckmann is

 &HT;     BRADLEY CONCEDES HE'S A LONGSHOT TO DEFEAT GORE IN IOWA   (Eds:
Refiling to clean up coding, spacing problems)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN   c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  INDIANOLA, Iowa _
<TEXT>
Bill Bradley, seeking to lower expectations on his chances for
victory in Iowa, conceded Tuesday that he was unlikely to beat Vice
President Al Gore in the all-important Iowa caucuses next week.
<P>
   Bradley said he would be content to exceed 31 percent of the
vote in Monday's Democratic caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult state when you're up against an entrenched
power,'' said Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey. ``We are
reaching out to as many people as possible. We don't have the
apparatus, the apparatus is with the vice president. But we do have
a lot of enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., won 31 percent of the party vote
in Iowa in his short-lived effort to challenge President Jimmy
Carter in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do better than expected in Iowa. I look at the
historical performance of insurgents in Iowa, which is Ted Kennedy
in 1980,'' Bradley told reporters in Iowa City.
</P>
<P>
   With the strong backing of organized labor, Gore consistently
has led Bradley in most polls in Iowa, a pivotal state because a
victory there can boost the national standing of the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris LeHane dismissed Bradley's concession as an
effort to soften an inevitable defeat. Several weeks ago ``they
thought they could win Iowa,'' he said, adding that Kennedy's
performance in 1980 ``was not thought of as a particularly strong
showing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore kicked off a day of campaigning in southern Iowa with a
rally in Indianola, a town of 11,300 southeast of Des Moines. As
part of his strategy to abandon at least some of the trappings of
high office, Gore doffed his suit coat as he took the microphone in
the Simpson College gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must recognize our obligation to extend the power of the
American dream to all Americans, because that's what we're all
about in this country,'' Gore told the crowd evenly divided between
college students in sweatshirts and baseball caps, and senior
citizens, including a contingent of war veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Elementary-age children ringed the running-track balcony of the
gymnasium holding Gore campaign signs.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president entered to the music of Tina Turner wailing
``simply the best, better than all the rest,'' and Paul Simon's
``Call me Al.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidency is a day-by-day fight for real people with real
problems,'' Gore said. ``Elect me president of the United States
and I'll fight my heart out for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore broke no new ground in the speech. Indeed, LeHane said it
followed a standard script of speeches he would give in nearby
Knoxville, Ottumwa and Burlington, which is on the Mississippi
River in southeast Iowa. In Knoxville, the American Federation of
Government Employees endorsed the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has worked hard to turn back the popular image of him as a
stiff, wooden speaker immersed in the technicalities of government.
He grew up primarily in Washington, D.C., as a senator's son and
served in Congress 16 years before becoming vice president in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But as part of his image-softening offensive, he was part
inspirational speaker and part talk-show host as he called out for
veterans of World War II, Korea and Vietnam to raise their hands in
sequence.
</P>
<P>
   After mentioning that he and his wife Tipper became grandparents
last year, he asked grandparents to raise their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Then he asked for the hands of those with 10 grandchildren, with
11 grandchildren, with 12 children and so on. He got to 21 before
one particular grandmother put her hand down. ``Twenty
grandchildren!'' Gore said as the crowd clapped.
``Congratulations!''
</P>
<P>
   Gore got in only one mild jibe against Bradley when he said the
40 million Americans who receive Medicaid should not lose it to a
``highly inadequate substitute.'' That was a reference to Bradley's
health plan, which would replace Medicaid with a income-based
subsidy aimed at bringing the poor into the mainstream of health
care.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates sparred over the same issue Monday night
during their final face-to-face debate before the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   In that debate, Bradley defended his plan, saying that ``only
politicians in Washington think Medicaid is a great system.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gore talked about his family's roots in Tennessee,
his own bitterness over politics in the wake of his Vietnam War
service and the Watergate scandal in the early 1970s. And he talked
about his reawakening to politics as a young reporter covering
local and state government in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also found time for the local issues.
``Keeping our prosperity going and using it as a foundation for
these sweeping changes means also making changes to bring everybody
into the prosperity,'' Gore said. ``And the number one group left
out is farmers. We need to have profitability restored on the
farm.''
</P>
<P>

   Many of the college students appeared to be Gore supporters. But
Jay Shearer, a 21-year-old junior from Farragut, described himself
as a Republican leaning toward Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He attended the rally because ``I want to have an open
opinion.'' Would he ever consider supporting Gore? ``Yeah, there's
a good chance if he's that impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bart Elliott, a 20-year-old junior from Melcher-Dallas, said he
was leaning toward Gore because of what the vice president had to
say about rebuilding schools, connecting them to the Internet, and
providing smaller classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said a lot of good things,'' said Elliott, who is thinking
about a teaching career and whose parents are teachers. ``I guess
it depends on whether he can come through with it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the polls showing Gore comfortably ahead of Bradley, ``It's
basically non-stop for here on out,'' LeHane said. ``You enter the
last six days with the basic goal of mobilizing your forces,
energizing them. We're going to fight for every single vote we
can.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd cheered for Gore's entrance, LeHane pointed and
said: ``Look! Energy!''

 &HT;    Loving Lucy's Clothes
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ History has cast Lucille Ball as a zany,
redheaded clown.
</P>
<P>
   But it sometimes forgets that she also wore clothes quite well,
whether playing leggy chorus girls in '30s films, a well-dressed
housewife on '50s TV or Auntie Mame in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Universal Studios Florida remembers and has asked a local woman
to restore several outfits worn by Ball over the course of her
lengthy film and TV career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always loved Lucy,'' said Nancy Flower, who stitches and
cleans the pieces in the dining room of her West Palm Beach home.
``I open my door now and say, `Lucy, I'm home!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Lucy-wear:
</P>
<P>
   _ A veiled, sheared-beaver riding hat that Lucy wore in Mame.
Flower repaired one section of the cracked brim and gave the whole
hat a good cleaning and brushing. She's also restoring the hat's
matching riding habit.
</P>
<P>
   _ A fringey, flapper-style bodysuit covered with black sequins,
rhinestones and thousands of bugle beads, many of which had to be
restrung by Flower. A new lining also had to be sewn into the
bodysuit; the original was deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
   _ A two-piece suit with a green sequined jacket and variegated
silk skirt worn in ``To Have and Have Not'' and an aqua dress from
``Yours, Mine and Ours.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A gray felt hat and a straw boater belonging to Desi Arnaz,
worn in his personal life and on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Universal acquired the costumes from Lucy Arnaz, Lucy and Desi's
daughter, and has them on display at the theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the items were in fairly good shape, although some were
faded from exposure to light, and some of the hats were slightly
crushed.
</P>
<P>
   A former antiques dealer with a background in art, Flower has
restored textiles for the Flagler Museum and the Norton Museum of
Art, and has also restored a life vest from the Titanic.

SAVIMBI APPROVED DOWNING U.N. PLANES, FORMER ANGOLAN REBELS SAY
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council on Tuesday saw videotaped
testimony from former rebels in Angola who said their leader
approved the shooting down of two U.N. planes a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had instructions to bring down any type of aircraft that
came within range of our anti-aircraft weapons,'' a former rebel
from the UNITA rebel army said in the videotape. Referring to the
rebel leader, Jonas Savimbi, the former rebel said, ``Savimbi said
that U.N. aircraft were in the service of the Angolan government.''
</P>
<P>
   The tapes were made by Robert Fowler, Canada's U.N.
representative. Fowler, who also heads the council's sanctions
committee on Angola, has just returned from a week in Angola, where
he made the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been conclusive evidence on what happened to the
two aircraft, which were apparently brought down by missiles on
Dec. 26, 1998, and Jan. 2, 1999. Twenty-two people are presumed to
have died, but their bodies have not been found.
</P>
<P>
   The former rebels later defected and joined the Angolan army.
</P>
<P>
   The information emerged as Fowler talked with former rebels
about UNITA's ability to arm itself despite international sanctions
against the movement. He was gathering evidence to be used by a
commission he formed last year to study how sanctions are being
evaded and by whom. In a report expected to be published in March,
the commission intends to name people, countries and companies,
Fowler told the council Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   All information being collected will be cross-checked against
other sources, he later told reporters, who asked about the
reliability of defectors now wearing Angolan army uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The commission includes experts in arms, petroleum and diamonds.
Savimbi uses diamonds to pay for his weapons purchases, the
defectors said, contending that he saves some of the best stones
for himself. ``He doesn't use banks,'' a former rebel said.
</P>
<P>
   To stop the fighting, now in its third decade, U.N. sanctions
have been imposed on the rebels. They are supposed to stop the
rebels from buying arms and petroleum, and to prevent their leaders
from traveling abroad and having diplomatic contacts.
</P>
<P>
   In forming the commission, Canada, which holds a rotating
Security Council seat, has tried to broaden the action of the
sanctions committee. Diplomats see this as an experiment in getting
the committee work out of meeting rooms and into the field.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rebel forces have suffered serious defeats
recently, including the loss of airstrips in the southern highlands
vital to their foreign supply lines, UNITA continues to resist the
Angolan government and look for new ways to circumvent sanctions,
Fowler told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   His aim is to publicize the commission's findings in order to
expose sanctions-breakers and make it more difficult for UNITA to
resupply.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the outside world ceases and desists from providing
military assistance to Savimbi, he will not be able to maintain
this war,'' Fowler said. ``Responsibility for this war has been
squarely and unequivocally laid at the feet of Jonas Savimbi.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge volume of information out there indicating _
crystal clear _ that UNITA's arsenal is essentially east
European,'' he said. The same is true of the government army, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Security Council gallery Tuesday were a group of Angolans
who wanted to deliver another message to the members discussing the
Angolan war. Daniel Ntoni-Nzinga, a Baptist minister who works with
the American Friends Service Committee in southern Africa, said in
an interview after the meeting that the world was still too much
focused on the two protagonists of the Angolan civil war.
</P>
<P>
   He leads a growing citizens' movement _ including labor
organizations, women's groups and religious leaders _ trying to
persuade ordinary Angolans to take an active part in building a
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``War is not Angola's crisis, Angola's tragedy, but the symptom
of those,'' Ntoni-Nzinga said. The country needs a new identity and
an economy that works for all, not only for the warring factions,
he said.

   SELCUK, Turkey _ The sporting season is under way in western
Turkey, and Hamza Akmese, oblivious to the camel saliva dripping
onto his shoulders, furtively surveyed the competition and decided
he had nothing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   ``My camel is strong,'' said Akmese, 61, who has been in the
game for most of his life. ``He has a good body, good technique,
and he knows how to use his front legs for tripping. He's going to
do fine today.''
</P>
<P>
   As Akmese spoke, a parade of brightly adorned camels, with bells
on their humps, mirrored blankets covering their backs and colorful
pompoms woven into their tails, passed slowly by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camel fighting is to us what bullfighting is to Spaniards,''
said Akmese as he led his hulking beast toward the ring. ``It's our
tradition. It's very big, very important.''
</P>
<P>
   As Turkey hurtles toward modernity and seeks to embrace a
European identity, camel fighting is a reminder that many Turks are
still acutely conscious of their Asian heritage. It is a legacy
from ancient Turkic tribes and its steadily increasing popularity
reflects the desire of many Turks to hold on to their Asian
identity even as they turn toward Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The sport developed as a diversion in winter, when cold weather
made farming impossible and forced nomads down from their
mountainside pastures. Winter also happens to be the only time
camels will fight, because it is mating season. Their instinct is
to knock each other down to win the right to available females.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the thousands of fans who come to watch camel fights
every Sunday during the three-month season are nomads who spend
summers moving among grazing areas. The owner of a fighting camel
is invariably a celebrity in his village, and when his camel wins,
he leads the whole village in celebration. Children admire him, men
defer to him, and women compete for his attention.
</P>
<P>
   The camels bear names chosen to reflect valor and fearlessness.
Among those fighting here in Selcuk, 380 miles south of Istanbul,
were Thunderbolt, Falcon, Destiny, Black Ali and Jackal.
</P>
<P>
   Buses from throughout western Turkey began arriving here well
before the first fight, and by midmorning many fans had set up
picnic tables around the makeshift arena. They ate salads, kebabs
and yogurt, washed down with raki, the potent anise-flavored
national drink, and discussed the virtues of the various
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see fancy high-society types at a camel fight,''
Omer Demir, a lifelong fan, said as he bit into a sausage that he
said was made of camel meat but, he later admitted, was actually
beef. ``We're the real Turkey, the real people, the backbone of
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes an experienced eye like Demir's to appreciate the finer
points of camel fighting. He can explain the judging system, the
various weight classes, the special techniques that winning camels
must learn, and the importance of having an animal with bloodlines
traceable to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The subtleties of the sport, however, are not immediately
visible to the untrained eye. A fight begins with two camels, the
largest of which can weigh well over a ton, being led toward each
other. Sometimes one immediately bolts and runs away, thereby
forfeiting the match. More often, they crash into each other and
begin a shoulder-to-shoulder pushing match that resembles an
outsize version of sumo wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   For a minute or more, there is little movement as the combatants
strain against each other. An announcer breathlessly calls the
play-by-play. Finally, one of the animals is pushed to the ground
and thereby defeated. Each winning owner is awarded a carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Fans agree that in this sport, a champion is born and not made.
Camels can be trained, but no amount of training can make up for a
weak or overly peaceful character.
</P>
<P>
   Serious injuries are rare, since camels can usually harm each
other only by biting, and during fights they are muzzled. When
muzzles fall off or camels prove especially aggressive, however,
damage can be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like seeing animals fight,'' said Mehmet Gonca, a
retired civil servant who supplements his pension by selling snacks
at public events like this one. ``Sometimes they get hurt or cut.
It's not as bad as cock fighting, but I still think it's a bit
cruel.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting camels do no work for nine months of the year, and in
the competitive season they fight only about a dozen times. Their
owners pamper them and often become deeply attached to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very intelligent animal,'' Aytekin Kaya, whose
family has been training fighting camels for more than a century,
said as he prepared his 1,900-pound camel for combat. ``He won't
move a muscle for anyone but me, but when I tell him what to do, he
does it right away. Stand up, sit down, lie down, follow me, turn
around, go to sleep _ all I have to do is say the word, and he
obeys.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaya said the $150 or $200 that each camel owner receives for
entering a competition does not come close to covering the costs of
raising the animal and transporting it from town to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, this was a sport for everyone, but now you
have to be rich,'' he said. ``As for the carpets, they're all
machine made and not so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have piles of them at home. I give them away. But this isn't
about money or carpets. It's about keeping something alive that was
given to us by our grandfathers and great-grandfathers.''

 &HT;    Dispatches from Iowa: if Kennis were president, things would be
a lot different
 &HT;    EDS. Second in an occasional series.
 &HT;    By Patrick Beach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRIMES, Iowa _ What, you probably aren't wondering, motivates
the political fringe? Why, to pick three names, are Alan Keyes,
Gary Bauer and Orrin Hatch stomping around here, quixotically
stumping before voters who next week will head to the Iowa caucuses
and in all likelihood send some of these candidates packing?
</P>
<P>
   Keyes: mission from God. Bauer: mission from God. Hatch: Iowa
around caucus time more fun than Utah or wherever he's from. But
even these guys make it into the news here occasionally, and
they're allowed to debate their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Mark Kennis, the most underexposed candidate in the
2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   His organization is small; his campaign funds cover ``Kennis 4
President'' bumper stickers and little else. But Kennis is most
severely hobbled by his inability to travel: He has to check with
his probation officer every time he wants to leave Polk County, and
his driver's license has been revoked. Kennis, who hosts a local
cable-access TV show called ``Big People News,'' on which he
rambles about discrimination against persons of girth, is a
convicted felon, having been busted along with his 25-year old son
for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver. Under the
strictest reading of the law, this prohibits Kennis from voting,
let alone leading the free world into a new century. So Kennis, who
long pledged to fight laws prohibiting felons convicted on drug
charges from running from office, cannot run for office because
he's a convicted felon. And that's just one of dozens of things
Kennis, 52, finds wrong with the system.
</P>
<P>
   It'd be easy to paint Mark Kennis as a wackball, a student of
unrealpolitik, someone with only a passing acquaintance with hard
reality. It'd be easy to do that if, all mockery aside, he didn't
exude a palpable longing to help the little guy. I drove to Kennis'
home here just west of Des Moines the other day, sat in his
basement (which doubles as a production facility for ``Big People
News'') and listened. Go ahead and laugh, but if Mark Kennis were
president, things would be a lot different.
</P>
<P>
   Guns would be outlawed and pot would be legal. Everybody would
get to go to college, and college would include more vocational
training. A worldwide disarmament agreement would be negotiated.The
U.S. would end the embargo against Cuba. Voters would have real
choices between candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party, all it is is the left wing of the
Republican Party,'' said Kennis, who claims to vote for the
candidate, not the party. (In the '96 election, he says he voted
for himself.)
</P>
<P>
   Well, who can argue with that? Not the New York Times' R.W.
Apple, who years back so devastatingly labeled the two-party system
as the culprit in limiting voters' choices between ``tweedle-dumb''
and ``tweedle-dumber.'' The mass scramble for the middle leaves
non-mainstream voters to seek and support candidates who,
unburdened by so much as a snowball's chance of getting elected,
are free to say what they really believe.
</P>
<P>
   And in intraparty squabbling the stakes are smaller still, a
point that was made numbingly clear at the most recent exercise in
redundancy and media overkill _ Monday's Black &AMP; Brown Forum
between Al Gore and Bill Bradley at North High School in Des
Moines. These two agree on almost everything except which one
should get the Democratic nomination. The questions _ pointed,
substantive questions dealing mostly with minority issues _ led to
interchangeable answers and so much consensus that I feared Gore
and his opponent might hug when it was over.
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling? Bad. Confederate flag? Bad. Minority
representation in the Cabinet? Good.
</P>
<P>
   As is usually the case, most of the political media watched the
debate not in the school auditorium but in a nearby gym that had
been converted into a filing center. (Yet another instance of
collective insanity: Media outlets spend tens of thousands of
dollars a week to keep their people on the trail so that they can
watch debates on TV, in this case courtesy of MSNBC.) The only
significant dustup between Gore and Bradley came when Bradley asked
why Gore didn't march into Bill Clinton's office and demand he sign
an executive order banning racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is because Clinton's president and Gore
isn't, and what effect would such an order have, anyway? But Gore
didn't say that. He told Bradley that ``President Bill Clinton
doesn't need a lecture from Bill Bradley about how to stand up and
fight for African-Americans and Latinos.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd loved it. The reporters reported it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the thing wound down, Gore and Bradley took a question
about whether those convicted of drug possession should have their
voting rights stripped for life.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kennis' name didn't come up.

BELGRADE ATTRIBUTES KILLING OF SERBIAN LEADER TO MONTENEGRIN
MAFIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The government of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic had no role in the killing on Saturday of Zeljko
Raznatovic, the notorious Serbian paramilitary leader known as
Arkan, a senior Yugoslav government official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arkan was simply a criminal, and he was killed by the
Montenegrin mafia that wants to take over Belgrade,'' said the
Yugoslav information minister, Goran Matic, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed a report in Tuesday's government newspaper,
Politika, that one of the gunmen was seriously wounded and is in a
hospital after an operation, adding that the hospital is in the
southern Serbian city of Leskovac.
</P>
<P>
   While the gunman has so far not regained consciousness, Matic
said, the police expect to be able to interrogate him about the
murder. ``I'm very glad we'll have an answer as to who killed
Arkan,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He also promised new developments soon on a long-standing police
investigation of the November 1997 gangland-style shooting of a
politician close to Milosevic, Zoran Todorovic, known as Kunda.
</P>
<P>
   Todorovic was a close associate of Milosevic's wife, Mirjana
Markovic, and a senior official of her Yugoslav United Left party,
or JUL, and his death has also been widely laid at the door of the
Milosevic regime.
</P>
<P>
   Matic's comments were the first explicit denial of widespread
accusations by Serbian analysts and the political opposition that
the Milosevic government and its security forces had murdered
Raznatovic, the 47-year-old businessman, gangster and indicted war
criminal in a professionally organized hit on Saturday at
Belgrade's Intercontinental Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the exclusive Politika report, which clearly came
from official sources, Matic's comments were an effort to stop
rampant speculation here that the murder was politically motivated
and had any relationship to Raznatovic's activities in the Croatian
and Bosnian wars. There, he fought with his own Serbian Volunteer
Guard and was indicted for his actions by the international
tribunal for war crimes in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Belgrade believe that Raznatovic's hints that he might
provide the tribunal information about the role of Milosevic and
other Serbian officials in those wars was one of the reasons he
might have been murdered.
</P>
<P>
   But Raznatovic, clearly disaffected from the regime and allied
with former police officials opposed to Mrs. Markovic's party, was
also making overtures to the political opposition in recent months.
He was a supporter of Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic, who
broke with Milosevic and has moved closer to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic also had wide business interests, both open and
criminal, funded from the profits of his earlier work with the
secret police and the wars in Bosnia and Croatia, that ranged from
soccer clubs and bakeries to banking and gasoline smuggling. He is
thought to have had no end of possible enemies. But his reputation
and his extensive security made anything but a highly professional
hit unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Killed with Raznatovic were a business associate in a casino,
Milenko Mandic, known as Manda, and a senior police official with
the Interior Ministry, Dragan Garic, believed to have been a
colonel.
</P>
<P>
   According to Politika, Garic and Mandic were killed so they
could not identify the two assassins, one of whom came up to them
in a cordoned off part of the lobby, greeted Raznatovic and then
fired at the three from close range, escaping unharmed, while his
associate was seriously wounded by a bodyguard before escaping.
</P>
<P>
   Matic, similarly, explained the presence of the police official
with Raznatovic as in the nature of his job, which was to deal with
foreigners for the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``His job meant dealing with foreigners, which meant that he was
often in the Intercontinental Hotel,'' Matic said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that one of the assassins was injured, in police
custody in the hospital and that a serious police investigation was
under way, Politika asserted, should stop speculation about a
political hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any case, all the versions about a prepared liquidation,
`an act of professionals' carried out because of Arkan's
involvement in the war and due to activities of the Hague Tribunal
no longer hold water,'' Politika said, calling ``allegations of
state terrorism malicious.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief prosecutor of the tribunal, Carla del Ponte, has
denied that there were any direct contacts between Raznatovic and
the tribunal, though his 1997 indictment would not be unsealed
despite his death.
</P>
<P>
   The police found the wounded gunmen by checking hospitals
throughout Serbia, Matic said. ``The gunman had the option of dying
or going to a hospital,'' Matic said. Matic confirmed that the
police had not yet been able to talk to the man, and that he is
``in serious condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Many opposition figures and independent observers have said the
murder would probably not be solved, and some suggested the state
was behind the killing of Arkan, either because he had become too
powerful and independent or because he knew too much.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk Draksovic, who says the
secret police tried to murder him in a car crash last October, said
the killing was ``confirmation that we live in a country of state
terrorism.'' In a statement on the Belgrade television channel it
controls, Studio B, the party said: ``Such brutal executions aim to
spread fear and general insecurity among citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Politika said Raznatovic had known his killers, that he had
spoken to them, that they had left but then returned.
</P>
<P>
   Dobrivoje Radovanovic, a lecturer in criminology at Belgrade
University, told Glas Javnosti newspaper that given the charges
provoked by the assassination, the authorities were eager to show
the investigation was progressing. ``It will be better for the
authorities that Arkan's murder be solved, because such events
could turn against them,'' he said.

&HT;     CRITERIA FOR HOUSE CHAPLAIN CRITICIZED AS BIASED

   WASHINGTON _ When the House began seeking a new chaplain last
year, the search committee's list of qualifications included the
statement that it would be ``extremely beneficial'' if the post
were filled by a ``dedicated spouse and parent,'' a provision which
would effectively rule out Catholic priests.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-member House committee later jettisoned the spouse-parent
standard after it was criticized but some Democrats say the
statement indicated an anti-Catholic mindset that has strained
congressional relations after Republicans leaders later rejected
the committee' choice, a Catholic priest.
</P>
<P>
   The committee labored for more than three months to whittle down
an initial list of more than 50 candidates and come up with three
finalists. Ranked No. 1 was Rev. Tim O'Brien, the Catholic priest,
followed by the Rev. Robert Drvorak, an Episcopalian priest, and
the Rev. Charles Wright, a Presbyterian minister.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the committee's recommendations, House Speaker
J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Majority Leader Richard Armey,
R-Texas, bypassed O'Brien and Drvorak and selected Wright, ranked
No. 3 by the search committee. Hastert has said he and Armey
selected the candidate they were ``most comfortable with'' but he
has declined to expand on that statement.
</P>
<P>
   The House will vote Jan. 27 on whether to appoint Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., a Catholic and a member of the
committee, said the spouse-parent provision ``does raise some flags
and it does ring some bells.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That does reflect kind of a singular and not very broad
experience in life,'' Eshoo said. ``It certainly doesn't include
Catholicism in Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   `` Eshoo and other House Democrats are demanding that Hastert
explain why he and Armey rejected O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in fact, the speaker wanted to directly appoint who he
wanted, why in God's name did they appoint a committee to do tons
of work and then have it come to this,'' Eshoo said. ``If you
overturn a bipartisan decision of a committee, I believe you bear
the burden of proof. I still believe the burden of explanation is
on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Eshoo also said she was deeply troubled over the kinds of
questions that O'Brien was subjected to when he was interviewed by
the search committee, including a question from Rep. Steve Largent,
R-Okla., about whether the priest thought wearing his clerical
collar would offend non-Catholic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., a committee member, said he was
``bothered'' that some Republicans on the panel didn't seem open to
the idea of considering a Catholic priest as their chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   ``By defining a qualification based on a chaplain being a good
husband and father, it would by definition exclude a priest,''
Waxman said. ``It seemed to me insensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's list of criteria for the chaplain's post
originally read: ``While not a qualification, it is extremely
beneficial that the chaplain have a strong family life, and is a
dedicated spouse and parent. Through this, the chaplain will be
able to reach out to the spouse and children of members who often
need help in adjusting to life in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee members contributed their own suggestions about what
would make an ideal chaplain. The result was a three-page list of
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Cal Dooley, D-Calif., a committee member and a Catholic,
said some members complained that the spouse-parent statement ``was
inappropriate and it would certainly be prejudicial against a
member of the Catholic clergy. There was an acceptance that it
wouldn't be fair and it shouldn't be a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., who co-chaired the chaplain selection
committee along with Rep. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr. R-Va., couldn't
recall which committee member introduced the parent-spouse angle
but speculated that it may have come from a lawmaker with ``an
evangelical Protestant background.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have been inartfully worded, or maybe it was
malicious intent,'' Pomeroy said. ``I don't know what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Pomeroy, who supported O'Brien for the post, said he was
disappointed that the candidate ``with the greatest consensus was
not selected,'' adding: ``I thought the opportunity to select a
very well-qualified Roman Catholic priest would have been great. I
think it was a lost opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written ballot, committee members placed checks beside the
names of their top three candidates. O`Brien got the most votes,
followed by Drvorak and Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the House recessed for the holidays Nov. 19, the
task force sent the three names to Hastert, Armey and Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. While Gephardt cast his vote for
O`Brien, the two Republicans chose Wright who has been working with
the National Capitol Presbytery on prayer breakfast groups in
Congress.

<P>
   R-AND-B-MUSIC (Undated) _ There's a widening groundswell of
R-and-B artists _ and even some who fit more naturally in the
category of hip-hop _ who are sounding like an antidote to the
sameness problem: their records are more well-rounded, more
musicianly, more complete. They make a mature music, and a family
music, for living rooms, rather than for the streets. By Ben
Ratliff.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA-FILMMAKERS (Undated) _ Who is the greatest American
filmmaker of the last 40 years? Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg,
Stanley Kubrick, John Cassavetes, Woody Allen, Robert Altman all
have their partisans. But if the criteria includes the most
masterpieces, or the highest sustained level of accomplishment,
maybe we should also be talking about Frederick Wiseman. Since
1967, when ``Titicut Follies,'' his portrait of a state prison for
the criminally insane, made its debut, he has made a total of 30
complex, disturbing, illuminating documentaries, on the average of
one a year. By Phillip Lopate. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CATHERINE-KEENER-FILMS (Undated) _ It was in 1986 that Catherine
Keener decided that sitcom humor might not be her calling. At the
time, she had just got her first real break _ making her network
debut as the eldest of three daughters in a pilot called ``The Alan
King Show.'' Ms Keener, now 40, whether in a starring role as a
helplessly distracted indie starlet in a shoestring production like
``Living In Oblivion'' (1995) or in a glorified supporting turn as
a magician's assistant and the ex-wife of an escaped convict in the
1998 crime caper ``Out of Sight,'' her ability to be effortlessly
hilarious is all about appearing as if she's never trying too hard.

   NEO-NOIR-FILMS (New York) _ Film noir has gone from retro to
neo, and on Feb. 18, Film Forum begins a seven-week festival to
commemorate this resurgence. The ``Neo-Noir'' series includes
acclaimed recent movies _ ``Fargo,'' ``Pulp Fiction,'' ``One False
Move'' _ as well as lesser-known features like ``Red Rock West''
and, for fans of the outre, a forgotten Sal Mineo film called ``Who
Killed Teddy Bear?'' Among the directors whose dark visions will be
offered are Joel Coen, Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh, Roman
Polanski and Abel Ferrara. By David Everitt. &QL;

   NY-CITY-BALLET (New York) _ New York City Ballet's
post-``Nutcracker'' winter season is barely four weeks old, yet
among a growing body of regular balletgoers there is already a
sense of completion about it. Nagging doubts that in some quarters
had verged on dread are being assuaged and possibly wiped out
altogether. By Harris Green. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JENNY-LIND-MUSIC (New York) _ One hundred fifty years ago, the
19th-century Swedish Nightingale, Jenny Lind, made a revolutionary
tour of the United States, and the American soprano Barbara Bonney
has seized the occasion of the anniversary to indulge her longtime
fascination with her Swedish predecessor. On Saturday morning, Ms.
Bonney will present a workshop, ``The Legacy of Jenny Lind,'' at
the Walter Reade Theater in Lincoln Center as the first installment
of her three-part survey of Scandinavian song over the next few
weeks. By Cori Ellison. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MENTZER-MUSIC (Undated) _ In a time rich in fine lyric
mezzo-sopranos, Susanne Mentzer is a quiet standout. She does not
have the biggest, most flamboyant personality or the flashiest
coloratura. What she offers is subtler: thoughtfulness,
consistency, vocal and dramatic depth and flexibility, and a
scintillating, elegant sound. Primarily an opera singer, she has
recently begun to take on concert and recital work as well. Ms.
Mentzer, who has a fondness for jeans and National Public Radio,
and none of the stigmas of the diva, is in her 10th season at the
Metropolitan Opera. By Sarah Bryan Miller. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SIMON-RATTLE-MUSIC (Undated) _ Sir Simon Rattle, who turned 45
on Wednesday, was for a decade or so considered the heir apparent
to succeed Seiji Ozawa as music director of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra in the event of a vacancy. In recent years, as the
likelihood of that eventuality kept receding into an indefinite
future, both Sir Simon and the orchestra seemed to cool toward the
prospect, and he was avidly courted by the Philadelphia Orchestra
to succeed Wolfgang Sawallisch in 2002. Then last June, a day after
it was announced that Ozawa would finally leave Boston in 2002 to
direct the Vienna State Opera, the Berlin Philharmonic elected Sir
Simon (italics)its(end italics) music director as of the same year.

<P>
   EGYPTIAN-ART (Boston) _ While exhibitions of Egyptian art, like
the well-traveled ``Treasures of Tutankhamen'' in the 1970s,
usually emphasized the excavation and discovery of artifacts in
ancient tombs, the museums that presented such objects were faced
with the question of how to display them. Most opted for an
atmosphere that was tantamount to reburial: dark, mysterious,
tomblike spaces. In installing the Museum of Fine Arts' permanent
galleries for Egyptian funerary arts and the art of the ancient
Middle East, the architects Jung/Brannen Associates of Boston
followed this approach but with a difference. Instead of dense,
dark spaces typical of such galleries, they have created rows of
transparent columns filled with light that serve as exhibition
cases. By Paula Deitz. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS-ART (Undated) _ Until recently, the art world
sanctioned little work with overt religious content unless it
possessed a critical, subversive edge. Postmodernism, however, has
embraced religion as part of ongoing cultural phenomena. Now,
spurred by the millennium, several contemporary-art exhibitions has
been unabashedly faith-based, to borrow political argot. ``Faith:
The Impact of Judeo-Christian Religion on Art at the Millennium,''
opening this Sunday at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in
Ridgefield, Conn., samples work by 36 living artists from six
countries who variously celebrate, wrestle with, deconstruct or
critique religion. By Ann Wilson Lloyd. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TV-CULTURE-SHOCK (Undated) _ There she is, totally naked,
reclining on pillows in a full frontal pose, just three and a half
minutes into a prime-time public television show. It is the first
of the nude model's many appearances on the second episode of
``Culture Shock,'' whose first two installments will be broadcast
on Wednesday night. Even today, tuning in to PBS and seeing a woman
whose only bow to modesty is a well-placed hand comes as something
of a stunner. But the rest of the series _ in all, four and a half
hours in four programs _ is far tamer. ``Culture Shock'' turns out
to be elucidating and entertaining but, most of all, safe _ safe in
its choices of art to illustrate the never-ending conflict between
artists and society, between freedom of expression and censorship,
between what is conventional and what might lie ahead. By Judith H.
Dobrzynski. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TV-OXYGEN (Los Angeles) _ Geraldine Laybourne, 52, who built the
children's Nickelodeon television channel into an $8 billion
mini-empire, has now created a high-risk 24-hour cable venture
aimed at women called Orygen. The program will make its debut on
Feb. 2 in a half-dozen major cities and suburban areas (but not New
York and parts of Los Angeles). It will be aimed at women who are
in control of their lives, have money to spend and are eager to
find an outlet on television and on Internet sites that will
address their health issues, finances, relationships and problems
with raising children. By Bernard Weinraub. &QL;

MANY SYRIANS UNCONCERNED BY LAG IN TALKS WITH ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ In this cold and rainy capital, just an hour's
drive from the contested Golan Heights, the suspension of peace
talks with Israel has left many Syrians remarkably unmoved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peace process will continue and it won't take long before
it resumes,'' said Ghassam Jeroudi, 21, the manager of a photo
processing studio, on Tuesday. He shrugged off the latest breakdown
as little more than a bump in the road toward the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, few Syrians were so sanguine about the prospects
or even the payoff of an agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   After the peace effort was set in motion at a conference in
Madrid in 1991, there were few face-to-face meetings between Syrian
and Israeli negotiators. In 1996, talks between the sides broke off
completely, and they resumed only a month ago under the direct
sponsorship of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are now in limbo, after the second round ended last
week with no agreement on the main issues: borders, water rights,
security and normalization of relations between the countries.
</P>
<P>
   Still, like Jeroudi, many people here now seem to take for
granted that one day, probably sooner than later, the state of war
that has endured for more than half a century, since Israel was
born, will end.

   ``Five years ago, nobody thought Israel wanted peace,'' said
Mazzen Desouki, a seller of gold chains and jewelry who has three
nephews in the army, one of them serving on the Syrian side of the
Golan. ``Now it's changed, and we see the Syrian and Israeli
negotiators meeting each other. For that, people start to speak
openly about peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian government line, to be sure, is that Israel has not
shown that it is serious, at least about Syria's core demand for a
withdrawal from the Golan Heights to the border that existed
between the countries before the war of June 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even as they have denounced Israel for not acceding
unconditionally to demands for full withdrawal, the official
government-run newspapers have focused chiefly on Israel's
negotiating strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, has said he wants a
peace treaty with Syria that provides normal diplomatic and trade
relations, and accepts that the cost will include the return of
land, although the exact border remains a subject for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is that Israel is dealing with these matters as if
it is in the bazaar, buying and selling,'' said Yousuf Makdesi, a
political analyst for the largest Syrian daily newspaper, Tishreen,
in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no official Syrian response to the cancelation of
the next round, which was scheduled to begin Wednesday in
Shepherdstown, W.Va., and there is no indication that Syria intends
to turn its back completely on the negotiations. It has agreed to
send experts to the United States to discuss technical issues, but
not its foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, who led the Syrians in
the first two rounds of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Makdesi, a leading commentator for the government media, praised
the Clinton administration for its handling of the negotiations, an
indication of the enduring Syrian interest in using the talks with
Israel as a means of improving relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He said a draft agreement drawn up by U.S. officials at the end
of the last negotiating session, a document meant to lay out the
positions of the two sides, effectively engaged the United States
as a more active participant in the peace talks. Syria has long
sought a direct U.S. role in the talks, while Israel has
traditionally pushed for direct negotiations with Arab states.
</P>
<P>
   ``By issuing the document, America has moved from the role of
mediator to the role of partner in the process,'' Makdassi said.
``In our political view, this means the U.S.A. is serious about
reaffirming its commitment to achieve a comprehensive and just
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Kasaa shopping district, Tony Khouri said he looked
forward to just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a few years, we didn't feel that peace was really close,''
he said, as he surveyed the customers in his clothing shop, which
sells Syrian-made blue jeans and shirts. ``Now it seems we are
hearing something new. And when we have peace, everyone will be
more comfortable _ there will be more exports and imports, more
tourists. It will be good for the economy and for us.''

EDUCATION FINANCE SPECIALIST TO HEAD WILLIAMS COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Calif.; Schapiro is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the nation's foremost experts on student financial aid
and the economics of higher education was chosen Tuesday as the new
president of Williams College.
</P>
<P>
   The college's trustees announced they chose Morton Owen
Schapiro, dean of the College of Arts and Letters at the University
of Southern California, to replace Harry Payne, who resigned
abruptly in October.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment is a return to Williamstown for Schapiro, who
began his teaching career in 1980 in the economics department of
the college. Colleagues and higher education leaders Tuesday lauded
him for his teaching, his scholarship, and his advocacy for higher
education issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not only an excellent scholar, a fine teacher, and an
accomplished administrator, he is also a person with fine values
who understands so well why education matters,'' said William G.
Bowen, president of the Mellon Foundation and former president of
Princeton University. ``All of us concerned with the large purposes
that higher education serves in America have reason to be delighted
by this appointment. ... Williams is to be congratulated for having
recruited someone who can do great work while at Williams while
also advancing the nation's agenda for higher education.''
</P>
<P>
   Schapiro is a commentator on Public Radio International, as well
as a widely quoted expert on issues such as keeping college
affordable and changes in how schools use financial aid. He has
testified frequently before Congress on economic issues in higher
education.
</P>
<P>
   He is the author of several books, including, with former
Williams colleague Michael McPherson, ``The Student Aid Game,''
which was one of the first writings to identify how schools have
begun using aid as a way to enhance their rankings and reputations,
giving money to lure top students who don't necessarily need
financial aid, and abandoning decades-old practice of giving money
to the neediest students. Last summer, he and McPherson co-wrote an
opinion piece in the Chronicle of Higher Education arguing that
Congress should enact incentives for colleges to maintain a
need-based aid system, and urging the federal government to make a
formal commitment to helping the neediest students get the
financial aid they need.
</P>
<P>
   At USC, where he started as head of the economics department
before becoming dean in 1994, Schapiro continued to teach
everything from freshman economics courses to post-graduate
seminars. His third year there, he received the Senior Faculty
Award for Excellence in Teaching, Research, and Service.
</P>
<P>
   He said Tuesday he plans to continue teaching during his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morty is, above all, an outstanding teacher,'' said McPherson,
now president of Macalester College in Minnesota. ``He believes
deeply in liberal education, and he'll be completely back in his
element at Williams. Liberal arts colleges, including Williams,
face huge challenges in the coming decade. Morty Schapiro will help
Williams to preserve what's central to its purpose while leading
the kinds of change new circumstances require.''

GORE PROJECTING NEW CONFIDENCE IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Nonsubscribers
can make individual purchase by calling 888-603-1036 or
888-346-9867.)

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Iowa _ After a bumpy start out of the gate, Vice
President Al Gore is acting once again like the Democratic
front-runner, and his aides say he can afford to.
</P>
<P>
   The surest and most obvious sign is that Gore is telling
audiences that he is going to win the Democratic nomination for
president. When a supporter at a black church yelled out on Monday
night, ``Run, Al, run!'' a revved-up Gore doubled over with
laughter and shouted back: ``I will! I will! I will! And with your
help, I'll win! I'll win! I'll win!''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time that Gore, who has been in a beseeching
posture with voters for months, has made such a claim.
</P>
<P>
   But that was an unusual display. Gore is being careful these
days to contain his enthusiasm, lest he appear overconfident or
give the voters the sense that he expects a coronation.
</P>
<P>
   He has dropped his attacks, though, against his rival for the
nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley, and is determined to give the
television cameras nothing but positive footage for the evening
news. This consists of the vice president beaming in front of
audiences that have been pumped up by the throbbing blasts of Tina
Turner belting out ``You're Simply the Best'' and Gore's upbeat
signature song from the 1992 campaign, Paul Simon's ``You Can Call
Me Al.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is stepping up his attentions to the leading Republican
candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. At rallies Tuesday, Gore
went further than his standard criticism that Bush would squander
the nation's budget surplus on a ``risky tax scheme.'' He said that
Bush would ``raid workers' pensions'' to pay for tax cuts and that
in Texas, the governor is ``waging war'' against organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a week until Iowa begins the nation's voting, the
polls show that Gore has a reason for confidence. Most recently, a
Los Angeles Times survey here put Gore at 58 percent, with 35
percent for Bradley. Internal Gore campaign polls show that Gore
leads Bradley in every category of voter except among those with
higher educations and more wealth. As a result, Bradley is faring
better in the college towns across Iowa, so Gore barnstormed across
these media markets in a bus tour today.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that the Democratic race is still neck and neck in
New Hampshire, and a Bradley win there could send a strong message
to other states, like New York, where voters are perceived as more
open to Bradley's candidacy. But top Gore advisers also believe
that it is, as one said, ``mathematically impossible'' for Bradley
to secure enough delegates to win the nomination, and they are
turning their sights increasingly toward the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers said the balance of power here in Iowa shifted to
Gore's favor after last Saturday's debate in Des Moines. That, they
said, is when Gore exposed Bradley as lax on farm issues.
</P>
<P>
   In the few days after that debate, Bradley appeared more
desperate, firing off one-day attacks on Gore _ for his support of
tobacco subsidies and for raising the specter of Willie Horton in
the 1988 presidential campaign. Gore advisers believe these hurt
Bradley more than they hurt Gore because Bradley appeared to be
violating his own assertion that he was a different kind of
politician who would not campaign using old votes and negative
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   A top Gore strategist said the goal is to drum up enthusiasm
among supporters but avoid negative news coverage. ``We want him to
set things on fire but not to self-immolate,'' this adviser said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore has been able to minimize the effects of the negative news
that has occurred, such as his reversal over whether the generals
he would appoint to the Joint Chiefs of Staff would have to support
his policy on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, Gore is loose, light and ``laughing a lot,'' said his
close adviser, Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban
development, who is campaigning with the vice president across the
state. ``He's at the top of his game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of Gore's tactical switch to ignoring Bradley instead of
demonizing him, Cuomo said that Gore has already convinced voters
that he has the experience and more thought-out positions on
issues. ``When you have won the case, you say `Thank you' and sit
down,'' Cuomo told reporters as the Gore campaign motorcade sailed
through a freakily spring-like, sun-drenched afternoon. ``You
continue to make your case, but since they are with you, it takes
on a different style.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of growling about Bradley, Gore is showing a touch of
whimsy. At a small labor gathering in Knoxville, where television
cameras outnumbered voters, Gore told the members of the American
Federation of Government Employees who were endorsing him: ``It
will be easy for me to be in your corner if you put me in an office
without any corners.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign advisers are engaging in a campaign luxury _
lowering the expectations for Gore's showing in the Jan. 24 Iowa
caucuses. They do this by fretting in front of reporters over
Bradley's advantages _ a $1.6-million buy on Iowa television
(compared with $1.1 million for Gore), the perceived motivation of
Bradley's upscale supporters to get to the caucuses, and the
failure of the United Auto Workers union, the backbone of organized
labor in Iowa, to work actively on Gore's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, they are waging a ferocious grab for
precinct captains, motivating them by telling them to act as if
Gore is 5 points behind and must scramble to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   They have shifted into overdrive to identify Gore supporters and
are using mailings to prod them to the caucuses. And they are
flooding the state with surrogates for Gore, most notably members
of the Kennedy dynasty. Trekking to Iowa are Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, Rep. Patrick Kennedy, former Rep. Joe Kennedy, Bobby
Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer in New York, and Kathleen
Kennedy Towson, the lieutenant governor of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand to make Gore's case: the model Christie Brinkley
and Sen. John Kerrey of Massachusetts, who served in Vietnam and is
especially helpful with military veterans.
</P>
<P>
   And the campaign has dotted the countryside with Burma
Shave-like signs, like this series outside Indianola: ``Grandma has
to decide between pills or food/ Putting her in a very foul
mood./Al Gore says to make Grandma happy/Make meds cheap and make
it snappy./Al Gore for President.''

   ATLANTA _ The Heritage Bowl, which has been called the Black
College Super Bowl, appears to be in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Held annually at the Georgia Dome the past seven years, the
event already had been hurt in by sagging attendance figures in
recent years. But the event might have received a knockout blow at
last week's NCAA convention in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) commissioner Rudy
Washington was told by the NCAA that his conference would be
allowed to continue playing its league championship game, which was
held for the first time in December. But Washington also was told
that neither of the two participating teams would be allowed to
compete in any other post-season action.
</P>
<P>
   The probable result would be a Heritage Bowl matchup of a
third-place team from the SWAC against a third-place squad from the
Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC).
</P>
<P>
   The conferences have sent representatives to the game for the
past seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say the least, that leaves the bowl on awfully thin ice,''
Heritage Bowl director Craig Cason said. ``I don't think TV would
be interested in that kind of matchup.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by attendance figures, fans have not been that
interested in most of the matchups since the bowl started in 1991.
With McDonald's as a title sponsor the past four years, bowl
officials had hoped the post-season battle between teams from the
historically black college conferences would have reached the
40,000-plus attendance mark as long as three years.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the average attendance over the past four years was
28,843. A month ago for Heritage Bowl IX, a crowd of 29,561 watched
SWAC champion Southern lose to Hampton, a team that finished third
in the MEAC.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see this coming,'' Washington said. ``Atlanta just
didn't support it. We're going to work on it and see where we can
take it, because we've got some alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Heritage Bowl game, played in Joe Robbie Stadium in
Miami in 1991, drew 7,724; they watched Alabama State defeat North
Carolina A&AMP;T 36-13. The crowd improved to 11,273 for Heritage Bowl
II in Tallahassee, when Grambling beat Florida A&AMP;M 45-15.

 &HT;    Atlanta seeks Super Bowl in 2005
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLNATA _ This city will host its second Super Bowl in six years
in the Georgia Dome on Jan. 30. But Super Bowl XXXIV also might be
another dress rehersal for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is among four cities lobbying for Super Bowl XXXIX in
2005. The NFL's special-events committee will hear preliminary
proposals in March at the league's annual meeting in Palm Beach,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Three Florida cities _ Jacksonville, Miami and Tampa _ also are
expected to submit bids for the 2005 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That year could be the free-for-all,'' said Jim Steeg, the
NFL's vice president for special events and the person in charge of
coordinating Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Sites for the next three Super Bowls are set _ Tampa in 2001,
New Orleans in 2002 and San Diego in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, which was awarded a new NFL franchise last year, is the
favorite to host pro football's title game in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Houston) gets all its stuff together,'' Steeg said.
``They've learned that it's a little more complicated than it
seemed at first light. They've been working on it pretty
intensively for the last month and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit also is lobbying to get back into the game. The
Detroit/Wayne County Stadium Authority broke ground on a new $300
million domed stadium in November. It is expected to open in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, whose best shot might come in 2006, would become the
first Northern city to host two Super Bowls. Super Bowl XVI _ in
which San Francisco won the first of its five titles with a 26-21
victory over Cincinnati _ was played in January 1982 in the Pontiac
Silverdome.

 &HT;    Delta profits dip as fuel prices take off
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Profits at Delta Air Lines fell nearly 10 percent
during its second fiscal quarter, as higher fuel prices pushed
industry earnings into a descent.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines reported a 50 percent drop in quarterly
profits and announced plans for a $20 per round-trip ``fuel
surcharge'' to offset higher fuel costs, driven by the upturn in
oil prices since the middle of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The two big carriers posted earnings Tuesday, as did Southwest
Airlines, which also saw profits decline.
</P>
<P>
   Airline profits are expected to fall in 2000 after several
high-flying years. Fuel costs are a big factor, and industry
capacity growth is forcing more low-ball pricing to fill seats,
also hurting profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Continental surcharge _ essentially a fare hike listed as a
separate fee _ takes effect Feb. 1. But Continental could be forced
to scrub the surcharge if other major airlines don't match it by
then. None did so on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Continental said fuel costs rose 49 percent in the quarter that
ended Dec. 31, and warned it might lose money in the current
quarter without relief. Fuel is the second-highest expense after
labor at most carriers.
</P>
<P>
   At Delta the damage was less severe, with fuel costs rising 9.4
percent. Delta bought most of its fuel under purchasing contracts
negotiated while prices were low. It paid an average of 53.6 cents
a gallon, vs. 67 cents for Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Chief Executive Leo Mullin said he was pleased with the
quarterly report and remains optimistic about the carrier's 2000
outlook. But he acknowledged Delta could face worse fuel inflation
as some of the hedging contracts expire later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If fuel prices do stay high...it would become a cost
challenge,'' Mullin said in an appearance on CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Delta posted a profit of $172 million, excluding
special items, or $1.24 a share in the quarter ended Dec. 31, down
from $194 million, or $1.29 a share, a year earlier. The results
easily beat the Wall Street estimate of $1.15 a share. Revenue rose
7.7 percent to $3.71 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Delta shares jumped $2.56 1/4 to $52.56 1/4 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's quarterly numbers showed a slight drop in passenger
yield, reflecting a weaker fare mix. Labor costs rose almost 10
percent, contributing to a 2 percent uptick in unit costs. On the
other hand, Delta enjoyed a 16 percent drop in commission costs as
it continues to cut travel agent payments. Like all airlines, Delta
endured a Y2K-induced slump in holiday travel that carried into
early January.
</P>
<P>
   Delta recorded one-time gains totaling $649 million, mostly from
the sale of shares in Priceline.com. It took a charge of $320
million for the planned early retirement of MD-90 and MD-11 jets,
although those planes will remain in its fleet for several years.
Including those items, Delta's quarterly profit was $352 million.
</P>
<P>
   Separately on Tuesday, Continental said it is in talks to buy
back the stake held by Northwest Airlines since a 1998 deal that
formed a marketing alliance between the two.
</P>
<P>
   Continental said it wants to continue the alliance but without
Northwest's ownership position. Northwest's 14 percent stake
carries 51 percent voting rights, although the deal was structured
to prevent Northwest from exerting management control.
</P>
<P>
   Continental chose the deal with Northwest over a buyout bid from
Delta. Continental's repurchase of the stake could raise questions
of whether it would become an acquisition target once again. But
analysts consider that unlikely for now, citing Continental's
stronger financial position and likely government opposition to
major airline mergers.
</P>
<P>
   A Delta spokesman declined comment.

 &HT;    Counties go dot-com
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two things bug Bryan Mundy: paper and lines.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as CheckFree are using the Internet to make the
bill-paying process check-free. Online banking software firms like
S1 want to thin the Friday afternoon line at the bank. Both
companies are trying to convince others to think of the Internet as
the main medium for doing business.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has done the same for government in any substantial
way. Mundy's company, Ezgov.com, which was started in May, hopes to
make a business out of cutting red tape.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is catching on. In the next few weeks, the 8-month-old
firm plans to close cond round of venture capital funding,
between $25 million and $30 million. Ezgov.com would not say who
the investors will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time I see mail or paper or people standing in line, it
makes my skin crawl because there's no reason for it,'' said Mundy,
Ezgov.com's co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government on the Internet is so wide-open. People are buying
books and airline tickets online. But no one is offering government
services,'' he said. ``Twenty years from now, all these things will
be done over the Internet. Someone's going to take us from now to
there, and we think we can be a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based firm has signed deals with local governments,
including DeKalb County and Clarke County/Athens, as well as with
Riverside County, Calif., and Brazoria County, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Since August, DeKalb residents have been able to pay property
taxes and research deeds through EzGov.com.
</P>
<P>
   But Ezgov.com is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   IBM helped Arizona's Department of Motor Vehicles. A few
paper-based records management companies _ SDR Technologies and
National Information Consortium _ have shifted their business
models to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   A few start-ups also have attracted venture capital recently.
</P>
<P>
   Link2gov.com, a Florida company backed in part by Atlanta-based
iXL Enterprises, received $7.5 million last spring, including money
from GE Capital Partners and Flatiron Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Link2Gov.com, formerly Transsport.com, is automating some of
Washington, D.C.'s transactions, including vehicle registration
and, soon, parking ticket payments. The firm already offers the
ability to register for Georgia hunting and fishing licenses
online. The company expects to announce the ability to pay Mobile,
Ala., parking tickets online soon, said Joe Jones, a company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Govworks.com, a New York-based firm, said it received a $19
million second round of venture capital in November. The firm
offers the chance to pay parking tickets and other local government
bills online.
</P>
<P>
   Ezgov.com was started in May by Mundy, 35, and Ed Trimble, a
31-year-old formerly with Andersen Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   The company employs 60 people working out of the same building
that, after renovation, will be the home of the new EarthLink
(following its merger with MindSpring).
</P>
<P>
   At Andersen, Trimble worked with clients such as Delta Air Lines
and MCI. In 1996, Trimble left to start InterArch Technologies,
which developed electronic-commerce applications. Mundy worked for
TicketMaster/CitySearch before joining Trimble at InterArch.
</P>
<P>
   Before investing more than $80,000 of their own money to get
Ezgov.com started, Trimble and Mundy researched the issue. They
said they asked people standing in line waiting to get their
vehicle tags renewed if they would rather be doing it from their
den.
</P>
<P>
   Then they talked to the people who run government agencies.
DeKalb County was the first to go online last fall.
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb saw the service as a way to become more efficient and cut
car pollution by reducing the number of people driving to a county
office to research property records or pay taxes, said Liane
Levetan, DeKalb chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Levetan said the county is considering offering the ability to
renew vehicle tags and pay water and sanitation bills and parking
tickets online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely elated,'' Levetan said. ``The possibilities are
unlimited.''
</P>
<P>
   Ezgov.com also has attracted some big names. The board of
directors includes former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, former
Congressman Jack Kemp and Zell Miller, former governor of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 67, has taken several board seats since retiring as
governor in 1999, including Georgia Power and Post Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Ezgov.com is his first high-technology start-up. Miller said he
was offered the chance to be on the board of two high-technology
start-ups when he first left office. He passed on them and later
regretted it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a very high-tech person. I still have a hard time
sending e-mail,'' Miller said. ``But this one seemed to be the
perfect fit of where some of my knowledge and experience was.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller met with Trimble and Mundy at the Willard Hotel in
Washington last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were really on to something,'' he said. ``I
never met a county official who didn't want to do something to make
it easier for his constituents. And I never met a constituent that
didn't want something made easier. I think it would be appealing
for everyone.''

 &HT;    Snow forces school schedule adjustments
 &HT;    By T. Scott Batchelor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Tuesday morning snowfall meant fun for Pitt
County students but headaches for the school district's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Officials already had lost 13 class days in the wake of massive
flooding from Hurricane Floyd. Reconfiguring the schedule left only
two days _ Feb. 21 and March 24 _ that can be used to replace days
lost to inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt County Schools decided early Tuesday morning to cancel
classes because of the morning snows. Today's classes are scheduled
to begin two hours after usual start times.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Howard Sosne and the school board now will have
to come up with a plan for packing the proper number of hours of
instruction into the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think he's planning to do is discuss this with the
board and see if they want to use Feb. 21 as a make-up day or
explore options about 1,000 hours or 180 days,'' said schools
spokesman Barry Gaskins.
</P>
<P>
   State law normally requires 1,000 hours and 180 days of
instructional time. But in a nod to shortcomings caused by Floyd,
the state legislature gave school systems the option to provide
either 1,000 hours or 180 days, but not necessarily both.
</P>
<P>
   If that course is taken, school officials would add minutes to
enough days to compensate for the lost class day, Gaskins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That in itself becomes complicated, but it is an option,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Without that option, Saturdays could become school days, said
Gaskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would probably be the last case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials made the decision to delay school for two hours at
5:30 a.m. Tuesday, Gaskins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then conditions got worse real quick,'' he said, prompting a
full shutdown of the system.
</P>
<P>
   While school leaders weighed how to fit the classroom hours, the
Howard family took advantage of the wintry weather and headed for
the snow-covered slopes of the large, earthen bowl at the corner of
Fifth Street and Reade Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Don and Joann Howard watched as their bundled up children,
Ginny, 6, and Lee, 10, both students at Elmhurst Elementary School,
careened down the powdered escarpment on plastic boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get to bring them out here and play, too,'' Joann Howard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ginny launched from the hilltop and bulleted down the slope,
tumbling head over heels at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wiped out,'' her mom yelled after her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, that was fun,'' the little girl shouted back. ``I want to
wipe out again.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee saddled up on his board once more, but he demanded an
audience for his exploits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy, don't take your eyes off me _ watch this,'' and began
the accelerating slide across the compacted flakes to the bottom of
the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the white scenery all around, Don Howard remarked on
the snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is rare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have so much fun,'' his wife said. ``We don't get it so
much to get tired of it.''

 &HT;    Meteorologist warns of 'black' ice on roads
 &HT;    By Travis Fain
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILEE, N.C. _ About an inch of snow fell Tuesday, causing a
round of closings and more than 70 automobile accidents in the
county, but few major problems.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst may be to come because of an expected freeze of
area roads, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Commuters can expect to find hard-to-see ``black'' ice on the
roads this morning, though mostly sunny skies should clear things
up by this afternoon, according to Rick Brandy, a meteorologist
with the National Weather Service's Newport office. No new snow or
sleet was expected to fall last night, Brandy said.
</P>
<P>
   Local police ask motorists to drive slowly in what Brandy
expected to be ``pretty treacherous'' conditions. The Highway
Patrol suggests leaving plenty of room between cars and being
especially wary of shady spots and bridges where ice and snow melt
slower from the road. It's also important to go easy on the brakes
on icy spots to avoid losing control of the car, Highway Patrol
Sgt. John Tomer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you slam on your brakes on ice, you're just along for the
ride then,'' Tomer said.
</P>
<P>
   One-half to 1 inch of snow was reported across Pitt County
Tuesday, most of it falling between 6-10 a.m., Brandy said.
Employees at the city's water treatment plant measured eight-tenths
of an inch of snow Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The snow brought ``just more fun and inconvenience at the same
time'' than serious problems, according to Greenville Assistant
City Manager Marvin Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Non-essential city employees were sent home at 3 p.m. and county
offices closed at 3 as well. East Carolina University canceled
Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning classes. Pitt schools were
closed Tuesday and were set to open 2 hours late today, unless
conditions worsen.
</P>
<P>
   City and county officials said Tuesday they'd decide today's
government office schedules early this morning. Closings will be
announced via local television and radio stations. Greenville bus
schedules and garbage and debris pickups should not be affected,
said Tom Tysinger, director of public works.
</P>
<P>
   The Highway Patrol reported 50 accidents in Pitt County by 1
p.m. Tuesday. Only one accident was termed major: a 10-car pileup
on the U.S. 264 bridge near Hastings Ford at about 7 a.m. One
person suffered injuries in that accident, Tomer said.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenville, 17 accidents were reported, 12 of them without
injury, according to police spokeswoman Melissa Bartlett. None of
the injuries were considered major and no multiple-car pileups were
reported, Bartlett said. Several minor accidents were reported in
other towns. Most of the wrecks involved drivers running off the
road into ditches, according to area police departments.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt County Memorial Hospital reported treating one person for
serious injuries from a car accident. The injuries were not
considered life-threatening, according to a hospital spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   The N.C. Department of Transportation dispatched seven sand
trucks across the county Tuesday, concentrating on primary
highways, according to department supervisor Chad Fornes. As of
Tuesday night, no county roads were closed because of the weather,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Four sand trucks patrolled Greenville Tuesday and two truck
crews were on standby through the night, Tysinger said. The city's
snow plow wasn't needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For many Tuesday, life went on as usual despite the snow. Some
businesses didn't open and other owners reported a light morning,
but people stayed in their routines for the most part, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really wasn't all that bad,'' said Greenville resident
Beverly Sparrow, fresh from her grocery shopping just after noon.
``I mean, people panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparrow said she was on the roads by 9 a.m. She had an
appointment to keep at the beauty parlor, she said. She said she
was going to have her nails done later Tuesday afternoon.

COMMENTARY: DOLLARS AND DESPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ecuador is a small, faraway country of which most Americans
probably know nothing. (Hint: it's on the equator.) Last week, amid
the hoopla of the AOL-Time Warner deal, one suspects that few
noticed the surprise announcement by President Jamil Mahuad that he
would abolish his nation's currency and replace it with the U.S.
dollar. But there is an important story behind that story, which is
not so much about Ecuador as about the great financial crisis that
swept Asia in 1997-98, and the continuing debate over what to do
when the next crisis strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that the Asian crisis was, in the first
instance, a case of financial panic: basically, after
enthusiastically putting hundreds of billions of dollars into Asia
in the years before 1997, investors suddenly lost their nerve and
began pulling out all at once, with catastrophic consequences. But
there is a sharp difference of views over what could have prevented
or at least mitigated that crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, one view holds that in times of panic, the
normal rules of business should be suspended _ that investors
should be persuaded, or if necessary forced, to keep their money in
place while the authorities get things under control. In the oddly
euphemistic jargon of international finance, this is known as
``burden-sharing,'' or even more obscurely as ``private sector
involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   The other view holds that the way to deal with panic is to try
to reassure investors that their money is absolutely secure _ and
that one way to do that is to offer an ironclad guarantee that
their holdings of Korean won, or Indonesian rupiah, or Ecuadorian
sucres, will not lose their value in terms of dollars. This can be
done by establishing a ``currency board,'' which holds dollar
reserves large enough to back the entire national money supply; it
can be done even more decisively by ``dollarizing'' _ that is,
abandoning the national currency and using dollars instead.
</P>
<P>
   It is an unresolved debate, because neither approach was given
much of a trial. Hong Kong has a currency board, but was never
itself the object of investor panic _ it just happened to be living
in a bad neighborhood. Malaysia imposed controls on investors, but
only after the worst of the panic was past.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Ecuador comes in. The small Latin American
nation has the dubious distinction of having plunged into crisis
just as Asia climbed out; and as a result it has become a sort of
guinea pig for economic nostrums. It is by no means an ideal choice
as a clinical model. After all, at the beginning of 1997 Asian
economies looked robustly healthy, with their government budgets
balanced or in surplus; their crisis came, as it were, out of a
clear blue sky. Ecuador, by contrast, has always been more or less
a mess; its plunging currency is only the outward sign of an inward
disgrace, of a bankrupt banking system that cannot be rescued by an
equally bankrupt government. But nonetheless, Ecuador is the test
case we have, and its experience is likely to have a
disproportionate effect on how the next big crisis is handled.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the tiny nation has already done much to discredit the
notion of ``private sector involvement.'' Last September, Ecuador
decided, with more or less explicit encouragement from the
International Monetary Fund, to temporarily suspend payment of some
of its foreign debt. The experiment was a failure: while some
investors found their money locked up, others continued to flee
Ecuador, and the economy's tailspin continued.
</P>
<P>
   Now its government has swung to the other extreme, and is trying
to restore confidence in the currency by abolishing it. Observers
say that this could work if it is accompanied by extensive domestic
reform _ which is a bit like the old line that you can kill someone
with witchcraft, if you also give him plenty of arsenic. But if it
works, it will do much to make dollarization likely elsewhere
(Argentina, for example); if it fails, as is much more likely, it
will give dollarization a bad name.
</P>
<P>
   And the outcome matters. Sometime _ almost surely sometime this
decade _ there will be another great financial crisis like the ones
that struck Mexico in 1994 or Asia in 1997. What will we do about
it? Believe it or not, Ecuador may determine the answer.

HIGH COURT ALLOWS ALABAMA TO SEGREGATE HIV-POSITIVE PRISONERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Miss., S.C., N.Y., Minn., Fla., Tenn., N.M., Conn.,
Ill.)   (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday left intact a lower
court's ruling permitting Alabama prisons to segregate hundreds of
HIV-positive inmates and keep them from educational programs and
even from religious services where they might mix with other
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The justices turned down the prisoners' appeal without comment,
in an action that does not set a legal precedent.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates, supported by a coalition made up of public health
organizations and specialists in AIDS treatment, had argued that
the segregation violated federal disability law. They said the law
required individual assessments of each inmate's personality and
medical profile rather than a blanket assumption that all
HIV-positive inmates presented such a danger that there was no
``reasonable accommodation'' that could allow any to participate in
normal prison life.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, those who
pose a ``direct threat to the health and safety of others'' can be
excluded from a program. The law defines ``direct threat'' as ``a
significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be
eliminated by reasonable accommodation'' or by modifying existing
policies.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit by the Alabama inmates was filed in 1985 under an
earlier federal law, the Rehabilitation Act, which also required
assessments of significant risk.
</P>
<P>
   The federal 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, in an 8-3 ruling last
April, concluded that the prison system's policy was justified
because AIDS is fatal, and ``death itself makes the risk
significant.'' The dissenting judges argued that the majority had
essentially adopted a ``no risk'' standard, instead of requiring
the state to demonstrate that a ``significant'' risk could not be
accommodated.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama was the only state prison system to segregate its
HIV-positive inmates when the suit was filed, but Mississippi and
South Carolina have now adopted similar policies. Alabama told the
Supreme Court that it has been notably more successful than states
without segregation policies in preventing the spread of AIDS
within its prisons.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The federal Bureau of Prisons does not use a segregation policy,
generally presuming that HIV-positive inmates can suitably be
housed and placed in programs with other inmates unless there is
evidence to the contrary. Nonetheless, the Clinton administration,
asked by the Supreme Court for its views on the Alabama case, urged
the justices last month not to hear the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said in its brief that while it had doubts
about the breadth of the appeals court's ruling, that judges were
generally correct to defer to prison officials judgments about
their ability ``to control prisoners in various settings and
programs.'' Determinations about specific programs were not
appropriate for Supreme Court review, the brief said, especially in
the absence of a conflict on the issue among the lower federal
courts.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The case, Davis vs. Hopper, No. 98-9663, had challenged the
inmates' exclusion from some 70 programs, including job training,
education and work-release. While the prison offers the
HIV-positive inmates some alternative educational programs, these
were much more limited, the inmates' brief said.

 &HT;    Issue ads getting more airtime although some politicos object
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The presidential campaign is revving into high gear
in Iowa and New Hampshire, and once again the airwaves are
crackling with political ads.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the advertisements are coming from the candidates. A
handful of special interest groups are buying up time to shape the
political debate or attack the contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Three groups with strong ties to the Republican Party have
launched attacks against publisher Steve Forbes and Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.), both of whom are seeking to defeat Texas Gov.
George W. Bush for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who once chaired a nonprofit organization that spent
heavily on political issue advertising, is now pursuing a complaint
with the Federal Election Commission to fight back against the
issue ads running against him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, an architect of campaign finance reform, is using the
ads by Americans for Tax Reform and National Right-to-Life to make
the case for reducing the role of special interest groups in
politics. ``I'm a threat to the iron triangle in Washington,''
McCain proclaimed at a campaign stop last week in Merrimack, N.H.
``That's big money, lobbyists and the legislative process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, meanwhile, which has a history of supporting
Democratic candidates, just completed an attack on Bush's
environmental record in ads running in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of issue advertising complain that it subverts campaign
finance laws because the political parties pay for them with ``soft
money,'' unregulated contributions from unions and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Issue ads run by independent groups are paid for with unreported
contributions that can be tax-exempt for the organization.
</P>
<P>
   This year, analysts say, the first issue ads of the 2000
campaign appear to be continuing the trend set in 1998 when
interest groups and political parties became the source of most of
the negative advertising aired on television. Kathleen Hall
Jamison, director of the Annenberg Center for Social Policy, which
studies issue advocacy, said special interest groups, not the
political parties, have so far been the dominant players.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is less party advertising at this point than one would
have expected,'' Jamison said. And so far, organized labor, a big
player in the 1996 elections, has been silent, reflecting the
belief that grass-roots organizing is more effective. Spokesmen for
the two political parties in Washington said they view issue
advertising as a central role of the parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the responsibility of the party to bring to the fore
issues that the media would ignore,'' said Republican spokesman
Mike Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic spokesman Rick Hess said, ``There is nothing wrong
with telling the truth about someone's record on an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the special interest advertising this year, Jamison
said, is the Sierra Club spot attacking Bush on his environmental
record. Both ads feature an 11-year-old boy with asthma and
essentially accuse Bush of worsening the boy's condition because of
his failure to adopt tough environmental policies. So far, the
Republican National Committee is the only party organization to
wade into the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. The RNC
is running ads in both places that criticize Vice President Al Gore
for suggesting he would select members of the Joint Chiefs of
Staffs based on their acceptance of allowing gays and lesbians to
serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call Al Gore,'' the ad says. ``Tell him the only litmus test
ought to be about patriotism.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad prompted the Human Rights Campaign, a gay and lesbian
advocacy group in Washington, to air a rebuttal spot this week in
Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to refocus the debate on gays in the military
around the issues of equality, fairness and justice,'' said Human
Rights Campaign spokesman David Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the toughest advertising of the year has been targeted
at Forbes and McCain. Forbes is preparing to re-file a complaint
with the FEC over two ads aired in Iowa and New Hampshire by the
Republican Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Leadership Council ad accuses Forbes of
distorting record on taxes. ``Steve Forbes' attack ad
distorts the truth,'' the ad says. ``Our research shows that
Governor Bush signed the largest tax cuts in Texas history.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dal Col, Forbes' campaign manager, called the Leadership
Council a ``Bush front group,'' and accused the organization of
coordinating the ad with Bush's campaign, which would likely be
illegal under FEC guidelines. Mark Miller, the director of the
Washington-based Leadership Council, denied there was any
coordination with the Bush campaign. He also denies that the
Council is a ``front group'' for Bush, although he acknowledged
that a majority of the group's members are supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put 100 Republicans in a room and 70 percent are going to
be supporting Bush,'' said Miller. ``That's why he's winning.''

 WASHINGTON: brief said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were also these developments at the court Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   State Immunity
</P>
<P>
   There was considerable fallout from the court's two rulings last
week on the balance of federal-state authority. The justices dealt
with several cases raising related questions that had backed up
while those two were under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Four were age discrimination cases, like the case from Florida
last week in which the court ruled that states are constitutionally
immune from suit by the employees under the law against age
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, New Mexico, Connecticut and Illinois had all appealed
rulings that had rejected their claims of immunity, and the
justices summarily vacated those rulings while also turning down a
challenge to an immunity decision that Minnesota had won in the
lower court. The court also disposed of several cases under the
Drivers Privacy Protection Act, the law barring states from selling
motorists' personal information, which the justices upheld
unanimously last week.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat less expected was the court's action in vacating the
decisions in two cases applying the Equal Pay Act to the states.
The justices order the two lower courts to study the cases again in
light of last week's ruling in an age discrimination case.
</P>
<P>
   The lower courts in both cases had rejected claims of immunity
that New York and Illinois had raised in defending suits under this
1963 law. In both cases, female professors sued state universities
on the ground that male colleagues in similar positions were being
paid more.
</P>
<P>
   In both State University of New York vs. Anderson, No. 98-1845,
and Illinois State University vs. Varner, No. 98-1117, federal
appeals courts had ruled that in passing the Equal Pay Act,
Congress had acted within its authority to enforce the equal
protection guarantee of the 14th Amendment and overcome the states'
immunity from suit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in Kimel vs. Florida Board of Regents, the court
ruled that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act could not
overcome the states' immunity because age was not a category to
which the Constitution gives special protection. Sex is such a
category, however, with official discrimination on the basis of sex
having been accorded ``heightened judicial scrutiny'' under the
court's precedents. So it appeared that the age discrimination
ruling might not dictate the outcome of the equal pay cases.
</P>
<P>
   However, questions remain because while the 14th Amendment's
equal protection guarantee bars only those official actions that
amount to intentional discrimination, the Equal Pay Act bars pay
differences on the basis of sex without requiring proof of motive.
Following the court's instructions Tuesday, the 2nd Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals, in New York, and the 7th Circuit, in Chicago,
will study this question and decide how these cases fit with last
week's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The court took no action Tuesday on the question of whether
states are immune from suit under the Americans with Disabilities
Act, raised in a pending case from Florida on which the justices
have evidently decided to deliberate further. That case is Florida
vs. Dickson, No. 98-829.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants' Privacy
</P>
<P>
   The court let stand a ruling that New York City cannot bar its
employees from sharing information with federal immigration
officials about the immigration status of foreigners who seek city
services.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute revolved around the interaction of an executive
ordered issued by Mayor Ed Koch in 1989 and the revision of federal
welfare law that Congress passed in 1996. Under the executive
order, a city welfare worker could not reveal that an applicant was
not in the country legally. Under the federal welfare law, state
and local officials are prohibited from restricting the
transmission of such information.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after that provision became law, New York challenged
it in federal court on the ground of state sovereignty. But both
the federal district court, in 1997, and the 2nd Circuit, in a
ruling last May, rejected the city's lawsuit and found that the
federal law preempted the executive order. In its appeal, New York
City vs. United States, No. 99-328, the city argued that Congress
had, in violation of the principles of federalism, ``commandeered
the city's legislative and executive policymaking apparatus.''

 &HT;    Snow forces school schedule adjustments
 &HT;    By T. Scott Batchelor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Tuesday morning snowfall meant fun for Pitt
County students but headaches for the school district's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Officials already had lost 13 class days in the wake of massive
flooding from Hurricane Floyd. Reconfiguring the schedule left only
two days _ Feb. 21 and March 24 _ that can be used to replace days
lost to inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt County Schools decided early Tuesday morning to cancel
classes because of the morning snows. Today's classes are scheduled
to begin two hours after usual start times.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Howard Sosne and the school board now will have
to come up with a plan for packing the proper number of hours of
instruction into the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think he's planning to do is discuss this with the
board and see if they want to use Feb. 21 as a make-up day or
explore options about 1,000 hours or 180 days,'' said schools
spokesman Barry Gaskins.
</P>
<P>
   State law normally requires 1,000 hours and 180 days of
instructional time. But in a nod to shortcomings caused by Floyd,
the state legislature gave school systems the option to provide
either 1,000 hours or 180 days, but not necessarily both.
</P>
<P>
   If that course is taken, school officials would add minutes to
enough days to compensate for the lost class day, Gaskins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That in itself becomes complicated, but it is an option,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Without that option, Saturdays could become school days, said
Gaskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would probably be the last case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials made the decision to delay school for two hours at
5:30 a.m. Tuesday, Gaskins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then conditions got worse real quick,'' he said, prompting a
full shutdown of the system.
</P>
<P>
   While school leaders weighed how to fit the classroom hours, the
Howard family took advantage of the wintry weather and headed for
the snow-covered slopes of the large, earthen bowl at the corner of
Fifth Street and Reade Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Don and Joann Howard watched as their bundled up children,
Ginny, 6, and Lee, 10, both students at Elmhurst Elementary School,
careened down the powdered escarpment on plastic boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get to bring them out here and play, too,'' Joann Howard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ginny launched from the hilltop and bulleted down the slope,
tumbling head over heels at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wiped out,'' her mom yelled after her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, that was fun,'' the little girl shouted back. ``I want to
wipe out again.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee saddled up on his board once more, but he demanded an
audience for his exploits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy, don't take your eyes off me _ watch this,'' and began
the accelerating slide across the compacted flakes to the bottom of
the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the white scenery all around, Don Howard remarked on
the snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is rare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have so much fun,'' his wife said. ``We don't get it so
much to get tired of it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Iowa _ After a bumpy start out of the gate, Vice
President Al Gore is acting once again like the Democratic
front-runner, and his aides say he can afford to.
</P>
<P>
   The surest and most obvious sign is that Gore is telling
audiences that he is going to win the Democratic nomination for
president. When a supporter at a black church yelled out on Monday
night, ``Run, Al, run!'' a revved-up Gore doubled over with
laughter and shouted back: ``I will! I will! I will! And with your
help, I'll win! I'll win! I'll win!''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time that Gore, who has been in a beseeching
posture with voters for months, has made such a claim.
</P>
<P>
   But that was an unusual display. Gore is being careful these
days to contain his enthusiasm, lest he appear overconfident or
give the voters the sense that he expects a coronation.
</P>
<P>
   He has dropped his attacks, though, against his rival for the
nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley, and is determined to give the
television cameras nothing but positive footage for the evening
news. This consists of the vice president beaming in front of
audiences that have been pumped up by the throbbing blasts of Tina
Turner belting out ``You're Simply the Best'' and Gore's upbeat
signature song from the 1992 campaign, Paul Simon's ``You Can Call
Me Al.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is stepping up his attentions to the leading Republican
candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. At rallies Tuesday, Gore
went further than his standard criticism that Bush would squander
the nation's budget surplus on a ``risky tax scheme.'' He said that
Bush would ``raid workers' pensions'' to pay for tax cuts and that
in Texas, the governor is ``waging war'' against organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a week until Iowa begins the nation's voting, the
polls show that Gore has a reason for confidence. Most recently, a
Los Angeles Times survey here put Gore at 58 percent, with 35
percent for Bradley. Internal Gore campaign polls show that Gore
leads Bradley in every category of voter except among those with
higher educations and more wealth. As a result, Bradley is faring
better in the college towns across Iowa, so Gore barnstormed across
these media markets in a bus tour Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that the Democratic race is still neck and neck in
New Hampshire, and a Bradley win there could send a strong message
to other states, like New York, where voters are perceived as more
open to Bradley's candidacy. But top Gore advisers also believe
that it is, as one said, ``mathematically impossible'' for Bradley
to secure enough delegates to win the nomination, and they are
turning their sights increasingly toward the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers said the balance of power here in Iowa shifted to
Gore's favor after last Saturday's debate in Des Moines. That, they
said, is when Gore exposed Bradley as lax on farm issues.
</P>
<P>
   In the few days after that debate, Bradley appeared more
desperate, firing off one-day attacks on Gore _ for his support of
tobacco subsidies and for raising the specter of Willie Horton in
the 1988 presidential campaign. Gore advisers believe these hurt
Bradley more than they hurt Gore because Bradley appeared to be
violating his own assertion that he was a different kind of
politician who would not campaign using old votes and negative
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   A top Gore strategist said the goal is to drum up enthusiasm
among supporters but avoid negative news coverage. ``We want him to
set things on fire but not to self-immolate,'' this adviser said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore has been able to minimize the effects of the negative news
that has occurred, such as his reversal over whether the generals
he would appoint to the Joint Chiefs of Staff would have to support
his policy on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, Gore is loose, light and ``laughing a lot,'' said his
close adviser, Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban
development, who is campaigning with the vice president across the
state. ``He's at the top of his game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of Gore's tactical switch to ignoring Bradley instead of
demonizing him, Cuomo said that Gore has already convinced voters
that he has the experience and more thought-out positions on
issues. ``When you have won the case, you say `Thank you' and sit
down,'' Cuomo told reporters as the Gore campaign motorcade sailed
through a freakily spring-like, sun-drenched afternoon. ``You
continue to make your case, but since they are with you, it takes
on a different style.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of growling about Bradley, Gore is showing a touch of
whimsy. At a small labor gathering in Knoxville, where television
cameras outnumbered voters, Gore told the members of the American
Federation of Government Employees who were endorsing him: ``It
will be easy for me to be in your corner if you put me in an office
without any corners.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign advisers are engaging in a campaign luxury _
lowering the expectations for Gore's showing in the Jan. 24 Iowa
caucuses. They do this by fretting in front of reporters over
Bradley's advantages _ a $1.6-million buy on Iowa television
(compared with $1.1 million for Gore), the perceived motivation of
Bradley's upscale supporters to get to the caucuses, and the
failure of the United Auto Workers union, the backbone of organized
labor in Iowa, to work actively on Gore's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, they are waging a ferocious grab for
precinct captains, motivating them by telling them to act as if
Gore is 5 points behind and must scramble to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   They have shifted into overdrive to identify Gore supporters and
are using mailings to prod them to the caucuses. And they are
flooding the state with surrogates for Gore, most notably members
of the Kennedy dynasty. Trekking to Iowa are Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, Rep. Patrick Kennedy, former Rep. Joe Kennedy, Bobby
Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer in New York, and Kathleen
Kennedy Towson, the lieutenant governor of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand to make Gore's case: the model Christie Brinkley
and Sen. John Kerrey of Massachusetts, who served in Vietnam and is
especially helpful with military veterans.
</P>
<P>
   And the campaign has dotted the countryside with Burma
Shave-like signs, like this series outside Indianola: ``Grandma has
to decide between pills or food/ Putting her in a very foul
mood./Al Gore says to make Grandma happy/Make meds cheap and make
it snappy./Al Gore for President.''

 &HT;    Clinton urges S.C. to pull flag
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ President Clinton added his voice Tuesday to
those opposed to the state of South Carolina flying the Confederate
flag atop its Statehouse, while a state senator refused to
apologize for his reference to the NAACP as ``that corrupt
organization known as the National Association for Retarded
People.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks given to reporters aboard Air Force One as Clinton
flew to Boston, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton
thinks the flag should come down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not saying the Confederate flag . . . doesn't have some
historical meaning to it, but in this case it's wrong,'' Lockhart
said. ``It shouldn't be flown.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, a delegation that included former Gov. John
West met privately Tuesday with Gov. Jim Hodges on the flag issue.
Hodges is expected to address the flag issue during his State of
the State remarks to the Legislature today.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as divisions within the state deepened over the flag,
state Sen. Arthur Ravenel refused Tuesday to apologize to the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a day
after his widely perceived slap at the civil rights group helped
inspire a rally of 46,000 people marching against the Confederate
flag.
</P>
<P>
   Ravenel, 72, a Republican from Mount Pleasant, outside
Charleston, appeared in the Statehouse rotunda and said he was
guilty of a ``rhetorical error'' in his controversial swipe at the
NAACP on Jan. 8. However, he refused to apologize beyond a
back-handed retreat that he had issued a few days later in which
Ravenel, the father of a retarded person, apologized to ``retarded
folks of the world for equating them with the NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravenel read a statement Tuesday seeking to quiet the national
uproar that has given activists on both sides of South Carolina's
flag fight another point to argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediately upon being told of my mistake, I apologized to all
those wonderful people laboring on behalf of the retarded with whom
I've worked for 40 years,'' Ravenel said. ``However, a chorus of
umbrage has arisen from others who choose to believe that my remark
was deliberate and directed at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of good will on either side of the controversy, being
appalled by the uproar, have asked me to help tone down the tenor
of this debate,'' Ravenel said. ``I have agreed. Enough said.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things going on in South Carolina other than the
flag, you know,'' he said afterward. ``So we're all going to cool
it. I am, anyhow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he apologize to the NAACP?'' asked state Sen. Darrell
Jackson (D-Columbia), a leading flag opponent. ``It is unacceptable
to me . . . I don't think he understands that when he insults the
NAACP, he insults our ancestors, our fathers, our mothers, church
leaders, many, many other folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't he get the message that when you are wrong, you say,
I am sorry'?'' Jackson said. ``The longer he waits, the deeper he
gets himself into it. . . . To a man who loves the flag and loves
the history of this state, it seems to me he should realize that
his statements are hurting his cause.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Glenn McConnell (R-Charleston), a leading flag
supporter, said he was satisfied by Ravenel's statement. ``He is
reiterating that he did not mean to say it, that it was a
mistake,'' he said. ``In his opinion, he did not call them
retarded.'' McConnell said civil rights leaders recently have
insulted flag supporters, but have not apologized. He cited a sheet
entitled ``Heritage of Hate,'' which Jackson distributed Tuesday in
the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It quotes the Confederate Constitution and other documents from
the 1860s describing blacks as inferior and calling slavery
important to the South. Civil rights leaders say the Confederate
flag is a racist symbol of slavery, while its supporters say it
honors the Civil War dead.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said Jackson's document ``makes it appear as though
everybody out in the field was fighting over slavery,'' said
McConnell, adding it ``is going to intensify'' the flag fight.
</P>
<P>
   Ravenel's remark had already stepped up the controversy Monday
when demonstrators marched on the Statehouse and demanded that
legislators remove the Confederate flag, the last to fly atop a
state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is in your heart comes out of your mouth,'' said Lorna
Coakley, 40, of Mount Pleasant. She carried a placard aimed at
Ravenel's remark, reading, ``We shall overcome! The Slippery
Tongues!''
</P>
<P>
   She called the remark ``a blatant disrespect for other people,''
and said that she believed it ``backfired'' on Ravenel. ``It
spurred us on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a church rally preceding Monday's march, Nelson B. Rivers
III, the NAACP's national director of field operations, urged
supporters to avoid name-calling.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to Ravenel as ``nameless, faceless, hopeless.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Statehouse, where the Confederate flag flies atop the
dome, Fabia Owens, 38, of Columbia held a poster, reading, ``Vote
out the old, vote in the new. Senator Ravenel must go.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens called Ravenel ``poor quality. He does not need to be
sitting in that seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Etched with Ravenel's caricature, another placard read, ``A mind
is a terrible thing to waste.''

IN POLITICS, THE NIGHTLY MONOLOGUE CAN BE A NIGHTLY NIGHTMARE 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ As the presidential primary and caucus season looms,
late-night television hosts are turning more and more to the
candidates, attacking their foibles and images with such barbed
glee that their shows have become required viewing among nervous
political strategists.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates and their aides can find the nightly monologues
by Jay Leno on NBC's ``The Tonight Show,'' by CBS's David
Letterman, who is recuperating from a bypass operation and expects
to be slinging barbs in about two months, by Conan O'Brien on NBC's
``Late Night,'' Bill Maher on ABC's ``Politically Incorrect,'' Jon
Stewart on Comedy Central's ``Daily Show,'' and on other programs,
at one level, funny, outrageous and obviously distortions of the
truth. At another level, though, the advisers say, the monologues
are playing a crucial, if flawed, role in shaping voters'
perception of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the recent jibes: Gov. George W. Bush of Texas' campaign
slogan is ``governs like a Republican, parties like a Democrat.''
John McCain has such a temper that when asked to name his favorite
philosopher, he replied ``Latrell Sprewell.'' Vice President Al
Gore is so boring that when he painted a self-portrait it was a
still life. And Donald J. Trump just split up with his latest
model-girlfriend because she accidentally started a conversation _
that was not about him.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates are often terrified by the power of the late-night
television hosts to define weaknesses and quirks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their impact is incredible, and it's growing,'' Dan Schnur,
director of communications for the McCain campaign. ``During the
campaign season, you're often cowering at 11:30 _ what are these
guys going to say?''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a campaign like ours, Jay Leno is a lot cheaper than
polling,'' Schnur said. ``They often reflect what voters feel, and
their observations have a tremendous effect on how voters view the
candidates, much more so than the evening news programs. Audiences
watching Tom Brokaw or Dan Rather are wary about what they hear. By
11:30 they're relaxed, the monologues are like casual
conversations. They seep into people's consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Castellanos, a Republican consultant, whose company,
National Media Inc., is buying commercial time for Bush, put it
another way: ``They have the power to create conventional wisdom in
politics; they'll set how a candidate is perceived in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   By every account, former Vice President Dan Quayle never
recovered from the avalanche of jokes about his intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they have a take on you, once they decided what to mock
you for, it essentially becomes permanent and there's almost no way
of undoing it,'' said Mandy Grunwald, a top media adviser to
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's appearance last week on the Letterman show was
partly in response to Letterman's repeated jokes about her move to
New York to run for senator, and his on-air tauntings of her for
not coming on the show.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1992 presidential race, in which Ms. Grunwald was an
adviser to Bill Clinton, the campaign hoped each night that Leno
and Letterman would focus on the benign ``Big Mac'' jokes about the
candidate gorging himself on junk food instead of what she termed
``the other things'' _ Clinton's avoidance of the draft, his sexual
escapades and whether or not he had smoked marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Burnett, executive producer of the Letterman show, insisted
that ``we are completely apolitical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no agenda,'' he said, ``other than do the best we can
do to get a laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that his show and others had an impact. ``I
don't pretend we don't,'' he said, adding, ``We only take what
people understand about a candidate and make fun of it; we don't
really invent anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno said it made no sense to say that he had political power.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't change anybody's mind with comedy,'' he said. ``You
just reinforce what they already believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno said that he and his staff writers started the day with as
many as 500 jokes, all taken from events mentioned on television
news and in newspaper stories. They pare them down to 25 or 30 that
he may use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience has to know what you're talking about or else
you'll be sunk,'' said Leno, who described himself as a political
independent. ``You can't know more than anybody watching. And we've
found that once you get past secretary of state _ and even that's a
stretch _ no one knows what you're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno said that the television audience easily related to
Clinton's marital infidelity. ``Everyone knows someone who's
fooling around,'' he said. ``I can't really make jokes about atomic
weapons. People don't have them, don't know about them, don't want
to think about them. But fooling around by the president _ people
relate to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett said that Bush was emerging as the prime source of jokes
for now because he was a significant candidate and because of the
impression, true or false, that he was a bit of a playboy in
college and grew up with easy privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's now right at the precipice,'' Burnett said. ``If it's a
slow day it'll start to be the premise that people latch on to _
that George Bush may be a boob.''
</P>
<P>
   (Or, as Leno said on his show recently, ``George W. Bush
released his medical records today. It seems during the Vietnam War
he suffered memory loss when he crushed a beer can against his
forehead at a fraternity party.'')
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some of the jokes are much more than mild jabs at missteps and
flaws. Pat Buchanan was treated to first-degree burns in the
hospital, Leno said in one monologue, because he stood too close to
a flaming cross.
</P>
<P>
   It is only in the last decade, especially with the plethora of
competitive late night comedy shows on network television and
cable, that political candidates and elected officials have borne
the brunt of so many jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, like Mrs. Clinton on the Letterman show, have
always sought to use television and the popular media to alter
their images. Richard M. Nixon, in 1968, made a cameo appearance on
NBC's ``Laugh-In'' and uttered the show's trademark line, ``Sock it
to me.'' During his 30 years on ``The Tonight Show,'' until 1992,
Johnny Carson made his share of political jokes and welcomed
numerous candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Among the candidates who have recently appeared on the programs
to show they could laugh along with everyone else were McCain, who
joked about his temper, and Bill Bradley, who joked about his
solemn personality.
</P>
<P>
   But many people in politics are not amused by the programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure Leno or Letterman can move a poll 5 or 6
points,'' said Lorraine Voles, former communications director for
Gore, from 1993-97, ``but part of the cynicism that people may feel
toward politicians can come from these shows.''
</P>
<P>
   But do the jokes always have an impact on the politicians?
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to his impeachment trial, Clinton was
the prime target of the jokes. (In a typical one from the other
night, Letterman said, ``President Clinton says he wants $30
million from Congress for contraception and family planning. Thirty
million dollars from Congress for contraception? It sounds to me
like somebody's going to go dating again.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the continuing barrage of jokes, Clinton's approval
rating went up.

GUN TRADE GROUP PLANS TO BECOME POLITICALLY AND LEGALLY ACTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Feeling pressure from a succession of lawsuits
against gun makers, the trade organization that represents them is
collecting millions of dollars from its members for legal defense
and this week announced plans to support political candidates and
to lobby at all levels of government to fight greater gun
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the National Shooting Sports Foundation,
representing companies that make all manner of outdoor products as
well as firearms, had steered clear of political entanglements over
gun laws and elections, leaving the fight to the National Rifle
Association, an organization of gun owners whose interests can be
vastly different from manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   But in Las Vegas at the foundation's 22nd annual trade show,
Robert Delfay, the foundation president, said his group would join
the NRA in efforts to oppose forces that favor more laws and
regulations as a way to curb violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, we have not been politically active as an
industry,'' Delfay said in a state-of-the industry address Monday
night. ``That must change and will change. This upcoming election
will impact our industry, and we must have an impact on this
election.''
</P>
<P>
   More than symbolic, Delfay's remarks reflected a major shift in
strategy for the 39-year-old foundation, which represents more than
1,700 manufacturers and distributors of everything from camouflage
outfits to telescopic sites to the most elaborate of handguns and
rifles.
</P>
<P>
   To this point, the foundation has concerned itself chiefly with
commercial issues that affect products their members sell, like
regulations governing sales and distribution. By comparison, the
major thrust of the NRA has always been political and most recently
has been to support the enforcement of existing gun laws rather
than the passage of new ones. While the two organizations have many
interests in common, they diverge on some issues, like helping the
federal government track guns and exploring new technologies like
so-called smart guns.
</P>
<P>
   And now, recent lawsuits filed by the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People and more than two dozen
municipalities, the first major assault on gun makers, have forced
the foundation to assert its own political agenda rather than to
rely on the NRA.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As part of a new initiative, many members are contributing 1
percent of their gross sales to help the gun makers defend
themselves in the lawsuits, which are trying to force the companies
to make safer guns. The money has been coming in since the program
was announced at last year's trade show, and in an interview,
Delfay predicted that the donations could reach as much as $10
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The recent threat of a federal lawsuit by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development to force the companies into an
omnibus settlement with the NAACP and municipalities, has spurred
further action by the industry group.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Delfay said, the foundation has formed a
political action committee to influence elections in November.
Efforts are now under way, he said, to gather the names of
customers from member companies to establish an initial list of
500,000 people who would be encouraged to support gun-friendly
candidates for Congress and president, including any Republican who
opposes Vice President Al Gore or former Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In delivering the keynote address Monday night, former Sen. Alan
Simpson, R-Wyo., a gun enthusiast, encouraged industry officials to
get involved in the political process. He was especially critical
of the HUD lawsuit and said, ``You can do something about HUD. Get
yourself a new president, and you get yourself a new HUD.''
</P>
<P>
   He slipped in words of support for two candidates, promising,
``You won't hear any gun-control crap from George Bush and John
McCain, so remember that when you waddle off to the polls, for
God's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an easy sell to gun makers in the audience, for whom the
gun wars have become a growing concern since October 1998, when New
Orleans became the first city to sue. Until then, the gun rights
banner was carried almost exclusively by the NRA, which spends
millions of dollars each year to influence elections at all levels
of government and fight passage of laws that would further restrict
gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, 27 more jurisdictions have sued the gun makers, but
some have combined efforts, leaving 19 actual lawsuits to defend.
Of the four that have come before judges, three _ in Cincinnati,
Miami and Bridgeport, Conn. _ have been dismissed. In a fourth, by
Atlanta, the product liability claim was dismissed but a negligence
claim was allowed to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice is stay the course,'' Douglas Kliever, the
foundation's general counsel, told members of the foundation.
``Above all, do not panic in the face of this litigation. The law
and fundamental fairness are on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   From the NRA's perspective, the new efforts by the shooting
group to exert political pressure can only enhance the power and
influence gun-rights proponents in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time an organization with the potential of the firearms
industry can participate in elections, it is a great assist to
everybody who believes in less gun control and more crime
control,'' said James Jay Baker, the NRA's chief lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that the NRA and the shooting federation might
disagree on some objectives. He described the two groups as a
``family at Thanksgiving dinner'' that might have differences. But,
he said, ``The lawsuits have certainly activated, invigorated and
expanded the industry to look at the political and legislative
landscape. We have noticed increased activity already.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides threatening their business operations, gun makers here
said the lawsuits also have made them a growing target of public
disdain. Many blamed organizations like Handgun Control, Inc., a
nonprofit organization that fights for tighter gun-control laws,
for orchestrating a campaign against them and distorting messages
that stress gun safety and crime prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a security company for cities, states and homes,'' said
Ed Shultz, president of Smith &AMP; Wesson, one of the country's
largest gun makers. ``But we've been demonized.''
</P>
<P>
   For all that, however, Shultz and executives at other gun
companies said business has never been better. They said their
opponents' efforts to pass new laws and file lawsuits have rallied
their customers to buy more guns as a way to demonstrate support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say people are apprehensive about the future of
our industry,'' said Jeffrey Reh, general counsel to Beretta USA.
``Having said that, many times in the past when the fire arms
industry has come under attack, we have not only survived but
flourished. Our sales last year were very strong, and we project
them to be very strong this year, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Reh pointed out that Beretta sells guns to police departments in
cities that are suing the industry, including Chicago, Los Angeles,
San Francisco and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Just how and when comity might arise between the litigants is
unclear. Many company executives here said they do not even know
what a settlement might include. Delfay and other foundation
officials have already held informal meetings with federal and
municipal government officials to discuss a possible resolution.
</P>
<P>
   And, in time, some companies might be grow more anxious to
settle than others _ at least that was the impression conveyed by
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who has monitored the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep in mind,'' Cuomo said in an interview from Iowa, ``there
is no one group. There is a spectrum. Some are more responsible
than others. Some are more political than others. All we want is
for them to design and distribute safer guns. Nobody wants to
outlaw guns. That is not the question.''

 &HT;    Georgia Review's Lindberg dies
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Respected in literary circles for his intellect
and his editing abilities, Stanley W. Lindberg will be remembered
for his dedication to The Georgia Review, which he helped bring to
national prominence as its editor. But those who knew him best say
he will be missed most for the generosity, patience and nurturing
he showered on fiction writers, poets, reviewers and essayists _
anyone who loved literature and reading.
</P>
<P>
   Lindberg, 60, died Tuesday morning at Emory University Hospital
in Atlanta from complications following a lung transplant. He had
suffered with emphysema for a number of years before receiving a
donor lung at Emory in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stan was always so astonishingly welcoming,'' said poet Paul
Zimmer, who served as director of the University of Georgia Press
from 1978 to 1984. ``He was one of the great editors of our time,
and was also a beguiling and endearing man.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindberg's editorial talents were well-known across the country.
In 1999, he received the prestigious Nora Magid/PEN Award for
Editing, adding it to a raft of honors that included being the
first recipient of the Georgia Governor's Award in the Humanities,
a special award for continuing general excellence from the Georgia
Magazine Association and editing awards from the Coordinating
Council of Literary Magazines and the National Endowment for the
Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for people like Stan, literary writing would go
down the tubes,'' said Robley Wilson, editor of The North American
Review. ``The Georgia Review is one of a few magazines that keep a
light in the window for good writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Lindberg's leadership, The Georgia Review's appeal
broadened to include articles on natural history, politics and
social science, and its circulation grew to more than 6,000. It won
a National Magazine Award in 1986 and has been a finalist in
various categories in other years. In its pages can be found both
well-known and little-known writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stan paid no attention to names at all; it was the quality of
the work, period,'' said Oconee County, Ga., writer Philip Lee
Williams. ``That's the reason all of us who've been reading the
Review for years loved Stan. He was not only fair, he never
deviated from his standards for anybody. This not only made the
best writers write better, it gave hope to those trying to break
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is on the board of directors of the Stanley Lindberg
Award, created last year to celebrate those who contribute to
Georgia's literary culture. Athens writer Terry Kay, another board
member, said that in losing Lindberg, ``we've lost a giant. He had
tremendous passion for the written word.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Corey, associate editor of the Review, worked with
Lindberg for 17 years. He recalls Lindberg's clear vision of the
kind of writing he wanted: It had to be excellent and enduring, and
it had to be readable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could drop a copy of The Georgia Review on a chair in an
airport,'' Corey said, ``and somebody could pick it up _ an English
professor or a banker _ and it would be likely that person could
start reading a short story or an essay and be caught up by it. The
magazine has a high retention rate with subscribers. Once someone
reads it, they like what they read and keep on.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Warren, Pa., Lindberg graduated magna cum laude from
Dickinson College in 1961, then served in Germany with the U.S.
Army for two years. He earned a Ph.D. in English from the
University of Pennsylvania in 1969, then taught at Ohio University,
where he co-founded The Ohio Review.
</P>
<P>
   He moved with his wife, Jeanne, and children Eric, Kristin and
Carl to Georgia in 1977 to edit the Review and join the English
department. He originated and coordinated The Georgia Review's
visiting lecturer series, bringing to campus speakers such as
Robert Bly, Robert Penn Warren, Sally Fitzgerald and Rita Dove.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the 1985 UGA Bicentennial, Lindberg conceived and
planned the ``Roots in Georgia'' conference, which drew 17 Georgia
writers to campus to discuss their works. Lindberg said once that
the conference was a warm-up for another event that proved a
literary triumph: assembling the living Nobel Laureates in
Literature as part of the 1996 Cultural Olympiad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very time-consuming, but I think he loved working on
it,'' said Leslie Gordon, humanities co-ordinator for the Cultural
Olympiad. ``A spirit like Stan's ... it just doesn't die, the
people whose lives he touched, the writers he helped.''
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service is scheduled for 2 p.m. Saturday in the UGA
chapel. Among those speaking will be Athens writer Jim Kilgo, who
struggled Tuesday to articulate his grief. ``Stan had a generosity
of mind and spirit that I was a recipient of,'' Kilgo said. ``I
benefited from all of his gifts as an editor, but it was his gifts
as a man that truly enriched me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the next editor will have the same high standards.''
</P>
<P>

BUSH, McCAIN TRADE JABS ON TAX STANDS 
 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSFIELD, N.H. _ In increasingly strident attacks on each
other's tax stands, GOP presidential rivals George W. Bush and John
McCain traded charges Tuesday that McCain would raise taxes on
average workers and Bush would tax the emerging Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   With both men offering New Hampshire voters tax-cut promises in
the final weeks before the Feb. 1 primary, Bush and McCain have
grown sharper in their efforts to undermine each other's
credibility as a tax cutter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said McCain's plan to end write-offs for corporations that
offer benefits such as continuing education would effectively
increase taxes by passing the cost on to employees.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, meanwhile, sought to turn the tables on Bush by pledging
to support a permanent ban on Internet taxes and challenging the
Texas governor to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks at a Nashua Chamber of Commerce breakfast, it was
McCain's turn to talk tough on taxes as he brandished a pen to sign
a ``no Internet taxes'' pledge crafted by the New Hampshire
Citizens for a Sound Economy, a conservative fiscal watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would not support taxes on Internet sales, ``not
now, not soon, never.'' And he added, ``I challenge all of the
candidates, including Governor Bush, to take the same pledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator was tougher on his chief presidential rival
in a written statement handed to reporters during his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``By refusing to sign this pledge and rule out taxing the
Internet, Governor Bush is endorsing a tax increase that could
total over $160 billion by 2003,'' McCain stated.
</P>
<P>
   To back up those figures, the McCain campaign cited research by
a Cambridge, Mass., research firm, Forrester Research, which
calculated that sales on the Internet would total $3.2 trillion by
2003. Applying a sales tax rate of five percent to those sales
would amount to $160 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Three other GOP candidates _ Steve Forbes, Orrin Hatch and Gary
Bauer _ have signed the pledge, said CSE state director Richard
Killian.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he favors extending a moratorium on Internet taxes,
but that he would not rule out such taxes in the future. Many
states fear their sales tax revenue base could be eroded by
Internet shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure I understand what the world looks like
three to four years from now before I speak further,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made it clear that I'm for extending the moratorium on
Internet taxes. Senator McCain needs to explain his tax cut plan to
the people, why raising taxes to the tune of $40 billion on
employer-related benefits is a tax cut,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush claims that by ending certain corporate write-offs on
employee benefits, McCain would cause the benefits either to be cut
off or the taxes on the benefits to be passed on to the employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you abolish employer-related benefits to pay for a tax cut,
it means working people are going to have to pay those benefits,''
Bush said. ``Either you get rid of the benefits by taxing them, or
you say that companies can't deduct them, in which case the
benefits will go away. I don't believe he (McCain) can have it both
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said McCain has claimed the benefits portion of his plan
will cost corporations $40 billion. When reporters told Bush that
McCain's campaign said the cost was actually $4 billion, Bush
declared: ``Then his plan doesn't add up.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Bush is mischaracterizing his plan.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Spitzer, an Arizona state senator, tax lawyer and architect
of the McCain plan, said the idea is to end the deductions
employers can now take on tax-exempt benefits they give their
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does nothing to the employees,'' said Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, McCain has proposed cutting taxes by $237 billion over
five years. He has said it is irresponsible to cut taxes further
until the financial future of Social Security and Medicare are
taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan would deliver a five-year, $483 billion tax cut. He
says the only way to be certain that projected budget surpluses are
not spent by the federal government is to refund most of the money
to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to groups of New Hampshire voters, Bush also subtly
attacked McCain for having one tax proposal in June and then coming
out with another last week. Bush said the plan he laid out in early
December has remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my plan today. This will be my plan next fall if I'm
the nominee of the Republican Party,'' Bush said. ``I can take the
heat.''

<P>
   MOZDOK, Russia _ Russian soldiers battled their way toward the
center of Grozny on Tuesday as the struggle for control of
Chechnya's capital entered an even fiercer phase.
</P>
<P>
   After a thunderous bombardment, Russian troops began moving
through Grozny's streets at dawn. It was the most intense ground
attack on the capital of the rebellious province of Chechnya in
nearly four months of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces moved from the north, the east and the west in an
effort to fracture the rebel defenses and seize the heart of the
city. At times, Russian and rebel forces were within shouting range
of each other, just dozens of yards apart, according to Russian
television reports. Hurling epithets, the opponents fired at each
other at short range.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Russian commanders insisted that they had not set a
deadline for recapturing Grozny, but some officers talked of taking
back the city in three or four days. There appeared to be general
agreement that the aim was to take Grozny before the presidential
election in Russia, scheduled for March 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the eve of the decisive storm of Grozny,'' said
Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov, the commander of Russia's Interior Ministry
troops, many of whom were fighting inside the capital.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way to verify the Russian claims of success. The
Russian military kept most reporters well away from Grozny
fighting. And the militants, who have been fighting from basements
and fortifications in the ruined capital, insisted they were
putting up fierce resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Also unknown was the fate of Grozny's civilians. As many as
40,000 civilians are believed to be still trapped in the city and
to have taken refuge in cellars, often without food, water or
medicine. Russian soldiers said they were trying to silence snipers
by blasting apartment buildings and houses in which they were
hiding, a tactic that increases the risk of civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the escalating fighting, a group a soldiers' mothers
sent an open letter to Acting President Vladimir Putin, warning
that the air and ground assaults were claiming many innocent
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military actions launched by the state's military
authorities in Chechnya are not helping to solve the conflict, and
are using methods outlawed by the Geneva convention of 1949 and
1977,'' the Union of Committees of Soldiers' Mothers said,
referring to the international accords intended to protect the
rights of civilians during war.
</P>
<P>
   In mounting its offensive, Russia's commanders are trying to
regain the initiative after a week of stalemate. Grozny was not the
only scene of bitter fighting. Russian troops and the militants
were also engaged in fierce skirmishes in the Argun Gorge, the
mountain ravine that connects the Chechen lowlands with Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But Grozny was the main focus on Tuesday. Massive artillery and
air strikes, many carried out by Russian planes from the military
base here, just a few miles northwest of Chechnya, pulverized
apartment buildings and set some homes on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Then the ground attack began as Russian troops moved into Grozny
from the Staraya Sunzha region just north of the city. At the same
time, another group of troops entered the city from the Khankala
district east of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials asserted that the forces had taken
some key objectives, including a bridge over the Sunzha River that
the rebels had used to supply their forces and to communicate with
their disparate forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian troops made their way toward the center of Grozny at
Minutka Square. Bislan Gantamirov, the leader of a Chechen
paramilitary group allied with Moscow, was reported to have twice
reached areas close to the city center before being forced to
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time since the beginning of the second Chechen
campaign, our troops are in direct contact with the enemy,'' the
ORT television network observed.
</P>
<P>
   Aslanbek Ismailov, a deputy commander in chief of the rebels,
told Russian news organizations that the rebels intended to stand
their ground and would not abandon the city.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear, however, how many rebels still occupy Grozny.
The militants have made numerous attempts to break the Russian
blockade of the city, and they have also had their share of
casualties. Russian officers say the rebel force ranges from 500 to
several thousand.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the ranks of the militants have been reduced, as Russian
officers and Gantamirov's fighters suggest, it is far from clear
that the Russian military can subdue Grozny in a matter of days.
The militants are mobile, familiar with Grozny's streets, fight
well and make extensive use of snipers.
</P>
<P>
   Even a Russian breakthrough in Grozny would not signal a quick
end to the war. The Russians captured Grozny in the last war only
to have the militants take it back in a surprise counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   Further, there is still a sizable rebel force in Chechnya's
southern highlands. The militants have also shown their ability to
carry out raids and sabotage in the Russian rear areas. Militants
were fighting in Argun and Shali a little more than a week ago, two
cities in the lowlands that the Russians thought they had secured.

 &HT;    Winter storm stretches along Eastern seaboard
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt and Gary Hendricks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOCKSVILLE, N.C. _ Icy roads made traveling dangerous for the
second night in a row in North Carolina, which suffered the
Southern brunt of a winter storm that pushed temperatures to below
zero in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is black ice and fog, ``said Tammy Burch, a cashier at
Horn's Auto/Truck Plaza just off I-40 near Mocksville, N.C.,
between Winston-Salem and Statesville. ``They are telling people
not to go out if they don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Trucker Steven Slatton, 43, said he counted 28 cars stuck on the
sides of the road during the three hours that it took him to travel
from Franklinton near Raleigh to Mocksville.
</P>
<P>
   The South was expected to begin warming back up today, but
below-freezing temperatures were expected to linger in the
Northeast most of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Flight cancellations and delays caused by the storm from Maine
to South Carolina forced delays at Hartsfield International Airport
in Atlanta early Tuesday, but operations were back almost to normal
in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Some delays of about 15 to 20 minutes persisted throughout the
day for flights coming into Hartsfield because of poor visibility
in Atlanta, according to Hartsfield officials. But as the weather
cleared, the delays dissipated, the airport said.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden storm dumped more than 6 inches of snow in the
Piedmont area of North Carolina, where many schools and businesses
were closed Tuesday. It surprisingly spared the western mountains,
which usually get the heaviest snowfalls.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-year-old girl who apparently got lost while playing with
friends in the snow Monday afternoon in a rural area south of
Chapel Hill was found alive but suffering from hypothermia about 10
a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got a fight ahead of her, and we all need to be praying
for her,'' said Chatham County sheriff's Lt. Charles Blackwood, who
coordinated the search.
</P>
<P>
   The first major winter storm to reach the South this season
pushed out to sea off the South Carolina coast by Tuesday afternoon
but left lingering misery in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   A Tuesday morning low of 38 below zero was reported at Enosburg
Falls, Vt. A low of minus 2 was reported as far south as Danbury,
Conn. New York City had gusty winds and temperatures in the teens.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, nearly 7,000 people stayed in homeless shelters
Tuesday, and two men described as homeless were found dead. One was
found on a loading dock Monday, when the temperature was 19 with a
wind chill of minus 16. The medical examiner said Tuesday he
apparently had died of exposure. The second man was found dead in
the backseat of a car he had apparently crawled into. An autopsy
was to be performed today.
</P>
<P>
   For the eastern seaboard, the drop in temperatures was dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The high at Baltimore-Washington International airport on Sunday
had been 59. On Monday, the temperature got no higher than 29.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Steinbrenner always has been reluctant to
invest long-term contracts in young Yankees players, but Derek
Jeter is a very special player and he is getting very special
treatment. The 25-year-old shortstop and the Yankees are close to
completing a seven-year, $118.5 million deal, which would be the
richest in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations could culminate within the next week in a
face-to-face meeting between Jeter and the Yankees owner, according
to a person familiar with Jeter's contract discussions. The Yankees
also are on the verge of finalizing a three-year, $25.5 million
deal with the pitcher Andy Pettitte, who, like Jeter, is eligible
for arbitration; the Yankees and other clubs exchanged proposals
with their arbitration-eligible players Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter's representative and the Yankees are still negotiating the
construction of the shortstop's signing bonus, but if the final
numbers are close to the $118.5 million proposal, then Jeter's
average annual salary would be about $17 million per season.
Jeter's agent, Casey Close, declined to comment, as did Brian
Cashman, the Yankees' general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, a pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers, currently is
the highest paid player, after signing a seven-year, $105 million
contract in December 1998, for an average of $15 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has played just four full seasons, Jeter already is
considered one of the game's best players, and his achievements at
the outset of his career surpass those of some of the greatest
players ever. He accumulated 795 hits in his first four seasons,
more than Ty Cobb, Henry Aaron or Stan Musial, who are all in
baseball's Hall of Fame. Jeter has a lifetime average of .318, and
has scored 486 runs. The Yankees will seek their third consecutive
title this summer, their fourth championship in five years, and
manager Joe Torre has said repeatedly he believes Jeter would be
the Yankees' leader for years to come, inheriting the pre-eminence
that once belonged to Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter also possesses star quality, naturally thrives in the
spotlight, has good looks, outward confidence and a gracious manner
that has made him an idol among teen-age girls (teammates tease him
about the high-pitched screams that emanate from the stands when
Jeter's name is announced before each at-bats). It was as if Jeter
was made to play in New York and for the Yankees, teammate David
Cone said once.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Jeter's childhood dream was to play shortstop for the
Yankees, and nothing's changed that. But he is eligible for free
agency after the 2001 season, and Steinbrenner has never given his
young stars long-term contracts _ not Don Mattingly, not Dave
Righetti, not Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But Steinbrenner always has subscribed to the theory that you
succeed with superstars, in the American League standings and at
the box office, and retaining Jeter for the next seven years _ at a
high but fixed rate _ is a move that many baseball executives
believe is overdue. Steinbrenner waited for years to sign Williams
to a long-term deal, and when he finally gave in and gave Williams
an $87.5 million deal in November 1998, industry experts estimated
the delay cost the Yankees about $30 million. By the time Jeter's
proposed contract would expire, after the 2007 season, he might be
a veritable bargain, based on his salary.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Jeter's deal is completed, he probably won't have the
largest contract in baseball for long, for the Seattle center
fielder Ken Griffey, Jr. and the shortstop Alex Rodriguez are
expected to seek deals in the range of $150 million later this
year. Kevin Garnett of basketball's Minnesota Timberwolves still
has the largest contract in the history of team sports _ a
six-year, $126 million deal. Michael Jordan made the highest
single-year salary, $33 million while playing for the Chicago Bulls
during the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees would forgo the arbitration process with Jeter and
Pettitte by agreeing to long-term deals, but they may face a
hearing with the closer Mariano Rivera and one-year settlements
with relievers Ramiro Mendoza and Jason Grimsley and the catcher
Jorge Posada and the reliever Jason Grimsley.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera asked for $9.25 million, while the Yankees' submission is
$7.2 million, a huge gap that could lead to arbitration. Mendoza
asked for $1.7 million, while the Yankees offered $1.1 million;
Posada is seeking $1.6 million, and the Yankees submitted a figure
of $1.1 million; Grimsley asked for $900,000, the Yankees offered
$650,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter asked for $10.5 million, a record request, even though
some in the Yankees' organization, which offered $9.5 million,
thought he might ask for more. But it figures that Jeter's
negotiations will be resolved long before the arbitration hearings
would begin in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are in the process of trying to arrange a
face-to-face meeting between Jeter and Steinbrenner, which usually
would be a simple matter. Jeter bought a house in Tampa, Fla., to
facilitate daily workouts in the off-season at the Yankees'
complex, where Steinbrenner appears frequently.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeter is scheduled to attend the wedding of teammate Jorge
Posada in Puerto Rico Friday, and if Jeter can't speak to
Steinbrenner Wednesday or Thursday, then the two could get together
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte, 27, submitted an arbitration request of $8.45 million,
and the Yankees offered $6.5 million, but the three-deal deal
appears imminent. Pettitte, who could become a free agent after the
2000 season, pitched terribly in the first half of last season and
was on the trading block, and the Yankees arranged a deal with the
Philadelphia Phillies for three prospects. But Torre and Cashman
convinced Steinbrenner to keep Pettitte, who then went on to win
seven of his last 10 decisions and pitch effectively in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte is 81-46 in five seasons in the majors, and by signing
the left-hander, the Yankees would have some long-term stability in
their rotation. David Cone will again be eligible for free agency
after next year, as will Roger Clemens _ assuming that Steinbrenner
doesn't have an understanding to extend Clemens' current contract,
as many baseball executives believe. Orlando Hernandez, the
Yankees' best pitcher in the last two postseasons, has two years
remaining on his current four-year contract, at a rate of $1.85
million per season.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his new contract, Pettitte is expected to receive
salaries of $6 million, $6 million and $8.5 million for each of the
next three seasons, respectively, as well as signing bonuses. The
Yankees also will hold an $11.5 million option for the 2004 season,
with a $2.5 million buyout.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' payroll will surpass $90 million for the upcoming
season _ the largest in history _ but Steinbrenner, who hates the
suggestion that the Yankees' success is merely the product of high
spending, has been adamant in internal meetings to keep the payroll
under $100 million. The Yankees' recent trades of the pitcher
Hideki Irabu and the outfielder Chad Curtis likely will keep the
team below that level.

ENTREMED TO FUND HOSPITAL CHAIR IN JUVENILE HEART DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The company that's developing the experimental cancer
drug Endostatin says it will fund a Children's Hospital scientist
who has suggested that Endostatin has promise as a new kind of
weapon against heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   EntreMed Inc., of Rockville, Md., said Tuesday the two-year pact
provides an undisclosed amount of funding to Dr. Karen Moulton.
</P>
<P>
   She is a colleague of Dr. Judah Folkman, a Children's Hospital
researcher in whose laboratory Endostatin was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   EntreMed stock closed Tuesday at 41 3/8, up 7 5/8 on the Nasdaq
Stock Market, on news of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Endostatin is a natural angiogenesis inhibitor found in the
body. Because it blocks the formation of new blood vessels that a
tumor needs to grow, it is being tested in human volunteers as a
new way of treating cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Endostatin's potential for treating heart disease emerged last
year, when Moulton showed in mouse studies that atherosclerotic
plaques that form in arteries need a blood supply in order to grow
_ and that Endostatin, by blocking these small blood vessels, can
halt the growth of plaques.
</P>
<P>
   Plaques, consisting of fats and connective tissue, can
dangerously narrow arteries and restrict blood flow. Plaques can
also rupture, triggering a heart attack or stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work in this agreeement is still quite basic,'' Moulton
said.
</P>
<P>
   It will focus on understanding how the network of new blood
vessels develops in plaques and what factors in the body result in
their growth or destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Moulton spoke Tuesday from Snowmass, Colo., where she was
describing her work to a meeting of cardiologists.
</P>
<P>
   Among other possible applications, she said, cardiologists are
interested in Endostatin as a potential tool to prevent plaques
from reforming _ called restenosis _ after a heart artery has been
cleared with balloon angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Dr. John Holaday, president, chairman,
and chief executive of EntreMed, said the new agreeement
``reinforces our longstanding collaboration with Children's
Hospital, Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   EntreMed has provided about $16 million since 1994 to Children's
Hospital to support the work of Folkman's large Surgical Research
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years, Folkman has been pioneering research
which has revealed the key role of angiogenesis in nourishing
tumors.
</P>
<P>
   He has also discovered a number of angiogenesis inhibitors that
are in early stages of human testing for use in anticancer
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman holds no stock in EntreMed and receives no direct pay
from the company, an EntreMed spokeswoman said.

INCOME GAPS LARGE IN NEW ENGLAND, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY BOSTON GLOBE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a nation where the gap between rich and poor keeps widening
nine years into a sparkling economic expansion, New England's six
states show some of the country's widest and narrowest income gaps,
according to a new report.
</P>
<P>
   In Rhode Island, the poorest fifth of families saw their income
decrease 22 percent since 1988, while the wealthiest fifth saw
their incomes increase 28 percent _ making the Rhode Island income
gap the fastest-growing of any state's.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Maine, the poorest fifth of families saw a 2
percent dip in income, and the richest fifth had a 5 percent
increase _ making Maine one of only four states where both top and
bottom incomes barely changed.
</P>
<P>
   The study, released Tuesday by two Washington nonprofits, paints
the picture of a nation where prosperity has nudged the rich and
poor into ever more distant worlds. In the late 1970s, there was no
state in the union where the income of the richest fifth was more
than 9.5 times the income of the bottom fifth _ now, that ``top-to
bottom ratio'' is higher than 9.5 in 24 states, and continues to
rise in all but three, according to the Economic Policy Institute
and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Both Connecticut and Rhode Island have seen their income
distributions widen during the 1990s, while Vermont and Maine both
show very little change in the disparity between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   During a period of dramatic technological change _ which tends
to separate winners and losers economically _ neither distinction
is entirely good news, said analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the middle of a technological revolution, and the way
that markets function is they create more inequality,'' said
Leonard Lardaro, an economics professor at the University of Rhode
Island. ``In an ideal situation, the disparity expands and then
hopefully the bottom pulls up.''
</P>
<P>
   But the authors of the study say the bottom isn't pulling up
fast enough _ especially for displaced manufacturing workers, who
are finding themselves stuck in lower-paying service sector jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1988 and 1999, Rhode Island lost 30 percent of its
manufacturing jobs, which earned an average of $34,000 a year, said
Nancy Gewirtz, director of the Poverty Center at Rhode Island
College. The service jobs that have contributed to Rhode Island's
record low unemployment rate earn, on average, $26,000, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of Rhode Island families saw their incomes decline
over that period, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've built enormous malls that provided decent jobs for
construction workers, and now what's left?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts blamed Rhode Island policymakers for relying too
heavily on the tourism industry to replace manufacturing, rather
than working to attract hi-tech firms, as Massachusetts did.
Massachusetts was among 15 states where the rich got richer and the
poor got poorer, but the gap is less dramatic than Rhode Island's _
the top fifth saw an increase in income of 18 percent, while the
bottom saw a decrease of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The news came in very differently in Maine, the state with the
7th lowest income ratio between the richest and poorest families in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems that dog Rhode Islanders loom equally in Maine,
which began losing shoe manufacturing jobs in the 1970s, then lost
textile manufacturing jobs in the 1980s, and is just beginning to
see paper manufacturing jobs decline, said Christopher St. John,
executive director of the Maine Center for Economic Policy.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, St. John said, could be simply that the
technological revolution _ with the skyrocketing salaries that
accompany booms _ has not quite hit Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started from a base of much greater poverty, with a much
more compact income distribution, but we're headed in that
direction, of very rapid service sector growth,'' he said. ``To a
certain extent, you could say the Rhode Island and Massachusetts
economies are more modern.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Economic
Policy Institute, which prepared the report using census data, are
non-profit groups which research policy that affects low- and
moderate-income people. Part of the goal of the study was to call
attention to the fact that ``manufacturing jobs, blue-collar jobs
that pay good benefits and what we would consider to be good wages
_ these jobs are being outsourced to overseas companies, and a lot
of these people are moving into the service sector,'' said Brian
Lustig, a spokesman for the Economic Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   State-by-state analysis showed that the average income of
families in the top 20 percent of income distribution was $137,500
_ more than 10 times as large as the average income of the poorest
20 percent, who earned $13,000.

PATRIOTS READY TO PAY TO GET BELICHICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Belichick is clearly the man the Patriots want;
that was confirmed by sources among the 31 NFL owners who gathered
here Tuesday to approve Robert ``Woody'' Johnson as the new owner
of the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   If they must, the Patriots will pay compensation, because they
believe Belichick is the best candidate to run their organization,
but they will fight that as much as they can.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Belichick went before Tagliabue to plead his case for
being allowed to negotiate with other teams; Belichick resigned as
Jets coach and says he is no longer contractually bound to them.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue, who attended one hour of the seven-hour grievance
hearing, said Tuesday he would pore through the briefs of the
hearing, then render a decision late this week.
</P>
<P>
   While Kraft dodged the Belichick subject in repeated questioning
by the media, Tagliabue did say, ``He just asked me this morning,
when we had the Finance Committee meeting, what was my timetable. I
told him what I had indicated to you earlier today.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first official acknowledgement that the Patriots were
after Belichick and waiting for a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue appears to want to get the issue resolved before Super
Bowl week, and Kraft also feels the sooner the better. The Patriots
have interviewed other candidates, but Kraft said they would ``wait
and see'' about interviewing more.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots kept an eye on the compensation situation involving
Marty Schottenheimer, who is still under contract to the Kansas
City Chiefs but was being considered by the Green Bay Packers. The
Chiefs originally asked for first-, second-, and third-round
choices before agreeing to one second-rounder. As it turned out,
Schottenheimer didn't take the job, and the Packers hired Seattle
offensive coordinator Mike Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, meanwhile, was approved by a unanimous vote of the
other owners, 29-0 (Atlanta and St. Louis were not present for the
vote).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have a great new owner here,'' said Kraft. ``He's
a passionate fan who wants to continue the tradition of the Hess
family and bring a champion here. It's great to see someone who's a
fan like he is own the team. He's so enthusiastic. I think it's
great for the fans of this region.''
</P>
<P>
   When the subject slid back to Belichick, Kraft said, ``I try to
talk about things I know a little bit about. I'm not qualified to
speak on it. I'll let the commissioner be our spokesman on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would get the sides together to hash something
out, Tagliabue said, ``I don't currently plan to do that. My
current thinking would be to try and resolve the Belichick
arbitration by the end of the week. I don't expect to get to it
until tomorrow, but certainly by the end of the week I will expect
to get a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's attorney, Jeffrey Kessler, argued that the Jets
never offered Belichick the proper title per his contract.
Kessler's interpretation is that Belichick was supposed to become
coach and director of football operations. The higher title now
belongs to Bill Parcells. Because of that, Kessler believes, the
contract should be void and Belichick should be free to go anywhere
he'd like, free of compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots favor this interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is now trying to persuade Parcells to stay aboard as
Jets coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have Bill Parcells coach another year, no
question,'' said Johnson, the heir to the Johnson &AMP; Johnson empire.
``He is a great coach. He has got two Super Bowls on his lawn, and
that says it all.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had an idea which way Parcells was leaning,
Johnson said, ``Have you met Parcells? So you know the answer to
that. He is not a guy . . . if he doesn't want you to know, you
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did announce that Steve Gutman was remaining with the
Jets as president, and that Parcells thinks highly of Al Groh, who
would be Parcells's hand-picked candidate for head coach should he
not return.
</P>
<P>
   But the hiring of a coach may not happen so swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess not,'' said Johnson. ``It's a critical time of
the year. To go through the landscape of coaching will take more
than 24 hours. We owe it to the fans to explore all options. We
really do. It's hard to find good coaches. There's only a handful
of choices. You have to make sure you make the right decision. He
has a very high opinion of Al Groh, there's no question.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson denied that he had offered Parcells up to $5 million to
stay as coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember making such an offer,'' said Johnson, who
said he spoke to Parcells for three hours last Friday and also had
a long conversation with him last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not the easiest person to read,'' said Johnson. ``In
fact, he's very difficult to read. He is a very unusual man and one
that has brought a life to this team, and we haven't had that for a
while.''

DRUG ROADBLOCKS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, COURT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' highest court says roadblocks set up for
the sole purpose of snaring suspected drug dealers are
unconstitutional, saying they violate state protections against
unreasonable searches and seizures.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching its decision, the Supreme Judicial Court rejected a
government argument that intercepting illegal drugs outweighs any
invasion of privacy posed by a roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the court reaffirmed the legality of
roadblocks to check for drunk drivers, stressing that they, unlike
drug dealers, pose an immediate danger to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absent an emergency or imminent threat to the lives and safety
of the public, roadblocks to interdict contraband,'' including
drugs, guns, pornography and other unlawful items, violate
constitutional protections against unwarranted searches and
seizures, said Justice Ruth Abrams, writing for the court in its
15-page opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians praised the ruling Tuesday, which they said
protects citizens from government abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A police state can set up roadblocks,'' said William Newman,
director of the western regional office of the American Civil
Liberties Union, which wrote a friend-of-the-court brief opposing
drug roadblocks. ``A democracy is not supposed to set up a
roadblock, seize citizens, and subject them to inspection and
interrogation unless there is an appropriate reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling stems from what is believed to be the state's first
roadblock set up specifically to catch drug traffickers. Driving
down a one-way residential street in Holyoke in November 1997,
Hector Rodriguez was caught in a ``drug interdiction'' roadblock
organized by the Holyoke police department, State Police and the
local district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 58 drivers pulled over, only Rodriguez was arrested on a
narcotics charge: possession of the butt ends of two marijuana
cigarettes, which were found in his car by drug-sniffing dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez later sought to suppress the marijuana evidence,
arguing that the roadblock violated his constitutional right to be
free from arbitrary interference by police. A District Court judge
ruled in Rodriguez's favor, but the Hampden County District
Attorney's office appealed to the state Appeals Court. The SJC
chose independently to review the case.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the high court noted that the US Supreme Court
has allowed ``blanket suspicionless searches'' in cases where ``the
risk to public safety is substantial and real,'' such as at
airports and courthouses.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1985, the SJC ruled that sobriety roadblocks, in which
cars are randomly stopped and checked to screen for drunk drivers,
are necessary to reduce the ``carnage'' caused by drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that ``(t)he drug problem in the United
States is certainly grave,'' the court concluded that drug
roadblocks do not achieve an immediate enough effect to warrant
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike (sobriety) roadblocks, narcotics interdiction
roadblocks do not provide immediate protection to the public using
the roadways,'' the court wrote. ``Although apprehending narcotics
traffickers may have an eventual impact on the public safety, that
impact will necessarily be more remote and tenuous than the impact
of removing impaired drivers from the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The SJC noted Article 14 of the state constitution, which
prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, was written in
response to British authorities conducting blanket searches of
colonists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viewed in light of the Commonwealth's history, it is clear
that the Holyoke roadblock is precisely the type of search that the
drafters of article 14 sought to prevent,'' the court wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Holyoke is believed to be the first community in the state to
have set up a roadblock to screen for suspected drug dealers. In
the early 1990s, the city of Lawrence set up police checkpoints in
an effort to crack down on illegal drug activity, but did not
require motorists to stop or submit to searches. Instead, police
recorded registration numbers of passing cars.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of such roadblocks, said Newman of the ACLU, ``is
that people could be stopped for anything. The same analysis that
the Commonwealth used to justify this to could be used to justify
stops for parents who are behind in child support, people carrying
pornography, immigrants.''

MCCAIN CALLS ON BUSH AGREE TO E-TAX BAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Back on Jan. 4, Arizona Senator John S. McCain's
``message of the day'' was his vehement opposition to taxes on
on-line shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say No to Internet Taxes,'' read a press release. ``The
greatest economic engine of our time is in danger. Politicians
across the country are trying to figure out a way to tax the
Internet. . . . stop the government from using the Internet as just
another excuse to raid your pocket and your pocketbook.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was not very good at staying on message that day.
Speaking to workers at Providian Financial, a credit card and
financial services company in Concord, he barrelled distractedly
through his prepared text on the subject, losing his place at one
point before charging on to other topics. At his next appearance
that same day, he almost forgot to mention Internet taxes at all,
though he had worked hard on the matter in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But now McCain is in the throes of a bloody game of dueling tax
plans with Texas Governor George W. Bush, his chief rival for the
Republican nomination, and the issue of Internet taxation has taken
on a new urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush will not commit to a permanent ban on the taxes,
McCain has been able to turn the tables and characterize the Texas
governor as insufficiently dedicated to Republican orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   And so Tuesday, McCain challenged Bush to sign an ``e-Freedom
Declaration,'' pledging to keep the Internet permanently tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has criticized McCain's $237 billion, five-year tax plan as
timid. And a slew of critics have lately charged that the Arizona
senator is too liberal a Republican, citing his talk of using the
surplus to safeguard Social Security and pay down the national
debt, and his criticisms of Bush's $483-billion tax-cut plan for
benefiting the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain awoke Tuesday to a front-page editorial by Manchester
Union-Leader publisher Joseph W. McQuaid which said McCain was
``running in the wrong race,'' citing last week's endorsement of
McCain by the Boston Globe as proof of his liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Globe likes McCain for the same reasons New Hampshire
conservatives and Republicans in general are to oppose him. He
wants big government to take over even more of our decisions,''
McQuaid wrote, before repeating his own newspaper's endorsement of
flat-tax proponent Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   To counter such criticisms Tuesday, McCain Tuesday cited a Time
magazine/CNN survey which found that 63 percent of Republican
respondents think the surplus should be used to pay down the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   He also argued strenuously for the ban on Internet taxes at a
Chamber of Commerce breakfast here and signed the ``e-Freedom
Declaration,'' which was written by Citizens for a Sound Economy, a
nonprofit advocacy group devoted to reducing the role of
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't harm this baby in the cradle,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes and Orrin Hatch have also
signed the pledge. Alan Keyes has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope all the candidates will take that pledge. I urge
Governor Bush to take that pledge,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has committed to extending the current moratorium on
Internet taxes for three more years, said Rich Killion, state
director of Citizens for a Sound Economy. But he has deferred a
decision on a permanent ban until the Advisory Commission on
Internet Commerce, set up to study e-commerce when the original
three-year moratorium on taxes was enacted in 1998, completes its
recommendations in the spring. He reiterated that position Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy that Governor Bush was willing to extend the
moratorium for several years,'' Killion said. ``We're unhappy that
he was unwilling to extend it in a permanent fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   At times Tuesday, McCain sounded more like critics of his tax
plan than like himself: He criticized state governors for opposing
the ban because ``all these governors who are'' fighting ``it are
running surpluses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is saying there will be surpluses, as far as the eye
can see,'' was his response to claims that permanently banning the
taxes might not take account of a possible economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of statement McCain often uses to criticize
himself. He frequently cites the changeability of the economy as
the prime motivation for his more cautious tax plan.

NEWSPAPER GROUP URGES TEXAS JUDGE TO STRIKE DOWN BROAD RECORDS LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On the heels of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that
makes information from driver's license applications confidential,
Texas newspapers Tuesday asked a state judge to strike down a
broader state privacy law.
</P>
<P>
   Media spokesmen said the 1997 state law, designed to restrict
public release of information from traffic accident reports as well
as driver's license applications, was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Paul Davis, who enjoined the state from
enforcing the law a few months after it was passed, delayed a
decision on whether to make his injunction permanent.
</P>
<P>
   One section of the state law would require reporters and other
people seeking information about car accidents to provide the name
of a person involved in the collision as well as the date or
location of the mishap.
</P>
<P>
   Editors said that provision would make it difficult _ and
impossible in many cases _ for news organizations to obtain
essential information for news stories about public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision of the Texas law would restrict the media _
under penalty of criminal sanctions _ from disseminating
information from accident reports on the Internet, which is now an
integral part of the news gathering and reporting efforts of most
news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court last week unanimously upheld a 1994
federal law that bans states from disclosing information from
driver's license applications. The federal and more far-reaching
state law were passed to protect people from criminals and unwanted
solicitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Daily Newspaper Association and the Texas Press
Association conceded the high court's ruling on driver's license
applications. But they asked Davis to continue his injunction
against the broader restrictions in the Texas law and to block any
decision by the Texas Department of Public Safety to apply the
driver's license confidentiality provisions to traffic accident
reports as well.
</P>
<P>
   Media executives testified that the media has always had access
to accident reports.
</P>
<P>
   And David Donaldson, an attorney for the news organizations,
said the Internet restrictions amounted an illegal ``prior
restraint'' restriction on the media.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the state law, assistant Attorney General Heather
Horton said the dispute was really over privacy. She said the bill
granted citizens the right to keep certain information private and
to be ``secure in their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Horton said the law didn't prohibit news reporters or other
people from obtaining accident reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference is they now have a few hoops to jump
through,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But media lawyers said the law, which was initially designed to
comply with the federal driver license privacy law, was
unconstitutionally amended to restrict access to accident reports.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush vetoed a separate 1997 bill that would
have restricted accident reports but signed the broader law.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said the governor either overlooked the extra
restrictions in the bill that he signed or felt that he had to sign
it so that Texas could comply with the federal law.

BOSS BUSH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a century ago, New York's infamous William ``Boss''
Tweed delivered one of his pithy political observations: ``I don't
care who does the electing,'' he said, ``so long as I do the
nominating.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every remnant of Tweed's Tammany Hall machine is,
mercifully, a historical footnote now. But the effort by Republican
insiders to keep Senator John McCain of Arizona off New York's
presidential primary ballot has the state GOP contending for
Tweed's tarnished mantle.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is patently undemocratic. Party officials, following
the lead of New York's Governor George Pataki, are almost all
supporting Governor George W. Bush of Texas for the Republican
nomination. On Tuesday they gleefully announced that they are
challenging the petitions filed by the McCain campaign in more than
half the state's 31 congressional districts in an attempt to deny
McCain a spot on the March 7 primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
   This is a long-running issue. In 1996 Steve Forbes was about to
be similarly victimized but sued successfully for standing on the
ballot. The party should have learned its lesson then, but it did
not. It is continuing to enforce rules that are unconscionably
arcane.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee should be pushing New York to
end this embarrassment, yet it has done nothing. But it is Bush
(along with McCain, of course) who has the most at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and his minions may feel they are helping Bush, but the
public message is very different. Bush should see this even if his
New York allies can't. Their effort makes it seem as if Bush lacks
confidence to take his case to the voters in a fair fight against
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, just as Bush is trying to portray McCain as a
Washington insider, it is Bush's supporters who are using Tammany
Hall tactics. The statement from a Bush campaign aide that ``it's a
decision for the state party to make'' should be as unacceptable to
Bush as to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time for Bush to show some leadership and renounce
his supporters' Tweed-like efforts _ after he puts a stop to them.

BRADLEY SAYS HE'LL EXCEED EXPECTATIONS IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IOWA CITY, Iowa _ Less than one week from the first voting in
the 2000 Democratic presidential contest, Bill Bradley said Tuesday
that he hopes to exceed expectations here, but he is already
looking ahead to what he called a ``separate national campaign''
beyond Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, speaking at West High School here a day after his final
Iowa debate with Vice President Al Gore, told students that
``politics should do big and bold things.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's pitch for expanded health care, gun control and
campaign finance reform was well received by the students. But by
most measures, he continues to trail in this state. A Los Angeles
Times poll released Tuesday of likely Democratic caucus-goers
showed Bradley 23 percentage points behind Gore. Among women
voters, Bradley lags way behind Gore, 64 percent to 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with reporters, Bradley would say only that he hopes to
do ``better than expected'' at Monday's caucuses. While he refused
to set a specific bar for success, he cited the 31 percent showing
of Senator Edward M. Kennedy in 1980 against President Jimmy
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that Kennedy's campaign quickly fizzled, Bradley argued
he is better-prepared than Kennedy was to carry on past the Iowa
caucuses and the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he is preparing for a pivotal ``national primary''
on March 7, when several key states, including New York and
California, as well as Massachusetts, hold their primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is a separate national campaign, and we have the
resources to commit to that national campaign,'' said Bradley, who
has been a lucrative fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also elaborated on several exchanges from Monday's
debate in Iowa on racial issues, including Gore's charge that the
former New Jersey senator ignored pleas from the mayor of Newark to
help stop ``racial profiling,'' the law-enforcement practice of
questioning or detaining people based on their skin color.
</P>
<P>
   A Bradley spokesman said Tuesday that Bradley does not recall
having conversations with Newark Mayor Sharpe James about the
issue. And the Bradley campaign issued a news release with glowing
comments James has made about Bradley, including a 1992 quote in
the Bergen Record from James saying Bradley was ``the only national
figure who is talking about racism in America'' and speaks ``from
the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley told reporters that racial profiling did not come to his
attention until 1997, after he had left the Senate. He said he
unsuccessfully urged New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman to
release statistical information on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also revisited the debate's most pointed exchange, when
he asked Gore why he hasn't pressed President Clinton to sign an
executive order outlawing racial profiling by federal authorities.
Gore has repeatedly said signing such an order would be among his
first acts as president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had replied that Clinton didn't needs ``a lecture from Bill
Bradley about how to stand up and fight for African-Americans and
Latinos.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Bradley pointed out he was talking about Gore: ``This
was about his leadership, and not about Bill Clinton. I think Bill
Clinton would be very receptive to this. Why wouldn't he, given his
whole record?'' Bradley asked.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will make an appearance in Salem, N.H. Wednesday morning
before returning to Iowa for an extended bus tour through the
western part of the state. He also is expected to pick up the
endorsement of the governor of Oregon, John Kitzhaber.

 Cori Ellison is dramaturg at the New York City Opera.  
 By CORI ELLISON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A recent search of the World Wide Web under ``Jenny
Lind'' turned up little that was edifying but plenty that was
utilitarian: cribs, furniture, ship figureheads, recipes, streets,
theaters and dams as well as a school, a hospital, a town and a
vocal competition, all named for the 19th-century Swedish
Nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   Though nobody today knows what she sounded like, Jenny Lind
lives on more vividly than many a more recent, recording-era diva
feebly commemorated in an ice cream sundae here or a chicken
fricassee there.
</P>
<P>
   If we still hear Lind loud and clear, it is mainly because her
career is the prototype for those of superstars today. Part
textbook, part cautionary tale, it was as minutely strategized _
and often as sincere _ as a modern political campaign. Were Lind
with us today, we would doubtless be treated to endless reruns of
her PBS television specials during pledge week, with the
Nightingale herself hammily hawking T-shirts and mugs during the
intermissions.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred fifty years ago Lind made a revolutionary tour of
the United States, and the American soprano Barbara Bonney has
seized the occasion of the anniversary to indulge her longtime
fascination with her Swedish predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, Ms. Bonney will present a workshop, ``The
Legacy of Jenny Lind,'' at the Walter Reade Theater in Lincoln
Center as the first installment of her three-part survey of
Scandinavian song over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The workshop will include a slide show assembled by Ms. Bonney
during her research at the Harvard Theater Museum, the American
Swedish Historical Museum in Philadelphia and the San Francisco
Music Library, and performances of songs written for or associated
with Lind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julius Benedict's song `Greeting to America' was the result of
a contest to write a song in honor of Jenny's tour to America,''
Ms. Bonney said recently from her home in London. ``Wilhelm
Taubert's `Bird Song' was one of the Swedish Nightingale's favorite
numbers, and Isak Berg's `Herdsman Song' was famous for its
remarkable echo effect as well as for the sort of
Victorian-Scandinavian melancholy that was one of Lind's
trademarks. And `Hear ye, Israel,' from `Elijah' was tailored for
Lind by Felix Mendelssohn.''
</P>
<P>
   For all her ultimate fame and impact, Johanna Maria ``Jenny''
Lind began life humbly. Born out of wedlock in Stockholm in 1820,
she spent her early childhood shunting between relatives' homes
until, the story goes, a ballerina's maid heard the 9-year-old girl
singing through a window. Young Jenny was swiftly admitted to the
Royal Opera School, where she studied with Isak Berg and made her
stage debut in 1830, at 10.
</P>
<P>
   After appearing in many comedies and melodramas, Lind made her
formal operatic debut in 1838, as Agathe in ``Der Freischutz.'' She
soon tackled such diverse and taxing roles as Donizetti's Lucia and
Weber's -Euryanthe, Donna Anna in ``Don Giovanni,'' Pamina in ``Die
Zauberflote,'' Alice in Meyerbeer's ``Robert le Diable'' and Julia
in Spontini's ``Vestale'' (said to be her favorite).
</P>
<P>
   Did her crazy-quilt repertory display amazing versatility or
just the hubris-fueled mania that still infects ambitious singers?
All we know is that by the time she was 20, when she sang her first
Norma, she had not only attained some 400 performances but also
developed alarming signs of vocal wear, especially in her middle
register. Her baritone colleague Giovanni Belletti counseled her to
go to Paris and consult Manuel Garcia, the brother of the divas
Malibran and Viardot and a pioneer of the modern scientific
approach to vocal pedagogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mademoiselle, you have no more voice,'' Garcia reportedly told
her. After three months of enforced silence, Lind studied with
Garcia for 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   She made a triumphant return to the Stockholm stage as Norma in
1842. All accounts report significant vocal and technical strides.
Yet Lind's tattered middle register would always remain relatively
weak. (``Veiled'' is the word most contemporaries used.)
</P>
<P>
   Adding Amina in ``La Sonnambula,'' Marie in ``La Fille du
Regiment'' and other roles to her repertory, Lind toured
Continental Europe. After singing in Berlin in 1844 at the
invitation of Meyerbeer, she conquered other German cities, Vienna,
and Copenhagen, where Hans Christian Andersen was said to have
fallen in love with her, vainly.
</P>
<P>
   Collaborating with Mendelssohn, the composer doubling as
conductor at the Leipzig Gewandhaus, in 1845, Lind found her
foremost musical soulmate. Though he did not live to write the
opera he had promised her, his ``Elijah'' stands as a potent
tribute, showcasing not only Lind's artistry but also her reputedly
splendid F sharp (a forte that most sopranos do not share and for
which they curse her).
</P>
<P>
   Lind's much-heralded London debut, delayed by titillating,
well-publicized contractual disputes, took place in 1847, before
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. For this occasion, Lind cannily
chose ``modern music'' _ ``Robert le Diable'' _ avoiding the
merciless exposure of Mozart or bel canto.
</P>
<P>
   The audience responded with mild hysteria; the queen tossed Lind
a bouquet and recorded her ``triumph'' in a diary entry: ``She has
a most exquisite, powerful and really quite peculiar voice, so
round, soft and flexible, and her acting is charming and touching
and very natural.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in London succumbed to ``Jenny Lind fever.''
``Atrociously stupid,'' William Makepeace Thackeray called the
soprano. ``I was thinking of something else the whole time she was
jugulating away,'' he wrote, adding that he had yearned to flee and
have a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   But Henry Chorley, one of the most credible 19th-century
critics, praised Lind's phenomenal breath control, glorious top and
shimmering high pianissimo. Most commentators conceded her
imperfect Italian and her limited dramatic range: from wistful to
pathetic, stopping short of heroic.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner noted her ``curious pensive individuality.'' Yet as with
most great singers, her appeal lay chiefly in her distinctive vocal
timbre _ what Chopin called ``a kind of northern lights'' _ which,
like the Bjoerling ``tear,'' the Caruso ``squillo'' or the Ponselle
``snarl,'' evoked an entire personality.
</P>
<P>
   The acclaim poured in. Verdi wrote the role of Amalia in ``I
Masnadieri'' for Lind, and she sang in the work's unsuccessful
premiere, in 1847 in London. And her popularity spread far beyond
opera audiences. She lent her homely name to such worldly items as
racehorses, lap dogs, dolls, a tulip, a pub and a whistling
teakettle.
</P>
<P>
   A railway tour of Britain, particularly a sojourn in Norwich at
the home of a Bishop and Mrs. Stanley, proved a turning point in
Lind's life. Something about churchy English Victoriana struck a
deep chord in her, solidifying her growing desire to quit the
``immoral'' opera stage for something more virtuous.
</P>
<P>
   No less important, Lind had hit on her recipe for success:
respectability. She was perfectly attuned to the middle-class
morality of England and its Puritan spinoff, the United States.
Donning lily-white gowns, shunning excessive makeup and jewelry,
and giving liberally and showily to charity, she made a high art of
her long-standing purity and earnestness, doing much to
rehabilitate the checkered image of female singers.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Pleasants wrote in ``The Great Singers,'' ``The
insignificant, snub-nosed, plain, simply dressed, hesitant,
unassuming, poor-little-me, pining for the northern homeland, pure
of heart and noble of thought, was the greatest of her roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Not yet 29, Lind made her final operatic appearance, in ``Robert
le Diable'' in London in 1849. Exhausted from overwork and two
broken marriage engagements, she was contemplating complete
retirement when she was approached by a representative of Phineas
T. Barnum, that legendary exploiter of American gullibility. No
matter that he was a musical yahoo and had never heard Lind; he
would market her as a curiosity, like Tom Thumb or a pair of
Siamese twins.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lind was no Trilby to Barnum's Svengali. She wrote her own
contracts, handled much of her own publicity and retained complete
control over her repertory and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   One of Barnum's dubious innovations was advance hype. He
generated all manner of bogus publicity about Lind, claiming that
she ``had changed all men's ideas of music as Bacon's system
revolutionized philosophy,'' that she had secretly married the Duke
of Devonshire and that her prim hairstyle concealed her lack of
ears.
</P>
<P>
   It worked like a charm. When Lind, along with the baritone
Belletti and the conductor Julius Benedict, sailed into New York
harbor in 1850, they were greeted by cheering throngs, serenades,
speeches and flowers, not to mention merchandising offshoots, as
documented in contemporary doggerel: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Yes, all is Jenny Lind now,
</P>
<P>
   In ev'ry shop she's found;
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Lind you get there retail
</P>
<P>
   By the yard, quart, pint or pound.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in New York and ending 18 months later in
Philadelphia, Lind traversed the eastern and southern United
States, racking up 93 concerts and $176,675 (more than $3.5 million
in today's currency). But this handsome profit was hard won. At
every stop she was obliged to receive a constant stream of beggars,
sycophants, aspiring musicians and autograph hounds.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of sullying her angelic reputation, she never availed
herself of police protection. No wonder she also earned a
reputation for tetchy ill temper.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of her life was a denouement. In 1852, she married Otto
Goldschmidt, a devoted but second-rate German accompanist whom she
described as ``a model of virtue, industry and domesticity.'' She
bore three children, sang concerts in Germany and in England, where
she settled in 1858, and taught at the Royal College of Music from
1883 to 1886. But by the time she died quietly at her home in
Herefordshire in 1887, Jenny Lind had irrevocably changed the
topography of the music business.

CONFIDENT GORE ACTING LIKE A WINNER IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Iowa _ The votes won't be in until next week, but Al
Gore is acting like a man who has already won next Monday's Iowa
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   He's smiling. He asks respectfully for votes, but there is an
air of confidence, not desperation, in his appeals for help. As
much as the notoriously stiff-mannered Gore can look relaxed, he is
relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore Tuesday snagged the important endorsement of the national
American Federation of Government Employees, a 600,000-member union
that had held back its decision at last year's meeting of the
AFL-CIO, the government worker's umbrella union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Gore! We want Gore!'' the union workers chanted as
Gore, dressed casually in a long-sleeved black polo shirt and
khakis, entered the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AFGE members expressed a clear choice for Al Gore,'' said
Bobby L. Harnage, the group's national president. ``There's only
one candidate to take this country forward, and that's Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The union endorsement is significant not only because of the
institutional stamp of approval, but also because unions typically
commandeer their members to get out the vote for the endorsed
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to fight for you,'' Gore told a gathering of a few
dozen union members at the VFW hall here. ``It will be a lot easier
for me to be in your corner if you put me in an office that doesn't
have any corners.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Gore as many as 23 percentage points ahead of his
rival for the Democratic nomination, former Senator Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's up. He was laughing a lot. He feels good,'' said Andrew
Cuomo, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development
and an active Gore campaigner. ``I was an appellate attorney, and
one thing I learned is ... when you have won the case, say thank
you and sit down,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign says it isn't taking any race or state for
granted. ``We're going to fight every single day for the next six
days,'' Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane, said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Gore camp is behaving as though Iowa is fairly
secure.
</P>
<P>
   After a day and a half spent traversing the state, Gore Tuesday
night headed to New Hampshire for a day of campaigning before
returning to Iowa until the night of the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign is also accusing the Bradley campaign of being
``negative'' and defensive, which Lehane said indicates Bradley is
worried about not doing well in Iowa. Further, Lehane said, Bradley
is trying to lower national media expectations of his showing in
Iowa by suggesting that a 31 percent showing _ as Senator Edward M.
Kennedy drew during the 1980 Iowa caucuses _ would be a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a two-person race. There's a winner and a loser,''
Lehane said. ``Second place is just another name for a first-place
loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has spent about $1 million on his TV media airtime in Iowa,
compared to the $1.6 million Bradley has booked for the state.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Gore has modified his criticism of Bradley. In
sharp contrast to his earlier demeanor, when Gore seemed anxious
about Bradley's fund-raising and showing in the polls, Gore acts
now more like a front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore points out what he sees as the deficiencies in
Bradley's health care plan, the vice president is more gracious in
his comments about his rival personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say about my opponent, Bill Bradley, that he's a good
man, a decent man'' Gore told the group at the VFW hall. ``He has
the right intentions. But he's a good man with a bad plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also peppered his speeches in Iowa with criticisms of the
Republican candidates, particularly the front-runner, Texas
Governor George W. Bush _ indicating he is setting up a voter
choice between him and Bush, instead of him and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``wants to raid government pension plans to finance his tax
plan,'' Gore told the unionists. Many Republican candidates want to
go back to the policies of the ``Reagan-Bush administration'' whose
``approach ran the country into the ground,'' Gore added, making a
pointed reference to Bush's father, the former vice president and
president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore received a warm response on his five-city tour in Iowa
Tuesday. He appeared in shirtsleeves in Indianola, telling the
mixed-age crowd he would fight for racial justice, equal pay for
equal work, and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, Gore was working the crowd at Indian Hills
Community College in Ottumwa like he was a talk show host,
wandering down the aisle and telling stories of growing up, of
being a young journalist and congressman, and of being a
grandparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be a much better president for Iowa,'' said Clayton
Carmody, 77, after listening to Gore speak in Indianola. Gore ``has
a farm program,'' and _ unlike Bradley _ does not want to get rid
of Medicaid, a crucial health program for Iowa's elderly, Carmody
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Wallerstedt, 76, was unconvinced of Gore's commitment to
racial harmony and said she found his attempt to connect with the
crowd to be artificial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like he's putting on some kind of show, instead of
being himself,'' she said. ``I liked him better before.''

A NAIVE DEFENSE OF ASSAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans who remember how rumors about Arab terrorists were
disseminated immediately after the bombing of the federal building
in Oklahoma City should recognize the need to overcome stereotyping
of Arabs and Arab-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There is a genuine need for a group such as the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee. A Lebanese grandmother visiting her
family in America should not be detained for hours on arrival at
Logan Airport solely for the suspicious activity of being Arab.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee, also known as the ADC, did not serve
Arab-Americans when it objected last week to a statement by the
State Department's spokesman, James Rubin, who had said: ``We do
not regard Syria as a democracy . . . in any sense of the word. We
don't expect the Syrian government to submit any potential
agreement to the people of Syria for a referendum in the same kind
of way the Israeli government does so.''
</P>
<P>
   The ADC's complaint took a strange turn, repeating the
fundamental error of those who propagate anti-Arab stereotypes. The
ADC's chairperson, Naila Asali, said: ``Most Arab-Americans saw
Rubin's remarks as a condescending depiction of the Syrian people
in particular and the Arab people in general. Jamie owes all
Syrians and Arab-Americans a sincere public apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Asali's unfathomable mistake is to identify all Syrians and all
Arab-Americans with the dictatorship of Syria's ruler, Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians, Lebanese, Palestinians, and Jordanians whose family
members have been imprisoned, tortured, or killed by Assad's
security services certainly would not agree with Asali. Indeed,
there are few Lebanese who do not regard Assad's occupation of
Lebanon as a kidnapping of their country. When they are able to
speak freely, many Syrians and Lebanese joke about presidential
elections in Syria, where Assad routinely receives 99.7 or 99.8
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Syrians, nor Lebanese, nor Arab- Americans deserve to be
identified with Assad's police state. That is certainly not what an
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee should be doing.

LOOKING AGAIN AT ART THAT MADE A CULTURE BLINK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There she is, totally naked, reclining on pillows in a full
frontal pose, just three and a half minutes into a prime-time
public television show. It is the first of the nude model's many
appearances on the second episode of ``Culture Shock,'' whose first
two installments will be broadcast on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, tuning in to PBS and seeing a woman whose only bow
to modesty is a well-placed hand comes as something of a stunner.
But the rest of the series _ in all, four and a half hours in four
programs _ is far tamer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Culture Shock'' turns out to be elucidating and entertaining
but, most of all, safe _ safe in its choices of art to illustrate
the never-ending conflict between artists and society, between
freedom of expression and censorship, between what is conventional
and what might lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than pick from recent skirmishes in the culture wars _
the relationship between music and movie violence and the massacre
at Columbine High School, say _ the series focuses on past battles
where art not only prevailed but also ascended into the canon:
``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' Manet's ``Olympia,'' movies
made in the 1920s and '30s before, during and after the Hollywood
production code and ``the devil's music'' _ jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Janows, the executive producer of ``Culture Shock,'' said
that she purposely did not rehash current conflicts. ``I wanted to
provide the historical context to examine what these conflicts say
about society,'' she explained. In each case, art mirrored
something that was happening in society _ the spread of black
culture into the mainstream, for instance _ and triggered anxiety
about it. ``The freedom of art to challenge the status quo can be
terrifying,'' Ms. Janows said, adding that she wanted to get people
talking about culture.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself is something television about the arts rarely
does. Television viewers _ and therefore programmers _ favor
biographies of artists, narrative documentaries and live or taped
performances over other arts programs, several industry executives
said. ``Culture Shock,'' Ms. Janows said, ``looks at issues.''
Morality, sex and race are central to the narratives.
</P>
<P>
   Although not many people outside public television have yet seen
``Culture Shock,'' several welcomed its thesis. That did not,
however, stop them from nit-picking, mostly about the works Ms.
Janows selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those choices are relevant,'' said Harold E. Morse, the chief
executive of Ovation, a cable arts network. ``But if you look at
hot controversies in the arts today, they're between the beginning
and the middle of the continuum; they're not on the edge.'' (The
New York Times holds a minority investment in Ovation.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Janows admitted to having another reason for resorting to
history. ``It's not radical, it's not avant-garde,'' she said of
the program, sounding slightly defensive, ``but it's very difficult
to raise money for arts programs.'' ``Culture Shock'' makes
reference to present-day disputes _ protests against gangsta rap,
contentions that ``Huckleberry Finn'' is a racist book _ but to
have focused on contemporary clashes, she said, would have
aggravated financing problems.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Janows proposed the series seven years ago, even her
employer, WGBH of Boston, was nervous about it. ``It was only when
I got support from the National Endowment for the Arts and the
National Endowment for Humanities that I got permission to use the
development department of WGBH,'' she said. The humanities
endowment put up $585,000 and the arts endowment $325,000, leaving
Ms. Janows and WGBH to raise a further $2,590,000 from foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Finding financing took four years. That, as well as the research
and writing, was completed long before Columbine or the contretemps
over the ``Sensation'' exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum of Art last
fall, though well after many 1980s uproars _ over, for example, the
merits of Richard Serra's public sculpture ``Tilted Arc,'' which
was unceremoniously removed from Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan,
or the homoerotic photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't put Mapplethorpe on public TV,'' Ms. Janows said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, arts programs on other networks, such as
they exist, also avoid controversy. Ovation has not done a show
about Mapplethorpe either, though Morse said he would consider one,
depending on the content. He added that Ovation has presented
programs about other controversial artists, including Damien Hirst,
whose works incorporating a sliced-up pig and a decomposing cow's
head with maggots feeding on it disgusted some visitors to
``Sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   One exception may be drama. Showtime, the premium cable movie
channel, is producing a movie about the Mapplethorpe exhibit in
Cincinnati, where the director of the Contemporary Arts Center was
tried and acquitted of obscenity charges. The movie is to be shown
in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Like many contemporary documentaries, ``Culture Shock''
interweaves historical material with on-camera interviews and
cinema verite. The most complicated episode, about Huck Finn,
retells the novel's plot, recapping its early repudiation as a
threat to public morals; visits historical sites like Elmira, N.Y.,
where Twain wrote much of the book; spends time with Twain
scholars; checks in on race relations in Hannibal, Mo., where Twain
grew up and is today celebrated (though without much participation
from black residents) and outlines the unsuccessful crusade of a
woman and her daughter in Tempe, Ariz., to remove ``Huckleberry
Finn'' from the high school curriculum. (It runs for 90 minutes;
the installments that follow last an hour.)
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, ``Culture Shock's'' link to today is weakest where
recent culture wars have raged most virulently, in the visual arts.
The episode about the painting ``Olympia,'' which captures the
direct gaze of an obvious prostitute and caused a furor in Paris
when it was first seen in 1865, makes a connection to today in only
two noncontroversial ways.
</P>
<P>
   After showing that artists like Cezanne and Picasso later
painted their own Olympias, the program enlists Mike Bidlo, a New
York artist, to do the same. He recreates Olympia as a photograph
using the nude model. And for viewers who are unaware of Manet's
position in art history, the program goes to a recent auction where
a Manet self-portrait sold for more than $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of people who would criticize artists of
the 1980s and '90s, but Ms. Janows said that when the Manet program
was written, she and the episode's producer, Richard P. Rogers,
thought that concentrating on the historical would be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Later, producers of the jazz and movie installments, and Ms.
Janows, who produced the Huck Finn show, decided to make direct
connections to contemporary disputes, giving voice to dissenters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Culture Shock'' may disappoint people who believe the
series should vigorously support free expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they had actually focused on the First Amendment,''
said Joan Bertin, the executive director of the National Coalition
Against Censorship. ``But it's good to give people examples of
controversial things that have moved into the mainstream and to
show, if there had been suppression, how much poorer we'd be.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Ms. Bertin added, ``they'd get all kinds of hell if
they did what was perceived as an advocacy piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a strong position was never an option, Ms. Janows said.
``We tried not to come down on one side or the other. Serious
people can have concerns about the limits of culture. The fears are
real.''

`OUTSIDER' FORBES PURSUES CAMPAIGN OF POLITICAL INSURGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARROLL, Iowa _ Steve Forbes, the magazine publisher who prefers
to characterize himself as an ``independent outsider,'' believes he
is sowing a political insurgency on the rolling plains of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   As he spends his last days in the state, traveling a circuit of
rural county seats where grain elevators tower over two-story
office buildings, Forbes talks of defying the establishment,
smashing power and routing the ``pundits and media and special
interests who want you to believe this race is over.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Forbes included the Republican
leadership in his critique of entrenched powerbrokers. In their
effort to rally around Texas Gov. George W. Bush, he said, ``the
party leaders, the lobbyists -- the K Street group in Washington --
have all closed ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   Unsparing in his assessment of the Clinton administration,
Forbes also turned his fire on his own party's performance on
Capitol Hill. ``The Republican Congress has been much too passive
-- to be blunt -- since '96 when they lost the budget showdown with
Clinton,'' Forbes said. ``They haven't been bold and forthright and
engaged with President Clinton on isssues.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his relationship with the congressional leadership,
the candidate smiled wanly. ``I meet with Trent Lott from time to
time. I send him everything I do. There's no shortage of written
advice or commentary.'' The Senate majority leader ``hasn't taken
the advice yet,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the conversation, as his campaign bus rolled
across a panorama of farmland, Forbes described his campaign as
``the real revolutionaries'' and actually talked about going to the
``barricades'' to fight for tax legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shows you the twists and turns of life,'' the
multi-millionaire executive said of his use of revolutionary
expressions.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is an unlikely rebel. His positions on big government,
tax relief, abortion and strong defense swim easily in the
Republican mainstream. He has the manners of a small town bank
president, successful in society rather than scorned by it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Forbes argued that his ``boldness'' on certain issues --the
flat tax, school choice and Social Security innovations --
separated him from Bush and the rest of the GOP field.
</P>
<P>
   As the days before Monday's caucus dwindle, Forbes has given up
creature comforts for touring the state by bus and spending nights
at modest motels with plastic drinking cups and threadbare towels.
</P>
<P>
   His operation is methodical, and Forbes, himself, has been as
punctual as a Swiss train in stop after stop in rural Iowa.
Republican leaders say the Forbes organization rivals the Bush
campaign in its grassroots work.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Forbes' appeal in Iowa may be greater than the 18
points he was assigned in a Des Moines Register poll earlier this
month. His events this week in northern Iowa drew impressive
crowds, though it was not altogether clear whether they represented
Forbes faithful or were merely curious, drawn from the workaday
routine of small towns for the promise of a free meal (chili or
chicken noodle soup), a copy of the candidate's slick campaign book
and an orange, long-sleeved Forbes jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The audiences seem friendly, but their enthusiasm is whetted by
a claque accompanying the candidate -- two women who drive by car
behind the bus and instigate applause with bursts of clapping.
</P>
<P>
   At Orange City, a Dutch community near the South Dakota line
where the locals sound as if they've stepped off the set of
``Fargo,'' Forbes repeatedly criticized the ``bureaucrats, elites
and lobbyists'' in Washington. Though his language carried some of
the same catch-phrases from George C. Wallace's assaults on the
``pointy-headed bureaucrats'' 30 years ago, his message was
conveyed in a soft voice.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles up the road at Sheldon, he characterized his two
leading Republican opponents, Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain, as
part and parcel of an establishment unwilling to change. Of their
tax proposals, Forbes says, ``They've used an array of snippets
here and tucks there, but nothing gets to the heart of the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching out to the conservative Christian communities, he has
emphasized his opposition to abortion. To establish his legitimacy
on the subject, he was joined on the trip by Phyllis Schlafly, an
exponent of take-no-prisoners conservative doctrine whose ministry
goes back to the last triumph by a true ``outsider'' in the
Republican Party, Barry Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Schlafly said she was not endorsing Forbes, merely
reinforcing his ``pro-life'' theme. She was there, obviously, to
goad Bush on the issue. But as the crowds grew larger at each stop
on the schedule, Schlafly began confiding to her listeners that she
would vote for Forbes were she an Iowa resident.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Forbes campaign can translate the crowds into
support at 2,100 caucus sites will not be known until next week.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Grubbs, a former state Republican chairman who is backing
Forbes, likes to recall the precedent of other insurgencies in
Iowa: in 1980, when George Bush, father of the current candidate,
surprised Ronald Reagan; in 1988, when evangelist Pat Robertson
finished ahead of Bush; and four years ago, when Pat Buchanan
nearly beat Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   But Grubbs never carries his examples to their end. In each
case, the hopes of these maverick candidates were ultimately
extinguished by the Republican establishment later in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said he was not discouraged by the Republican Party's
history of primogeniture. ``When I was growing up I was the oldest
among my siblings, so I saw some merit then. But not since then.
Thomas Jefferson abolished primogeniture over 200 years ago,''
Forbes said. ``I think any Republicans who have a lingering
fondness for it, they'll be over it by the time I get through with
this campaign.''

ANALYSIS: BARAK JUGGLES PEACE EFFORTS WITH SYRIA AND PALESTINIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When Prime Minister Ehud Barak first declared his
ambitious intentions to juggle the Palestinian and Syrian peace
efforts simultaneously, he said he could keep both balls in the air
and prevent them from touching, much less colliding. But that is
increasingly turning into a contortionist's trick.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has managed to keep both tracks alive by shuttling between
the camps, led by two Arab leaders, President Hafez Assad of Syria
and Yasser Arafat of the Palestinian Authority, who are longtime
adversaries. But the tracks unavoidably bump against each other.
</P>
<P>
   Time spent by the Israelis and the U.S. peace team on one takes
time from the other. Progress on one affects progress on the other.
Demands made and concessions wrung sit as mutual precedents.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was clearly shown Monday, when Syrian-Israeli
negotiations that had been scheduled to resume Wednesday in the
United States were canceled. Within hours of the cancellation,
Barak, his table cleared, was traveling to the Tel Aviv area for a
secretive night-time meeting with Arafat that ended up lasting four
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we buy ourselves a little time to devote to the
Palestinians,'' an Israeli official said. The Israelis and the
Palestinians pronounced the meeting a success, and Arafat called it
a ``very important'' review of all outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment that Israeli-Syrian relations were revived in
December, the Palestinians thought that Barak did protest too much.
Every time that he assured them that his deep immersion in
Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations would not affect them, it
reminded them of the inherent conflict in time and energy.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to ignore the interconnection, given that progress
between the Israelis and the Palestinians slowed immediately after
the Israeli-Syrian talks resumed. Israelis said the Palestinians
were dragging their feet. The Palestinians said the Israelis were
distracted _ and dragging their feet, too.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton invited Arafat to visit Washington this
week for what was to have been the third round of Israeli-Syrian
talks, he intended to reassure Arafat that the Palestinian peace
effort was still as important as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Arafat, who will now be the only Middle East leader to
meet Clinton this week, is explicitly seeking affirmation that the
Americans will not let the Palestinian cause slide if the Syrians
advance, an adviser said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   From the other side, when Assad refused to send his emissary to
Washington for the talks that have now been canceled, it was at
least partly because Arafat was elbowing in on his show.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say Assad, 69, and Arafat, 70, see themselves in a kind
of competition to be the linchpin for peace in the region, although
Assad, newer to the peace game, does so with more ambivalence. And
both want to be courted and afforded international recognition.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Egyptian intermediaries have tried to persuade Assad's emissary
to Washington, Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, that he should
not see the Palestinians as competitors, a senior Egyptian aide
said. The Egyptians suggested that it would help win over Israeli
public opinion if Barak presented two peace treaties at once, the
aide added.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not necessarily the view in Jerusalem, and U.S.
officials also question it. Although negotiating on two tracks at
once is tough for the Israelis, making decisions on two tracks at
once could prove even tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Could Barak agree to give up the Golan Heights to the Syrians
and make concessions on Jerusalem to the Palestinians at the same
time? This was a question that he somewhat brushed off in the early
days of his premiership last summer, noting that a historical
moment had arisen that might allow him to do what his predecessors
did not dare. He seemed to believed that two nearly simultaneous
peace deals could create enough momentum to overwhelm domestic
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But after a mass rally last week opposing Israeli concession of
the Golan Heights, the question restated itself in Jerusalem. How
much could the Israeli body politic absorb at once?
</P>
<P>
   ``In contrast to his earlier declarations, Barak today realizes
that it is impossible to conduct complex negotiations, which
include far-reaching territorial concessions on both fronts
simultaneously,'' Shimon Shiffer, a diplomatic correspondent for
Yedioth Arhonoth, a newspaper, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Israeli official played down the idea that anything
would be simultaneous, saying the tracks would progress and slide
back at their own rates and at their own times. Like others, he
maintained the optimistic posture that the cancellation of
Israeli-Syrian talks is a snag and not a derailment. He also said
that Barak remained confident that a deal could be reached on both
tracks in a few months _ an agreement with Syria and a framework
agreement for a final peace with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials expressed concern that an Israeli-Syrian deal
first would harden Barak and Arafat and make an Israeli-Palestinian
agreement more difficult. Barak, if he conceded the Golan Heights,
might feel compelled to take a tougher line on Jerusalem and the
settlements. And if Assad won back the Golan Heights, Arafat might
find it more difficult politically to make concessions to the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, too, needs to sell a deal to his people, who are growing
increasingly skeptical about the prospects for a kind of peace that
could change their lives. Among the Palestinians, there is a
difference of opinion as to whether it is best to proceed speedily
or to slow down and wait out the Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
   As they aim for a deadline of Feb. 13 for a framework accord
that Barak set, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators have committed
themselves to working intensively toward that goal, even if it
appears increasingly unlikely that it will be met.
</P>
<P>
   But some Palestinians think that if they waited, they could end
up having the playing field back to themselves. International
pressure on Israel might ease if Barak made serious concessions to
the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Syrian effort failed, or if enough time passed after
an agreement, that pressure might resurface, compelling Barak to
close the circle of peace, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile, Arafat sits above the fray, waiting, not wanting to
close any of his options,'' a Western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it is a tricky balancing act for all three parties,
and after Barak suffered a setback this week, Israelis are noting
that the juggler cannot control the balls.

PARLIAMENT LIBERALS PROTEST PUTIN APPOINTMENT OF COMMUNIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Just hours after vowing that Russia would never return
to its totalitarian past, acting President Vladimir V. Putin
infuriated some of his pro-democracy allies by supporting a leading
Communist as speaker of the country's newly elected parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal lawmakers marched out of the chamber in protest,
blemishing what had otherwise been a triumphant day for the new
Kremlin leader.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle was Putin's first major political embarrassment
since becaming acting president on New Year's Eve after Boris
Yeltsin's abrupt resignation. For some it was a sobering
demonstration of how little is known about the new Kremlin leader's
political leanings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a humiliation for Russian democracy,'' said lawmaker
Oleg Morozov, leader of a centrist pro-government party called
Regions of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Morozov and others were protesting a backroom deal made between
the Communist Party, the largest faction in the legislature, and a
pro-Kremlin bloc called Unity, which holds the second largest
number of seats. Unity, a hastily assembled alliance of bureaucrats
and regional elites, is widely seen here as ``Putin's party.'' It
also has no clear political platform other than supporting the
acting president.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists and Unity together control a majority of the 450
seats in the State Duma, the lower house of Russia's parliament.
Using this dominance, the two froze smaller parties _ including
Putin's other allies _ out of negotiations and elected Communist
lawmaker Gennady Seleznyov as the legislature's speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Seleznyov served as speaker of the previous parliament, in which
the Communists and their allies had a majority. Widely seen as a
moderate, he proved adept at taming the hard liners in his own
party and reaching compromises with the Kremlin. Analysts here said
that Seleznyov's political affiliations are less important to Putin
than the fact that he will be able to deliver key votes for the
Kremlin and keep his party's true believers under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a pragmatic move. Seleznyov is somebody that Putin
will easily be able to control and use to get what he wants from
parliament,'' said Yevgeny Volk, a political analyst with the
Heritage Foundation in Moscow. ``Seleznyov may be a Communist, but
now he is Putin's Communist,'' Volk added.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Boris Nemtsov, leader of a liberal party that
supports Putin, called the deal ``a major political mistake that
will have very serious and negative consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Nemtsov's party, called the Union of Right Forces, was among 137
lawmakers who walked out of parliament when it became clear that
the Communists and Unity had cut a deal that excluded them.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised interview, Nemtsov said that the Union of Right
Forces, the liberal Yabloko faction, and an opposition group called
Fatherland-All Russia would continue their protest by refusing to
accept any leadership posts or committee chairmanships.
</P>
<P>
   The Union of Right Forces and the Yabloko bloc had hoped to team
up with Unity to elect former prime minister Sergei Stepashin as
speaker. Fatherland-All Russia had nominated its leader, former
prime minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   By the time lawmakers finally got around to voting Seleznyov in
for his second term as speaker _ by a vote of 285 to nine _ most
seats on the right side of the parliamentary chamber, usually
occupied by liberal parties, were conspicuously empty. And although
the vote was legal, the scene of a nearly half empty legislature
voting for its leader appeared to lose a degree of moral
legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened today was really profane. It was a collusion
that will prevent the State Duma from working effectively in the
future,'' Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontational mood at the end of the new legislature's
first session contrasted sharply with the feel-good atmosphere that
prevailed in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Putin opened Tuesday's session of parliament by calling for
cooperation between the Kremlin and legislature, after years of
acrimonious bickering during the Yeltsin's presidency. Putin's mere
presence in the chamber was seen as a gesture of compromise,
contrasting sharply with the disdain with which Yeltsin had treated
the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Although Russia's president holds most political power, the
State Duma must approve the federal budget, approve prime ministers
and ratify treaties. The speaker is a key figure who runs
parliamentary sessions, controls the legislature's agenda and
presides over the chamber's staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the widest support base in the State Duma. This is a
pragmatic position, not a political position. We will not divide
lawmakers into us and them,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   A former KGB spy, Putin also sought to soothe the fears of those
who were apprehensive about his past in the feared Soviet secret
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who speak about a possible dictatorship are themselves
dreaming of it. But their dream is impossible in modern Russia,''
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to lawmakers, the Kremlin leader embraced
pro-market themes. Putin said he favored a ``moderately liberal''
economic policy and urged the legislature to pass bills to improve
the country's investment climate and to allow land to be bought and
sold freely.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Pribylovsky, a Moscow-based political analyst, said the
angry public reaction by Putin's erstwhile allies was ``a very
serious blow for Putin's image.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure he didn't anticipate such a strong reaction and a
solid opposition to Seleznyov's candidacy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who enjoys wide popularity here for his tough stance in
Russia's battle with Chechen separatist, faces snap presidential
elections on March 26 that most expect him to win.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Close to 25 years ago, Geraldine Laybourne decided
that children were being poorly served by television. Ms.
Laybourne, with a master's degree in elementary education from the
University of Pennsylvania, soon found a job with a fledgling cable
network called Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 16 years, Ms. Laybourne not only built Nickelodeon
into an $8 billion mini-empire but also altered the way children _
and, for that matter, their families _ viewed television. Among her
signatures were unusual and unsentimental shows like ``Rugrats,''
which tap into the humor, quirks and anxieties of ordinary
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the success of Nickelodeon, I asked who was the most
underserved audience,'' Ms. Laybourne, 52, said. ``There are many
channels designed now for kids. And teens. And men. Who is the most
underserved audience? Women, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laybourne's response, a high-risk 24-hour cable venture
called Oxygen, will make its debut on Feb. 2 in a half-dozen major
cities and suburban areas (but not New York and parts of Los
Angeles). It will be aimed at women who are in control of their
lives, have money to spend and are eager to find an outlet on
television and on Internet sites that will address their health
issues, finances, relationships and problems with raising children.
</P>
<P>
   Do women really need another cable network? Do they really need
another Internet site? Such questions are almost heresy in the
entertainment business, not least because of Oxygen's pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laybourne's partners are Marcy Carsey, Tom Werner and Caryn
Mandabach, who run one of television's most successful production
companies, responsible for such series as ``The Cosby Show,''
``Roseanne,'' ``A Different World,'' ``Grace Under Fire,'' ``Third
Rock From the Sun'' and ``Cybill.'' The other partner, Oprah
Winfrey, is one of the most formidable figures in American popular
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Besides these rich and successful associates, Oxygen has several
high-profile financial backers. These include America Online and
Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft. Another investor is
Bernard Arnault, the chairman of the French conglomerate LVMH,
whose luxury goods _ Christian Dior, Givenchy, Louis Vuitton _ are
obviously in tune with the affluent audience Oxygen's channel and
World Wide Web sites anticipate.
</P>
<P>
   Given this support, you would expect the network to face smooth
sailing. But the waters look choppy for Oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   The other basic 24-hour cable network developed for women,
Lifetime, which is owned by the Walt Disney Co. and Hearst Corp.,
is seen in 75 million homes. By contrast, Oxygen will be available,
at the outset, in only 10 million households, because Ms. Laybourne
and her staff have not been able to come to financial terms with
cable companies in some of the largest markets or because the cable
operators are unwilling to commit to a network whose shows they
have not seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a crowded cable marketplace, Gerry has to carve out her
niche,'' said Christopher Dixon, a media analyst at Paine Webber.
``The critical issue for any launch is how many subscribers you
have. Until you get 25 to 30 million subscribers, you won't have
the kind of critical mass that attracts major national
advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen's inability to find a home in New York or Los Angeles is
partly because of the crowded cable landscape and partly because
the network is asking cable companies to help pay the costs of
programming, all of which is original. Even more significant is the
matter of creating the programs that will lure viewers. No one can
be quite sure what women, en masse, want to see on television.
</P>
<P>
   The Lifetime network has found a successful set of formulas:
reruns of shows like ``Golden Girls,'' ``Designing Women'' and
``Chicago Hope''; series like ``Any Day Now,'' about the enduring
friendship of two women, one black and one white, in Birmingham,
Ala.; original escapist movies, often characterized by women in
some kind of jeopardy, as well as ``Intimate Portrait'' biographies
(Bette Midler, Lady Bird Johnson, Gloria Steinem, Katharine Graham)
and documentary specials on subjects like breast cancer and the
crisis in child care. The network seems to be directed at an older,
less hip audience than the one Oxygen is reaching for.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Black, the president and chief executive of Lifetime,
said that Lifetime's success _ it ranks sixth among basic cable
networks in prime time, according to Nielsen figures _ can be
attributed to its clear assessment of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women multitask,'' said Ms. Black, who had been a top
television marketing executive at Disney and the general manager at
KNBC-TV in Los Angeles. ``They're very busy. They're worrying about
everyone else _ their significant other, their children, their
parents, their friends. They have very little time to themselves.
They need a place to go where they can be themselves, where they
can feel understood, have fun, learn something and feel
supported.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, executives at Lifetime and Oxygen were fairly candid
about each other's shortcomings. But lately mutual criticisms have
been muted. Officials at both companies say that magazines and
newspapers are poised for a cat fight to develop between Oxygen and
Lifetime, perpetuating every cliche about competition among women.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen faces competition not only from Lifetime but also,
depending on the viewer's age and income, from Romance Classics,
the Food Network, HGTV as well as MTV, VH1 and other networks with
talk shows and series aimed at women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm anxious to see what Oxygen has on,'' Ms. Black said. ``The
people behind it are so smart and have been very successful. But
everyone's going after women now. Including the broadcast
networks.'' (She is right: shows like NBC's ``Providence'' and
``Will and Grace,'' and CBS's ``Judging Amy'' have been unexpected
successes, those networks say, because of their substantial female
audience.)
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen has no plans to rerun old television series. Although Ms.
Laybourne has said that Oxygen is not seeking a specific age group,
the shows seem to be skewed toward women from 18 to their mid-40s.
</P>
<P>
   The original programming _ 55 hours a week, hardly all of it
heavyweight _ includes ``Pure Oxygen,'' two hours of news and
entertainment features from New York, which will be broadcast five
days a week. There is also ``X-Chromosome,'' cable television's
first prime-time animated series for women; ``Pajama Party,'' a
weekly, late-night talk and variety show conceived to celebrate,
with humor, what grown women are confronting in their personal and
business lives; ``Trackers'' an afternoon show that involves roving
teen-age girls with digital cameras who create episodes that deal
with fashion, movies, boys and getting into college; an updated
version of the 1950s game show ``I've Got a Secret;'' and programs
given over to exercise and sports, yoga and cooking.

RUSSIAN OPPOSITION TO EKEUS DISUPTS UN BAGHDAD POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAURIA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Again flexing its muscles with the United
States, Russia formally blocked Washington's choice to head a new
Iraq weapons inspection team Tuesday, throwing UN policy on Baghdad
into disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Security Council members China and France joined Russia
in opposing Secretary General Kofi Annan's appointment of Swedish
diplomat Rolf Ekeus to lead the weapons team.
</P>
<P>
   Ekeus, who relentlessly monitored Baghdad as UN weapons
inspection chief from 1991 to 1997, was seen by Annan and
high-profile US Ambassador Richard Holbrooke as vital to trying to
prevent Iraq from building its stocks of long-range missiles and
biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The previous UN team left Iraq in December 1998 ahead of US and
British bombing raids, intended to force Iraq to cooperate with
them. They never returned. The Security Council created a new
inspection unit last month and gave Annan 30 days to nominate its
head. After exploring more than 25 candidates, the secretary
general put forth Ekeus' name.
</P>
<P>
   Russia wants economic sanctions against Iraq to be lifted,
ostensibly on humanitarian grounds, though Russia's battered
economy could certainly use the $7 billion in Soviet-era debt that
Baghdad owes it as well as any new business that might be cemented
with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's UN ambassador, Sergei Lavrov, said any candidate must
be someone Iraq could work with. Baghdad rejects Ekeus as ``old
wine in a new bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Russia has shown a willingness to stand up to
Washington, reversing its no-first strike nuclear policy and
persisting despite international criticism with its offensive in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats say Russia's rejection, firsested in a
letter to Holbrooke Monday night, was the first time a secretary
general's appointment was stopped by a Security Council member.
Holbrooke said he will continue to fight for Ekeus' approval.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, France and China swiftly joined Moscow in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a new body and a new body means of course a new
person in charge,'' said French UN Ambassador Alain Dejammet. His
nation hopes to take advantage of lucrative gas and oil contracts
with Iraq once sanctions are removed.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese diplomats here say Beijing favors a candidate from the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council imposed an oil embargo and other commercial
sanctions on Iraq after its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
According to Security Council resolutions, those sanctions cannot
be lifted until UN weapons inspectors declare Iraq to be rid of its
nuclear, biological, chemical and long-range missile programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council Tuesday decided not to ask Annan for a new
nomination. Instead it will consider previous candidates as well as
new names that might arise.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Kober, a research fellow at the Cato Institute in
Washington, said anger in Russia toward the United States is
actually greater now than during the Cold War. ``Back then it was a
conflict of elites between the two countries and the people had no
animosity towards the US,'' Kober said. ``Now this anger is
bubbling up from the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kober cited a recent poll showing 87 percent of Russians
believed the US is taking advantage of Russia's economic plight to
strengthen its position in the world. Only 10 percent saw President
Clinton as a friend of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, American and Russian diplomats sought to play down
differences between their countries. Holbrooke said Washington and
Moscow ``agree on some issues and disagree on others'' and would
not be drawn into placing Moscow's defiance on Iraq as part of an
overall pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Lavrov said publicly he saw no linkage between Moscow's position
on Iraq and its other policies towards the United States.

 LOS ANGELES: and cooking.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Candice Bergen will have a talk show called ``Exhale,'' with
guests like David Hockney, Madeleine Albright, Frank Gehry and Tina
Turner. Ms. Bergen, who is 53, is expected to deal with issues of
interest to older women as well as the younger set.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winfrey will have a Sunday night talk show and ``Oprah Goes
Online,'' a program that will detail how she is learning to work
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   All of the shows will be integrated with Oxygen's online sites.
Indeed, the Web is integral to the success of the network, Ms.
Laybourne said. She explained that 13 online sites devoted to women
will serve as way stations for Oxygen, sharing useful information,
allowing viewers to interact with the network's shows and,
significantly, to offer opinions and information to Oxygen
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want feedback,'' Ms. Laybourne said. ``We want audiences to
be as involved in the creation of Oxygen as we can get them.''
</P>
<P>
   (Ms. Laybourne used a similar technique at Nickelodeon, where
she turned to research panels across the country to find out what
children wanted from television and what they thought of the
network.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mandabach put it another way. ``Women are more online now
than men,'' she said. ``Women buy 85 percent of the goods and
services. They buy 66 percent of the cars. In the discussion of
what Oxygen is and what we can be, we want to listen and learn from
these women. And that's what the company is about.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the experienced and successful partners at Oxygen are
plainly nervous about the network's debut. ``We are going to make
mistakes, we're learning,'' Werner said. ``Our heart is in the
right place here. I'd say, don't judge us too severely right off
the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   With its backers, Oxygen's valuation, even before the first show
is broadcast, is estimated at more than $1 billion. The company has
about 560 employees, mostly in New York and Los Angeles. It has set
aside about $450 million for original programming. AOL, an investor
in the venture, exchanged cash and three Web sites for women for a
stake in the company. Tele-Communications, the nation's No. 2 cable
operator, now part of AT&AMP;T, has pledged to deliver seven million
cable subscribers over two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been cooking in my head for a long time,'' said Ms.
Laybourne, whose husband, Kit, a filmmaker, is directing the
development of animation at Oxygen. (They have two grown children.)
``How do you figure out something to do with the Internet? How do
you figure out something to do with women, who are 52 percent of
the population?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I thought the hurdles would be much worse,'' Ms.
Laybourne said, cool and assured. ``I hope I don't sound smug. I
suspected we'd start off on a much smaller scale and prove
ourselves every step of the way. What I found was, very early, my
partners wanted to tackle the big picture right off the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen, most certainly, is the biggest risk in Ms. Laybourne's
career. Her success at Nickelodeon led to a somewhat unhappy two
years as president of Disney/ABC cable networks. (During that time
Ms. Laybourne was chairwoman of Lifetime.)
</P>
<P>
   In the Disney job, which ended in 1998, Ms. Laybourne saw her
efforts founder and realized that she wanted to establish a company
on her own. Within months, the Carsey-Werner-Mandabach team joined
her, and later, Ms. Winfrey, who has said she was attracted by
Oxygen's mission to inspire women.
</P>
<P>
   (Ms. Laybourne has said that the name ``Oxygen'' came about
after she woke up one morning gasping for air and concluded ``that
we all needed more breathing room.'' Also, she said, ``I didn't
want a girlish name or what Oprah would call a pinkish name.'')
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen's business priority now is to expand its number of cable
outlets and, especially, to find one in the media capital, New
York. Without New York, Oxygen has diminished clout. But Ms.
Laybourne was noticably buoyed by the news that AOL planned to
merge with Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is a significant partner in Oxygen. Robert W. Pittman, the
president of AOL, was not only Ms. Laybourne's original boss at
Nickelodeon but also a close friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Pittman got us established on the Internet,'' she said.
``AOL was our first deal.'' Pittman is expected to play an
important role in the new company. And with Time Warner's cable
outlet, which is dominant in the New York area, Oxygen's voyage
into New York may be smoother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of time,'' Ms. Laybourne said of her company's
finding a place in New York and Los Angeles. ``It's been a long
time since anything truly fresh, with original programming, was
added to the cable landscape. Once people see what Oxygen is all
about, we'll be welcomed.''

CONFIDENT ABOUT SCORING, CELTICS FOCUS ON DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Celtics continue to think defense first, or at
least that is what their public statements indicate. In fact, the
emphasis on discouraging opposition offenses should probably go
without saying. But young teams often need mantras and slogans, and
the Celtics have chosen defense as their buzzword.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things started to go our way, and that's a big boost for us,''
Antoine Walker said while preparing for Wednesday's game against
Toronto. ``We feel can score with anyone, but defensively we are
still a little suspect. We are still missing the full four quarters
of defense we need to win on the road. One area you can always be
consistent in is defense.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Celtics are counting on Walker to also perform
consistently and/or spectacularly on offense. Walker scored 39
points in a 99-96 win at New Jersey Saturday and 31 in a 105-101
victory at Washington Monday as the Celtics doubled their season
road-victory total to four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played well on the road trip,'' Walker said. ``I was able to
establish myself inside a lot against New Jersey and get some easy
buckets. And the team got back to running, which is a credit to
Kenny Anderson. He got the ball out to guys and got everyone
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to go out and win two road games is a
confidence-booster. We've had a lot of games we could have won on
the road and you could understand it if we didn't have the talent.
But we feel we have as much talent as anybody in the league from
our first through our 12th player.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by shooting accuracy, Walker has not been consistent
this season. Walker's field goal percentage is 41.7. He shot 25 for
73 during a recent four-game stretch in which the Celtics won once.
But since then, Walker has converted on 29 of 58 shots, setting up
the Celtics for a chance to win more than twice in succession for
the first time since Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been getting a lot from Antoine the last three weeks,''
coach Rick Pitino said. ``He is defending much better, he is more
of a leader. He is focused much more on winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a matter of him just being tired of losing. His head is
in the right place and I love his attitude. He is a court leader
and it is with words. He is not the type who will go out there and
just lead by example. Physically, he is much stronger because he is
spending more time in the weight room. He figured out why the team
was losing and he is doing things to correct it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker was especially effective against the Nets, as he also had
11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get to the low post and make myself as much of an
inside presence as possible,'' Walker said. ``That makes things
easier for Kenny and Paul Pierce. I've been going to the basket and
getting some calls. When you get those calls, it makes you want to
go the basket because you can get to the line. Against New Jersey
we were in the penalty with nine minutes left in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to play basketball the way I'm used to playing _
being versatile and doing a lot of different things on the court,
making sacrifices. I try to lead on the court and I try to lead by
example. We are in a state of emergency if we want to make the
playoffs, and I want to be as consistent as possible, night in and
night out.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked who would guard Vince Carterr, Pitino replied: ``It won't
be Adrian (Griffin).'' Griffin (sprained right ankle) has been on
the injured list since Jan. 9 but could return for Friday's game
against Seattle.

HEINRICHS NAMED US WOMEN'S SOCCER COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She figured she would stay at Virginia for another four, five,
six years, then take a shot at coaching the national team. Then the
federation people asked her to write a what's-my-vision paper for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought okay, no harm in that, I'd love to,'' April
Heinrichs said Tuesday, after she was named the first female coach
of the US women's soccer team and technical director for the entire
program for the next four years. ``And here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs, who captained the team that won the first World Cup
in 1991, succeeds Tony DiCicco, who stepped down in November after
directing the Americans to both the Olympic gold medal and World
Cup title during the last quadrennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to take this position,'' said the 35-year-old
Heinrichs, who will be responsible for both this summer's Olympic
team and the 2002 Cup squad. ``It gives me great pride to come full
circle from player on the national team to coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The circle came around unexpectedly early for Heinrichs, who
leapfrogged Lauren Gregg and Jay Hoffman, DiCicco's top assistants,
to become only one of three females worldwide (along with Sweden's
Marika Domanski Lyfors and Germany's Tina Theune-Meyer) to head
women's national teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``April was the best choice and is the best person for the
job,'' said federation president Dr. S. Robert Contiguglia.
Contiguglia denied that Clive Charles, the men's Olympic (i.e.
under-23) coach turned down the job. ``That's not the case,'' he
said. ``Clive decided to stay with the Olympic team.''
</P>
<P>
   Contiguglia also denied that the federation gave Heinrichs the
job, following three male head coaches, to avoid a gender
discrimination lawsuit. ``That's the first I've heard of that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs' credentials were unquestioned. She was one of
DiCicco's assistants with the 1995 World Cup and 1996 Olympic teams
and coached the under-16 team for three years. She had a 116-70-18
collegiate record at Princeton, Maryland and Virginia, where she
led the Cavaliers to four NCAA tournament appearances in as many
seasons. And Heinrichs was one of the pioneers of the US team,
playing for six seasons and starring alongside Michelle Akers and
Carin Gabarra as strikers on the 1991 Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   ``April has been such a constant source of light and respect for
the team,'' said midfielder Julie Foudy, who played with Heinrichs
in 1991. ``She is an incredible leader, a gifted motivator and a
great tactician. The team was very excited when she was named
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs actually is inheriting two teams -- the Cup champions
who've declined to play for the US during their ongoing contract
dispute and the B squad of collegians and high-schoolers who just
outplayed the Australians, Swedes and Czechs for the Australia Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest challenge will be to whittle down a player pool of
41 to 16 for the Olympics,'' said Heinrichs, whose immediate task
is to put a squad together for a Feb. 6 match with archrival Norway
in Ft. Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   Though Heinrichs will be in the delicate position of coaching
seven former teammates (Akers, Foudy, Mia Hamm, Joy Fawcett,
Kristine Lilly, Brandi Chastain, Carla Overbeck), she says she
doesn't expect any problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I coached them in 1995 and 1996,'' she said. ``I thought we
had a healthy player-coach relationship and I'm looking forward to
picking up where we left off.''

MICROSOFT'S STRONG 4TH-QUARTER EARNINGS BOOSTS NASDAQ

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks were mixed Tuesday as investors took profits
out of blue-chips even as they continued to plow money into high
technology shares.
</P>
<P>
   The divergent patterns in stocks occurred against a backdrop of
rising interest rates, which moved to their highest level in 2{
years. For the first time since 1994, yields on the Treasury's
10-year notes briefly climbed above the yield on benchmark 30-year
bonds. By late in the day, both securities were quoted at a price
that yielded 6.75 percent. The yield of the 30-year bond was up
from 6.69 percent Friday. The 30-year Treasury bond fell 22/32, to
92 3/32.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Microsoft, which reported better-than-expected
fourth-quarter profit after the close of trading, the Nasdaq
composite index narrowly missed setting a record.
</P>
<P>
   The index gained 66.54 points Tuesday, or 1.64 percent, to
4,130.81, just below the Jan. 3 record of 4,131.15.
</P>
<P>
   But investors turned their backs on most of the stocks that make
up the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, which set records Thursday and Friday, fell 162.26
points, a drop of 1.38 percent, to 11,560.72. Only eight of the 30
stocks that make up the index gained in price. Financial service
company stocks led the decline.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index fell 10.01 points, or 0.68
percent, to 1,455.14.
</P>
<P>
   The small-cap Russell 2000 index bucked the trend, and
maintained its status as the best-performing major market index so
far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell rose 5.90 Tuesday, or 1.2 percent, to 513.46.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underpinnings for strength in the market are still
there,'' said Michael Clark, head of U.S. stock trading at Credit
Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are going to be in a trading range for the next six to
eight weeks, due to worries about the Federal Reserve and a
relentless supply of new and secondary stock issues. There is not
much reason to take stocks higher until we get a new perspective on
how higher rates will impact earnings this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman
Brothers, said Tuesday that earnings will remain strong this year,
and that he expects high-flying technology stocks to retain their
position as market leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big cap beats small cap, growth beats value and the leadership
will stay narrow,'' Applegate said at a meeting with reporters.
``Earnings, not valuation, will drive the market this year.''
Applegate said that in the aggregate corporate earnings should rise
14 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bond market analysts said the brief inversion between 10-year
and 30-year Treasury securities was largely because of technical
factors. But there is a broad consensus that the Federal Reserve
will be pushing up short-term interest rates very soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has built in a half-point increase, whether it
comes in one or two moves'' by the Fed, said Donald J. Fine, chief
market analyst at Chase Asset Management. ``If after doing that the
economy shows no signs of slowing, they will tighten again.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee are
seen as likely to approve a rate increase when they hold two days
of meetings that begin Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, fourth quarter earnings reports are living up
to forecasts, and in many cases are exceeding expectations. Still,
a number of stocks were punished Tuesday after reporting strong
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan, a Dow component, was a case in point. The stock
fell 4 11/16, to 123 5/16, even though the big financial services
company's fourth-quarter results were better than Wall Street had
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, which also posted better than expected earnings, was
also punished, but not so severely: the stock closed at 57 15/16,
down 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was one of the few Dow stocks to show life Tuesday,
jumping 3 1/16 to 115 5/16 on the expectation its fourth quarter
results would be strong.
</P>
<P>
   The software giant did better than consensus estimates,
reporting fourth-quarter earnings of 44 cents a share, compared
with an average estimate of 42 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the gains were below the 49 cent-a-share ``whisper''
estimate. In after-hours trading, Microsoft gave up all of its
gains and more. Late Tuesday the stock was quoted at 112, down 3
5/16.
</P>
<P>
   And Motorola, whose shares rose sharply on Friday on
expectations of strong fourth-quarter results, saw investors take
much of those gains back Tuesday after its numbers failed to meet
the rosiest forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The stock fell 6}, to 144\.

BONFIRE COMMISSION HIRES CALIFORNIA FORENSIC CONSULTANT

<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ A California forensic consultant hired
Tuesday to sort out human error in November's deadly Bonfire
collapse said he will investigate all possible causes, including
the administration of Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigation will not ... stop at a certain point,'' said
Chong Chiu, chief executive officer of Performance Improvement
International. ``Whatever will impact the culture of the event, we
will investigate.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiu's comments came a week after school President Ray Bowen
indicated he will resign if it is determined his administration is
at fault through poor supervision of the event which largely is
student sponsored.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents released since the Nov. 18 calamity, at
least two university policies were not followed as students erected
the massive hard timber pile to be burned before the Texas-Texas
A&AMP;M football game.
</P>
<P>
   Two students working on the Bonfire the night of the collapse
were found to have alcohol in their systems despite a school ban on
alcoholic beverages during Bonfire construction.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the unfinished tower had an estimated height of 59 feet
when it collapsed with four of its five levels completed. In the
late 1980s, the school capped the height at 55 feet amid safety and
environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the height played a role in the Bonfire
falling. A preliminary engineering report released last week
indicated that students built the first level built on uneven
ground, causing it to lean. The three other levels above the first
or ground level were built parallel to the center pole that anchors
the structure.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the collapse, which killed 12 and injured
27, Bowen and school officials have appointed a special commission
headed by Houston contractor Leo Linbeck Jr. to determine the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the commission agreed to hire Performance Improvement
International to join three other firms retained two weeks ago to
determine the cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the other consulting firms will look largely at the
design and construction of the Bonfire. The third firm, Kroll
Associates, will coordinate the efforts. Kroll has established a
toll-free hotline for information or anonymous tips regarding the
Bonfire. The number is 1-888-765-3977.
</P>
<P>
   Performance Improvement International of San Clemente has
investigated accidents around the world, including an analysis of
human performance for the 1998 San Francisco blackout and a study
into a 1999 electricity tower collapse in Taiwan that severely
disrupted the economy there.
</P>
<P>
   Chiu said that in all failures, there is usually a human factor
that leads to accidents. Sometimes the human factor plays a direct
role, or sometimes it is a culture that surrounds an event, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't set out to blame anybody, we set out to determine
what happened,'' Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
   Chiu, who has looked at the human causes for other accidents
such as Three Mile Island (Pennsylvania) nuclear accident, said
Bowen's comments about resigning would not affect his company's
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter,'' Chiu said. ``To us we are transparent to
emotion, we just look at the facts. Because he made a comment after
the event, to us, that won't be a causal factor to the event. We
will look at all the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   After the commission hired Performance Improvement
International, Linbeck said the consultants have had concerns about
getting involved in lawsuits, should any be filed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, state Rep. Ron Wilson, D-Houston, said he will seek
an exception in the 2001 Legislature to a state cap that limits the
school's liability to a total of $500,000 should any victims or
their families sue the school.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck said the consultants wanted indemnity protecting them
from litigation, a safety net the school cannot provide. And they
want the school to pay them should they be sought as expert
witnesses in any lawsuits once their investigation is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, commission members and university officials are
struggling with the ramifications of hiring consultants. Though the
commission has selected them, the school will pay for them. The
university will use money drawn from interest earned on
investments, not tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   A final budget for the investigation will not be known for at
least two weeks but Linbeck has estimated the bill might reach
$500,000. That figure could go even higher if the consultants are
paid for time consumed with lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   University spokeswoman Cindy Lawson said the school ``would do
the right thing'' about paying the consultants, though she was not
sure if there would be a ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   The payment issue raised questions about whether the consultants
are working for the commission or for the university, which might
find itself a defendant in a lawsuit. The relationship could create
a situation where the school pays the consultants to testify
against it should the university be found at fault, Linbeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck, who is also chairman of Texans for Tort Reform, said
that the consultants, though paid by the university, are charged
with finding out exactly what happened. He said they will not to
create a finding amenable to university desires.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we thought at any time in the investigation that any member
of the team was skewing their work in a direction that had another
objective in mind ... we'd find a way to get rid of them,'' Linbeck
said.

RAYTHEON SHARES PUMMELED AFTER IT PREDICTS EARNINGS SHORTFALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. may miss earnings forecasts this year by up to $220
million, stunning investors who thought the company had put its
worst news on the table three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The market quickly punished Raytheon's class B stock, which fell
25 percent Tuesday to close at 19, its lowest price in more than
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also warned of fourth-quarter shortfalls, blaming
accounting problems, credit downgrades, and overseas sales woes,
and said it plans to restate financial results for the past three
years after a review of its commercial-aircraft business.
</P>
<P>
   The news followed pledges by Raytheon chief executive Daniel
Burnham to restore the company's credibility among investors after
a string of bad-news surprises last fall. Many problems related to
difficulties Raytheon has had integrating acquisitions, leading to
a restructuring and the layoff of 2,380 workers _ a figure that
came to include up to 300 from a microelectronics plant in Quincy,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But following Tuesday's news, some analysts now worry those
remedies might not be enough, or will take longer to turn the
company around.
</P>
<P>
   The latest news ``Doesn't inspire confidence that the company
knows what's its doing in the individual business units,'' said
Heidi Wood, analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. She downgraded
the company to ``neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood said she was chiefly concerned whether Raytheon had made
enough progess meshing computerized financial controls, which at
one point it kept on 50 different computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Any details would help, others said. ``It's still really tough
to gauge where they are,'' said Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
analyst Joe Nadol, who had previously downgraded the company to
neutral.
</P>
<P>
   In a pointed note to clients Tuesday he said the rating would
stand ``until we feel that all of the bad news is out and the
company has its act together.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Raytheon said it expects fourth-quarter earnings
of between 20 to 25 cents per share, or between $67.7 million to
$84.6 million, versus the 59 cents, or $199.6 million, expected on
average by 13 analysts surveyed by Nelson's Investment Research.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly as a result, Raytheon said, 1999 earnings will be between
$1.15 and $1.20 a share, versus the $1.40 to $1.50 a share Raytheon
said to expect last October.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, Raytheon said it expects to earn between $1.60 to
$1.75 a share, down from between $2.10 to $2.25 per share it said
in October it expected to earn this year. The company has about
338.4 million shares outstanding. Raytheon said it ended 1999 with
a record order backlog, up about 15 percent from the year-earlier
level, and said it had net debt of $9.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release Tuesday Raytheon spelled out many issues,
some new and some recurring, but said little about root causes.
Spokesman David Polk declined to elaborate execpt to say executives
would be more forthcoming when the company releases its formal
financial results on Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The release mentioned ``further erosion in international
opportunities for certain missile programs and missile defense
systems, especially Patriot,'' the air-defense missile whose
slowing sales it blamed last fall. Raytheon also cited higher
interest expenses resulting from a credit rating downgrade in
November, a higher effective tax rate, and delays in gaining
certifications for its Premier I business jet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Raytheon reported ``production and shipment delays
on 19 aircraft, as well as cost growth,'' at its Wichita civilian
aircraft company. All 19 planes are expected to be shipped this
year, Raytheon said.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon said reviews at the aircraft unit follow the
introduction of a new accounting standard, and said it plans to
restate the company's full results back to 1997 by the end of this
week. The impact will be no more than 6 cents per share per year,
Raytheon said.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft's problems worried analysts, who noted it had
previously reported few problems, unlike Raytheon's defense
segments or its engineering and construction business in Cambridge,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also blamed a delay in the signing of a radar contract
with the British military. The company announced the contract win
last June, but didn't finalize the work until Dec. 17, therefore
booking revenue later than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's disclosures prompted Duff &AMP; Phelps Credit Rating Co.
to lower its outlook for Raytheon to negative from stable, noting
the company had missed its debt-reduction target by $200 million.
The agency also noted the shortfalls could prompt Raytheon to sell
more of its business units, an option it said provides the company
some ``financial flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Raytheon agreed to sell a flight training business to
L-3 Communications Corp. for $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   In July Raytheon's widely traded class B shares reached a high
of 74-15/16 on enthusiasm for Burnham, who took over in 1998, and
on the strength of missile replacement orders following NATO's air
campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But on Oct. 12 shares fell 44 percent to 24 1/4 after Burnham
said the company would miss some ambitious profit targets.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has mostly remained in the 20s since as investors
awaited updates about the effectiveness of Burnham's restructuring
that, among other things, split into several pieces the big
Raytheon Systems Co. defense unit. Absent those details, analysts
have seized on the progress of individual programs for hints.
</P>
<P>
   One test is Raytheon's share of a space-based missile defense
system being developed by the Pentagon known as the
``exoatmospheric kill vehicle.'' The device is scheduled for its
second test shot Wednesday night.

BUSH TO APPEAL TO CONSERVATIVES FOR SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Governor George W. Bush is making last-minute
plans to appeal to a convention of 2,000 conservative activists
here and win the group's straw poll on the eve of the GOP's first
presidential caucuses Monday in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer confirmed Tuesday that on Saturday,
Bush will address the annual Conservative Political Action
Conference by satellite from Iowa. The invitation from the group,
which represents the most conservative wing of the Republican
Party, had been extended months ago but was only accepted by Bush
on Monday, said Diana Banister, a CPAC spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is sort of in a panic. He is certainly feel pressure to
at least make an effort to reach out to conservatives who represent
the Republican base,'' Banister said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said Bush considers CPAC ``an important group'' and
was ``pleased to be able to squeeze it into his schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also would like to beat millionaire publisher Steve Forbes,
his closest competitor in Iowa and until this week the only GOP
candidate scheduled to address the convention, in CPAC's
presidential-preference poll. Results of the poll will be released
Saturday afternoon and could aid the winner _ or sting front-runner
Bush _ over the weekend in Iowa, where religious and social
conservatives have a loud voice in party politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be a real embarrassment to Bush in Iowa if he got
spanked by Steve Forbes in the straw poll,'' said L. Brent Bozell,
chairman of the conservative Media Research Center and a Forbes
supporter.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Gary Bauer, former head of the conservative Family
Research Council, mobilized friends and backers into ``Bauer
Power'' and won CPAC's straw poll with 28 percent of the vote. Bush
came in second with 24 percent, though he was not yet a candidate
and did not address the gathering. Forbes, who gave a CPAC speech
in 1999 cautioning conservatives to beware of ``mealy-mouthed
rhetoric'' from candidates with familiar names, came in third with
10 percent of those polled.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer will not participate at CPAC this year, but it is not
because he fears he cannot repeat his first-place straw poll
finish, said Jeffrey Bell, a Bauer adviser. ``With limited
resources, what are you going to invest it in, a satellite feed to
CPAC or campaigning for votes in Iowa?'' asked Bell, noting that
CPAC had scored a ``coup by becoming a player in the nomination
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Forbes informed CPAC that he would give his speech,
scheduled for Thursday, by satellite instead of in person. Former
ambassador Alan Keyes, who had not been expected to appear, told
CPAC officials he now plans to attend. Reform Party presidential
candidate Patrick Buchanan is scheduled to speak Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Because its convention comes so close to the Iowa caucuses, CPAC
officials offered each of the candidates, except Arizona Senator
John McCain, the option to make a speech by satellite. Banister
said McCain was the only candidate to decline the group's initial
invitation on grounds that he does not participate in straw polls.
CPAC and McCain are also at odds over the senator's proposal to end
certain unlimited campaign spending by political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that the best campaign events we can do is being with
conservative voters in New Hampshire and South Carolina, states
that are going to have early primaries,'' said McCain spokesman
Howard Opinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, called
Bush's decision to speak to CPAC ``a striking switch'' resulting
from both his need to suppress Forbes in Iowa and to position
himself as more conservative than McCain, who, two weeks before the
first primary, is running even with him in the polls in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This perfectly epitomizes the change of strategy that has been
forced on Bush by McCain's campaign,'' Kristol said. ``Bush started
off as a centrist, a compassionate conservative, and now he is
running as an orthodox Republican conservative against the
heretical McCain. The kinder, gentler Bush suddenly is sounding
like Tom DeLay,'' the conservative Huuse Republican whip.
</P>
<P>
   Kristol said Bush can't be sanguine about his standing in Iowa.
A new Los Angeles Times poll shows Bush with 43 percent of the vote
against 42 percent of the combined vote going to the more
conservative candidates in the field _ Forbes (25 percent); Keyes
(10 percent); and Bauer (7 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is scary for Bush. Maybe he thinks he can go to CPAC and
pick off some of those conservative voters by claiming he is their
standard bearer,'' Kristol said. ``I don't know if he can pull it
off.''

<P>
   In what amounts to a rare admission of failure, Coca-Cola Co. is
trying to make itself into a friendlier company that will adapt
more to local markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy, emerging from Coca-Cola's recent announcements
and from conversations with people close to the company, involves a
string of personnel moves and related actions intended to improve
its standing on Wall Street and repair its reputation with
consumers, regulators, bottlers and others with whom its
relationships have been damaged over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the company announced that Jack Stahl, who has headed
Coke's business in North America, will become second in command to
Douglas Daft, who was chosen for the chief executive's job in
December. The widely expected announcement and hints of a bigger
shift at the soft drink giant pushed the stock up $3.938 to $65,
well above its October low of under $48.
</P>
<P>
   The changes _ some as obvious as relocating executives outside
of Atlanta _ will affect the company's marketing strategies, both
in the kinds of products it sells and the way it sells them.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes seem designed to improve relations between Coke
and its bottlers, relations that have been strained recently by
rapid increases in the cost of concentrate in the United States and
demands for capital investment from bottlers abroad that were
mandated by Coke executives in Atlanta. The stock price of
Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest Coke bottler, has lost 40
percent of its value in the last year because of depressed profits
in the bottling system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're starting to see new marching orders, which are coming
from the board and from Daft and Stahl,'' said Bill Pecoriello, a
beverage stocks analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., which does
not underwrite stock offerings. Pecoriello issued a lengthy report
Tuesday in which he said Coca-Cola was going through ``the biggest
`sea change' with regard to all aspects of its business in nearly
20 years.'' The company will trim its 29,000-person workforce by at
least 2,000 and scale back its goals for case sales to more
realistic levels, he said after interviewing Coke bottlers and
others in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A Coca-Cola company spokesman said Tuesday that ``management has
been looking at the business for some time,'' but declined to
confirm the details of Pecoriello's report.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After a board meeting in Atlanta on Tuesday, the company said
Stahl, 46, will become president and chief operating officer in
April when Daft officially takes over. M. Douglas Ivester, Coke's
outgoing chairman and chief executive, steadfastly insisted during
his short tenure that he did not need a second in command.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to see a more traditional CEO-COO relationship
with a management team approach,'' said James B. Williams, a Coke
director. ``It's going to be an effective and a different
approach.'' Asked whether power had been too concentrated under
Ivester, he said: ``Each CEO has to to establish his own management
style.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft moved quickly to retain Carl Ware, the company's highest
ranking black executive, who had resigned in November after a
management shuffle that pushed him aside. Ware's departure
concerned some in Atlanta's civil-rights community, particularly
since Coke is the subject of a racial-discrimination lawsuit filed
by several black employees. Earlier this month, Ware was named
executive vice president in charge of corporate affairs and
government relations.
</P>
<P>
   A recurring theme since Daft's appointment has been
decentralization, first signaled by the announcement earlier this
month that executives in charge of Asian and European operations
would live not in Atlanta, but in their territories.
Decentralization will also be key in marketing, where local tastes
and local brands are expected to play a larger role than they have
in the past. Coke's expansion into overseas markets has for years
led with Coca-Cola, regardless of local preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has been the notable exception to that strategy; Coke is
outsold there by Coca-Cola's canned coffee and tea products, which
are among some 200 company brands. Daft, who was group president
for Asia until his promotion, earlier this month named the No. 2
executive in Japan, Stephen C. Jones, as Coke's chief marketing
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the shift is that Coke finds itself
increasingly challenged by cheaper local brands in markets from
Eastern Europe to Brazil and parts of Asia. Instead of its longtime
rival Pepsi-Cola, Coke's chief competitor has turned out to be
lower-priced soft drinks, if not water or juice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that Doug Daft is moving lightning-quick to
get the Coca-Cola Co. heading in the right direction again,'' said
Michael Branca, a beverage stocks analyst with Lehman Brothers,
``putting his best players in positions to make a difference, in
areas where Coke has struggled in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Ivester, the company's global ambitions frequently angered
local officials. Plans to expand by acquiring the Cadbury Schweppes
brands were partly stymied by objections from regulators as far
flung as Mexico, Australia and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester is credited with pushing the consolidation of Coke's
bottlers in the United States and abroad _ something that led to
more efficiencies and initially impressed investors. But analysts
have criticized the company recently for exhorting bottlers to
invest heavily in manufacturing plants and other equipment, based
on sales targets that became increasingly unattainable as economies
around the world sputtered. ``It's critical to see the bottlers
improve their returns on invested capital,'' said Andrew Conway, a
Morgan Stanley analyst.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a conference for investors sponsored by Morgan Stanley late
last year, the chairman and chief executive of a large European
bottler gave a presentation that many in the audience considered
the most abject that they had heard in years from anyone in the
relentlessly optimistic Coke system. The executive, Neville Isdell,
put up what he called ``our Kleenex tissue slide,'' a list of
obstacles like the war in Kosovo that the bottler, Coca-Cola
Beverages, had run into since it went public in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But another problem Isdell mentioned was an enormous $1.5
billion in capital spending, which was ``too far ahead of the
market,'' he conceded. Among those expenses: vending machines,
nearly twice as many by last year as the company had in 1997. The
bottler posted a loss in the in the first half of last year.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst said such problems would continue unless Coke merges
its operations with those of its bottlers. ``Coke's problems are
related to the bottling system, which subsidized Coke's earnings
and are now being subsidized by Coke,'' said Albert Meyer, an
analyst at David Tice &AMP; Co., who has been a steady critic of Coke's
accounting practices.

INVESTMENT BANK EXPLORING OPTIONS FOR HMO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX AND STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Salomon Smith Barney Tuesday began scouting for options
to save Massachusetts' largest HMO from bankruptcy, either by
finding $150 million or so in cash to resuscitate Harvard Pilgrim
Health Care, or by identifying a buyer for the $2.8 billion-a-year
health plan.
</P>
<P>
   A Salomon Smith Barney team led by Thomas Green, who was former
Attorney General Scott Harshbarger's chief deputy, is expected to
tell state officials as early as next week what firm possibilities
exist. But the public may not be told until some indefinite time in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas Reilly would not disclose
Tuesday how Salomon Smith Barney, an investment firm, is being
paid, offering only general reassurances that ``the fee structure
does not in any way favor one option over another.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general stressed that ``no public money is involved
here,'' and that Salomon Smith Barney ``will be compensated from
the assets of Harvard Pilgrim.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers of Harvard Pilgrim's 2-week-old financial crisis
have said that the customary method of compensating investment
bankers, as a percentage of the value of the ultimate deal, might
favor a sale of the nonprofit insurer rather than a more limited
recapitalization plan.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said in an interview that preliminary contacts had
already been made with possible rescuers, ``but we've got to
determine what's real.''
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney, which Reilly said has the world's largest
health care practice among investment bankers, will ``test the
marketplace'' to get ``a firmer feel for which of these options are
real,'' added J. David Leslie, a private insurance specialist who
has been named special assistant attorney general for the Harvard
Pilgrim crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary goal,'' Reilly said, ``is to recapitalize Harvard
Pilgrim,'' that is, to find investors who can provide the
wherewithal to keep the health plan going as a nonprofit.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly refused to attach a dollar figure to that goal. ``We have
a general sense of what it would take,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under a Harvard Pilgrim bond issue that was to have gone to
market last week, the health maintenance organization would have
realized about $120 million from the sale of five of the eight
Boston-area health centers leases to Harvard Vanguard Medical
Associates, a spinoff group now an independent company.
</P>
<P>
   The bond issue was aborted by the sudden news that Harvard
Pilgrim's 1999 losses were nearly $60 million higher than
previously thought, a disclosure that prompted Reilly and state
insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt to ask the Supreme Judicial
Court to place the health plan in receivership.
</P>
<P>
   The eight health centers represent Harvard Pilgrim's most
accessible capital assets. A recent independent appraisal put their
value, on a current-use basis, at $144.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Health care specialists who have reviewed Harvard Pilgrim's
finances say that amount would return the HMO to solvency. However,
it is not clear whether it would be sufficient to clear up the
nonprofit HMO's long-term problems, following this month's
disclosure that 1999 losses could reach $177 million.
</P>
<P>
   If recapitalization of Harvard Pilgrim turns out not to be
possible, Reilly said the investment firm should be ready with
names of possible buyers, who could include out-of-state for-profit
companies. ``Everything is on the table,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Everything, he added, except state funding. ``The options we
have asked the investment bankers to pursue, those we're most
interested in, do not involve any spending of state money.''
</P>
<P>
   One local health care finance specialist said potential
investors might be attracted by the promise of some state support,
such as a loan or bond guarantee backed by the full faith and
credit of the commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly would not rule out a state loan guarantee. ``It's
premature to talk about it,'' said Dean Richlin, Reilly's chief
deputy.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Salomon Smith Barney may have had an inside track,
among the three firms that were finalists for the Harvard Pilgrim
job, is that it is intimately familiar with Harvard Pilgrim's
current finances, having performed due diligence on the recent
aborted bond issue, which was sponsored by the Massachusetts Health
and Educational Facilities Authority, an agency that arranges
financing for nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon also handled Harvard Pilgrim's 1998 sale of $195 million
in HEFA bonds, mostly a refinancing, according to Robert Ciolek,
the agency's executive director.

IN A NEW MILLENNIUM, RELIGION SHOWS ITS FACE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Ann Wilson Lloyd's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
artists' residences.  
 By ANN WILSON LLOYD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sex and politics, two of three topics once forbidden at polite
dinner parties, have been abundant in recent art. So is God the
last taboo?
</P>
<P>
   Midcentury artists turned away from religion and toward
modernist universalism. They kept beliefs pretty much to
themselves, or abstracted them, a la Barnett Newman and Mark
Rothko. Until recently, the art world sanctioned little work with
overt religious content unless it possessed a critical, subversive
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Postmodernists, however, have begun to embrace religion as part
of the culture. Now, spurred by the millennium, contemporary art
can again be unabashedly faith-based, to borrow political argot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith: The Impact of Judeo-Christian Religion on Art at the
Millennium,'' opening this Sunday at the Aldrich Museum of
Contemporary Art in Ridgefield, Conn., samples work by 36 living
artists from six countries who variously celebrate, wrestle with,
deconstruct or critique religion.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition confines itself to the Judeo-Christian tradition
partly to rein things in, but also because it has been the dominant
influence in Western culture, says Harry Philbrick, the museum's
director. Philbrick and two artists in the show, Christian Eckart
and Osvaldo Romberg, have organized the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Philbrick says the show has flushed out the long-suppressed or
concealed religious backgrounds of several participants. ``Even
though many artists deal openly with issues of race, gender, class
and sexuality, repeatedly we heard, `No one's ever asked me about
religion before.'''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Ritchie, for example, makes colorful, complex paintings
and installations that recall abstract scientific schematics, but
imbedded within them are arcane systems based on Judeo-Christian
myth, specifically, he notes in an artist's statement, regarding
angels and the doctrinal clash between concrete image and abstract
word.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perception in the art world that there's a
fundamentalist, right wing, Christian Coalition juggernaut out
there,'' Philbrick says. ``Of course, the world is a lot more
complex than that. There are all sorts of levels of thought, belief
and faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Three local churches and one synagogue have agreed to display
works from the exhibition. These include fonts cast in the shape of
renowned cathedrals by Nicholas Kripal, stained glass by Jo
Yarrington, sculpture by Justen Ladda, photographs by Lyle Ashton
Harris and painting by Romberg, one of the curators.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the underlying hypotheses of this show is, `Does
contemporary art have something to offer religion, and vice
versa?''' says Eckart, the other curator. ``From the first
curatorial meeting, we felt the most interesting expression of
faith was a test of faith _ challenging but not necessarily cynical
or pessimistic _ from within or without the spiritual or religious
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Western-trained artists have been influenced by Western
religious art, either directly through imagery or indirectly
through ethics. There tends to be an underlying Judeo-Christian
ethical and moral imperative somewhere. Even the most progressive
projects, like socio-political, didactic work, are about inclusion
or democratic ideals and are essentially morality plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckart's contribution to the exhibition is an elegant trio of
luminous monochrome paintings on shaped aluminum. Their lacquered
industrial finish reveals no trace of the artist's hand, which he
intends as a postmodern contribution to the spiritually sublime
state that, historically, certain artists sought to invoke.
</P>
<P>
   In his catalog essay, Eckart writes that a fundamental aspect of
proto-modernity required Renaissance sacred art to shift from ``an
external, didactic site to an internal and personal one,''
requiring ``committed participation on behalf of the viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers will be able to participate in completing the work of
Romberg. His outdoor installation of stacked fire logs in the
museum's sculpture garden comprises overlapping archaeological
footprints of a mosque, synagogue, temple and cathedral. When the
show ends on May 29, visitors can take the logs to burn, sending
the ghosts of these buildings heavenward, where, the artist says,
they belong.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Romberg is Jewish; he was born in Argentinaas lived and
worked in Israel and now in Philadelphia. He sees a growing corps
of international artists from all religious backgrounds, who, like
him, find the spiritual potential of art supplanting the need for
religion. ``I believe art can help society become more spiritual,''
he says. ``And artists can be the engineers of emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 36 artists in the exhibition, about half identified their
religious background, according to the museum staff. Of those,
eight are Catholics, four Jewish, two Baptist, one Mormon and one
Quaker, with two generically listing themselves as Christians. The
mix suggests that the rich visual tradition of the Catholic Church,
as well as its vast contributions to Western art history, are
particularly lasting legacies for artists reared as Catholics.
Influential Catholic doctrines have also supplied grist (or axes)
for further grinding.
</P>
<P>
   Petah Coyne's new sculpture for the exhibition is a minimalist
wall-like construction investigating idealized femininity. It
involves nuns, and Marilyn Monroe and her alter ego, Norma Jean.
Ms. Coyne says she is consciously revisiting her Catholic
upbringing in recent work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The psychology of that past is imperative,'' Ms. Coyne says.
``The nuns always told us they were as pure and whole as the
Madonna, the epitome of women, the best of women. But the church's
stance on women is so second class it bothers me terribly. So I put
these nuns literally in the wall, their faces hidden, except for
glimpses from the back.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds: ``There were some beautiful things about the church. I
try to use those in my work too. It brings up so much material.
It's given me my art, or, at least, a lot to work around, but it's
not the main thing. Feminism is in all my work, as are other
elements. I think this new piece has less to do with faith and more
to do with humanity and being female in the world, but because the
whole thing is couched for me in religion, I can't separate it.''
</P>
<P>
   One question the exhibition raises, according to the curators,
is whether non-Catholics have less leftover angst with which to
work. Another is whether today's younger artists of all religious
backgrounds simply feel freer to broach the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ethan Acres, 30, an evangelical street preacher from
Las Vegas who is also a trained artist, still practices his
gospel-based, born-again faith, professing his sometimes quirky
version of things overtly in his work.
</P>
<P>
   Acres' art, based on normally fire-and-brimstone topics like
Armageddon and creationism, is instead good-natured and funny.
``Miracle at La Brea,'' a photographic print, depicts a
Tyrannosaurus rex with wings ascending into heaven from out of Los
Angeles' famous tar pits. Some fundamentalists might see this more
as a sendup than a testament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most common misconception people have, but I hope my
art presents Christianity in a new and interesting way,'' he says.
``I grew up around hell fire and brimstone'' _ he began preaching
at 9, with his stepfather, in a rural Alabama Baptist church. ``But
what touched me most was laughter in church. I believe humor is
just as powerful an expression of faith as terror or guilt.''

FED SURVEY SHOWS MORE STOCK OWNERSHIP, GREATER WEALTH GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A soaring stock market fueled an unprecedented increase in
wealth for Americans between 1995 and 1998 as the number of
families owning stock rose to record levels, according to a Federal
Reserve Board survey charting changes over the three-year period.
</P>
<P>
   While the nation is enjoying a golden era of economic prosperity
and low unemployment, the Fed's 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances
also found evidence the boom has been stingy in distributing the
wealth to low-income wage earners, who fell behind because they
lacked the wherewithal to invest in stocks. In a troubling trend,
Americans across the income spectrum are more deeply in debt than
they were in the early part of the decade, though debt burdens are
heaviest for low-income individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rich are getting richer, and they are getting richer
faster than the poor,'' David Wyss, economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's
DRI, an economic consulting firm in Lexington, Mass., concluded
from the report.
</P>
<P>
   While middle-class and wealthy Americans' prosperity rose in
concert with the great bull market of the 1990s, what distinguished
the Fed's 1998 survey was the enormity of gains compared with past
surveys. In 1998, Americans' wealth far surpassed levels reached in
the late 1980s, when the stock market also was rising rapidly. The
Fed has conducted the survey every three years since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``While income continued a moderate upward trend'' in recent
years, ``net worth grew strongly, and the increase in net worth was
broadly shared by different demographic groups,'' the Fed report
said. Financial gains were especially large among middle-aged and
retired Americans in their peak saving and investing years.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, experts said, points to the growing dependence of
Americans on the stock market for their financial well-being. The
market has achieved a new record every year since 1995, producing
profits that could evaporate rapidly if there were a correction.
</P>
<P>
   Stock profits through 1998 were enormous. The value of stock
mutual funds and individual shares held by top-earning Americans
surged, at the median, to $150,000 in 1998 _ up 75 percent over the
past three years and triple levels a decade ago. Middle-class
Americans saw their stock portfolios grow 35 percent over the past
three years, to $11,500, while low-income earners posted small
gains in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, median family wealth _ the net worth for a family
that fell smack in the middle of all Americans _ rose 17.6 percent
from 1995 through 1998, a period in which the Dow Jones industrial
average surged from 3700 to more than 9200. That was more than
twice the growth rate of median family wealth for the prior three
years, 1992 to 1995. (The survey uses net worth to measure wealth.
Net worth subtracts a family's liabilities, such as a mortgage,
from its assets, such as real estate, stocks, and other
investments.)
</P>
<P>
   Looked at another way, wealth shot up even more. Average net
worth _ which gives more weight to the portfolios of the wealthy,
such as Microsoft Corp. chairman Bill Gates or Internet executives
_ than do median figures, rose nearly 26 percent and reflected the
ballooning portfolios of the elite.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's survey was based on detailed interviews with 4,300
families. Although officials did not disclose individuals included
in the survey, the study was supplemented with tax records to
provide better information on the difficult-to-decipher holdings of
the richest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Driving big increases for some was a record number of US
families _ nearly half _ who owned stock, either directly by
purchasing individual shares themselves, or through mutual funds
and retirement accounts. A decade ago, less than a third of
American families held stock. (Stock options, which are difficult
to value, were not included in wealth totals.)
</P>
<P>
   Investing in individual stocks, which lost favor when Americans
began pouring money into mutual funds in the early 1980s, made a
comeback, which experts said may be due to the growing popularity
of on-line brokerage accounts, day trading, and Internet stocks.
Direct investments in shares accounted for nearly 23 percent of all
financial assets in 1998, a 7 percentage-point jump in three years.
Mutual funds, which also included huge stock portfolios, were
little changed at 12.5 percent of all financial assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been saying for decades that it would be a good
thing when workers . . . were stock owners,'' said John Weicher, a
senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. That trend toward more stock
ownership ``is good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Going against the broad trend of Americans getting ahead were
the figures for those who earn $25,000 or less. Even though some
had stock profits, the median net worth of low-income Americans
declined by 20 to 25 percent from 1995 to 1998. The median net
worth also dipped for minorities, in contrast to big gains among
those with higher incomes and among white Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But even for those whose portolios are flush, longer-term trends
are less spectacular, said Edward Wolff, a leading expert on wealth
data. The Gulf War recession and a sagging stock market in the wake
of the 1987 correction took away much of the gains earned in the
stock market runup of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of (the gains are) just catch-up to where it should've
been,'' said Wolff, an economics professor at New York University.
Looking at gains over the past decade are ``not as spectacular as
looking to '95 to '98.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, debt levels are up sharply. Nearly 13 percent
of Americans spend more than 40 percent of their income on debt,
including mortgages on homes. That is up from a 11 percent or less
in all prior year's surveys. ``People are mortgaging themselves to
death so that they can buy a slightly bigger car,'' Wolff said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite wider ownership of stocks, Weicher of the Hudson
Institute estimated that a quarter of Americans' wealth still rests
in their homes, with only about 9 percent in stocks. A record
two-thirds of all families own their primary residence, the Fed
survey said. More are also entering the financial mainstream: 90
percent of families now have a checking account.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Over the last two weeks, a treacherous and incurable
plant disease called citrus canker that began showing up in
backyards five years ago has been migrating into commercial groves
in South Florida, threatening the state's $8.5-billion citrus fruit
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The disease has struck at least 20 commercial lime groves in
Miami-Dade County, the hardest hit area. To try to check its
advance, the state has quarantined nearly 700 square miles of land
in and around the groves and has bulldozed and burned nearly
200,000 exposed and infected trees. Nothing else can stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is very, very serious,'' said Michael Hornyak, an
official of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and a director of a
Citrus Canker Eradication Program, which has dispatched 125 state
and federal inspectors into groves throughout South Florida. ``We
do not believe we see the full extent of the spread,'' Hornyak
said. ``California, Texas, all these states are at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials say citrus canker's potential damage dwarfs other
periodic scourges of the state's citrus crops, like winter freezes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most trees recover from a freeze,'' said Andrew LaVigne,
executive vice president of Florida Citrus Mutual, the industry's
trade association in Lakeland. ``Usually the loss is just the fruit
of the tree. With canker, you lose the tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Canker was first detected in the Gulf States in 1910. It was
declared eradicated in 1933, after 258,000 trees had been destroyed
in Florida. It reappeared periodically and between 1986 and 1992 it
was detected at 13 sites in four Florida counties, leading to the
destruction of almost 34,000 trees in commercial groves, according
to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The citrus canker, a round, yellowish blister that forms on
leaves, limbs and fruit, cripples the tree, causing leaves and
fruit to fall prematurely. It poses no threat to human or animal
health, and does not affect the flavor of the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Its infestation is concentrated south of Miami, around Homestead
and Florida City. Tuesday, state agriculture officials said they
had inspected 581 of the area's 3,000 acres of commercial lime
groves and found that 551 had been infected or exposed. All their
trees will be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The canker has spread beyond Miami-Dade, infecting groves in
Broward, Manatee, Collier, Hillsborough and Hendry counties.
</P>
<P>
   In Homestead on Monday, Craig Wheeling approached a grove of his
lime trees, all bearing the star-like white blossoms that in a
month should turn to fruit. He stopped within five feet so he would
not carry bacteria to other trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far we've had approximately 200 acres that have had
positive indications of canker,'' said Wheeling, chief executive of
Brooks Tropicals, the nation's leading producer of limes. ``They're
likely to be burned.'' He said about 1,800 acres looked unaffected
as yet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under quarantine, no tree's fruit may be moved from the areas.
The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has
begun removing all citrus trees within 1,900 feet of an infected
tree.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak was traced to a home near Miami International
Airport in 1995. Then the disease began appearing at other
residential sites.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the state began the eradication program. Raising the
alarm three years ago, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Bob
Crawford issued a statement appealing for the public's help in
``waging a battle against one of the most devastating, highly
contagious diseases known to citrus trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the citrus canker spread through more
residential areas. Then, strewn by the wind and rain of last year's
fires and hurricanes, it was discovered on Jan. 5 at an abandoned
commercial grove in Florida City, 35 miles south of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The disease migrates with more stealth than a medfly, officials
said. Wind and water carry it. ``Birds carry it on their feet,''
LaVigne said. Growers like Wheeling fight it by spraying their
field workers' boots with chlorine.
</P>
<P>
   Outbreaks have been detected off and on for years in Florida
since 1910, but it has been mostly confined to residential sites
and has been eradicated before reaching many groves.
</P>
<P>
   As citrus farming has grown into an $8.5-billion industry,
Florida's second biggest after tourism, the potential damage of
widespread infection is pronounced. Few orange and grapefruit
groves have been infected, as yet, although grapefruits are highly
susceptible to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Just north of Homestead in the community of Princeton, Herbert
Yamamura, owner of Limeco Inc., said 265 acres of his 400 acres in
lime groves had been found infected. He expects them to be
bulldozed and burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't checked the other acres,'' Yamamura said. He said
each tree was worth $26 and each acre had 242 trees. So his groves
represent an investment of $2.5 million.

 &HT;    Brunell not ducking a rematch

<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Mark Brunell was waiting a minute or two at
his locker during the Jaguars' lunch break Tuesday. He was trying
to stand still as he waited for reporters to assemble.
</P>
<P>
   So much is on the line and so much energy is ready to be
expended in a quest to beat the Tennessee Titans in Sunday's AFC
Championship Game. When Brunell eventually got to talking, he
bounced impatiently on his feet, emphasizing each word.
</P>
<P>
   They Jaguars aren't ducking anything. After two losses to
Tennessee this season, they get a third try to beat the Titans,
with everything on the line.
</P>
<P>
   And here Mark Brunell is, knowing that the road to the Super
Bowl ends in Atlanta and wanting no part of waiting. ``I guess you
could call it `unfinished business,''' Brunell said. ``We would
have hated to finish the season without having gotten another shot
at these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Brunell occasionally rubbed his left kneecap as he
spoke, he insists that the knee is sound. And he can thank the
Miami Dolphins for that. In the 62-7 laugher of a divisional
playoff Saturday, Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin was able both to win
big and to rest Brunell. Surprisingly mobile for a man who had been
injured by the Titans in Week 15, Brunell played just 18 minutes
Saturday. He completed 5 of 9 passes for 105 yards and two scores,
and the Jaguars led 38-0, so the quarterback took a seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knee feels great,'' Brunell said. ``The game against Miami
couldn't have gone better, as far as the knee is concerned. I got
hit a couple of times, but it felt strong, and I was able to move
around a little bit. I expect it Sunday to be 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   That is great news for the Jaguars, who have watched Brunell
push them to 13 winning fourth-quarter drives over five seasons.
Although the Titans have beaten the Jaguars twice, the game that
will determine a Super Bowl assignment is more likely to resemble
the 20-19 type in Week 3 than the 41-14 blowout in Nashville last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mindset is that it's a new game,'' Brunell said. ``One,
I'm glad that we're at home. And certainly, we're facing a team
that's playing great football right now. Defensively, they're
incredible. They have every reason to have confidence coming in
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars probably could have gotten past the Dolphins with
backup Jay Fiedler, but they aren't likely to conquer the Titans
without their best quarterback. In five seasons with the Jaguars,
Brunell has assumed a position in the passing statistics alongside
Joe Montana, Steve Young and Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Jacksonville offensive tackle Leon Searcy says, ``Mark's
the man who puts food on my table. He's the breadwinner. Without
him, the family's not complete.''
</P>
<P>
   With the players around him having matured since a 20-9 loss to
New England in the 1996 AFC title game, Brunell senses that the
outcome will not be the same this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't the young team we were that '96 season,'' he said.
``Some guys have been around for a while and have played in big
games before. A lot of that shows up in how the younger players
watch the older players prepare. Putting in extra time. More film.
Working a little extra hard. Getting a little more excited. That's
real important.''
</P>
<P>
   So are the mind games that will be played in the media all week.
The Titans must wonder how they can be 7-point underdogs while
representing the only two losses on Jacksonville's record. Not to
mention hearing all the Jaguars proclaim that they wanted the
Titans all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they're taking it (from us) as that being a cocky
statement, but it really isn't,'' Brunell said. ``We would like to
play them because they beat us a couple of times. It's really as
simple as that. It's not an in-your-face kind of comment. We wanted
another shot at the team that beat us pretty bad and also beat us
here at home. It would be a way to complete our season if we could
beat them and answer a few questions as to who's the better team.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader emerging from him, Brunell said, ``We've got great
character on this team. This has been our closest team so far. Guys
have got a lot of leadership on this team, a lot of accountability.
Nobody wants to let the other guy down, and that might be the most
important thing about a team. Nobody wants to be the one to mess it
up for everybody else.''

VERRMONT GOVERNOR DEAN TO BACK GORE

   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Howard Dean, the governor of Vermont, is
expected to endorse Vice President Al Gore for president Wednesday
in Lebanon, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement is to take place during a tour of a children's
center there. Dean, who was not available for comment Tuesday, is a
former chairman of the national governors' association and of the
Democratic governors' association.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a physician who made health care the centerpiece of
his early tenure as governor of Vermont. In 1992, Dean signed a
bill to negotatiate with insurance companies for universal
coverage. That bill was later rejected by the Vermont legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Dean also promoted early childhood development with a Success by
Six prevention program that offered home visits to babies. And he
has worked to subsidize health insurance for children.
</P>
<P>
   In endorsing Gore, Dean is expected to say that he favors Gore's
health care plan over the proposal offered by Bill Bradley, the
former New Jersey senator. Gore's plan would attempt to cover all
children and their families by the end of the next president's
administration.

   IOWA CITY, Iowa _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley vowed on Tuesday to
continue his insurgent campaign for president through at least the
March 7 ``Super Tuesday'' primaries even if he loses to Vice
President Al Gore in the first two events of the nominating season
in Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's remarks suggest that Gore, considered the favorite for
the Democratic nomination, cannot count on knocking Bradley out of
the race quickly and could face an extended campaign that would
leave the eventual winner penniless.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Bradley trailing Gore by a wide margin in Iowa, which
holds its caucuses on Monday. But the two are thought to be running
even in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore said they have always expected Bradley to fight on
until the March 7 primaries, which include New York, where Bradley
played professional basketball for the Knicks from 1967 until 1977.
California, Ohio, Georgia and seven other states also vote on March
7, which Bradley refers to as the ``national primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley made his remarks on Tuesday in response to questions
about how he compares with insurgents of the past, particularly
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who challenged
President Jimmy Carter in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy lost in Iowa, 59 percent to 31 percent, and never gained
the momentum he needed to unseat Carter. Nevertheless, with limited
resources, he managed to win the New York and California primaries
and kept his campaign going until the convention, though Carter's
nomination had become a foregone conclusion by then.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bradley said he was different from Kennedy because
he has matched Gore in fund-raising while Kennedy lacked the
resources to sustain a national campaign after his poor Iowa
showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question was, did he have resources to go on,'' Bradley
said of Kennedy. ``I'm not sure he did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is a separate national campaign,'' he continued
during a news conference in a high school in this university town.
``And we have the resources to compete in that campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign also announced on Tuesday that Gov. John
Kitzhaber of Oregon will on Wednesday become the first sitting
governor to endorse Bradley. ``He thinks Senator Bradley's got the
right approach on health care,'' said Bob Applegate, a spokesman
for Kitzhaber, a physician.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Aides to Gore say they think Bradley has had a poor couple of
weeks in Iowa. They assert that Gore decisively won a Jan. 8 debate
in Des Moines, has effectively attacked Bradley's positions on farm
policy and has won over many undecided Democrats by picking up the
endorsement of Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore aides also contend that recent attacks by Bradley
against Gore's record, including his votes in Congress on tobacco
legislation 15 years ago, show that Bradley is worried that the
race is slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's supporters are also concerned that Bradley could win
just enough delegates on March 7 to block Gore from clinching the
nomination. The campaign could then drag into the March 14
primaries in Texas, Florida and four other southern states.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore's supporters are confident the vice president can
knock Bradley out of the race on March 14, they are also worried
that the added expense of carrying the fight south will leave his
campaign bankrupt. For that reason, they say, pressure will grow on
Bradley to drop out if he loses in both Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are in a quixotic mission that can only drain
Democratic time and resources, you might come to the conclusion
that it would be to the benefit of the party and the country to get
out,'' said Rep. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who is
supporting Gore.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Former Washington Redskins general manager Charley Casserly will be
hired as the vice president of football operations for Houston's
NFL expansion team, sources said Tuesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Casserly, who won three Super Bowl rings during his 22 years
with the Redskins, could be introduced as early as today, a league
source said.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Bob McNair and executive vice president Steve Patterson
were in New York on Tuesday for an NFL meeting, and they were
expected to return to Houston today for the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly's multiyear contract is expected to be signed when he
comes to Houston for the announcement. A source close to McNair
said details were still being worked out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly, who spent his entire NFL career with the Redskins
before new owner Daniel Snyder fired him before this season, will
run the personnel side of the operation. The first head coach won't
be hired until after the 2000 season at the earliest, with the team
set to begin play in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly was one of only two candidates interviewed by McNair
and Patterson. Joe Mack, who helped start up expansion teams in
Carolina and Cleveland, was the other candidate.
</P>
<P>
   McNair said he was impressed with Casserly from the first time
they talked on the telephone. McNair said he was even more
impressed when they met in person 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly also talked with the Jets and Saints. A league source
said the Steelers tried and failed to get him to interview this
week for the job vacated last week by director of football
operations Tom Donahoe, who resigned after losing a power struggle
with coach Bill Cowher.
</P>
<P>
   Cowher and Casserly are good friends after serving on the NFL
competition committee for years.
</P>
<P>
   The league source said Casserly spoke with a couple of teams on
the telephone but wouldn't agree to interview in person because he
was so close to completing a deal with McNair.
</P>
<P>
   McNair said from the start that his first choice was to hire
someone who had been successful running the football side of the
operation. Later, he said he wanted someone with experience in
scouting, contracts, the salary cap and free agency. Casserly ran
the whole show in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This season was the ideal time for Casserly to be out of work,
because the Redskins won the NFC East and advanced to the second
round of the playoffs. Almost every move Casserly made before he
was fired paid off this season.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was out of a job, Pro Football Weekly voted him
the NFL Executive of the Half-Season.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly traded for quarterback Brad Johnson. Two receivers
Casserly drafted _ Michael Westbrook and Albert Connell _ had their
best seasons. Running back Stephen Davis, another Casserly pick,
developed into one of the best in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly elected to wheel and deal in the draft. He ended up
with Georgia cornerback Champ Bailey, who was exceptional. And,
most important of all, Casserly left Washington with three No. 1
picks in the April draft.
</P>
<P>
   By firing Casserly with a year left on his contract, Snyder
actually did him a favor. Casserly worked for ESPN Radio, and he
had a lot of time on his hands to prepare for his interview with
McNair, who said he was impressed with how organized Casserly was.
</P>
<P>
   Because Casserly didn't have an NFL job this season for the
first time since he was hired in 1977 as an unpaid intern by late
Redskins coach George Allen, he was able to get his foot in
McNair's door first. And Casserly took advantage of being first in
line.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking with McNair on the telephone several times over
the months, Casserly had his first face-to-face meeting with McNair
in Houston 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Casserly and his wife, Bev, and daughter, Shannon, came to
Houston last Thursday and didn't leave until Sunday. While Casserly
continued to meet with McNair, his wife and daughter looked at
neighborhoods and schools.

 &HT;    Titans at home on road
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Marcus Robertson sought out fellow defensive
back Samari Rolle after the Titans put away the Colts on Sunday
night to earn a trip to the AFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at him after the game,'' Robertson said, ``and I
said, 'We've got the Jacksonville killer, so we're going to be all
right.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rolle has four career interceptions _ all against the Jaguars in
Tennessee's two victories over Jacksonville this season. He had the
game-ending interception in the 20-19 win Sept. 26. On Dec. 26,
Tennessee won 41-14 in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Titans prepare to face the Jaguars for the third
time, history is not on their side. They're still considered David
to the Jaguars Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   Since the AFL and NFL merged in 1970, no team has beaten the
same team three times in one season with the final win coming on
the road. Sunday's game will be at Alltel Stadium. Of the 12 teams
who had a chance to sweep, seven did it, but only with the last
game at home.
</P>
<P>
   However, Tennessee is comfortable on the road, a result of the
team's two-years of wandering before it settled into its permanent
home here. The Titans played in Memphis and at Vanderbilt Stadium
in Nashville before Adelphia Coliseum opened.
</P>
<P>
   That odyssey, said running back Eddie George, ``toughened us
up... for everything that we're battling now. For two years, every
game was a road game. We played in a lot of hostile environments _
including our home games.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the Titans are confident entering Sunday's game,
they're not brashly guaranteeing a win.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why they ``own'' the Jaguars, winning four out of five
games in Alltel, George laughed. ``That's you saying that,'' he
said. ``We'll go down there with a good game plan and try to get a
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the teams are familiar with each other's tendencies,
``I don't think there's going to be any surprises,'' said
quarterback Steve McNair, who had five touchdown passes in the
second win. ``It's just a matter of winning the one-on-one
battles.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Titans' dominance, Jacksonville is favored to win
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like being the underdogs,'' receiver Yancey Thigpen said.
``When you're underdogs, nobody expects you to win. Around here,
our motto is, `Expect the unexpected.' ``
</P>
<P>
   As well as the expected, which is that Jacksonville wants to
avoid the disgrace of losing three times to the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something hard to live with,'' Thigpen said. ``If we
limit the turnovers, and so do they, it's going to be whoever wants
it the most, who can pound on each other most, and cause the other
one to `give,' basically.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said the ``bitter rivalry'' has been heating up ever
since the Jaguars played their first franchise game against the
then-Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love competing against each other,'' he said. ``There's a
lot of trash (talk), believe me. Guys are on the telephone now.''

HIGH COURT HANDS TEXAS HISPANICS A MAJOR VOTING DEFEAT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hispanic voters in the Houston and San Antonio
areas Tuesday lost a Supreme Court challenge to their local school
boards' method of electing members, which the Latinos claimed saps
their voting strength.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' refusal, without comment, to hear the voters'
appeal marked a stunning defeat for Hispanics in the Pasadena and
Alamo Heights school districts who saw the Supreme Court as perhaps
their last hope to ensure adequate Latino representation on the
boards.
</P>
<P>
   The Pasadena Independent School District, which includes parts
of Houston, has had only one Hispanic trustee, and the Alamo
Heights Independent School District has had none.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic voters are now left to seek relief legislatively
when districts are redrawn after this year's census, said the
Latinos' attorney, Jose Garza of McAllen.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic voters had challenged the at-large election systems
in the Pasadena and Alamo Heights districts, saying the voting
schemes diluted Latinos' electoral influence and prevented
Hispanics from getting elected.
</P>
<P>
   But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans
disagreed last winter, prompting the voters' ill-fated appeal to
the justices.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics comprise a high percentage but not a majority of the
two school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos, for example, make up about 30 percent of the Pasadena
Independent School District, which covers 85 square miles of
southeastern Harris County and includes parts of Houston, South
Houston and Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic students make up 42 percent of the student body. A
seven-member board of trustees governs the district.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 percent of the Alamo Heights Independent School
District near San Antonio is Hispanic. But Hispanics account for
about 24 percent of the student body.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pasadena, a seven-member board of trustees governs the
district.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the population figures, the 5th Circuit said Pasadena and
Alamo Heights could not have weakened the Hispanics' vote because
no election precinct could reasonably be drawn in which Latinos
would comprise more than half the population. Because having
majority voting strength was never a possibility, Hispanics cannot
say their votes have been dampened, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the school district hailed the high court's decision
to leave the electing method intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with the outcome. It is what we expected,''
said Kirk Lewis, a spokesman for the Pasadena school district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known from the beginning that we were in compliance with
the voting regulations. We have done everything we can do make
voting more accessible to all of our community. Our board and our
community believe in the at-large system because it makes all seven
board members responsible for the entire community not just one
segment.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Orozco, the only Hispanic member on the school board,
said she, too, was pleased with the high court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy with it because I know that we were not
discriminating either in our voting or in the use of our funds in
our school district. We are serving all of our children equally. At
this point I would say I'm extremely happy with the outcome,'' said
Orozco, 63, a retired executive secretary, who has been on the
board almost 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Orozco said she was to be elected to the school board even
though she is a Hispanic female because of her involvement in the
district for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that anyone can be elected to the school district if
they campaign with the interest of children at heart and not with
any other political agenda,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Celestino M. Perez Jr., who was a plaintiff in the case and
represented the group Pasadena Citizens for Equitable
Representation, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Circuit, in the decisions the justices let stand, also
rejected the voters' argument that the federal Voting Rights Act's
protection of minorities required school districts, in some
instances, to count all Hispanics, including non-U.S. citizens,
when determining the population of voting precincts.
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of Hispanic non-U.S. citizens would have increased
the Latino populations in Pasadena and Alamo Heights, thereby
enabling the school districts to draw majority-Hispanic precincts,
the voters said. But the 5th Circuit said the law protects only the
voting rights of U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that it would be patently absurd'' for a
court to count noncitizens among a population of eligible voters,
Pasadena's attorney, Bernard Brooks of nearby Stafford, said
Tuesday. ``The Voting Rights Act only protects those people who can
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Alamo Heights' attorney, C. Robert Heath of Austin, echoed
Brooks in saying the 5th Circuit correctly interpreted the Voting
Rights Act and that the justices properly rejected the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's rejection of the appeal was also a loss for
the Clinton administration, which had urged the justices to
interpret the Voting Rights Act broadly to give Hispanics greater
electoral strength.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, in a legal brief to the high court, said the
5th Circuit wrongly decided that a minority group's voting strength
can be weakened only if that group could reasonably comprise a
majority in at least one precinct. The Voting Rights Act protects
the electoral strength of closely knit minority groups, such as
Hispanics, even when they constitute a small but vocal minority,
the administration wrote in its brief.
</P>
<P>
   By protecting the voting strength of Hispanics, the law
preserves the possibility that a small number of white voters could
cross over and help a minority of Hispanics elect a Latino board
member, wrote U.S. Solicitor General Seth Waxman, the
administration's top lawyer before the high court.
</P>
<P>
   But a weakening of that Hispanic vote would make it
significantly more difficult for a Latino candidate to garner
enough white crossover votes, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, however, broke from the Hispanic voters in
urging the justices to reject the argument that non-U.S. citizens
could be calculated under the Voting Rights Act. The federal law
bars any practice that denies or abridges ``the right of any
citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or language
minority status,'' Waxman wrote, adding that the statute makes no
reference to noncitizens.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the 1965 law to remedy discrimination against
blacks and other minorities seeking to assert their constitutional
right to vote. The statute expressly prohibits states and local
jurisdictions from diluting the voting strength of minorities.

DESPITE LACK OF VIEWERS, DEBATES PLAY CRUCIAL ROLE IN CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: 2nd Take is scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m. ET)

<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ At first glance, the results after the first
round of more than a dozen presidential debates do not seem
encouraging: Most of them attracted fewer television viewers
nationwide than Dilbert, the cartoon about a grumpy office worker
which last week ranked 146 in the Nielsen ratings _drawing about
1.8 million viewers. The debates were lucky to pull more than 1.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, politicians and strategists say the debates have been
the most crucial factor in framing the political dynamic in the
run-up to the Iowa caucuses on Monday. The encounters have set the
tone for the television news coverage, which reaches far greater
audiences, and have highlighted the substance over which the
candidates have engaged.
</P>
<P>
   It was at those forums that the candidates articulated their
views _ at times in impenetrable detail _ on matters ranging from
tax cuts to health care to campaign reform to whether John Rocker,
the Atlanta Braves pitcher, needs psychotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely in presidential politics have so many candidates taken
part in so many debates before the voting begins in the Iowa
caucuses. The major Republican contenders participated in seven
debates; the Democrats held six.
</P>
<P>
   It is a striking contrast to four years ago, when there was no
Democratic contest and the Republican competition was shaped more
by 30-second television attack commercials that dominated the
airwaves here and in New Hampshire. There were only three
Republican debates before the voting in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `96, you had a situation where the ads _ and response ads _
were dictating the terms of the campaign,'' said Tony Fabrizio, who
was the pollster for Bob Dole, the Republican nominee four years
ago. ``Now it's the debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mark McKinnon, the chief ad-maker for Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, conceded that the debates have had greater impact than
the commercials. ``The debates have greater credibility because
people see them as unfiltered,'' he said. ``And there is a larger
microphone from the press to the public on these debates than there
ever has been before.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, academics and civic groups all praised the frenzy
of debates for elevating the discourse _ and giving the public a
genuine opportunity to observe the people competing to be the next
president. They also said that some candidates took advantage of
the opportunity to remake themselves before the public.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many strategists said Vice President Al Gore used
the hours of television exposure to articulate the differences
between his health care plan and that of his rival, former Sen.
Bill Bradley. Others argued that the debates allowed Bradley, who
was far less known than the vice president, to make his pitch to a
broader audience than he would roaming Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny fraction of Americans who watched the encounters was
also treated to a rare, sometimes even spontaneous, glimpse at the
evolution of candidates for president.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers witnessed the transformation of Bush from an awkward,
taut politician to one who _ while still on guard _ grew
increasingly self-assured.
</P>
<P>
   They observed Sen. John McCain of Arizona keeping his cool as he
smiled broadly through intense questioning about his campaign
reform proposal _ and his own fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
   They watched as Gore progressed from a combative, perhaps
overanxious, persona to one of calm and confidence. And they saw
Bradley evolve from a passive debater who did not even respond to
Gore's broadsides to an assertive, at times sarcastic, combatant
who in their last debate here Monday night ridiculed the Clinton
administration on the issue of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the effect of a mini-series _ the same characters
kept coming back in new installments,'' said Alan D. Schroeder, a
journalism professor at Northeastern University in Boston who is an
authority on presidential debates. ``In every case we learned
something because debates, by definition, offer insight into the
candidates that the candidates don't necessarily want us to have.''
</P>
<P>
   As healthy as the debates may have been for the electorate, they
were not necessarily helpful to the candidates. As an example,
Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher, often seemed lost in the
sparring between Bush and his other rivals, and was largely unable
to use the forums to embolden his campaign. Of course, the success
of the politicians is in the eye of the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans argue that the events planted doubts about
Bush's command of issues. Others say that with every encounter, he
grew more impressive. ``Any one who is skeptical about Governor
Bush's ability to speak in complete sentences _ that was put to
rest a while ago,'' said Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, a Republican
pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shrum, a veteran media adviser who works for Gore, said
the debates were of immense importance. He said despite the
relatively small viewership, and sometimes critical news coverage
of his candidate's performance, the events allowed Gore to win over
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a tremendous disconnect in almost every debate
between how I think voters reacted and a lot of political reporters
and commentators reacted,'' Shrum said.

 &HT;    Jaguar notebook: Defining the difference between miracles and
destinies
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ The Jacksonville Jaguars seek a
clarification. There are differences between miracles, fate and
real life, something they wish to impart to Tennessee and the
``Team of Destiny'' theme emanating from Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have a revelation anytime a miracle comes
about,'' Jacksonville tackle Leon Searcy said. ``What happened in
Tennessee against Buffalo (in the first round) was something
immaculate, something unexplainable. They have every right to feel
that way. We can't cheat them of that. They did achieve a
miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   And was it another miracle that the Titans beat the Jags twice
in 1999?
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't a miracle,'' Searcy said, clarifying. ``They just
had our number.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a difference, just as there is a different between the
emotion that has come to boil so soon between these two teams.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it borders on hatred. ``I guess you could say that,''
wide receiver Jimmy Smith said. ``But I just think most of all it's
just a rivalry, a divisional rivalry, We both made it to the AFC
Championship. You could say the rivalry continues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some flashes of arrogance. There always is,''
Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin said. ``Some talk. No question
about that. Because we are familiar with one another, there's a
nastiness about the way in which each team plays one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're a team that sets the tone physically. You're going
to have to answer that bell, if you're going to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparations
</P>
<P>
   Despite two previous meetings, the second of them just three
weeks ago, the Jaguars staff began doing its game plan from scratch
for the Titans. Asked if he thought that his team did anything
particularly well in the 41-14 loss at Tennessee on Dec. 26,
Coughlin replied, ``We got there on time and were ready for the
kickoff.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of Jaguars confessed to having replayed that 27-point
rout in their minds in the passing weeks. Asked how the game might
go if he could play it over, safety Carney Lake thought a long
moment and replied, ``Well, we'd win.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh market
</P>
<P>
   Some 3,000 seats for the AFC Championship put on sale Tuesday
were gone before lunch, as Jacksonville scalpers get a first chance
to press a new NFL market. Posted on-line offers for tickets have
reached $500, while professional brokers were seeking $650.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars season-ticket base of 45,000 were given first chance
at extra tickets after last Saturday's divisional semifinal win
over Miami. Another 12,000 seats were sold that way, and, after the
NFL claimed its allotment, roughly 4 percent of Alltel Stadium's
75,600 tickets remained for public sale.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   The Jags scored just four more points than Tennessee this season
but held opponents to 107 fewer. . . . Asked about the carry-over
from the 62-7 win over Miami on Saturday, Jacksonville guard Zack
Wiegert said, ``That game ended 10 minutes after we came into the
locker room. No one was really celebrating that win. Everyone was
talking about, 'We've got to do it next week.' `` . . . Although
just a five-year-old franchise, Jacksonville has grown up fast. Of
the 53 players on their current roster, 34 players had seen
postseason experience before this month. Fifteen current Jags
played in the 1996 AFC title game, a 20-6 loss at New England. . .
. Jags quarterback Mark Brunell has a career 60 percent completion
rate against the Titans/Oilers, good for 1,464 yards _ a 209-yard
average in seven starts _ with eight touchdowns but 10
interceptions.

BOURQUE PRACTICES, DESPITE MOUTH INJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Not 24 hours earlier, Ray Bourque had been on the
FleetCenter ice, taking a deflected slapshot in the mouth that
knocked out three of his teeth and required 11 stitches in his
upper lip. He needed more stitches for the damage inside his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque left the game against Atlanta after being struck late in
the first period, and coach Pat Burns wasn't sure how long his
captain would be out of action.
</P>
<P>
   Burns got his answer Tuesday when Bourque joined his teammates
at the FleetCenter for practice. Few had expected him to be there,
but the 39-year-old veteran of 21 National Hockey League seasons
couldn't figure out what the big deal was. When asked why he
practiced, Bourque answered, ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's lip was still very swollen but, he said, ``I'm not in
pain. It's a long way from my legs. I could skate, I can play. I
would've liked to have come back and played (Monday). But I guess
that wouldn't have been very smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque will be in the lineup Wednesday in Atlanta. There isn't
much that can be done until his lip and gums heal and the swelling
goes away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go to the dentist and have a few things done, and now
they've got to wait to give me a temp until my gum heals up,'' he
said. ``It's a crazy game sometimes. You know you've been hit and
you know you've lost some teeth. It's not the first time. I've had
sticks hit me and pucks hit me. I've never shattered my teeth like
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's coming is half a dozen visits to the dentist, and
that's not much fun. I just have to find time to do it. We'll see
how good the temporaries look.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred when Thrashers center Ray Ferraro teed up a
slapper from inside the blue line, and Bourque put his stick out to
block it. The puck rode up the stick and struck him flush in the
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   It's actually something that happens a lot, said Bourque, but
his half-visor often protects him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visor has saved me many times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns wasn't surprised to see Bourque back so quickly. It's just
the way he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he could've, he probably would've come back for the third
period if they would've let him,'' said Burns. ``We'd have some
guys who would be out for a month with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the way he stood up and shook off the trainers, like,
`I'll skate under my own will power.' The young kids should look at
that. Sometimes you see guys go down and they've got to get the
stretchers out there. He just shook the guy off and said, `I'm
going to the bench.' So you have to respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach doesn't envy Bourque for what lies ahead: namely, the
drilling necessary to repair his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part is what he has to go get done now,'' said
Burns. ``To get those anchors put in. That hurts. That's no fun.
They'll have to let the swelling go down before they can put those
anchors in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a competitor and he's one of the old-school guys. And he
loves to play the game. Him and (Dave) Andreychuk. Look at
Andreychuk _ his knee popped out and he was back out there (two
games later) scoring the tying goal (against Atlanta).''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's presence at practice wasn't lost on the young members
of the team. Joe Thornton was surprised and impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably been my biggest fear, losing all my teeth,''
said Thornton, who has a chipped front tooth from hockey but
nothing worse. ``You can't do anything about it. He had a
mouthguard in. It's one of those fluke things. You see Dr. (Bert)
Zarins picking up his teeth on the ice. I don't know in what other
sports you can see that stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's out there, he doesn't want to miss a day, he doesn't
want to miss a beat. It's unbelievable how he works. He's a
machine. (The lesson is) never take a day off and that's why he's
been so successful for so long. He wants to be the best he can be,
and if we can be half of what he is, we'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bourque, it's just business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be fixed,'' he said. ``A lot of us with broken teeth
end up looking better because they make them better.''

WHEN A PRESIDENT'S BEST FRIEND IS HIS DOG
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER and MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Bill Clinton attends a social event at the
White House these days, more often than not it is a farewell party,
as the familiar faces in the West Wing leap for jobs in the private
sector while the leaping is still good.
</P>
<P>
   After hours, the president dials up aides gone by. The
conversations can stretch into the early hours of the morning,
according to the recipients of his calls, wandering from
assessments of a presidential campaign he is not part of to
accounts of his peacemaker duties in the Middle East to musings
about how a retiree in his 50's might usefully fill his days after
Jan. 20, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear that lonely voice,'' says one old friend of the
president, ``you know it's time to sit up and turn on the light,
because this is going to take a while.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton heads into the eighth and final year of his
presidency, he is a blur of motion _ but he is also very alone.
</P>
<P>
   His only child is away at college. His wife has moved out to
start a career of her own. His vice president is on the road
seeking to become his successor. Left behind, at least, is Buddy
the Labrador, who now spends all night with the president when
Hillary Rodham Clinton is away _ modern day testimony to Harry
Truman's observation a half century ago that the only true friend
in Washington is a dog.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Clinton still has the coterie of ushers, attendants, aides
and agents hovering around him during the workday. But he is an
empty nester now, with fewer longtime friends within daily reach
than at any time during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Some old hands, like Sandy Berger, the president's national
security adviser, and Bruce Lindsey, the deputy White House
counsel, are still a daily presence in the White House and in
Clinton's life. Many of the other members of his current staff,
however, are either relative newcomers or people with whom the
president's primary relationship is as a boss, rather than a
longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to look out the window on a nice day and say,
`Erskine, let's play golf,''' one senior adviser said of the
president's close relationship to Erskine Bowles, his former chief
of staff. ``There's fewer people around he can do that with.''
</P>
<P>
   Now when Clinton is out to dinner, it often runs late, very
late, which is no surprise given the empty rooms awaiting him in
the White House residence.
</P>
<P>
   In Shepherdstown, W.Va., on Sunday night, Clinton's dinner with
Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and Syria's foreign minister,
Farouk al-Shara, went on for so long that one American diplomat
feared the participants would doze off. The president's helicopter
took off for the return trip to the White House a little before 1
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton concedes that his wife's absence feeds his late-night
tendencies to stay up reading and gabbing. ``Hillary's a good
anchor for me,'' he said. ``When I work too late she always makes
sure I get the requisite amount of sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sounds philosophical about his new in-between existence.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview aboard his presidential helicopter while touring
the Grand Canyon last week, he said his wife's decision to move out
and set up house in Chappaqua, N.Y., where he spent a night last
week and two nights this week, will help them with the difficult
transition from the presidency to everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically, it gives us a year to make the adjustment to
moving out,'' he said. ``It's kind of good for us that we're making
a gradual transition.'' But he added quickly, ``We're still getting
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, a Clinton family friend said of the Chappaqua
house: ``It's Hillary's place. He doesn't have a lot of emotion
invested in it.''
</P>
<P>
   In public, the president talks enthusiastically about the
Chappaqua house, in a wealthy suburban neighborhood far from the
commotion he is used to in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But friends still have a hard time imagining him as he kicks
around the place _ or uses that gleaming lawn tractor that David
Letterman gave Mrs. Clinton on his late-night television show last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, addressing reporters outside the Chappaqua house,
Clinton talked about what he would do when he got ``home'' to
Washington _ a sign that no one is quite sure where home is these
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he needs the breather,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, the
New York Democrat who first urged Mrs. Clinton to run for the
Senate. ``He needs a little space. He has a legacy to decide. He
has work to do. He's in a position where the first lady and the
vice president may need to distance themselves from him. He's stuck
with himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says he has had little time recently to dwell on his new
lot in life, with preparations for the 2001 budget and the State of
the Union message occupying him and the delicate Middle East peace
talks requiring constant attention.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the president's chief of staff, said Clinton was
not walking around the White House like Hamlet, brooding,
conflicted, depressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's counting backward,'' Podesta said. ``He's
looking at each day and seeing if he can accomplish something.
He'll probably get to Jan. 20, 2001, and say, `What three things
can I get done today before I get in the car and go up to the
Capitol.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Clinton talks a great deal about how little time he has left,
and how that both weighs on him and spurs him into motion. The
first seven years have flown by, he said, and 12 months is not a
lot of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year will pass in a flash,'' he remarked recently.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton rarely gives a speech these days without
mentioning the looming end of his presidency. Clinton follows his
regular recitation of rosy economic statistics with a plea that
much work will remain when he is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, what are we going to do now?'' he asked on
Wednesday during an event in Washington sponsored by the Democratic
Leadership Council. ``What will you do as citizens, when I am no
longer here, and I'm just a citizen like you?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a question that almost seems to haunt Clinton, who will be
the youngest ex-president since Theodore Roosevelt. But he
sometimes suggests that he is not feeling young.
</P>
<P>
   During his recent trip to the Grand Canyon, he complained about
his failing eyesight while noting that he could not read the
letters on some picket signs along his motorcade route. A little
while later, he put his hand to his ear and said he could not hear
a question from a reporter because his hearing is going, too. At
the start of his second term, he was fitted with small hearing aids
in both ears.
</P>
<P>
   At one recent fund-raiser, an old friend was introducing him and
joked that Clinton had aged appreciably in the last seven years.
``I keep a photograph in my office of me taken with the president,
early on in his first term, in the Oval Office,'' said Debbie
Branson, a Dallas lawyer who knows Clinton from Arkansas. ``Every
time I look at that picture I notice how young you looked.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was laughing but surely agreeing when Ms. Branson added,
``The presidency causes a lot of wear and tear.''

 - COX &HT;    ``The Sopranos'' hits the mark
 &HT;    by Kevin J. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Take a juicy, yet familiar mob tale, add
a delicious twist of black humor, mix in chaotic family life and
hire a balding, overweight actor as your star.
</P>
<P>
   Whaddya get? Bada bing! The biggest %(at)!!! phenomenon cable
television has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos,'' HBO's white-hot mob series, is no longer just
a TV show. It's an event. A happening. A juggernaut. Sixteen Emmy
nominations. Universal critical acclaim. Widespread viewer
acceptance. Fan letters from Stephen King and Elvis Costello. The
best TV show _ ever. Well, not quite, but the kudos have gone that
far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos,'' which kicks off its second season today at 9
p.m., is possibly one of the most praised shows in television
history.
</P>
<P>
   HBO certainly spared no expense to tout its programming crown
jewel, shelling out $10 million to pump up interest in the eagerly
anticipated sophomore season. Ads were plastered everywhere _
magazines, billboards, buses, newspapers, other cable channels.
There were lavish premiere parties in New York and Los Angeles. A
fake Soprano Waste Management garbage truck was even sent to
shopping malls to lure potential HBO subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most comprehensive campaign we've ever done,'' says
Chris Donlay, an HBO spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Why has a show about an angst- ridden,
middle-aged mob capo with all sorts of family problems captured our
imagination?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is simple. When you strip away the violent whackings,
shady dealings and four-letter words, ``The Sopranos'' is really
about family. It's that essential ingredient that makes the show
work so well. While Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) has a job most
of us can't relate to, we can identify with him as a father. A
husband. A son. He's an ordinary guy who wants to enroll his
daughter in a good college. He has an overbearing mom who's quick
to berate and criticize. He suffers from medical problems stemming
from the stress in his life. He needs someone to talk to.
</P>
<P>
   Does any of this sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   `` 'The Sopranos ' has taken a familiar genre, the Mafia drama,
and given it an unexpected twist, a semi-humorous twist,'' says Tim
Brooks, co-author of ``The Complete Directory To Prime Time Network
and Cable TV Shows.'' ``That's what 'The Godfather' did. The genre
was typed as something dark and gruesome, but 'The Godfather ' gave
us a whole new look at that world. Every time you turned over a
rock, you found something you didn't expect to see. 'The Sopranos '
has also reinvented that genre.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Dalley, a West Palm Beach criminal defense attorney who
has defended some Soprano types, says he watches the show as often
as he can. He particularly likes how the writers have humanized
Tony and turned what could have been a one-dimensional character
into a complex one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most mob guys just come home to dinner to show their face,''
says Dalley. ``But for Tony, his home life is important. That makes
him more real. As long as you're not on his wrong side, he's a
pretty decent guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos `` producers are definitely thrilled with the
accolades. ``Last year, when we were doing the show, we were
entertaining ourselves, and we just hoped that everyone would get
it,'' says Ilene S. Landress, one of the series' producers. ``You
see a couple of good reviews and you get excited, but never in your
wildest dreams can you imagine getting this sort of attention
across the board. Then you say, `Oh my God, it'll probably never be
this good again.' ``
</P>
<P>
   But could ``The Sopranos `` be this good on network television?
Probably not. Certainly not in its current form (nudity,
four-letter words, whackings). Ironically, Fox had first dibs on
``The Sopranos,'' but passed. Despite all the hype, only a paltry
2.8 million viewers watched ``The Sopranos `` each week during its
initial run last January. While that number was good enough to make
``The Sopranos `` one of the most watched shows on cable
television, the same amount of viewers watched the awful ``Clueless
`` each week on network TV. And ``Clueless `` ranked a dismal No.
147 out of 178 shows.
</P>
<P>
   So, what next for the Mafia's First Family? How do you top last
season?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: You don't.
</P>
<P>
   Landress says there won't be many changes. You will see two new
regular cast members, however. Aida Turturro (''Deep Blue Sea'')
joins the cast as Tony's scheming sister (a chip off the 'ol mom,
that one) and David Proval (''The Shawshank Redemption'') is Richie
Aprile, the quick-fisted brother of deceased mob boss Jackie
Aprile. Film director Peter Bogdanovich will also have a recurring
role as Dr. Melfi's (Lorraine Bracco) shrink. Tony and his cronies
will also take a business trip to Sicily later this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important for us not to change too much,'' says
Landress. ``Whatever we were doing right, and we're not sure what
that was, we just wanted to keep doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the second season begin.

ANNAN FACES GROWING RIFT OVER ARMS INSPECTOR FOR IRAQ
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Russia took the lead Tuesday in marshaling a
growing opposition to Secretary-General Kofi Annan's nomination of
a chief arms inspector for Iraq. The opposition suggested
protracted battles to come, not only over that appointment, but
also over other steps toward resuming the monitoring of Iraqi
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   France and China joined the Russians in objecting to the
nomination of Rolf Ekeus, a Swedish disarmament expert who
established the first inspection system in Iraq after the 1991 war
in the Persian Gulf, as the executive chairman of a new commission
created in December.
</P>
<P>
   The three want the nomination process reopened so that someone
more acceptable to Iraq can be found.
</P>
<P>
   Several nations holding rotating council seats were also thought
to be uncertain about the appointment of Ekeus, making it unlikely
that his supporters, including the United States, would try to
force a vote soon. The idea was discussed Tuesday, and apparently
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts outside the United Nations, seeing the stalemate as
a crisis of credibility for both Annan and the Security Council,
said that a vote of confidence _ or no confidence _ in the
secretary-general's choice would be without precedent and could be
very damaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue will have to get resolved, but I'm not going to say
how or when,'' said Richard Holbrooke, the American representative
and this month's council president, after an inconclusive two-hour
session. ``We are not sending this back to the secretary-general.
It remains in the Security Council.'' He said that foreign
ministers and other officials were discussing the matter by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   China, France and Russia sent letters to Holbrooke announcing
their opposition and calling for new names.
</P>
<P>
   China's letter, signed by Ambassador Qin Huasun, was the most
tentative, suggesting that a candidate from a developing country
``may be better positioned to convince Iraq to cooperate with the
council.'' The letter from Sergey Lavrov, the Russian
representative, which Holbrooke received Tuesday night, was the
most terse, simply stating that Russia ``cannot agree with the
proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after the council session Tuesday, Lavrov
said Russia would have nothing to do with anyone who was associated
with UNSCOM, the former disarmament panel headed by Ekeus.
</P>
<P>
   Lavrov then added that if Iraq was to be persuaded to accept
renewed inspections, the Iraqis would have to know, and presumably
approve, a number of points. These include not only the commission
chairman, he said, but also the composition of the inspection and
monitoring staff and the list of issues that President Saddam
Hussein's government would have to address.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this is to be done before we come to the situation where
Iraq can say yes or no,'' Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, once the most outspoken defender of the
inspections, has played a low-key role on the topic for more than a
year. Tuesday, Holbrooke, who continued to insist that the priority
of the month was Africa, rejected the suggestion that Washington
and Moscow were on a collision course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our differences,'' he said. ``We have our areas of
commonality. We're working through here a difficult problem but one
that is not insurmountable _ and sanctions do remain in place, and
the resolution was passed.'' He was referring to the resolution
establishing the new arms panel, the U.N. Monitoring, Verification
and Inspection Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``No action is taken on the secretary-general's recommendation
on Rolf Ekeus, and everyone agreed that this remains the month of
Africa,'' Holbrooke said. ``Everyone agreed that we do not wish
this to divert from the fact that President Mandela will be here
tomorrow _ the first time he will be in the Security Council _ to
discuss his efforts to prevent massive bloodshed in Burundi, and
that we have seven or eight presidents and former presidents of
Africa arriving in town at the end of the week.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the Council on Foreign Relations, Ruth Wedgwood, an
international lawyer and specialist on the United Nations, called
the secretary-general's nomination of Ekeus after a month of
wrangling with Security Council members ``very daring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``France and Russia should be aware of the gravity of
no-confidence vote,'' she said. ``The secretary-general has taken a
personal stake in this issue. The council's confidence in his
leadership should lead to a positive vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward C. Luck, executive director of the Center for the Study
of International Organization, a joint program of New York
University Law School and Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School, said
it was difficult to see on what basis council members could reject
Ekeus ``unless they are rejecting competence, professionalism and
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would appear that what the Russians, Chinese and French
want is someone who would be little more than a figurehead,'' said
Luck, who wrote ``Mixed Messages: American Politics and
International Organization 1919-1999'' (Brookings, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Luck said it was disappointing that a bold experiment in
disarmament failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, arms control was becoming global in scope and
needed an impartial institution to oversee inspections that would
have to be intrusive,'' he said. ``It was a logical extension of
the Security Council's mandate.'' But many parties contributed to
the demise of UNSCOM, he said.

 &HT;    Titans notebook: Big hitter Bishop has best game
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nashville _ At 5 feet 9, strong safety Blaine Bishop is the
shortest defensive starter on the Titans, but he posts some big
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop had a team-high seven tackles and broke up two passes
Sunday against the Colts in a 19-16 win. Before his hometown crowd
in Indianapolis, the former Pro Bowler had ``probably his best
career ballgame,'' said coach Jeff Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to hit, he makes no bones about it,'' said Tennessee
running back Eddie George. ``No matter how big you are, he wants to
knock your head off. I'm glad he's on my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Said free safety Marcus Robertson, ``He is tough, man. He's the
iron man.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's not a miracle worker. Bishop could manage to acquire
only 31 tickets to Sunday's game, after getting requests for 70.
</P>
<P>
   Leg up
</P>
<P>
   The story goes that Al Del Greco was on his way to accept a
corporate job in Birmingham when he was offered the kicking job
with the Oilers. But he might have been ready for that suit and tie
the way his kicks were going the week before the Indianapolis game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wednesday and Thursday he was struggling and down on himself
because things weren't going right with his kicks, and he was
pulling a lot of balls,'' said punter/kickoff man Craig Hentrich,
who is the holder on placement attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of mad,'' Del Greco said. ``It was like, `Man, I've
waited six years to get here and I'm going to kick like this?' It's
everybody's dream to get here, and once you get here you want to do
well.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did. The 16-year veteran out of Auburn was 4-for-4
Sunday, with field goals of 49, 37, 25 and 43 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Del Greco said he corrected the problem when the Titans moved
into the indoor facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked kicking in domes,'' he said. ``Atlanta is a
dome, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Valuable piece of paper
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia Tech offensive lineman Craig Page moved from the
practice squad to the 53-man roster when tight end Mike Roan was
placed on injured reserve. Roan had surgery Tuesday for a herniated
disc in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't expecting it at all,'' said Page. ``I feel like it's
a good reward. I worked hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Page was inactive at Indianapolis, but he made the trip and
visited with Colts practice squad linebacker Nate Simpson, his
college roommate at Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Stay away from the airport
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, the Titans have arranged a homecoming party Sunday
at Adelphia Coliseum in an attempt to avoid the mob scene that
occurred at the airport after the Indianapolis game.
</P>
<P>
   The team will be routed directly from its charter flight onto
buses without going through the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as many as 10,000 people crammed the airport. One
woman fell from an escalator, which airport officials say had
stopped and then restarted at an accelerated pace. She was treated
at a hospital and released. Two children were also slightly
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The party will start at 3:30 p.m., and the NFC championship game
will be shown on a large screen.
</P>
<P>
   Horror show
</P>
<P>
   While watching Jacksonville hammer Miami 62-7 in the other AFC
divisional playoff, running back George had sympathy for the
Dolphins, but wouldn't have wanted to be in their shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw them stacking on the points,'' he said, ``and I was
like, `It's a long day for Miami. I'm glad that we're not down
there right now.' ''

A FINAL RESTING PLACE FOR ANCIENT RELICS (IN BOSTON)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Paula Deitz is the editor of The Hudson Review.  
 By PAULA DEITZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Museum galleries were not the destination the Egyptians
had in mind when they made elaborate preparations to send deceased
royalty on the journey to the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   While exhibitions of Egyptian art, like the well-traveled
``Treasures of Tutankhamen'' in the 1970s, usually emphasized the
excavation and discovery of artifacts in ancient tombs, the museums
that presented such objects were faced with the question of how to
display them. Most opted for an atmosphere that was tantamount to
reburial: dark, mysterious, tomblike spaces.
</P>
<P>
   In installing the Museum of Fine Arts' permanent galleries for
Egyptian funerary arts and the art of the ancient Middle East, the
architects Jung/Brannen Associates of Boston followed this approach
but with a difference. Instead of the dense spaces typical of such
galleries, they have created rows of transparent columns filled
with light that serve as exhibition cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the vastness of the darkened gallery, these illuminated cases
are like windows on the objects beyond. Seven hundred objects are
on view.
</P>
<P>
   While other collections in the museum were acquired by donation
or purchase, the Egyptian section, consisting of 40,000 objects,
has maintained its direct link to archaeological sites. In 1872,
two years after the museum was founded, it purchased 4,000 objects
from a Boston collector that formed the core of its Egyptian
collection.
</P>
<P>
   In 1905, the museum joined Harvard University in sponsoring an
archaeological expedition in Giza that yielded treasures for 40
years. Dr. Rita E. Freed, curator of Ancient Egyptian, Nubian and
Near Eastern Art at the museum, has led many archaeological digs,
and the department has compiled 200 volumes of field notebooks and
60,000 glass negatives.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Jung/Brannen, Joseph Mamayek, its director of
architectural design, had lived in Turkey and had spent three weeks
in Egypt on a traveling fellowship in 1989 studying and sketching
the columns at Karnak and the hieroglyphics in the Valley of the
Kings. It was the experience of visiting tombs that suggested to
him that he could use stony gray walls in the new galleries to
convey the shadowy appearance of tombs reflecting the glare of
torchlight.
</P>
<P>
   A statue of Osiris, god of the nether world, stands at the new
Egyptian gallery's entrance as the gatekeeper of the tomblike
setting. Within the gallery, there are 13 mummies. In addition to
three coffins for a Theban aristocrat that fit into one another _
the middle one elaborately painted with a face and wig _ there are
mummy cases for both a barber, Nes-Ptah, and his wife, that have
found their eternal resting place in the museum.
</P>
<P>
   At the far end of the gallery, the eight-foot-high stone
sarcophagus for General Kheper-Re has been placed in a standing
position, rather than supine as is customary.
</P>
<P>
   In the darkness, small objects glow in the wall cases _ funerary
jewelry like gold fingernail covers and a gold pectoral in the
shape of a vulture with outstretched wings inlaid with some 400
pieces of carnelian and glass.
</P>
<P>
   One attraction of Egyptian funerary art is that it also
documents the lives of ordinary people. In the hieroglyphics and
wall reliefs, stories are told: on one limestone relief, a royal
butler and his wife make offerings to a god in his shrine.
</P>
<P>
   To enter the adjoining gallery devoted to artifacts from the
Middle East, the visitor passes through an archway decorated with
rosettes that suggests a re-creation of the Great Ishtar Gate
(Ishtar was the goddess of love and war) from the Babylon of
Nebuchadnezzar II (604-561 B.C.). Although it lacks the grandeur of
the reconstruction of the original gate at the Pergamon Museum in
Berlin, it establishes another atmosphere, that of an ancient
courtyard in Mesopotamia at dusk with the last gleam of light
glowing behind the crenelated walls.
</P>
<P>
   And just as the processional path to the original gate is lined
with tile reliefs of striding lions, the lion on view here, in
turquoise, cream and yellow glazed brick, is enough to evoke the
presence of the others.
</P>
<P>
   From alabaster wall reliefs of winged deities from Assyrian
palaces, to coins from Iran, to animal-shaped bronze bridle
ornaments from Turkey, the objects are arranged chronologically
rather than by region, giving an indication of the flow of
influences. No other statue exudes the power of the dark green
diorite carved head of Gudea, ruler of Lagash; and a stone vessel
in the form of a hare, circa 6400-5900 B.C., is the oldest artifact
in the museum.
</P>
<P>
   When the architects discovered that there was too little wall
space for a map of the region that would show an area 6,000 miles
in circumference, spanning 6,000 years, Mamayek turned necessity
into a virtue. Using slates of different colors _ ocher for land
and gray for water, like the Nile, the Tigris and the Euphrates
Rivers _ he created a map that takes up the entire center of the
gallery floor. It has been a favorite spot for children to sit when
they are not wandering among the mummy cases.
</P>
<P>
   Mamayek sees it as a kind of metaphor for the desert, as if, he
said, ``one drew a map in the sand with a stick.''

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Tampa Bay defensive tackle Warren Sapp sat in his living room
Sunday afternoon watching the St. Louis Rams put points on the
scoreboard like a pinball machine stuck in extra-play mode.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it was over, the St. Louis offense had reached the end zone
six times _ five by air and once on the ground _ in a 49-37 victory
over Minnesota. But Sapp was unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they haven't put them up against us, and that's all that
matters,'' Sapp said. ``What matters is we're 60 minutes away from
the greatest show on earth. We're not done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   To reach that show _ Super Bowl XXXIV in Atlanta _ the
Buccaneers will have to prove on Sunday at the Trans World Dome in
St. Louis that they can stop the most potent offense in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The NFC Championship Game will be the ultimate test for the
NFC's top defense. The Bucs were up to the challenge against
Washington, keeping the No. 2 offense in the league out of the end
zone in a 14-13 win at Tampa Bay on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But few people believe 14 points will be enough to defeat the
Rams, who have averaged 34 points per game this season. A Tampa Bay
victory probably will require another superb effort by the defense,
including the big guy in the middle of the line _ the 6-2,
303-pound Sapp.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Sapp became the first Tampa player to win the
Associated Press Defensive Player of the Year award since Hall of
Fame defensive end Lee Roy Selmon in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to be mentioned in the same breath with Lee Roy Selmon
means I'm doing my job,'' Sapp said. ``For a long time, he set the
standard around here on how to play defense. Maybe the torch has
passed. I want to keep up the tradition he started of great defense
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapp, 27, ended the regular season with 12{ sacks, just shy of
Selmon's team record of 13 set in 1979. But Selmon got his sacks as
a defensive end in a 3-4 alignment. Sapp is a defensive tackle in a
4-3, a much tougher role in which to produce sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of Warren for what he did to get better after
last season,'' said Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy. ``He set his mind
to doing everything he could to be the best he could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapp had seven sacks last season, when the Bucs were 8-8. Tampa
Bay is 12-5 this season thanks in part to the improved play of
Sapp, who is 20 pounds lighter than his 1998 playing weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last season I was too fat and too slow,'' Sapp said. ``I was
out of shape, and I wasn't close to being able to make plays.
Sometimes late in games I would line up knowing I couldn't make a
play. But this year I've been able to chase people down for four
quarters. I'm giving the fans their money's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapp has given the Bucs everything they could have hoped for
since they took a chance and made him a first-round draft choice
with the 12th overall pick in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He was a Lombardi Award winner his junior year at Miami and was
expected to be the first player picked in the draft, but a positive
drug test caused 11 teams to choose someone else in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that really hurt me was the talk about
cocaine,'' Sapp said. ``It wasn't true. I dabbled with marijuana,
like a lot of guys in college do. I admitted it. I told the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapp remembers every player who was chosen ahead of him, and he
quickly points out that only one _ Jacksonville offensive tackle
Tony Boselli _ has equaled his level of performance.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp admits he still has bitter feelings about what happened on
draft day, but he also thinks it may have made him a better player
because he wanted to prove the other 11 teams were wrong by not
selecting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always in the back of my mind,'' Sapp said. ``I tote it
with me, no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It serves as added motivation for a man who has the possibility
of a Super Bowl ring to motivate him now. Sapp was instrumental in
Tampa Bay's win Saturday, coming up with a key sack and later
getting a fumble recovery that set up the winning TD drive for the
Bucs.
</P>
<P>
   Both Tampa Bay touchdown drives came after the defense caused
turnovers, but that's nothing new. In the last three games, the
defense has forced eight turnovers that became scoring drives for
the Tampa Bay offense.
</P>
<P>
   The two TDs against the Redskins came after Tampa Bay got behind
13-0 and Sapp gave a pep talk to the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `We need to turn this into a war, an absolute war.' We
loaded our guns,'' Sapp said. ``We were in the huddle saying we
hadn't made a play yet to get the offense rolling. We know this
team is built around us making plays, so somebody had to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety John Lynch came up with an interception that started the
turnaround before a sack by defensive end Steve White caused a
fumble that Sapp recovered.
</P>
<P>
   It will take more of the same if the Bucs hope to slow the
explosive St. Louis offense, led by quarterback Kurt Warner, the
league's Most Valuable Player this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp believes the Tampa Bay defense is up to the task and has
the talent to counter the Rams' top offensive stars _ Warner,
running back Marshall Faulk and receiver Isaac Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Sapp, the Bucs will send linebacker Derrick Brooks
and Lynch to the Pro Bowl. The defensive line of Sapp, White, Brad
Culpepper and Chidi Ahanotu may be the best in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a representative of the unit,'' Sapp said. ``That's
the way I've always looked at it. There are a lot of great players
on this defense, and great players have to do great things that
change the outcome of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapp and his defensive teammates have changed the outcome of a
lot of games this season. Eight times the Bucs allowed 10 points or
fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Only twice this season has a team scored three touchdowns
against Tampa Bay. St. Louis has done that in all 17 games, so
everyone is going to see if a great defense can stop a great
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take my chances with our defense anytime,'' Sapp said.
``And our offense gets it done every time we give them a chance. I
don't know if we're a team of destiny, but I know we're a team of
heart and desire.''

BRADLEY JUST HOPES TO DO WELL IN IOWA CAUCUSES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
and PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IOWA CITY, Iowa _ In the span of a few minutes Tuesday, Bill
Bradley preached idealism about government and realism about his
chances of winning the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say anything about winning in Iowa,'' Bradley said at
a news conference in a music room at West High School.
</P>
<P>
   He was responding to a question about his campaign staff having
talked wistfully once about Bradley upsetting Vice President Al
Gore in the Jan. 24 Democratic presidential caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing Gore holding onto a lead of about 20
percentage points in voter surveys, Bradley said he merely hopes to
do as well as Sen. Ted Kennedy did against President Jimmy Carter
in 1980. Kennedy garnered 31 percent of the caucus vote in an
unsuccessful campaign to wrest the Democratic nomination from the
incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult state when you are up against entrenched
power,'' Bradley said. ``We don't have the apparatus. The apparatus
is with the vice president. But we do have a lot of enthusiasm
among people and the real question is can we reach out to enough to
get them to the caucuses, and that remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's lead comes partly thanks to support from labor unions and
Iowa elected officials such as Sen. Tom Harkin. Organization is
important in the caucuses because to cast a vote, residents must
participate in a lengthy evening meeting rather than just punch a
ballot in the voting booth. The better-organized candidates turn
out more participants.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said his goal all along has been to ``do better than
expected in Iowa.'' His campaign is hoping for a lift a week later
in New Hampshire, where most polls show him leading Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, for his part, appeared confident and relaxed Tuesday,
joking with college students in Indianola and picking up a labor
endorsement in Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   And he turned his attention, briefly, to Republican candidate
George W. Bush, telling about 40 members of the American Federation
of Government Employees that Bush has ``waged war'' on organized
labor in Texas and ``wants to raid government pension plans'' to
finance a tax plan intended to help the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and other Republican candidates, he said, would risk the
strong economy nurtured during the Clinton-Gore administration by
clinging to old ideas of the Reagan and Bush years, recommending
tax cuts and spending plans that amount to ``the hair of the dog
that bit us.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to AFGE union members packed in the local VFW Hall,
Gore didn't mention Bradleye, but said the presidency isn't
just about big ideas or concentrating on a few select projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an all-out commitment day-by-day, fighting for real
people with real problems,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's news conference came on the heels of his address to an
assembly in the high school auditorium. There, his message was the
opposite: Don't settle for second best.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley repeated his theme that he is the bold candidate in the
race _ with his proposals on health care, gun control and campaign
finance reform _ while Gore is only ``nibbling around the edges''
of those issues.
</P>
<P>
   In near-spiritual tones, Bradley said he wants to be president
to achieve ``a world of new possibilities guided by goodness'' and
that his campaign ``is about asking good people to step forward so
that all of our voices could he heard.''
</P>
<P>
   The students sat in a silence that could most charitably be
described as respectful, not breaking into applause until Bradley
answered a question from the audience by saying South Carolina
should stop flying the Confederate flag over state buildings
because ``slavery was our original sin, just as race remains our
unsolved dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   To reporters later, Bradley said Texas' new university
enrollment program, which guarantees admission to high school
seniors who rank in the top 10 percent of their class academically,
doesn't give universities the flexibility they need to attract
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the best high schools, he said, those just below the
threshold might be left behind even though they might be more
qualified than students at other schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (the Texas rules) are as good as your straight
affirmative action,'' he said.

   EUROPE
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: ANTI-PUNISHMENT LAW
</P>
<P>
   Parents who smack their children on the head or beat them
anywhere on their bodies with objects like canes or belts could
face jail under a new law being formulated by the government.
Britain has to bring its laws into compliance with decisions
outlawing corporal punishment by the European Court of Human Rights
despite polls showing that most British parents are against the
changes.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: PINOCHET RULING DUE
</P>
<P>
   Britain told Chile it was free to send a plane to pick up Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, but it withheld a decision on whether or not to
free him until later in the week. Home Secretary Jack Straw said he
needed the coming days to consider petitions from rights groups and
countries like Spain, France, Belgium and Switzerland that have
called for the former Chilean dictator's extradition. Opponents of
his imminent release want the right to see medical reports on which
Straw, above, based his decision that General Pinochet, 84, was
unfit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: DIANA WALKWAY
</P>
<P>
   The government will build a seven-mile walkway in London through
St. James' Park, Green Park, Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens to
commemorate the life of Diana, Princess of Wales. The $2.8 million
project, to open in July, will include 70 plaques marking moments
in her life and places associated with her.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE: COVERING STORM DAMAGE
</P>
<P>
   Paris has decided to sell off some of its assets to pay for the
more than $70 million worth of damage the city suffered in two
storms that hit at Christmas. Mayor Jean Tiberi said Paris would
sell city-owned land and two hotels as well as its stake in a power
company. ``We are doing this so that it does not cost Parisians one
additional franc in taxes,'' Tiberi said.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: BASQUE ATTACK PREDICTED
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said the Basque separatist
group ETA would attempt a terrorist attack before the March 12
general elections to try to take revenge on the center-right
government, which is leading in the polls. The rebels halted their
14-month unilateral cease-fire last November, and the police have
since arrested several suspected rebels and seized explosives.
</P>
<P>
   HONG KONG: CHANGE OF NAME
</P>
<P>
   The New China News Agency, a state-run body, has been Beijing's
de facto consulate in Hong Kong since 1947. Now, two years after
Hong Kong reverted to China, the Hong Kong branch is changing its
name to more accurately reflect its role. The agency will be called
the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA
</P>
<P>
   IVORY COAST: U.N. ENVOY
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan has sent a special envoy, Ibrahima
Fall, to Ivory Coast to encourage the new military rulers to return
to constitutional rule, Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said.
Ivory Coast's leader, Gen. Robert Guei, seized power last month.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, McKinsey &AMP; Co., the world's most prestigious
consulting firm, had a simple policy on taking an equity stake in a
client in exchange for advice: it didn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Owning a piece of a company might scare that company's
competitors away from McKinsey, the partners worried. Or, a
high-profile blow-up at one of the companies in which it owned a
stake could tarnish McKinsey's reputation. So even as Bain &AMP; Co., a
rival, made tens of millions of dollars by setting up its own
venture capital company in the 1980s, and even through the bull
market of the 1990s, McKinsey's partners stood firm.
</P>
<P>
   No longer.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year and a half, unable to resist the lure of the
Internet economy, McKinsey has taken small stakes in more than 50
clients, in exchange for lower fees. Across Europe and North
America, the firm is opening eight ``business accelerators,'' where
consultants will spend up to nine months helping start companies in
which the firm could own a stake.
</P>
<P>
   McKinsey's about-face is the most striking example yet of the
transformation of the $55 billion management consulting business,
as virtually every large firm rushes to own a piece of some of its
clients. Like tradition-bound investment banks that start offering
online services, or individual investors who add dot-com stocks to
their blue-chip portfolios, the partners at the largest consulting
firms are changing to avoid being left out of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, they are opening themselves up to new risks,
from losing money on bad investment bets to losing the confidence
of clients. But the firms' executives are confident they can avoid
those pitfalls. Besides, they say, the need both to sell their
expensive services to smaller companies and to attract talent left
them with little choice but to switch course.
</P>
<P>
   They are doing so with gusto. Andersen Consulting, the world's
largest firm, has invested in nearly 150 companies since 1996. Booz
Allen &AMP; Hamilton will soon announce it has set up incubators,
similar to McKinsey's accelerators, in the United States, Asia and
Europe. Less-established firms are often even more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   The trend represents a profound shift for an industry that
touches virtually every large company around the globe. Once
thought of as outside experts who independently evaluated a
business, as an accountant or lawyer might, consultants are
becoming more like bankers whose fortunes are closely tied to those
of their clients.
</P>
<P>
   The switch ``repositions us from being consultants and advisers
to being business partners and really being capitalists,'' said
Mary Tolan, Andersen's managing partner for growth and strategy. At
Andersen, she said, the practice has spread beyond Internet work,
and the firm has forfeited fees of as much as $20 million in
exchange for equity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It is an absolutely huge change,'' said Jackson Wilson, the
head of Andersen's new $1-billion venture-capital fund.
</P>
<P>
   The investments are usually minority stakes, typically worth a
few million dollars. The recipients range from small start-ups to
newly created businesses at large existing clients. Andersen, for
example, owns part of Snowdrops.com, a Swedish site selling beauty
products. The Boston Consulting Group, during an assignment at
Whirlpool, decided to help the company set up brandwise.com, a
separate company that sells appliances over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of electronic-business consulting _ advising
companies how to advertise, distribute and sell in cyberspace _ the
last two years has driven the trend. At some concerns, it will soon
be the single-largest moneymaker. In order to build a reputation as
Internet experts, the consultants say they must work with start-ups
that cannot afford their high fees _ rarely below $1 million for a
project _ but can offer equity.
</P>
<P>
   The investments are also crucial to restoring the consulting
firms' luster among employees and recruits. At the top business
schools, many graduates are shunning consulting, the most popular
career path in the 1990s, for options-bearing dot-com start-ups.
Even George Shaheen, the chief executive of Andersen until last
year, bolted to join the Internet world, taking the top job at
Webvan, a small online grocery service. ``Recruiting people right
now is very problematic,'' said Andrew Zimmerman, the head of the
e-business unit at PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in an effort to mimic stock options, Booz Allen and
others are now studying how to offer junior consultants a share of
the investments that the firms make.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the consultants hope, the moves will bolster the
bottom line when some other forms of technology consulting are
slowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty simple: we're doing this to make money,'' said
Wilson, the head of Andersen's new venture fund, who transferred
from a job as supervisor of thousands of workers to go to Silicon
Valley as the boss of 20.
</P>
<P>
   The consulting firms are confident that the investment gains
from their winners will more than offset lost fees. For example,
Bain, which set up a venture-capital unit five years ago, says the
returns on its investments since then have averaged better than 50
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the new strategy could create problems. First, it
substitutes investments for cash revenue. ``Obviously, this is very
attractive so long as everybody's stock goes up,'' said Zimmerman
of Pricewaterhouse, which has invested in Web companies that are
its partners, but very few that are its clients so far. ``But I'm
not sure consultants are the best-equipped people to determine how
successful these companies are going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Most consulting firms, Zimmerman added, lack the experience that
established venture-capital firms have in analyzing the quality of
a start-up's management or the strengths and weaknesses of its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Zimmerman said, he expects that Pricewaterhouse will
begin investing more frequently in its clients in the next two
years.

CONFIDENT BRADLEY STICKS WITH HIS THEMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERLOO, Iowa _ As his campaign bus headed down U.S. 63, Bill
Bradley talked about the succession of debates that have pitted him
against his Democratic presidential rival, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debates remind me of a joke that Woody Allen once told
about when he learned speed reading,'' Bradley said. ``He went out
and read Tolstoy's `War and Peace.' Later asked to describe the
novel, Allen said what he remembered was that it was about
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   What Bradley hopes voters will remember is that the debates were
about issues. For many Iowa and New Hampshire voters, debates
provide the main snapshot of the candidates vying for the
Democratic nomination to succeed Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore comes armed with sound bites and statistics, plants human
props in the audience and rips apart Bradley's health care plan.
Bradley is sticking to his themes with a deep _ perhaps misplaced _
confidence that America is ready for campaign finance reform,
registration of handguns and bold action to get its children out of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy interview, the onetime New York Knicks forward gave
the sense of somebody not inclined to retool himself, confident of
his game and believing the country is ready for his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am suggesting is common sense,'' he said. ``What we
have to do is take this moment, and deal with issues while
prosperity gives us the chance. ... People know our health care
system is in distress. They know premiums are going up. ... They
know what gun violence has done in our schools. They know, given
the fund-raising scandals in 1996, that money is distorting the
political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley wants to change that process through campaign finance
reform, but pledges to go farther and retool what has become a
media-driven presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The current model was established by Ronald Reagan. During
Reagan's presidency, aides met daily to design a presidential
appearance or announcement that would win the day's ``bit'' _
getting TV coverage and driving the day's news cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The pace has, if anything, been accelerated by the daily stream
of statements out of Clinton's White House. It was Clinton, for
example, who personally announced plans to extend federal
protection to slopes above the Columbia River in eastern
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, I would strive to be on television _ less,''
Bradley said. ``I would delegate a lot of authority so that my
subordinates would get a lot of airtime. As president, you
shouldn't dominate everything. For example, the secretary of the
Interior should take the lead in making statements on taking down
dams from the Elwha River'' on Washington state's Olympic
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know from the 1930s, that Franklin Roosevelt's voice counted
for more because he was not speaking every day. When he did address
the nation, people knew it was important and were anxious to hear
what he had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Bradley's proposals _ notably handgun registration
and public financing of federal campaigns _ have been dismissed as
impossible to achieve in the charged, bitterly partisan atmosphere
of today's Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what people in Washington, D.C., always say,'' Bradley
observed. ``They can't see change if its stimulus comes from
outside Washington, D.C. It's not that way in Washington state.
Look at your economy. Only in Washington, D.C., are limits put on
the imagination that are rigid.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley sees Gore as a product of those limits and a politician
disinclined to tangle for keeps with the capital's entrenched
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is more cautious. In this campaign he has taken a more
cautious approach,'' Bradley said. ``He demonstrates time and again
his inclination to do the safe thing rather than exercise the
leadership that transforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley reflects that he has been ``on the road'' across America
for 30 years as a basketball player, and later as a politician, and
as a teacher and businessman after 18 years representing New Jersey
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a goodness in most of us,'' he reflected. ``Of course,
there has always been a nativist sentiment in America. I find that
a small, vocal segment of America. ... But, on the whole, people
are generous, tolerant, and open. They are aware of (public
figures') strengths and will tolerate the flaws and weaknesses as
long as we say what we believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, Bradley was visiting Seattle on the day that
his presidential committee officially came into existence.
Typically, he made no formal announcement and held no news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   At one meeting, a luncheon at the Seattle Hilton, Bradley
acknowledged that he would lose to Gore if the nomination race were
decided by the Democratic Party's current members and financial
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   What he had to do, Bradley argued, was attract new donors and
reignite enthusiasm for politics among Americans grown cynical
about the money games of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   He has succeed to an extent that nobody would have believed a
year ago. The Bradley campaign in Iowa is built on such voters as
Jim Mahoney, a teacher at Johnston High School north of Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people, including myself, have been sitting back and
not taking an active role in politics,'' Mahoney said. ``He has
drawn me back in. We need better values in our government.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired nursery school teracher Jo Leffler will move slowly with
her walker to next Monday's caucus. ``I just can't believe he is
not who he says he is, and he is so much what the country needs,''
Leffler said after hearing Bradley speak.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has, however, a deep reservoir of support among committed,
active Democrats who see him as a man who has done the Clinton
administration's heavy lifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not dislike for Bradley _ I'm glad he's running _ but I
look at what the vice president has done and feel he's ready for
the job. I'm rather traditional,'' said Nick Eakins, concierge at
the Hotel Pattee in Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Activists like Eakins have given the vice president a
substantial lead in pre-caucus polls. With heavy backing from
labor, Gore also has the organizational muscle to turn out his
troops.
</P>
<P>
   How strong of a second-place showing must Bradley achieve to win
the expectations game in Iowa? The only remote parallel among
Democrats was 1980, when Sen. Edward Kennedy challenged President
Jimmy Carter. Carter won 59 percent to Kennedy's 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hart took only 16 percent in 1984, trailing far behind
former Vice President Walter Mondale's 49 percent. But Hart's
second place showing was considered a breakthrough, and propelled
him toward an upset of Mondale in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof will be in what the electorate says. ... Have we
reached people with the right sense of urgency?'' Bradley asked.
</P>
<P>
   He's not likely to go away, even if Gore wins big on Monday.
Writing in his book, ``Time Present, Time Past,'' Bradley mused on
his Scotch-Irish ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being Scotch Irish is to recognize that once or twice or
several times in your life, defeat will seem certain,'' he wrote,
``but never to give up when faced with this moment, instead to
persevere, to advance ... .''

 UNDATED: two years.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the trend seems unstoppable, it also raises thorny
conflict-of-interest issues that will not go away, either.
Accountants and lawyers, after all, are generally barred by law
from being part owners of clients. For years, the big consulting
firms generally followed suit. They have also built fire walls of
silence around projects, forbidding consultants to talk with
colleagues about them. This confidentiality enabled them to work
for rival companies simultaneously. Andersen, for example,
currently does work for Federal Express, the U.S. Postal Service
and United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   But when the consultants own a part of a client, rivals could
become more reluctant to trust those fire walls. The consulting
firms, in turn, may then have to make clearer decisions about which
companies they work with.
</P>
<P>
   The increased acceptance of equity stakes ``will put pressure on
consultants to pick their spots a little bit more carefully,'' said
James Citrin, a former McKinsey consultant who is now the managing
director of the Internet practice at Spencer Stuart, a large
executive search firm.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging those concerns, many firms, including McKinsey,
say they plan to sell the investments within a few years, to avoid
becoming too closely aligned with a client. ``In no case do we ever
want to become a long-term stakeholder,'' said Andreas Biagosch, a
director in McKinsey's Munich office.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, skeptics say such close links between advisers and
clients create many potential problems. In the 1980s, for example,
Bain, which once refused to work for two firms in the same industry
and would send dozens of consultants into a single company,
suffered a major hit to its reputation when consultants who had
taken on formal titles at Guinness were implicated in a British
stock scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrangements will make similar situations more likely,
said Lewis Pinault, a former partner at Coopers &AMP; Lybrand who also
worked at Boston Consulting and Gemini Consulting. They will also
give clients new reason to doubt the fire walls, which he said
often come down after a project has ended. ``The history of fire
walls before this e-commerce boom is not really a healthy one,''
said Pinault, the author of ``Consulting Demons,'' a critical look
at the industry, which is soon to be published by HarperBusiness.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is particularly sensitive at the consulting units of
the large accounting firms. The Securities and Exchange Commission
bars those firms from investing in companies they audit or in
companies whose other part owners they audit. Scrutiny is likely to
be high. This month, the SEC released a report saying that more
than 50 percent of Pricewaterhouse's partners had violated rules
prohibiting them from holding personal investments in companies the
firm audits. A federal agency is now investigating whether the
problem is widespread at other firms, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Consulting executives said many of the questions about conflicts
of interest are not new. ``Clients have always lived with us
dealing with their competitors,'' said Scott Hartz, the top
consulting executive at Pricewaterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid new problems, consultants said they would choose their
investments carefully and establish clear rules within their firms.
``We will try never to invest in or have in our portfolio companies
that compete with one another,'' Wilson of Andersen said. But, he
acknowledged, ``that's very, very hard to do; it's inevitable that
there will be collisions down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll solve that problem when we get there,'' he said. &QL;

 &HT;    Vermeil likes 'clockwork' kicker Lowery
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ On Jan. 30, 1994, Nick Lowery was exactly where he
wanted to be. In the Georgia Dome, Super Bowl XXVIII, Cowboys and
Bills. One problem: Lowery had the worst seat in the house: A seat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember going to the game,'' said Lowery, the No. 5 scorer
in NFL history, ''and I had a migraine headache the whole game
because I wanted to be on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   That hope evaporated a week earlier, when Lowery and the Chiefs
lost the AFC Championship Game in Buffalo. Six years later, at age
43 and three years since he last kicked in an NFL game, Lowery
might finally reach the Super Bowl, in the most unlikely manner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I did OK for an old man,'' Lowery said. He was one
of three kickers the Rams brought in Tuesday morning to try out if
regular placekicker Jeff Wilkins can't kick in Sunday's NFC
Championship Game against Tampa Bay. Wilkins reaggravated the
patella tendinitis in his left knee in the divisional playoff win
over Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   If Wilkins can't kick, head coach Dick Vermeil will choose
Lowery over two 25-year-olds: ex-FSU star Scott Bentley, who kicked
off in two games this season for the Chiefs, and Marshall Young,
who kicked at UTEP and has tried out for a couple of NFL teams.
Although Vermeil hopes Wilkins can kick and won't make a decision
until Thursday, he will go with Lowery if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our preference is to stay with our guy, if we can,'' the coach
sai Wilkins reinjured himself on the opening kickoff, his first of
eight against Minnesota; missed his only field-goal attempt, a
42-yarder; and had an MRI on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was way off, compensating for his sore leg,'' Vermeil said.
``If he's going to kick like that, he can't kick for us. But if he
can kick a field goal and ignore the pain, he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, Vermeil will use Lowery as a replacement kicker in the
biggest game in St. Louis football history. He would earn a playoff
share only, with no salary to count toward the 1999 cap.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought my performance was really good,'' said Bentley, who
showed the strongest leg during a 30-minute workout. He made all of
his field goals, including a 52-yarder. ''My kickoffs were
obviously the strongest of the three. That's the good thing about
being young.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vermeil wants experience, and youth and conditioning are
less important for a game or two. ''I would always be comfortable
with Nick Lowery,'' said Vermeil, who worked as an analyst on
television while he was out of coaching. ''I always thought he was
the best, most accurate. The numbers I kept on him were equivalent
to the best ever. I had a lot of confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's clockwork, that guy. Whether he can do it now, I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope to get a chance to find out,'' Lowery said. ''I have
not kicked a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   It showed Tuesday. Lowery, who has been working as a TV
sportscaster, has kicked once in the last several months, on Dec.
19. He hasn't kicked with a holder in a year and a half. That was
in June 1998, when Lowery had a tryout with the Rams and impressed
Vermeil but wasn't signed.
</P>
<P>
   So Lowery was surprised _ ''You bet'' _ when Vermeil called
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lowery said his knees feel better than they have in years. ''I
don't think I have the cumulative fatigue of a year of kicking. I
just have to get into a rhythm,'' he said. He would love to be
reunited with the Rams special-teams coach, Frank Gansz, for whom
Lowery played in Kansas City, and work with a good holder, Mike
Horan. ''I hope the only thing that matters is, 'Who's the best guy
for the job?' '' Lowery said. ''It's a great team here. The car's
already running, and I've just got to do my part if I get a
chance.''

 &HT;    RAMS NOTEBOOK: Bucs not only `D,' Bush says
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ And you thought it's St. Louis' offense vs. Tampa
Bay's defense for the NFC championship? Think again. In the court
of public opinion, Devin Bush comes to the Rams' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we play other teams,'' Bush said, ``all you hear about is
the other team's defense.''
</P>
<P>
   As in, how in the world is the other team's defense going to
stop St. Louis' out-of-this-world attack? This is understandable
considering the Star Wars weaponry _ Kurt Warner, Marshall Faulk,
Isaac Bruce. Bush understands that.
</P>
<P>
   But the ex-Falcon _ reduced to a nickel back in his fourth
season last year in Atlanta before signing a four-year, $7.2
million free-agent contract with St. Louis _ complains, ``The only
thing we get sick of is we get ignored. All you hear about is
everybody else's defense but ours. We feed off that. We don't let
that get us down. If opponents take us lightly, we try to come up
with the knockout blow.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no different this week. It's the Bucs' defense _ No. 1 in
the NFC, hasn't allowed a touchdown in 10 quarters _ against the
Rams' pinball machine.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, starting at free safety in place of the injured Keith
Lyle, counters, ``We're No. 1 in the NFL against the rush (74.3
yards a game). We're No. 1 in scoring defense (eight touchdowns).
What does that say about our defense?
</P>
<P>
   ``We run just as fast (as Tampa Bay),'' said Bush. ``Play just
as hard as they do. We're in the same category as they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Slicing prices
</P>
<P>
   In a city known for its Italian food, the most popular place to
eat Monday was . . . Domino's Pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Thousands of Rams fans took advantage of the ``Rams
Touchdown Takedown'' promotion at local Domino's stores in the wake
of last Sunday's 49-37 win over Minnesota. The pitch: A dollar off
pizza prices on Mondays for every Rams touchdown the day before.
After seven TDs against Minnesota, a $7.99 medium cheese pizza cost
99 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting slammed,'' Greg Neichter, who owns 32 of the 79
local Domino's outlets and concocted the promotion, told the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch. Neichter predicted a loss of $1 million
Monday, ``But we have no regrets. This is our way of doing
something nice for the St. Louis fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Domino's had to close briefly because of the crush.
Steve Hively, who owns one Domino's, said he baked 200 pizzas by 2
p.m. Monday _ 160 more than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is that they won,'' said Hively.
``But after five touchdowns, I was praying for field goals.''
</P>
<P>
   And for dessert . . .
</P>
<P>
   And how did Warner, the only undrafted player to become the NFL
MVP and surely the most modest, celebrate after completing 27 of 33
passes for 391 yards and five touchdowns against Minnesota? He went
home, had a pizza with his family and watched a movie on the Disney
Channel while eating popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's par,'' coach Dick Vermeil said of his quarterback,
who'd spent Saturday baking a birthday cake for his daughter,
Jessica. ``He's not ready to celebrate. He knows he has more to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil was actually worried about Warner before the Vikings
game. ``I was scared because the last few days (of practice) he
didn't throw the ball real accurately.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In pregame warmups, he was hummin' it,'' Vermeil said. ``I've
never been around anyone who can throw the ball as accurately as he
can.''

THE MEZZO AS SUPERSTAR? ONE STANDS OUT QUIETLY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Sarah Bryan Miller is the classical music critic of The St. Louis
Post-Dispatch.  
 By SARAH BRYAN MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a time rich in fine lyric mezzo-sopranos, Susanne Mentzer is
a quiet standout. She does not have the biggest, most flamboyant
personality or the flashiest coloratura.
</P>
<P>
   What she offers is subtler: thoughtfulness, consistency, vocal
and dramatic depth and flexibility, and a scintillating, elegant
sound. Primarily an opera singer, she has recently begun to take on
concert and recital work as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mentzer, who has a fondness for jeans and National Public
Radio, and none of the stigmas of the diva, is in her 10th season
at the Metropolitan Opera. She is especially gifted at playing
trouser roles, as those who saw her Cherubino in the Met telecast
of ``Le Nozze di Figaro'' last month can attest: she has the
figure, the voice and the acting ability to do him right.
</P>
<P>
   Having just sung Mozart's amorous page again in the Met's most
recent run of ``Figaro,'' she takes up the role of Hoffmann's
sardonic sidekick, Nicklausse, in Offenbach's ``Contes d'Hoffmann''
on Thursday at the Met and is soon to sing her first Romeo in
Bellini's ``Capuleti e i Montecchi'' in Los Angeles, a role she
compares to Octavian from ``Der Rosenkavalier'' in its emotional
depth.
</P>
<P>
   Her skirt roles include Debussy's Melisande, Massenet's
Cendrillon and Purcell's Dido, Dorabella from ``Cosi Fan Tutte,''
Zerlina from ``Don Giovanni,'' and Adalgisa from ``Norma,'' which
she is to sing in concert at the Royal Opera House in London this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Ms. Mentzer will also perform two ravishingly feminine
concert pieces, Ravel's ``Sheherazade'' and Debussy's ``Demoiselle
Elue,'' with Leonard Slatkin and the Orchestre National de France.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who has had a solid singing career for almost two
decades, Ms. Mentzer was slow to come to the concert stage. She
made her Lincoln Center recital debut only recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new world for me after a steady diet of opera,''
she said from her home in a suburb of Chicago. ``I like a steady
diet of opera. I think I'm well suited to roles with a lot of
depth. And I wasn't ready emotionally to do chamber music. I liked
having a character to hide behind. I had too much pain in my life
to face those emotions as myself. Now I'm ready to do songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Her reasons are practical as well as emotional. Ms. Mentzer, who
is in her early 40s (preferring not to be more specific) and
divorced, shares custody of her 11-year-old son, Ben. When he was
younger, he often traveled with her, but now that he is in middle
school, his travel is limited to school vacations. In contrast to
opera, which requires large blocks of time, concert work seldom
takes more than a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get more of a balance between opera, concerts,
recitals and chamber music,'' Ms. Mentzer said, ``in order to be at
home more with my son.''
</P>
<P>
   The two will spend most of this summer at the Aspen Music
Festival, where she will teach and perform. ``It has a totally
different atmosphere from any other festival,'' said Ms. Mentzer,
who studied there in 1976. ``It's very real, without the usual
fakey aspects of this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuela Hoelterhoff, in ``Cinderella &AMP; Co.,'' her best-selling,
gossipy backstage chronicle of the usually fakey business of opera,
painted an affectionate but less than charitable portrait of Ms.
Mentzer, suggesting that she was prone to depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a bubbly, outgoing person, and I think I often get
misunderstood because I'm not,'' said Ms. Mentzer, noting that she
had not read the book. ``I love my job, I love to make great music,
but I'm not a great schmoozer, and that gives people the wrong
impression. A lot of times, I'm just saving energy. I'm saving it
for mothering. I'm saving it for the stage. A lot of people are
`on' all the time. I'm not. But I feel like a different person when
I walk out on stage. It's very therapeutic.''
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ``singing actress,'' Ms. Mentzer said that she
worked instinctively and enjoyed getting lost in roles. ``I like to
be part of an ensemble,'' she added. ``I like to blend. I think
that's how I do my best work.'' But she does not get lost in the
blend. She holds her own even with a force of nature like Bryn
Terfel, the recent Figaro and the villain, Lindorf, in ``Hoffmann''
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mentzer, who was born in Philadelphia, moved with her family
to Santa Fe during high school, and it was there that she developed
an interest in opera, while working as an usher at the celebrated
summer festival. Although she had planned a career in music
therapy, after her successful apprenticeship at Aspen (where she
was chosen to play Nicklausse in ``Hoffmann'') she enrolled in the
Juilliard School as a voice major. She made her European debut in
1983, as Cherubino at the Cologne Opera, and has performed steadily
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have worked with her are quick to praise her
abilities, drive and sense of humor onstage. ``She's fantastic,''
said the soprano Renee Fleming, who has sung with her on many
occasions, as love object or sister. ``I'm one of her biggest fans,
because I adore her sound, the vibrato and shimmer of it, and her
musicality. She's a terrific actress, and she's really fun to work
with.''
</P>
<P>
   As a new mother, Ms. Fleming said, she went to Ms. Mentzer for
help and advice: ``I had a 2-month-old baby. I hadn't traveled with
an infant before, and it was a little frightening. I called Susanne
and asked, `What do I bring to Italy?' She was a wonderful
mentor.''
</P>
<P>
   The conductor Christoph Eschenbach, who has often worked with
Ms. Mentzer in opera and concert, is also a fan. ``She sings with
so much poetry, so much beauty and depth of expression,'' he said.
``She is such a sincere artist. She always wants to see the
profound side of music and has nothing of superficiality in her.
And she has such a beautiful voice.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone in those sentiments, to judge from the
caliber of musicians who take part in annual ``Jubilate'' concerts
that Ms. Mentzer helps organize in Chicago to benefit Bonaventure
House, a residence for people with AIDS. She asks colleagues to
perform free and finds only generosity, she said. ``If you just ask
them, they'll show up.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 concert raised nearly a million dollars, drawing on the
talents of the bass Samuel Ramey, the rising tenor Gregory Turay,
the soprano Catherine Malfitano, the guitarist Sharon Isbin and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Isbin figured in one of Ms. Mentzer's early steps toward
musical diversity, in 1998, when the two made an Erato recording,
``Wayfaring Stranger.'' Ms. Mentzer has been featured in many
recordings, mostly of complete operas, but this one was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I've been able to decide what I wanted
to sing and stand by it,'' she said. ``We just made music for five
days. It was wonderful.''

 McCAIN PROMISES NEVER TO TAX INTERNET COMMERCE  
(sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona signed a pledge on Tuesday never to
tax commerce on the Internet and challenged Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas to make the same promise, as the two Republican rivals fought
over tax cuts two weeks before the nation's first primary in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush rebuffed his challenger, saying that he wanted to
``understand what the world looks like three to five years from
now.'' And he put his own emphasis on the tax debate by featuring
two residents in Pittsfield, N.H., whom he said would benefit more
under his plan for a $483 billion, five-year tax cut than under
McCain's proposal for a nearly $240 billion reduction.
</P>
<P>
   As he campaigned on Tuesday, Bush talked causticly about how
McCain put out a tax proposal last summer and then released a
revised and more complete plan last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a Washington mindset that says: I'll lay
something out and then, if it takes on a little water, I'll amend
it and keep amending it,'' Bush said in Concord, N.H.. ``At least
the way I do it is _ I think through all the ramifications.''
</P>
<P>
   The day of dueling news conferences showed both men using a
signature Republican issue as they fought for advantage in a tight
New Hampshire race that could either propel McCain's insurgent
campaign or seal Bush's status as his party's front-runner. Several
polls have shown McCain leading in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has long called for a ban on taxes on the Internet. But
he highlighted his stand on Tuesday by signing a poster-sized
blowup copy of an ``E-Freedom declaration'' at a breakfast of the
Greater Nashua Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   He called technology the engine of the nation's economic growth
and warned against harming ``this baby in its cradle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I challenge all the candidates, including Governor Bush to
take the same pledge,'' McCain said, ``not for a moratorium, not
for two years, not for five years, but a permanent, a permanent ban
on Internet taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``E-Freedom declaration,'' which is being promoted by
Citizens for a Sound Economy, an antitax group that often helps
showcase Republican antitax efforts, commits signers to a permanent
ban on Internet access, sales or use taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Many governors oppose a ban for fear that as more and more
commerce goes online the shift could drain state coffers of sales
tax revenues. So the McCain campaign was trying to create a tricky
conflict for Bush, who counts many Republican governors as some of
his staunchest supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said that he favors a moratorium on Internet taxes and
he said on Tuesday that he would consider extending the moratorium
to five years from three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure I understand what the world looks like
three to five from now,'' he said, ``before I speak further.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said that ``nobody's predicted where this technology
is going correctly for the last few years so I'm not sure that
anything can predict it correctly.'' But he insisted that the
Internet would ``churn'' the economy and produce a growth in sales,
not just a shift from shopping in stores to shopping online.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment on his campaign bus, he seemed to hedge on his
pledge, saying that if there were an economic downturn, ``we may
have to look at anything.'' Then he got back on message, saying,
``but I certainly don't believe the Internet is the way to go.'' He
scoffed at the concerns of governors saying, ``Mind you all these
governors that don't want to do that are all running surpluses.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush's aides have been combing McCain's tax plan in search of
debating points, and the governor accused the senator of including
a hidden increase of $40 billion in his proposal because it would
end certain deductions that employers can now take on tax-exempt
benefits they give their workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with leaving money in Washington, D.C.,'' Bush
said, ``and I darned sure don't agree with saying that you're going
to take $40 billion in employer-related benefits and have the
people pay tax on them. I think that's a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign repeated the themes in a new commercial that
starts on Wednesday in New Hampshire. While the commercial does not
mention McCain by name, it is Bush's first one focusing on his
leading rival's tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the McCain campaign called the advertisement a
negative attack.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said on Tuesday that the governor had repeatedly made
accusations about his tax plan ``that have proven to be false.'' He
said his plan would close loopholes that allow corporations to
write off such benefits as golf club and spa memberships and
parking and would not affect health and education benefits. His
aides said the deductions were worth about $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain repeatedly drew applause in Nashua, N.H.,
and at an armory in Rhode Island when he said that his smaller tax
cut would help the middle class while still allowing the government
to devote much of the federal surplus to shoring up Social
Security, Medicare and start retiring the $5.6 trillion national
debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe from a philosophical standpoint as families and as a
nation that it is important for us when we go though bad times and
accumulate debts,'' he said, ``that in good times that we as
families and responsible citizens repay those debts.''
</P>
<P>
   He charged, ``Governor Bush's plan has not one penny for Social
Security, not one penny for Medicare and not one penny for paying
down the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's swing into New Hampshire was his last before devoting his
attention to the Iowa caucuses on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also left the state, arriving in New York City on Tuesday
afternoon for three fund-raisers expected to collect about
$300,000. The first was at the Luncheon Club on Wall Street. The
two other receptions were being held by Edgar Bronfman Jr., the
chief executive of Seagram, and Michael Bloomberg, the media
executive.

 &HT;    Stahl lands No. 2 job at Coke
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's official.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Stahl will become Coca-Cola's new president and chief
operating officer in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Stahl's dynamic leadership has been proven for more than
two decades,'' Douglas Daft, the company's current president, said
in a statement Tuesday after recommending Stahl for the post during
a board of directors meeting in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl, the 46-year-old head of the company's operations in North
America and Latin America, will become Coca-Cola's 20th president
after the April 19 board meeting. That is when the board will elect
Daft to the top spot of chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're running an operation as broad-based as Coca-Cola,
two heads are better than one, if you have the right two heads,''
said Manny Goldman, global beverage analyst with Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, Daft and Stahl complement each other. Daft has
tremendous international experience operationally, and Stahl has
significant experience operationally in North America and
financially worldwide,'' Goldman said. ``In addition, Jack has very
strong relations with Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   A Daft-Stahl team will re-establish the No. 1 and No. 2
management structure that was missing during the first two years of
M. Douglas Ivester's tenure as chairman. Ivester did not name a
president when he left that post to become chairman following the
death of Roberto C. Goizueta in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Daft only became president last month after Ivester announced
that he would prematurely retire in April.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester was criticized by some analysts for not naming a
president, which they believe contributed to some of the problems
the company faced under his watch. Some analysts speculate that
those problems, combined with his refusal to name a No. 2 person,
led key board members to seek his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   For years, under the dynamic duo of Goizueta and former
President Donald Keough, the company was known for its stellar
management and financial performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was interesting that Daft referred to a partnership with
Stahl in his statement,'' said John Sicher, editor and publisher of
Beverage Digest. ``It begins to give us insight into what kind of
working relationship they will have and the management style at the
top of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the board also elected new executive vice presidents,
who will sit on a six-member management executive committee that
will set company policy and establish a strategic direction.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Daft and Stahl, members of the committee are
James Chestnut, head of Operations Support; Charles Frenette,
president of Greater Europe Group; Joseph Gladden, general counsel;
and Carl Ware, head of Global Public Affairs and Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone on the executive committee, except Gladden, has gotten
a new job with the company over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug has a bright team in place to take the company forward,''
said board member Jimmy Williams. ``Jack is clearly an ideal
choice. Everybody is excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, Daft, bottlers and analysts all cited Stahl's 20 years
of experience at the company as a key attribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack has flourished in two positions of tremendous importance
and responsibility,'' Daft said. ``First, as the company's youngest
chief financial officer at age 36 and recently as the president of
our key U.S. and Canada operations.''
</P>
<P>
   During Stahl's tenure running Coke in North America, which he
has been doing since 1994, the operation has contributed a greater
share of the company's profits. In 1993, before Stahl took over,
North America accounted for 22 percent of the profits. In 1998 it
grew to 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke in the U.S. way outperformed Pepsi during Stahl's years
at the helm,'' said Sicher, of Beverage Digest. ``From 1995 to
1998, Coke's market share increased 2.2 points, while Pepsi's
increased a half a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Stahl, who is known as having good interpersonal skills, is
popular with bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, the bottlers like him,'' said Bob Lovell, vice
president of marketing for Birmingham-based Coca-Cola Bottling
Company United, the system's fourth-largest U.S. bottler. ``He's
very candid, and he listens well. He follows up on what he says
he'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovell and others describe Stahl as bright and articulate, with
a good sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Boston, Stahl holds a bachelor's degree in economics
from Emory University and a master's degree from the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   He spent two years with the Arthur Andersen accounting firm
before joining Coke in 1979 as an investor relations specialist. A
year later he became manager of investor relations and pension
investments. In 1981 he was named executive assistant to the chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   From there it was a slow but steady rise up the corporate
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985 he was promoted to manager of planning and business
development. Three years later he was elected vice president and
controller. In 1989 he became chief financial officer. Five years
later he became head of the company's North America operations.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three months ago he was given the added responsibility
for Latin America, as well as for the company's Minute Maid
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl also is a co-chairman with Ware of the company's Diversity
Advisory Council, which Ivester created following the filing of an
employee racial discrimination lawsuit against the company last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl is married and has two children.

CITIGROUP TO BUY SCHRODER'S INVESTMENT BANK UNIT, MERGE IT WITH
SALOMON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a hurry to become more competitive in the
exploding investment banking business in Europe, Citigroup said
Tuesday that it would acquire the last independent investment bank
in London from Schroders PLC for about $2.21 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, the largest financial-services company, also
announced that its net income for the fourth quarter rose to $2.62
billion, or 75 cents a diluted share, from $677 million, or 19
cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1998. The year-ago profit
was depressed by trading losses and restructuring charges and
expenses related to the 1998 merger of Citicorp and Travelers
Group, which created Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup also said that it would raise its quarterly dividend
14 percent, to 16 cents a share from 14 cents. Investors reacted to
all of the news out of Citigroup by sending its shares to a 52-week
high of $58.50, up 50 cents. The earnings exceeded analysts'
consensus forecast of 70 cents a share, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   The company's purchase of Schroders' investment banking business
is being structured as a merger of that operation with Citigroup's
Salomon Smith Barney investment banking unit. In Europe, the
combined operation will be known as Schroders Salomon Smith Barney
and will be co-managed by executives from each firm.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Weill, chairman and co-chief executive officer of
Citigroup, said the deal ``will put us two or three years ahead of
where we would have been'' on the path to being a leading
investment bank in Europe. As the business of advising corporations
on mergers and acquisitions has boomed in Europe, Salomon has
fallen far behind the two New York-based investment banks that are
dominating that business, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. and
Goldman Sachs Group.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup has agreed to pay about $220 million in incentives to
retain hundreds of Schroders' most important employees, said
Michael Carpenter, chairman and chief executive of Salomon Smith
Barney. Most of those employees did not own significant amounts of
stock in Schroders, whose founding family owns about 48 percent of
its stock.
</P>
<P>
   To seal the deal, Citigroup rolled out its newest heavy hitter:
former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. At a dinner Saturday night
in the Marlborough Suite at the Dukes Hotel in London, Rubin,
chairman of Citigroup's executive committee, assured Schroders'
executives that Salomon no longer was the ``rough-and-tumble''
trading operation it had been 10 years ago, said a person who was
there.
</P>
<P>
   It was important for Rubin, who was a partner at Goldman, Sachs
long before it went public last year, to put ``his personal
imprimatur'' on the deal because Schroders executives saw their
firm as a collegial partnership, said another person who was at the
dinner. ``He brought a fresh set of eyes to the strength that
Citigroup has around the world,'' this person said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Citigroup plans to fold the smaller Schroder &AMP; Co.
investment banking unit into Salomon Smith Barney, a move that
Citigroup executives acknowledged would result in the loss of a
considerable number of jobs. ``In the U.S., we have significant
overlap,'' Carpenter said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The proposed deal would leave Schroders PLC as a public company
in London specializing in money management for institutions and
wealthy people. But Win Bischoff, the German-born chairman of
Schroders who was knighted in December, will take the new position
of chairman of Citigroup Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Klein, who will be co-head of investment banking in
London for Schroders Salomon Smith Barney, said the decision to
acquire Schroders grew out of a strategic review of Citigroup's
options in August. The firm committed to building its European
banking operation fast, sending top managers over from New York and
hiring about 65 investment bankers in the next four months.
</P>
<P>
   Schroders then was considering building up its presence in New
York by acquiring Beacon Group, an investment banking boutique run
by former Goldman Sachs partner Geoffrey Boisi, and putting Boisi
in charge of Schroder &AMP; Co. Instead of working for Schroders, Boisi
wound up advising the firm on its deal with Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Christmas, Bischoff contacted Carpenter and invited
him to make an offer before Schroders' board met Jan. 6. After
that, the two sides negotiated the deal, meeting mostly in the New
York area, sometimes at Citigroup's corporate retreat in Armonk,
N.Y. Carpenter said he went to London last week, using the
``cover'' that he was there to receive a ``bank of the year'' award
from a financial publication, and stayed around to wrap up the
talks over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't finish it for us,'' Klein said. ``We still have
some significant building to do on the continent.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong growth in investment banking fueled Citigroup's
surprisingly strong performance last quarter. The firm's corporate
and investment bank, which includes Salomon Smith Barney, earned
$1.31 billion, up 136 percent from $553 million a year before. Its
consumer businesses, including branch banking, credit cards,
insurance and consumer finance, had operating income of $1.17
billion, up 35 percent from $872 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers were very solid, though probably skewed more to
Salomon Smith Barney than to the consumer businesses,'' said Judah
Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``They have very good
revenue momentum and a lot of positive operating leverage.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ PaineWebber Group posted better-than-expected
quarterly earnings driven by active financial markets. PaineWebber
said its fourth-quarter earnings increased 66 percent, to $166.3
million, or $1.07 a diluted share, from $100.4 million, or 63 cents
a share.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's net revenue _ revenue minus interest expense _
increased 27 percent, to $1.39 billion, from $1.1 billion in the
fourth quarter of 1998. The amount of customer assets at the firm,
a key source of recurring revenue, rose 12 percent in the quarter
to $423 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Marron, chairman and chief executive of PaineWebber, said
customers are embracing the firm's integration of the Internet into
its business. ``Affluent clients now want to be able to see their
accounts online,'' he said, adding that the amount of assets in the
firm's online accounts increased 40 percent last quarter to more
than $140 billion. About 20 percent of that money is new to the
firm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the Charles Schwab Corp. reported fourth quarter
net income of $170 million, or 20 cents a diluted share, up 60
percent from $106 million, or 12 cents a share, in the fourth
quarter of 1998. San Francisco-based Schwab said three weeks ago
that its earnings would exceed analysts' expectations, then
announced last week that it would use $2.73 billion of its stock to
acquire U.S. Trust Corp., a New York-based private bank.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab said its revenue for the quarter rose 43 percent, to
$1.13 billion as the average number of daily trades its customers
made surged to an all-time high of 234,000 a day in December.
Almost three-quarters, 73 percent, of all trades at Schwab were
made online last quarter, up from 61 percent a year before.

FED DRAWS A PORTRAIT OF A WEALTHIER AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In its most detailed look so far at how families
have fared during the nation's long run of prosperity, the Federal
Reserve said Tuesday that the strong economy pushed more households
int the middle class, and that the strong market showered benefits
on all but those with the lowest incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The report, based on an in-depth survey of the finances of more
than 4,000 households in 1998 and comparisons to similar surveys in
1989, 1992 and 1995, also found a sharp increase in the percentage
of families owning stocks directly or through retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   And while generally finding most households to be in slightly
better financial shape relative to 1995, the report, the Fed's
Survey of Consumer Finances, flashed some warning signs about the
accumulation of debt. The proportion of families that had missed a
debt payment by two months or more, for example, rose to 8.1
percent in 1998 from 7.1 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``While income continued a moderate upward trend, net worth grew
strongly, and the increase in net worth was broadly shared by
different demographic groups,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It did not draw any explicit conclusions about the degree to
which the gap between rich and poor was growing. But it was
relatively clear in suggesting that education levels played a key
role in determining economic success.
</P>
<P>
   And the report showed that while white families tended to enjoy
strong growth in net worth _ assets like stocks and equity in homes
minus liabilities like mortgages and credit card debts _ non-white
and Hispanic families were far less likely to have seen a big jump
in their wealth from 1995 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the report simply confirmed what other statistics
and common sense have previously suggested: that the combination of
a long economic expansion and a bull market on Wall Street left
most people making a little more money and feeling somewhat
wealthier.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that the net worth of the median household in
1998 was $71,600, up 17.6 percent from 1995, when the figure was
$60,900, adjusted for inflation. The Fed's data suggested that much
of the gain in net worth flowed to the very wealthiest families.
But it also showed substantial gains among households with incomes
starting at $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Median family pretax income rose to $33,400 in 1998, up 2.1
percent from $32,700 in 1995, the Fed said. It was the first time
during the 1990s that median income _ which means that half of the
families were above that level and half below _ adjusted for
inflation, had surpassed the level of 1989, when it was $32,800.
</P>
<P>
   But the gains appeared to be concentrated on wealthy families,
though self-employed people also had large income gains in 1995-98
period.
</P>
<P>
   But the data also suggested that more households were slowly
pulling themselves up out of the lower income groups and more
firmly into the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of families making less than $10,000 a year
declined to 12.6 percent of all families in 1998 from 15.1 percent
in 1995. Families making $10,000 to $24,999 declined to 24.8
percent of the population from 25.4 percent, while families making
$25,000 to $49,999 declined to 28.8 percent of the total from 31
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Families making $50,000 to $99,999 increased to 25.2 percent of
the total from 21 percent in 1995, while those in the $100,000 and
above bracket rose to 8.6 percent of the total from 7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers were positive in the aggregate, they struck
some analysts as showing remarkably little improvement given the
strength and duration of the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lived through a stock market such as none of us have
ever seen and few of us ever dreamed of,'' said Henry Aaron, a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a liberal-leaning
research organization. ``Unemployment has fallen to the lowest
levels in more than three decades. Yet these global measures of
well being have moved little. Income is flat. Asset holdings are up
a few percent.''

 &HT;    BUCS NOTEBOOK: Speedy foe impressive to Dungy
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Tampa Bay players were rewarded with a day off
Tuesday, but coach Tony Dungy and the rest of his staff were in the
team's headquarters to review film of the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Dungy seems more impressed with his foe in Sunday's NFC
Championship game with each new tape he watches.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis ``is a very explosive team _ that is the No. 1 thing
you see,'' he said. ``You see speed and explosiveness in every area
of their team. That is how we tried to build our team, and they
have done real well at it.The big question
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, good pitching usually beats good hitting. In
football, what happens when a good offense goes against a good
defense? St. Louis has the No. 1 offense in the NFC, while Tampa
Bay has the top-ranked defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happens; you guys will have to research and
tell me what happens when that is the case,'' Dungy said. ``I
really don't know. (But) being a defensive coach, I'd like to think
defense'' has the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy the moment
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the laid-back style of team leader Warren Sapp.
Whatever the case, Tampa Bay's players appear loose and relaxed.
It's not usually the personality of an NFL team approaching the
pressure-packed conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them to just enjoy it,'' Dungy said. ``It's something
that goes with the territory. You have to enjoy it, but you also
have to know what we are really here for _ that's to prepare and
get ready for the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this kind of thing doesn't happen all the time. You don't
play in the NFC Championship every week, so you need to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dungy had been concerned that the team had gotten out of control
before last weekend's game against the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we had a bye in the first round, we had to wait two
weeks to play, and our guys were very hyped,'' Dungy said. ``This
week, thankfully, we are on a more normal schedule. The thing I
tell the (players) is that this is still a football game, even
though it's the NFC Championship. It's really not a lot different
(from) the other 17 games we've played.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta wannabe
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay backup quarterback Eric Zeier, who will be an
unrestricted free agent after the Super Bowl, again confirmed this
week that he is willing to listen to Falcons officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, having the chance to go back and play in front of
my friends and family would be good,'' said Zeier, a five-year
veteran. ``I don't know what is going to happen after the season.
I'm in a great situation here (in Tampa). I love this time; I love
this organization. We'll just have to wait and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Two coaches' approaches
</P>
<P>
   Dungy has earned the respect of his players for his
non-confrontational methods and his refusal to single out and
criticize players through the media. The same cannot be said for
the coach of last week's opponent, Norv Turner of the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Turner remains the subject of criticism in Washington for
singling out veteran snapper Dan Turk in the 14-13 loss. Turk made
a bad snap that cost Washington a chance to kick a game-winning
field goal with 1:17 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy didn't get the job done, not the whole special-teams
unit,'' Turner said.Brett Conway
</P>
<P>
   Turk was so upset that he skipped the team flight Saturday night
and remained with friends in South Florida. He was a no-show at
Washington's season-ending team meeting Monday and wants to be cut
from the team.

   WASHINGTON _ Put it in the category of Nixon goes to China.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the conservative chairman
of the Foreign Relations Committee and a vocal critic of the United
Nations, is to be the first legislator from any nation to address
the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for him to soften overnight his harsh views of the
international organization, which over the years he has called ``a
disgrace'' and ``Orwellian.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Congress approved a bill last year to pay nearly $1
billion in back dues that the United States owes the United Nations
in exchange for structural changes at the organization, both Helms
and U.N. leaders agreed that it was time to call a truce.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going with a hand of friendship extended, but will
deliver a message that, to set right the U.N.-U.S. relationship, it
has to be with a reformed U.N. that knows its limitations,'' said
Marc Thiessen, Helms' spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Under legislation sponsored by Helms and Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., Congress authorized repaying $819 million in back dues over
three years and forgiving another $107 million in debt, but only if
the State Department certified that the United Nations had met a
series of conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Among those were reducing the U.S. share of the U.N.
peacekeeping budget to 25 percent from 31 percent and paring
Washington's share of the regular budget to 22 percent from 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Helms has been something as an ally, although if you look
at the legislation, it's full of impossible conditions to meet,''
said Fred Eckhard, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the full Foreign Relations Committee will hold an
unusual hearing in Manhattan at the Bar Association of New York to
review the conditions Congress set down.
</P>
<P>
   Helms is taking up a standing invitation from Annan, an offer
renewed recently by the U.S. delegate to the United Nations,
Richard Holbrooke. Holbrooke lobbied Congress extensively last year
to resolve an issue that threatened to undermine both America's
global reputation and a year-end budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The back dues were resolved after the White House and House
Republicans struck a deal on an unrelated issue that put into law a
ban on using U.S.for international organizations that promote
abortion rights. The ban would be written into law, but only for
one year.

AT YALE, A $500 MILLION INVESTMENT IN SCIENCE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn. Mass., Calif., N.Y., N.J.)  (rk) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concerned that it will not be able to stay in the top academic
ranks without a greater presence in science, Yale University plans
to announce Thursday that it will invest $500 million in science
and engineering facilities, including the construction of five new
buildings and the renovation of several old ones.
</P>
<P>
   Universities everywhere are spending heavily on genomics
centers, computer labs and other facilities to foster cutting-edge
scientific fields, but Yale's $500 million commitment appears to be
one of the largest one-time building plans ever.
</P>
<P>
   Yale's decision to try to become more of a science and
technology powerhouse illustrates the growing importance that
universities are placing on scientific research. It also represents
a serious bid to reposition Yale's reputation; it is better known
for its prominence in the humanities, social sciences and arts, and
for its professional schools, than for its work in the sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yale is committed to remain on everyone's short list of the
best universities in the world,'' said Richard C. Levin, Yale's
president, an economist who studies technological innovation. ``In
the 21st century, you must excel in science and engineering to
maintain that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern space for scientific research is crucial, Levin said, in
attracting top professors and students. ``We find ourselves in
stiffer competition in the sciences than in other fields,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   E. William Colglazier, executive officer of the National Academy
of Sciences, said many universities were recognizing the need to
spend more money on science. ``I think this is the wave of the
future, and we'll see more of these announcements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a reflection of the fact that science and technology
are reshaping the world, and the universities need to make these
types of investments to remain in the forefront,'' he added.
``Unfortunately it's expensive, but universities like Yale have
decided they have to make this kind of investment.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Aided by its medical school, Yale is stronger scientifically
than its reputation might suggest, Levin contends. He said it was
among the top four universities in grants from the National
Institutes of Health and among the top four in scientific articles
most cited by others. Most of its science and engineering
departments are ranked among the top 12 nationally, he said, and
two _ physiology and pharmacology _ are No. 1 in graduate
department rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-three Yale professors are members of the National Academy
of Sciences, placing it fifth after Harvard (158), the University
of California at Berkeley (115), Stanford (111) and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (100). But the Yale faculty
includes only one Nobel laureate in the sciences: Sidney Altman,
who won the Nobel Prize in biology in 1989 for research on RNA.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of Yale's 5,200 undergraduates are in science or
engineering, up from about 17 percent a decade ago, and about a
third of its 1,800 graduate students are in those fields.
</P>
<P>
   The university has begun to try to upgrade its science offerings
in recent years. Levin announced his intention to strengthen
engineering when he became president in 1993, and he brought in Dr.
D. Allan Bromley, a nuclear physicist and former science adviser to
President George Bush, as a dean.
</P>
<P>
   The new construction plan grew out of a report last fall on
Yale's needs for expansion and renovation of its physical plant.
Yale has erected only two new science buildings in the last 30
years, one connected to the medical school and the other for a
structural biology center. The new buildings will expand the
university's science and engineering space by about 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $500 million investment, about 40 percent will go for new
buildings, and the rest will be used to refurbish existing space.
The money will come on top of existing spending in science and
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Many other colleges and universities, including Haverford,
Hofstra, Middlebury, Princeton, Williams and Wooster, have
announced new science centers in recent years, and some are
undertaking more than one.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard, for example, has said it plans to spend about $200
million over the next five years on five new and refurbished
science centers, including one for physical sciences and one for
life sciences. It recently opened a new computer sciences building
and is nearly finished with a new chemistry laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Yale plan covers only capital spending, Levin said
it would probably result in more hiring and spending in these
disciplines, too. He said the university had already committed to
adding four positions in engineering and six in the biological
sciences, which it is filling now.
</P>
<P>
   The new buildings, which Yale hopes to complete in six to eight
years, will include facilities for chemical, biological and
environmental research as well as for engineering and for the
School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. Yale also plans to
build two lecture halls for introductory science courses.
</P>
<P>
   A $24 million gift from John Malone, chairman of Liberty Media
and a 1963 graduate of Yale's engineering program, will help
finance the new engineering building, and Yale hopes to attract
other private gifts. In the meantime, it will borrow to pay for
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut officials are cheering Yale's new building plan.
Gov. John Rowland and his senior economic adviser, Arthur Diedrick,
will join Yale officials Thursday morning for the formal
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great thing for Connecticut,'' Diedrick said Tuesday,
adding that research at the university had led to the creation of
35 companies over the last decade and that an expanding research
base could lead to even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will just further education in Connecticut in the
sciences and engineering,'' Diedrick said, ``which will be greatly
needed, as economic development focuses more on science and
technology fields.''

SOMEONE TO STEP IN FOR FARRELL?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23)

American Ballet Theater's ``Corsaire'' on PBS.  
 By HARRIS GREEN 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City Ballet's post-``Nutcracker'' winter
season is barely four weeks old, yet among a growing body of
regular balletgoers there is already a sense of completion about
it, thanks to the 23-year-old principal dancer Maria Kowroski. She
is assuaging and possibly wiping out nagging doubts that in some
quarters had verged on dread.
</P>
<P>
   This unease arose a few years ago when Kyra Nichols and Darci
Kistler began to relinquish the precious repertory of Balanchine
roles that Suzanne Farrell had either created or made her own.
Simply put, people were asking: ``Who else can now perform these
ballets with an authority, a grandeur and a daring similar to
Farrell's?'' And authority, grandeur and daring similar to hers are
all anyone has a right to expect; to ask for her equal would be
greedy, as well as preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   So far this season, most of the Farrell roles have been in very
good hands indeed. Ms. Nichols has been idle, but Ms. Kistler
continues to dominate the empty stage in the finale of ``Vienna
Waltzes'' with her exquisite arms and supple back.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda Weese and Wendy Whelan gave gratifying performances in
``Mozartiana'' and ``Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2,''
respectively. Both danced with a scrupulous, fearless assurance
that made one eager to see their subsequent performances for the
extra subtleties that seemed certain to come.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the imperious flexibility of Helene Alexopoulos in
``Monumentum pro Gesualdo'' last season, and watching her boneless
mastery of Peter Martins' extraordinary demands in ``The Waltz
Project'' earlier this month, one looks forward to her future
assignments as well.
</P>
<P>
   The company's women are unusually strong this season. Despite
injuries _ Monique Meunier, Alexandra Ansanelli and Riolama Lorenzo
are hurt _ and influenza, City Ballet could count on outstanding
dancers like Jennie Somogyi, Jenifer Ringer, Pascale van Kipnis and
Rachel Rutherford, among others.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Ms. Kistler, however, they are not
particularly tall and therefore lack the amplitude that made a
Farrell performance bigger than life. Ms. Kowroski's height (5 foot
9 inches off point) is one of several reasons she has been the
center of attention ever since her appearance at the School of
American Ballet's 30th Annual Workshop Performances in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   As the dancer who dominates the man in the final Dark Messenger
section of Balanchine's ``Serenade,'' a role still in her
repertory, she possessed a surprisingly mature assurance. But it
was in his ``Western Symphony,'' one of those works he had
dismissed as an ``applause machine,'' that she had her maximum
impact. High as the students' energy level was in ``Symphony,'' it
did not peak until Ms. Kowroski charged onstage, the embodiment of
daring and assurance, powered by the longest legs in sight and a
yeasty delight in performing.
</P>
<P>
   (Before enrolling in SAB two years earlier, at age 16, she had
studied at the School of Grand Rapids Ballet for nine years and had
often danced in the Michigan company's ``Nutcracker.'')
</P>
<P>
   Such authority, not to mention such legs, guaranteed that her
joining the City Ballet corps in January 1995 would not lead to
anonymity in the ranks. The ballet master in chief, Martins,
immediately began grooming her for prominent roles.
</P>
<P>
   The soloist James Fayette recalls how quickly his surprise at
being asked to partner this novice turned into admiration. ``She
was totally focused in rehearsal,'' he says. ``She related to her
partner _ she looked you in the eye. And she was humble. You know,
you cannot escape history at City Ballet; you look at the score and
you read, `Suzanne jumps.' Maria knows the obligations that go
along with our repertory.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the mantle of Suzanne Farrell _ or perhaps one should
say ``the shawl,'' Ms. Farrell's preferred wrap _ holds no terror
for Ms. Kowroski. Asked about the Farrell roles, four of which she
has danced to date, she says: ``It's an honor to do them. For me
they are no burden or obligation but a challenge. And I like
challenges. In rehearsal I'm not comfortable until I feel I'm
perfect. When I get that assurance, then I can take chances
onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a Farrell successor, exceedingly hopeful in 1995, began
in earnest a little over two years later, after Ms. Kowroski was
made a soloist. Already she had brought a similarly regal authority
to Titania in the pas de deux with the Cavalier in Balanchine's
``Midsummer Night's Dream'' and a similarly nacreous quality in
repose on her seashell couch.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first week of the current winter season demonstrated Ms.
Kowroski's growing command of a broad repertory. On the same
evening that she was an Austrian maiden, swooning in the moonlit
forest of ``Vienna Waltzes,'' she assumed various serpentine and
insectile shapes in ``The Waltz Project'' and, with her arms
seemingly joined at the elbows and her legs at the knees, twitched
alarmingly as Charles Askegard toted her offstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt,'' she admits when asked about the contortion. (She
is fortunate to have someone as tall as Askegard as a frequent
partner, even if their long legs create problems in rehearsals.
``We spend a lot of time kicking each other,'' he says, with genial
stoicism.)
</P>
<P>
   Two days later she was presiding over the second pas de trois in
``Agon'' with cool authority. Her awesome extension was so
rock-solidly balanced on point that her partners, Arch Higgins and
Stephen Hanna, could have taken twice as long to offer support.
</P>
<P>
   Perfectionist though she is, Ms. Kowroski in class is invariably
collegial. It was this quality that caught the attention of the
Broadway choreographer Susan Stroman last spring when she was
casting ``Blossom Got Kissed,'' her contribution to City Ballet's
50th-anniversary season and the last of three ballets collectively
titled ``Duke!'' (because all were set to Duke Ellington's music).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stroman had in mind a character so out of it that she wears
a tutu to a jazz club, where she ``learns rhythm and finds love
with a triangle player.''
</P>
<P>
   Because City Ballet was constantly rehearsing and performing a
record number of works at that festive time, however, Ms. Stroman
did not have the luxury of conducting individual auditions. ``I was
familiar with the dancers, of course,'' she says. ``I knew Robert
La Fosse could play the musician. I knew the type I wanted for
Blossom. I decided to watch four company classes, looking for
performers who had personality and could perform through the beat
as well as on it. Maria was so tough and serious but so obviously
happy to be there and so outgoing with her fellow dancers that I
knew she was the one.'' (Asked why she thought she had been chosen,
Ms. Kowroski says, ``I think Susan saw me cutting up during a
break.'')
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Ms. Stroman's showmanship, Ellington's music
(belted out by the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra under David
Berger) and Ms. Kowroski's characterization made ``Duke!'' one of
the few exhilarating triumphs of that hectic season. Promotion to
principal followed within weeks. This month she was scheduled to
add four new roles to her repertory of around 30 ballets.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Satisfaction is fleeting for the perfectionist, however.
Although she has a steady boyfriend, the City Ballet corps dancer
Stuart Capps, and is appreciated by one of the world's major
performing-arts institutions, she will look positively stricken if
asked about her failure to whip off all 32 of the obligatory
third-act fouettes in Martins' ``Swan Lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Assurance that her characterizations of Odette and Odile had
been wholly convincing brings little consolation. ``I just wasn't
strong enough,'' she says, then adds quietly and firmly, ``I'm
going to work on those fouettes.''

AT VATICAN'S INTERFAITH CEREMONY, RIFTS REMAIN OBVIOUS

<P>
   ROME _ Indulgences, the Roman Catholic practice of remitting
punishment for sins in exchange for prayer, repentance and, in the
Middle Ages, even money, helped set off the Protestant Reformation.
</P>
<P>
   Five hundred years later, indulgences remain a sticking point
between Catholics and Protestants. On Tuesday, a few of the world's
largest Protestant denominations boycotted a religious ceremony
that the Vatican described as the ``most significant ecumenical
event'' of this Holy Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it was. Metropolitan Athanasios, a representative
of the orthodox patriarch of Constantinople, and George Carey,
archbishop of Canterbury, helped Pope John Paul II push open the
Holy Door of St. Paul Outside the Walls Basilica.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth and final such ceremony celebrating the start
of a Jubilee, or Roman Catholic Holy Year. On Christmas Eve, the
pope opened doors at St. Peter's Basilica, and subsequently opened
doors at two other major basilicas in Rome where Catholic pilgrims
can earn indulgences during the Holy Year. Tuesday's ceremony was
the only one that actively involved non-Catholic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from 22 Christian churches, including the
Lutheran World Federation, attended the service, one of the largest
interfaith gatherings since the Second Vatican Council. But some
Protestant leaders, among them Baptists, Presbyterians and
Calvinists, chose to skip an event they viewed as an affront.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reformation was provoked by an indulgence campaign, so
associating a jubilee indulgence with Holy Year celebrations seemed
like a retrograde step by the Vatican,'' explained the Rev. Paraic
Reamonn, spokesman for the World Alliance of Reformed Churches,
based in Geneva, which represents 75 million Protestants, mostly
Presbyterian and Calvinist.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony signaled both the progress of interfaith dialogue
over the last 30 years and some of the stumbling blocks. But it
also illustrated the contradictions that have run through John Paul
II's papacy. No pope has worked harder to mend the rifts between
Christian churches. The presence of so many Orthodox religious
leaders, as well as the head of the Lutheran church worldwide,
testified to his diplomacy. At the same time, however, John Paul II
has rigidly upheld church dogma and Catholic traditions, including
indulgences, that antagonize other faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Anglican Church, which is closer to Rome than most
Protestant denominations, conceded that deep divisions simmer
beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was important to work toward a closer
relationship between our two churches,'' said the Rev. Paul Avis,
general secretary of the Church of England's Council on Christian
Charity, explaining the archbishop of Canterbury's participation,
``without concealing that serious difficulties remain to be
overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The Anglican decision to ordain women is one source of friction
with Rome, but there are others, including the authority of the
pope.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the Vatican and Lutheran World Federation signed a
landmark joint declaration, saying they were in agreement on most
major points of doctrine, though not all. But many Lutheran
churches refused to go along. The more outspoken critics, including
the second largest American branch, the Lutheran Church-Missouri
Synod, said they were not invited to the event Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has stressed that he wants ecumenicism to be a keynote
of the Jubilee, and that was the main reason he twinned Tuesday's
ecumenical service with the opening of a Holy Door. Since the first
Jubilee in 1300, popes have granted plenary indulgences to pilgrims
who visit holy sites in Rome. The sale of indulgences, which helped
drive Martin Luther to break with Rome in 1517, was stopped soon
after, but their religious value was reaffirmed at the Council of
Trent. Especially after the Second Vatican Council reforms,
progressive Catholics sought to play down indulgences, viewing them
as hindrances to ecumenical dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   For the year 2000, however, John Paul II has highlighted the
importance of indulgences, broadening the ways they can be earned,
including attendance at Tuesday's ceremony at St. Paul Outside the
Walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, that was a bit much,'' said the Rev. Domenico
Tomasetto, a Baptist pastor who is president of the Federation of
Evangelical Churches in Italy and declined to attend. ``The
Protestant church was born to protest indulgences.''
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old pope was clearly elated by Tuesday's ceremony,
walking at an unusually brisk pace down the aisle of St. Paul's,
and delivering his homily on the need to repent for divisions
within Christianity in a clear, firm voice. He improvised a new
ending to his prepared remarks, saying, ``Unity, unity, maybe even
we, leaving this basilica, can say unity.''
</P>
<P>
   But some still detected roots of division. ``The Vatican seems
to be facing in two directions: there are genuine ecumenical
feelers, and there are unilateral steps that go backward,'' Reamonn
said. ``Sometimes it seems that for at least some in the Vatican,
Christian unity can be achieved by everybody else becoming Roman
Catholic.''

LAX TRAINING HARMING TEXAS PRISON GUARDS, SAYS REPORT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Training for state prison guards has been so
severely curtailed in recent years that the officers' lives are in
``grave danger,'' the director of training for the prison system
has warned.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Gov. George W. Bush, Charles D. Godwin, training
director for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, accused his
bosses not only of diverting training funds to other prison
expenditures but also of lying to the governor and the public about
the seriousness of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   His letter and an accompanying report outline 32 staff assaults
since November 1998 that he said could easily have resulted in
deaths _ including an assault in which an officer was stabbed with
a 26-inch steel rod and another in which a prisoner tried to throw
an officer off the second tier onto a concrete floor.
</P>
<P>
   Godwin posted a signed summary of his report to the governor on
the Internet at www.tdcjid.com _ an unofficial agency Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile on Tuesday, the 230,000 member Texas AFL-CIO urged
Bush to call a special legislative session to address a shortage of
guards at state prisons. TDCJ has about 1,000 vacant guard
positions throughout the state, a reflection of rapid expansion of
prisons in recent years plus a booming economy that has offered
Texans a variety of job choices with higher pay and better working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO's approval of a special session resolution came a
week after prison guards presented Bush's office with a petition
urging him to call the Legislature into session. The Texas
Legislature isn't scheduled to meet again until January 2001. Bush
has said he will not call a special session but he does support
higher pay for guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush, the TDCJ administration is deceiving you, as
well as the public in Texas,'' Godwin wrote in a letter dated Jan.
12. ``I have in the past witnessed attempts by TDCJ administrators
to deceive members of the Board of Criminal Justice. I believe you
likewise have been deceived by TDCJ officials as to the seriousness
of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety of prison guards has become an increasingly public issue
in recent weeks following the murder of correctional officer Daniel
Nagle, the inmate takeover of a Beeville prison last month and the
stabbing earlier this week of a guard at a facility in Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Godwin said, Nagle's murder and the subsequent takeover
of the McConnell Unit by some prisoners ``are the direct results of
dangerous trends in security over the past several years.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagle's death is still under investigation. TDCJ spokesman Glen
Castlebury said Tuesday a report on the McConnell Unit uprising is
expected to be completed by the first week in February.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Officer Ernest Coleman, 41, was stabbed in
the stomach with a pencil by a convict at the Byrd Diagnostic Unit
in Huntsville where incoming male prisoners are processed.
</P>
<P>
   ``TDCJ officials say there is a lack of funds within the agency
to address these issues (of recruiting, training and retention),''
Godwin added. ``This is another lie. It is not a lack of funds; it
is the low priority placed on the lives of the officers by the TDCJ
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Godwin's letter prompted an immediate and strong response from
Criminal Justice Board Chairman Alfred ``Mac'' Stringfellow of San
Antonio, who wrote Godwin, saying that his ``serious accusations''
require the board to investigate the matter. But he also warned
that if Godwin's accusations are wrong, ``they are defamatory,
irresponsible and at a minimum inconsistent with your current
position as ... director of training.''
</P>
<P>
   Stringfellow also ordered Godwin to attend the board meeting
later this week to defend and support his allegations.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Godwin also called for the resignation of TDCJ
Executive Director Wayne Scott and the entire Texas Board of
Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Godwin, no stranger to controversy with his bosses, said he
fears he will be fired from his job for speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's got to get their attention,'' he said. ``And I've
already got the reputation as a whistle-blower. I'm not held in
favor with the administration anyway. I figured somebody had to do
it and it might as well be me. So many people in the agency fear
retaliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Godwin said TDCJ's own reports on staff assaults dispel prison
administrators' contentions that there is no threat to prison
security or officer safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the assault rate and if you look at the
increasingly violent nature of assaults, then you know that is not
a true statement,'' Godwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Assaults are at least 10 times more frequent than they were in
1988 and they are increasingly violent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Castlebury said the rate of assaults with a weapon has, indeed,
increased from 4.3 per 10,000 inmates in 1997 to 7.4 per 10,000 in
1999. ``Weapons'' include throwing of bodily fluids and other
liquids at guards, the two most common types of assaults, according
to TDCJ officials.
</P>
<P>
   But he attributed the cause to the fact that TDCJ is locking up
more violent criminals for longer periods of time _ not to cutbacks
in training.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment further on any other allegations that
Godwin raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The TDCJ administration cut training hours, lowered academic
standards, denied requests for additional instructors, reduced the
training budget, spent dedicated training funds on other programs,
canceled renovations, delayed construction of new training
facilities and did not pursue recommended recruiting and retention
strategies all during this period of rapidly increasing inmate
assaults on correctional employees,'' Godwin said in his report to
the governor.

 DES MOINES, Iowa: Shrum said.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But no one has disputed that the debates generated interest from
the press. A national poll by the Shorenstein Center at Harvard
University found that the rash of debates last week spawned the
heaviest news coverage thus far of the presidential campaign. The
survey found a doubling from the previous week of the number of
Americans who could recall having seen, read, or heard a campaign
news story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our polling suggests that at the end of this first salvo of
debates, the candidates' images have changed as a consequence,''
said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for People
and the Press. ``Gore's stronger standing in a number of polls
reflects that.''
</P>
<P>
   While there were memorable flashes _ like Gore's dare to Bradley
to eliminate television advertisements and Bush's saying Christ was
his favorite philosopher-thinker _ no candidate committed a
career-breaking blunder or scored with a one-liner that catapulted
him ahead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both have improved,'' Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of
Delaware, who ran for the Democratic nomination in 1988, said of
the two Democrats. ``You would declare a winner based on what style
appeals to you.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a decided difference between the Democratic and
Republican events. The Democrats had far more opportunity to delve
into policy minutia because there were only two candidates. The
Republican forums were often unwieldly because six candidates were
vying to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   In random interviews with voters in New Hampshire, many said
they were pleased there were so many debates, but grumbled that too
many Republicans who were far behind in the polls _ namely Sen.
Orrin Hatch of Utah, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes _ got equal billing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were just too many people,'' said Perry Shaw, 48, who
runs a supermarket in Dover, N.H. ``They weren't able to get their
points across. It's non-productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the debates were so distinct in format and substance that
they offered viewers an opportunity to observe how the contenders
could handle wildly different situations. The most watched debate _
about 4.5 million viewers, according to Nielsen _ was the
Democratic encounter on ``Meet the Press'' on Dec. 19; only 450,000
tuned in to a Democratic debate here on Jan. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``The formats have been a let a thousand flowers bloom kind of
thing,'' said Tom Hannon, the political director for CNN, which
broadcast several of the debates. ``If you were following these
like soap operas, you'd have a good sense at the end of these of
the personality of Bradley and Gore and Bush and McCain in a way
you can't get from the minute-and-a-half spots on the evening
news.''

 &HT;    Emanuel to Falcons fans: 'How do you like me now?'
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Tampa Bay reciever Bert Emanuel is not a
trash-talker or filled with vengeance. But he has a message for
Atlanta Falcons fans who criticized his reasons for leaving the
team as a free agent two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``How you like me now?'' Emanuel asked quietly with a grin on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken Emanuel looked as is had a made a big mistake by
departing the Falcons. One of the main reasons he decided to sign
with the Buccaneers was to play for a team that had a chance to
reach the Super Bowl. Tampa Bay had advanced to the NFC
quarterfinals the year before.
</P>
<P>
   However, during Emanuel's inaugural season with Tampa Bay, it
was the Falcons _ not the Bucs _ who were playing in Super Bowl
XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, it was like, `In your face,' '' Emanuel said.
``People said `You left too early _ now we (the Falcons) are in the
Super Bowl, and you are at home watching us.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is kind of reverse fortune now,'' he said. ``We're one
win away (from the Super Bowl), and they are at home. It is pretty
much a dream come true. It's a time to enjoy and savor, because you
may never have a moment like this again in your career.''
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel is determined to enjoy the moment because he has had
on-field problems his two years in Tampa Bay. He caught a
career-low 41 passes in the 1998 season and missed five games
because of various injuries. He watched the Falcons play in the NFL
championship game one day after being released from the hospital
with rib and kidney injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to see some friends and (former Falcon) teammates
that had been through the tough times make it to the Super Bowl,''
Emanuel said. ``It was good to see guys like Jessie Tuggle rewarded
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel said that, while watching the Super Bowl from the sofa
of his Alpharetta home, he felt no regrets about leaving the
Falcons. On Tuesday, though, Emanuel admitted that he had been a
``little bit envious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is only natural when you leave a team, and then
they go the Super Bowl and you are at home watching them,'' Emanuel
said. ``But it was never to the point where I felt like I had made
a bad decision _ never that.''
</P>
<P>
   This season has been another series of struggles for Emanuel. He
has been hindered by a right hamstring strain and sat out five
games and played only sparingly in five others. He has looked
nothing like the explosive talent that led the Falcons in receiving
in the 1996-97 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you told me two years ago some of the things I would've
gone through down here, I probably wouldn't have agreed to go
through with it,'' Emanuel said. ``I've been through a lot of
adversity, but I wouldn't change a thing. It has made me a better
player and a better person. I've grown a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that this week Emanuel is healthier than he has
been since joining Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that he's here,'' Bucs offensive coordinator Mike
Shula said. ``Statistically, he hasn't seemed as productive as he
would've wanted to be. But he means a lot to this team. He has made
some big plays and is a great influence on our younger recievers.
He's playing his best ball right now.''

THE NEW NOIR: IN THE DAYLIGHT, BUT STILL DEADLY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23)

Reel,'' published this month.

<P>
   Film noir carries the 1940s and 1950s within its tales of
treachery and murder, in its cavernous city streets photographed in
shadowy black-and-white. The men wear trenchcoats and sardonic
grimaces.
</P>
<P>
   The women sport platinum-blonde hairdos and harbor malicious
schemes. And there is enough cigarette smoke to make anti-tobacco
lobbyists apoplectic. Yet despite its post-World War II stamp, noir
has managed to stay alive, and not merely as film-buff fare.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Humphrey Bogart, Richard Widmark and Barbara Stanwyck
have been replaced on screen by the likes of Harvey Keitel, Dennis
Hopper and Linda Fiorentino. In films like ``Reservoir Dogs'' and
``The Last Seduction,'' these actors follow their predecessors into
the depths of a dark, dangerous world.
</P>
<P>
   Only now their lonely travels take them to bright, contemporary
settings rather than fleabag hotels and last-stop saloons. Film
noir has gone from retro to neo, and on Feb. 18, Film Forum begins
a seven-week festival to commemorate this resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Neo-Noir'' series includes acclaimed recent movies _
``Fargo,'' ``Pulp Fiction,'' ``One False Move'' _ as well as
lesser-known features like ``Red Rock West'' and, for fans of the
outre, a forgotten Sal Mineo film called ``Who Killed Teddy Bear?''
Among the directors whose dark visions will be offered are Joel
Coen, Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh, Roman Polanski and Abel
Ferrara.
</P>
<P>
   Excursions into the noir world have always included vivid sex
and violence. But where seduction was once a fully clothed affair,
and death took place among the shadows, today's noir stylists leave
less to the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Goldstein, Film Forum's director of repertory programming,
admitted with some tongue-in-cheek relish that he had used the
sleaze factor as a criterion in selecting films for the series.
``Seduction, betrayal and greed _ those had to be major themes,''
he said. ``And a good dose of sex and sadistic violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein and his programming partner, Michael Sayers,
discovered another element that distinguishes neo-noir filmmakers
from those whose work they seek to emulate. ``When they were making
what we now call classic noir, they didn't know they were making
film noir,'' Goldstein said. ``They were making thrillers or crime
movies. Now it's a recognized genre, so filmmakers are
self-consciously making noir.''
</P>
<P>
   The classic noir period ended in 1958, according to Foster
Hirsch, author of ``Detours and Lost Highways: A Map of Neo-Noir,''
the inspiration for the Film Forum series. It was in 1958 that
Orson Welles made ``Touch of Evil,'' which gathered many of the
noir trademarks _ paranoia; double-dealing; bleak, baroque
camerawork _ and ratcheted them up to delirious extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch regards the movie as the final statement of the genre's
conventions and a convenient demarcation, although he pointed out
that ``things don't happen that neatly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The impulse behind noir didn't suddenly stop after `Touch of
Evil,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What emerged in the 1960s and 1970s was a new way to express
that impulse. The first change was the addition of color. ``The
classic phase was totally identified with black-and-white,'' Hirsch
said. ``In fact, people would ask: `How can you have film noir in
color'? My contention is that you can.'' Noir, Hirsch asserts, can
also be realized on a wide screen, even though the original
classics achieved their claustrophobic mood by squeezing images
into the nearly square dimensions of older screens.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first movies to demonstrate the new approach was John
Boorman's ``Point Blank'' (1967), a brooding crime story starring
Lee Marvin that was filmed not only in color and on a wide screen
but, to a great extent, in broad daylight. More recently, the most
significant milestone was Lawrence Kasdan's ``Body Heat,'' made in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   The film combined a modern sensibility with a vintage-style
story about a scheming femme fatale, and it brought the term
neo-noir into the critical lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   While wide-screen color and a new explicitness have updated the
genre, audiences remain intrigued for essentially the same reasons
they always were, according to Hirsch. ``There is an appeal of
story about characters who are thrown into a kind of nightmare
scenario. I don't know that that ever goes out of style.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Hill, whose 1978 thriller ``The Driver'' is included in
the Film Forum program, agrees that there is a timeless attraction
to characters dogged by cruel circumstance and fate. ``As much as
these movies are hard-bitten and without illusions, there's also a
romanticism about that stance,'' he said. ``Doomed romanticism, I
guess, is something we think of as Byronic, but it's obviously a
lot older than that, as old as the Greek tragedies, really.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For audiences of the '80s and '90s, the doomed protagonist may
have had a special significance. Typically, this character is white
and male. Often, in films like ``Fatal Attraction'' and ``A Simple
Plan,'' he is middle-class. Almost always he damns himself by
giving in to temptation _ either a proposition from an alluring
woman or a scheme to make easy money (often engineered by an
alluring woman).
</P>
<P>
   Some who have studied the genre see a parallel here between the
classic and neo periods. The writer-director Paul Schrader, who has
two films in the ``Neo-Noir'' series (``Taxi Driver'' and ``Light
Sleeper'') and who published an extensive critique of film noir in
1972, pointed out that American men in the late 1940s were uneasy
about the independence women had acquired during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something scary sociologically going on with that
empowerment that had occurred during the war,'' Schrader said. ``So
this black widow character, this femme fatale, was partly a way to
address this new balance in the sexes. And, of course, that
empowerment for women has kept pace, and every generation needs to
reformulate these kinds of metaphorical fantasies involving male
fears.''
</P>
<P>
   Men who like their sociology hot and pulpy may be the primary
audience for noir, both classic and neo, but women don't
necessarily take umbrage at the genre's larcenous vixens. John Dahl
said that while making ``The Last Seduction,'' he expected the
villain portrayed by Linda Fiorentino to repel female viewers. But
audience reaction surprised him. ``I talked to some men who were
just offended by her, and I talked to a lot of women who said: `Oh,
I love that woman. She was as bad as she wanted to be and nobody
could stop her.'''
</P>
<P>
   However much neo-noir crosses gender lines, the genre's greatest
admirers may well be the people who make the films. To a certain
extent, neo-noir appears to be filmmaker-driven. While an
occasional title _ ``Fargo'' or ``Pulp Fiction'' _ qualifies as a
mass-market hit, most neo-noir films attract a smaller audience.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these movies continue to be made. One obvious attraction
for filmmakers is the economics: noir-style films require few sets,
small casts and no digital effects. A young director with meager
resources could not find a leaner entree into the movie business.
</P>
<P>
   And the stories themselves, Hill believes, hold a special
allure. ``The very large audiences tend not to respond terribly to
this, but noir is a form that is almost the antithesis of
traditional Hollywood filmmaking, in that it accepts the
inevitability of fate,'' he said. ``There is probably no idea less
harmonious with the usual Hollywood storytelling ideal. And never
to be overlooked is the perversity factor in people who make
movies. They like to push against what everyone else is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   They also like to show off, and noir gives them the chance.
``One of the things that's most intriguing about noir is the
absolute command you must have over the medium,'' Hill said. ``You
must control almost every comma, and everything is kind of invented
and artificial. In a sense, a stylistic exercise for the
filmmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the exercise can go a bit too far. Aficionados of the
genre point to movies that slavishly copy the classic style and
dismiss them as ``faux noir.'' Dahl uses the term to describe
movies in which the directors explore every conceivable form of
stark, dramatic lighting, but fail to generate suspense or
involvement with the characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filmmakers fall in love with the style of noir, the
Venetian-blind lighting, the smoke,'' Dahl said, adding, ``It
doesn't really get under your skin.''

   A college by any other name would surely attract less attention.
</P>
<P>
   Yale University in New Haven has persuaded Yale College in
Wrexham, Wales, to change its name, apparently concerned that the
27-year-old British ``further education facility,'' which offers
nondegree programs, might be mistaken for the Ivy League
institution founded in 1701.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's confusion about whether they are us or not,'' said
Linda Lorimer, the secretary of Yale University, according to
Tuesday's Yale Daily News. ``Who's to know whether they're
connected with us?''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Welsh college are nonplused. ``We are a mere
drop in the education ocean compared to Yale,'' Emelyn Jones, the
principal, told the newspaper, adding that the idea of a mix-up was
``preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Welsh college's Web site, www.yale.ac.uk, says the school
was named for Elihu Yale, the American university's benefactor, who
is buried in Wrexham. But Jones said his institution was named
after the hills that surround it, which have been known for
hundreds of years as lal (pronounced ``y'ALL,'' according to The
Yale Daily News).
</P>
<P>
   ``Yale'' is a trademark registered to the Connecticut
university, and administrators there had apparently threatened
legal action. Because of the pressure from its more famous
namesake, the Welsh school will hereafter be known as Coleg lal
Yale College, Wrexham. Signs and brochures will be replaced as the
new name takes hold.
</P>
<P>
   The people who make those locks better watch out.

 &HT;    Hawks' Wilkens optimistic despite rough start
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ More than a quarter-century into a Hall of Fame
coaching career Lenny Wilkens said Tuesday that he remains eager
for the battle.
</P>
<P>
   After preparing his team for tonight's game with the
Philadelphia 76ers, the Hawks coach indicated he will not back away
from his mission to turn a revamped underachieving Hawks team into
a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe we can get it done,'' he said. ``Two or three
wins against good teams and I think it will turn itself around.
Confidence is contagious. Once they believe in themselves and what
we're doing, it will change.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks are 13-23, 13th in the 15th-team Eastern Conference.
They've lost 14 of 18 and on their present course would become a
lottery team. That's not what management had in mind last summer
when it dealt away starting guards Steve Smith and Mookie Blaylock
and future draft picks for four veterans and a high pick last June.
In fact, if they remain in lottery territory any pick nine to 13
would fall to the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The coach says that won't happen. ``I'm going to see that it
doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   At 62, Wilkens has reached an age when many successful men with
financial means take a step back. He has a new home nearing
completion in Seattle where his grandchildren live. He enjoys ocean
cruises with his wife, Marilyn. But in his 27th season as an NBA
head coach and with 2 1/2 years remaining on his final Hawks
contract at $5.27 million a season, Wilkens indicates it is not
time to go.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that he occasionally wearies of the fight. ``Look,
like anyone else, I have my moments. I'll admit that. It can be
discouraging. But I'm an optimistic person. I'm very positive. I've
always been that way and I intend to fight through this.''
</P>
<P>
   But what can Hawks fans expect if the 13-man roster does not
turn things around in what stands to be the franchise's worst
season since a 34-48 record in 1984-85?
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be changes,'' Wilkens said. Pointing to the
wood-paneled dressing room, he noted, ``There will be changes and
it will be in there. I am convinced we have the talent. The
question, then, is whether the chemistry is right. If we don't have
the right chemistry, then we have to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to define chemistry, he said it is the ability of his
players to function and win together. ``It's not there right now. I
see that we can compete and I think the guys have shown they can
play hard together, but not that they can win. I think that's
coming. I'm encouraged, actually, by some of the things we did (in
a three-point loss to Philadelphia last Saturday and a six-point
defeat against Milwaukee Monday).
</P>
<P>
   ``We got great play from our bench Monday, the dynamic
performance from Jason (Terry), LaPhonso (Ellis) and Lorenzen
(Wright) that I had expected. I want that to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said he is not getting the leadership he expects
from veterans Dikembe Mutombo and Alan Henderson, whose fits of
pique have punctuated virtually every loss in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I won't tolerate confrontations with the
referees,'' Wilkens said, noting Henderson's three episodes in
Monday's game. ``That's not going to continue. These are two
bright, competitive guys. They know better. I expect them to show
the way to the other guys on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, he indicated he will deal harshly
with players who are demonstrably unhappy with their roles on the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming individuals, he said, ``I'm not going to allow
them to hang their heads. No. When a teammate is getting shots and
you're not, you don't hang your head. When he misses a shot, you
support him. When you miss a shot, you keep your head in the game.
I'm not going to have players with their heads down because they're
not happy with minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems he deals with, he said, is the diverse
backgrounds on this team. ``Many of them have not been in a winning
program. I've given them time to make adjustments. Now, it's time
to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   A week after recovering from a severe bout of flu, Wilkens looks
healthier and sounds like a man who is eager for the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the talent we have,'' he said. ``I like our young
players. Kids like Jason have a chance to be really good, so
they're going to get their time on the floor. That's cost us a few
games, but we won't back away. In time, that's going to help us
turn this thing around.''

MICROSOFT REPORTS 23 PERCENT GAIN IN EARNINGS, BUT STOCK FALLS

<P>
   Microsoft Corp. on Tuesday reported second quarter earnings that
exceeded Wall Street analysts' expectations, but was punished by
after-hours traders for having missed more optimistic ``whisper
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   While sounding its usual cautionary notes about corporate PC
demand and slowing revenue growth, Microsoft reported solid results
amid a sea of recent distractions, including last week's news of
the merger of Time Warner and America Online, the passing of the
chief executive title from Bill Gates to Steven Ballmer and
Tuesday's filing challenging the findings of a federal judge that
the company is an abusive monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft reported its results after the close of the market. In
Nasdaq trading, its shares closed at $115.3125, up $3.0625. But in
afterhours trading, shares fell to $112.75.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Microsoft reported earnings of
$2.44 billion, or 44 cents per diluted share, up 23 percent
compared with $1.98 billion, or 36 cents a share, in the comparable
period a year ago. Revenues rose 18 percent to $6.11 billion from
the $5.20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Second quarter 2000 earnings include a one-time charge of
approximately 3 cents per share related to last week's settlement
of an antitrust lawsuit brought by Caldera Inc. Excluding this
charge, diluted earnings per share grew 31 percent to 47 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus expectation among analysts had been 43 cents,
according to First Call. Whisper numbers on the street Tuesday
ranged from 47 cents to 49 cents.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a 2 cents a share reduction in earnings related
to new accounting practices for employee stock options; this change
will continue to affect Microsoft earnings.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rick Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, said the quarter
included about 4 cents a share in unanticipated investment income,
essentially accounting for all of the earnings above the consensus
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The revenues are in line with our expectations, and excluding
the investment gain, so were earnings. It's a respectable
quarter,'' he said. ``Investors are likely to look forward to the
launch of Windows 2000 to create more momentum going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000, the business-class operating system that is a
successor to Windows NT, is scheduled to ship on Feb. 17. Windows
2000 is a critical product for Microsoft because, as the company's
operating system for powerful network server computers, its success
will determine the company's ability to compete in the crucial
Internet market on an equal footing with Sun Microsystems Inc., IBM
and various vendors of the Unix operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Sun and IBM have flourished on the Internet, in part because of
reports that Windows NT was not robust enough or secure enough for
the kinds of demands the Web places on servers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the ship date, the third quarter will reflect only
partial revenues from Windows 2000, John Connors, Microsoft's new
chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take time for the revenue stream to build with
Windows 2000 because it's a business product rather than a consumer
product,'' he said. Business products have longer sales cycles and
slower adoption rates because corporate users take longer to
evaluate software and modify internal programs.
</P>
<P>
   Connors said investment income had been unusually high due to
the sale of certain assets as well as merger activity that
triggered gains from other holdings. ``I don't expect the same
level of non-operating income every quarter, but you guys should
expect some quarters with a fairly high number,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With Microsoft, analysts pay particular attention to deferred
revenue, which increased about $130 million from the September
quarter to $4.26 billion. This was in contrast with the September
quarter, which showed a decline from the June quarter. The reason
that analysts focus on this item is that they regard it as a
financial cushion: the time when Microsoft recognizes revenue on
its software licenses to corporations can sharply affect the
quarterly earnings. Recognizing more revenue in a particular
quarter can give a one-time lift to that quarter's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has three major segments: productivity applications
and software developer tools; Windows operating systems; and
consumer and other. Revenue from applications and developer tools
increased 28 percent to $2.8 billion in the December quarter. At
$2.44 billion, Windows revenue was up just 6 percent, and Microsoft
said the slower growth reflected reduced corporate PC purchases due
to preparing computer systems for the rollover to the year 2000,
and deferred operating system sales in anticipation of Windows
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer and other includes learning and entertainment software,
PC input devices like mice and keyboards, training and
certification fees, consulting and the online services. Revenue for
these businesses in the December quarter was $872 million, up 23
percent.

INSULATING TILES MAY BE STICKING POINT TO NEXT SHUTTLE MISSION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA provisionally set Jan. 31 for the launching of its first
space shuttle flight of 2000, a bid to map the Earth's surface with
space-borne radar.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to launch the shuttle Endeavour at month's end will depend
on a reassessment of the adhesive used to bond dozens of
irregularly shaped insulating tiles to the spacecraft, said NASA
spokesman Bruce Buckingham.
</P>
<P>
   The issue arose when the shuttle Discovery returned to Earth
from its Hubble Space Telescope repair mission Dec. 27 with a tile
missing from its right wing flap.
</P>
<P>
   A post-flight analysis revealed the Discovery tile was applied
with an improper amount of adhesive, Buckingham said.
</P>
<P>
   During their formal review of mission preparations for Endeavour
at Kennedy Space Center on Tuesday, shuttle managers agreed to a
Jan. 31 liftoff if engineers can complete a reappraisal of the
bonds on similar tiles aboard Endeavour.
</P>
<P>
   Largely a review of paperwork supplied by the workers as
documentation when the tiles were originally applied, the appraisal
should take at least several more days, Buckingham said.
</P>
<P>
   The tiles and larger insulative blankets on the exterior of the
space shuttle protect it from the 3,000-degree temperatures
generated by friction during the shuttle's re-entry of the Earth's
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Once in orbit, Endeavour's astronauts plan to work
round-the-clock in teams for 11 days scanning the Earth's surface
with a large radar secured within the shuttle's payload bay.
</P>
<P>
   Two antennas, one extended over the side of the shuttle's cargo
bay on the tip of a 195-foot boom and a second within the ship will
collect and record the radar signal returns.
</P>
<P>
   After the flight, scientists on the ground plan to use computers
to convert the signals into three-dimensional maps.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the effort should produce a map of unrivaled
accuracy of all the Earth's terrain between the arctic and
Antarctic circles.
</P>
<P>
   Originally scheduled for last September, Endeavour's was one of
three shuttle missions delayed last year.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency suspended shuttle flights after Columbia
experienced an electrical short seconds after liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   When the short was traced to chafed insulation on wiring in
Columbia's fuselage, shuttle managers ordered inspections and
repairs of the electrical conduit in all of the ships.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As found on the Billboard charts and radio stations like New
York's Hot 97, today's R-and-B mostly denotes a tight formula:
single-string acoustic guitar licks over synthetic blipping beats
like an Atari Pong game, the airbrushed vocals of a lead singer
indignant over a sexual promise that's been withheld and a bland
group of backup singers taking the chorus in unison while the
leader sings sub-Stevie Wonder melisma.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the musical blueprints, as developed by producers like
Timbaland and Babyface, are fascinating _ but only until they are
copied to death. With such homogeneity, it's becoming very hard to
tell one performer from another in mainstream black music.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, D'Angelo's new single ``Untitled'' has just
been added to commercial playlists across the country, and it
sounds nothing like the above description. Slow and insinuating,
its vocals violate a cardinal rule of commercial music by being
mixed deep into the track.
</P>
<P>
   It's based on a live studio jam; it begins with a false start,
and it ends with an abrupt cut-off during a crescendo. In the
middle of formulaic, machinelike music that sounds as if it was
made by committee, you're suddenly presented with a mysterious
song, with handcrafted defects all over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Untitled'' is a signal that can't be missed; something this
radical can't just drop out of the sky alone. There's a widening
groundswell of R-and-B artists _ and even some who fit more
naturally in the category of hip-hop _ who are sounding like an
antidote to the sameness problem: their records are more
well-rounded, more musicianly, more complete. They make a mature
music, and a family music, for living rooms, rather than for the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   In their subject matter there is room for self-doubt, anger,
beatitude, whimsy and religion _ not just slick come-ons or
aggressive bluster. It's increasingly album-oriented as opposed to
singles-oriented. Importantly, it marks a gradual return in black
pop to the use of instruments instead of electronics. And it isn't
even always sung in English.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that some of these performers are infusing their
new music with 30-year-old grooves; they are expanding the entire
personality of R-and-B. Some, like D'Angelo and Maxwell, are rising
to the the challenge of becoming complete singer-songwriters; some
are beginning to look beyond the standard sound of American
R-and-B, adding jazz elements or reaching out to black music of
other cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop is changing, too, with so-called alternative performers
like Mos Def, Q-Tip and the Roots suddenly making the best current
albums of the genre. Perhaps you could call it all-natural R-and-B,
referring to the patience and wisdom in this new music as well as
to the general absence of glossy pop hysteria and to the Afro hair
style affected by some of the performers.
</P>
<P>
   If the fluky breakout successes for this kind of music have
arrived in a trickle _ Arrested Development in the early '90s,
Maxwell in 1996, Erykah Badu in 1997 (Lauryn Hill's success in 1998
wasn't exactly unexpected) _ now seems like the moment for the
floodgates to open. Tastes have changed in its direction.
</P>
<P>
   Macy Gray's recent debut, ``On How Life Is,'' a lushly produced
album rich with 1970s Chaka Khan references _ but also containing
strong hints of more underground sources from the era, like the
singer Betty Davis _ has just been nominated for two Grammy awards;
it's a record for knowledgeable music fans as well as casual radio
listeners. Angie Stone's promising debut record, ``Black Diamond,''
has slowly gained sales and radio play since its release four
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   And D'Angelo's long-awaited new album, ``Voodoo''
(Cheebasound/Virgin V2-48499), to be released on Tuesday, could be
the succes d'estime that proves the force of this new music: it is
a largely unslick, stubbornly idiosyncratic and genuinely great
album that has already produced two hit singles.
</P>
<P>
   Official names haven't stuck to any of these artists who
somewhat defy the radio formulas. Neo-soul is too reductive; rare
groove, as it's often called in England, is too record
collector-ish. ``I've been called alternative, retro, all kinds of
things like that,'' said the singer, guitarist and producer Raphael
Saadiq, formerly of the band Toni Toni Tone and now of a new band,
Lucy Pearl, whose first album comes out in May.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, Saadiq has combined old R-and-B with current
production sounds and whiffs of hip-hop, and two years ago Toni
Toni Tone finally broke up, a victim of radio's narrowness. ``Maybe
they need to have a new category, `R-R-and-B,''' he said, ``real
rhythm `n' blues, for music that has a lot of feeling going into
it, almost like underground R-and-B.''
</P>
<P>
   Saadiq's dream for a new radio format is all music by bands, as
opposed to music with electronic rhythm sections. ``Call it `hot
real music' or something,'' he suggested. ``I think a lot more
people would start playing instruments as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever there are twists on the current formulas of black
music, there are only euphemisms to describe it. First, there's
that umbrella term ``urban'': no record company or chartmaker wants
to own up to segregating music by race, so a sociological category
serves instead. One also hears the term ``progressive,'' which
means music that can be liked beyond teendom: nobody wants to lose
a share of the enormous, heavy-spending youth market for black
music by using that taboo word, adult. And, finally, there is the
term that has lost all its flavor yet continues to be used in the
business: alternative.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Alternative, in this context, denotes music that appeals to
black and nonblack, male and female, brand-new and retro tastes.
Here you see the first confusion: what's so alternative about a
potential audience that wide? But buried deeper in that confusion
is some cultural alchemy, a point at which music made by black
artists ceases to be ``black music'' and their songs are not
suitable for black radio; performers like Lenny Kravitz, Me'Shell
Ndegeocello and Dionne Farris have fallen into this trap.
</P>
<P>
   One ought to avoid calling this music ``alternative'' outside
the argumentative purposes of this article. Black artists tend to
distance themselves from the word and its connotations of white
performers, rock's musical ingredients and the aesthetic of
self-marginalizing. But the word still links to a pressing issue.
</P>
<P>
   It remains difficult to get this new between-the-cracks music on
the radio and in the hands of mainstream American record buyers.
Since the Telecommunications Act of 1996, corporate consolidation
within the radio industry has severely reduced adventurous
programming. The number of current records on an average commercial
black station's playlist, said Tom Bracamontes, senior vice
president of promotion at Virgin records, has dropped by nearly a
third. ``Not only is music on the fringes of R-and-B going to lose
out,'' said Bracamontes, ``but even regular mainstream R-and-B is
going to lose out.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are ways of defeating the rules of the system,
through the long-term effort of record labels and performers
themselves. Virgin took a year to market the French band Les
Nubians to black stations across the country with an adult
audience, and the life of the band's single, ``Mekeda,'' has been
extended: it's now being pitched to hip-hop mix shows.
</P>
<P>
   The Roots continue to perform incessantly, even setting up shop
every week in various clubs to present shows that act as workshops.
The last few years have also seen a growing number of R-and-B
artists turn away from the system and form their own labels to
release their new material _ a roll call that includes not only the
Artist Formerly Known as Prince, but also Saadiq, Dionne Farris and
the new singer N'Dambi.
</P>
<P>
   The shabby state of live performance is also forcing change.
Last year one could witness the spectacle of the singer Ginuwine,
who had a top-10 R-and-B radio hit at the time, performing to a
half-empty audience at the Manhattan club Tramps. Behind him, an ad
hoc band copied his recordings exactly; there was a drummer, but a
rhythm machine anchored the grooves.
</P>
<P>
   One got the sense that Ginuwine could be an exciting performer
if only live performance made more business sense to him, and the
club would be full if the audience for black music had a little
more faith that live shows in general were worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the drummer for the Roots, Ahmir Thompson (aka
Questlove), has started to pop up on all sorts of records, from
Erykah Badu's ``Baduizm'' to the Congolese-French group Zap Mama's
``Amazone''; his participation seems to ensure that a record will
sound both new and different, and there are sure to be others like
him in his wake. Truth be told, he's often too metronomic, holding
one pattern steady through almost an entire song. But the
difference in hearing music with a human drummer again is
immeasurable _ it's warmer, more vulnerable, more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   It's Thompson's drumming that threads together the songs on
D'Angelo's ``Voodoo.'' A full five years (an eternity in the career
of a black pop artist) after his first album, ``Brown Sugar,''
D'Angelo (Michael D'Angelo Archer) took two years of daily
recording sessions to construct his new album, yet anyone who has
heard the stories of his studio indulgences may be surprised by the
album's streamlined economy.
</P>
<P>
   He spent that time establishing a telepathic live feel between
the members of his band, which included, aside from Thompson, the
jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove, the jazz guitarist Charlie Hunter and
Saadiq. At their best, the record's songs begin without fanfare, as
if they're drifting into hearing range from the floor below. The
main evidence of studio indulgence is the heavy multitracking of
D'Angelo's voice: you hear seven or eight D'Angelos, in falsetto,
muttering, chanting, out of sync; they soar freely atop the music
like doves in an aviary.
</P>
<P>
   The album's first single, ``Left and Right,'' hedged bets: it
was the only track that used hip-hop, and it brought in the rap
stars Method Man and Redman. Though the song is a shrewd effort to
have it both ways, retaining the slinky, subtle feel of D'Angelo's
music while incorporating hip-hop in its second half, it's also the
album's weakest track. The rest of ``Voodoo'' is not, per se, an
attempt to bring back the music of the '70s; it's an attempt to
recall a time when long tracks and unique group sounds were
radioworthy popular culture, and pop radio wasn't so segmented by
race.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, D'Angelo has described it as evoking the ``second
phase'' of musicians like Marvin Gaye, Sly Stone and Curtis
Mayfield _ the point where they had already had success with
mainstream pop and were ready to experiment a bit. It says much
about today's competitive record and radio business that D'Angelo
was ready to make that shift on his second record.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since the '60s, paradigm-shift moments in black popular culture
have frequently been announced. Some of this new ferment seems
reminiscent of the late 1980s, when the writer Trey Ellis, in an
influential article in the literary journal Callaloo, proclaimed a
culturally mulatto ``New Black Aesthetic.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to bands like Living Color and Fishbone, filmmakers
like Spike Lee and the Hudlin brothers, playwrights like George C.
Wolfe _ all of whom expressed a ``casually nonchalant'' attitude
about race; these were artists liberated by the feeling that they
did not have to perform according to what was expected from them as
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   But while the dominant strain of Ellis's essay is of black
artists joyfully crashing the temples of white culture _ Living
Color's freedom to play rock `n' roll, Tracy Chapman's to play
coffeehouse folk and so on _ the emphasis of the current crop of
``R-R-and-B'' musicians is to rediscover what was so good about the
black music of their youth, and how it was incorporated into the
wider scope of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   But one victory begets another, and it seems likely that more
barriers will be broken down; possibly the next step for these
artists will be to find meaningful ways to connect American black
pop with the rest of their cultural heritage, as well as with black
music of other cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz musicians have already hooked up with Maxwell and D'Angelo;
Lauryn Hill has apparently expressed interest in working with the
protean Brazilian musician and cultural hero Carlinhos Brown; she
and D'Angelo both worked in the studio last year with the Nigerian
bandleader Femi Kuti. Instead of dwelling on the limitations and
frustrations of the idea of alternative black pop, it might be
better to focus on its positive side: its incredible capaciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a listener-supported radio station or Internet station
of the near future that played not only Macy Gray and D'Angelo, but
also their sources _ Curtis Mayfield, Jimi Hendrix, Marvin Gaye,
Rufus. And also Al Green and Shirley Caesar (gospel music, and in
fact all religious devotion, is ``alternative'' these days); Billie
Holiday, John Coltrane and Betty Carter (jazz _ misunderstood and
underappreciated, yet one of America's dearest notions _ remains
our ultimate alternative music); the sweet Afro-Peruvian grooves of
Susana Baca, the Brazilian funk of Jorge Ben; Cassandra Wilson's
sophisticated projects of folk Americana.
</P>
<P>
   Black pop has been a producer's game for the last two decades;
now it's musicians who are starting to shape a wider aesthetic.

ON DAY 1, JETS' OWNER ZEROS IN ON PARCELLS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Minutes after being approved by the NFL as the Jets'
new owner, Robert Wood Johnson IV promised to make a decision on
Bill Parcells' status by the weekend, find a new home for the team
by 2008 and said that he would have a hands-on approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a critical time of the year, but to go over the whole
landscape of coaching is going to take more than 24 hours,''
Johnson said at a news conference at the Waldorf-Astoria. ``I think
we owe it to the fans to explore all options. It's hard to find
good coaches. There's only a handful of them. You've got to make
sure you make a careful decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson _ ``you can call me Woody'' _ said that if Parcells
declined to return as coach, he wanted him to still have a major
role with the team. He has met or spoken with Parcells every day
since last Wednesday, including a three-hour talk last Friday. He
planned to meet with him again Wednesday or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not the easiest person to read,'' Johnson said. ``In
fact, he is very difficult to read. But he is a quick study, very
direct, very honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Johnson optimistic he can convince Parcells to return?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have him coach,'' Johnson said. ``We will know _ I
guarantee we will know _ by the end of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was vague about who else might coach the team. Parcells
is thought to believe that Al Groh, the linebackers coach, should
succeed him. Groh and most of the coaches are in Mobile, Ala.,
during Senior Bowl week. They will return Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill has a very, very high opinion of Al Groh,'' Johnson said.
While Johnson has read various reports that Groh was a likely
candidate, he said that Parcells had not brought that up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can see their relationship is one of trust,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with any good leader selection, you have to look at
all opportunities. So we will be very careful in trying to assess
what is best for the team and the fans. We will look inside and
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson admitted that if he goes outside the organization, there
would be less continuity.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson suggested he would be a sleeves-rolled-up owner, for
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two things that I have to do in a short period of
time,'' he said. ``One is to get the operational elements in shape,
and I have talked to Steve Gutman, who has been at the Jets for
over 20 years and he has agreed to stay on. He is a terrific guy.
He knows more about the NFL than almost anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was less talkative about the Bill Belichick situation.
He said because it was a ``semilegal'' situation he was leaving it
in the hands of Commissioner Paul Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was clear about the Jets' move from the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years from now,'' he said, ``they will be playing
somewhere else.'' That is when the team's lease expires.
</P>
<P>
   Before the league's owners voted unanimously to have him join
their club, Johnson told the finance committee of his commitment to
moving the Jets into their own stadium.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tagliabue, Johnson spoke of ``getting that last
ounce of adrenaline out of the players onto the field sometimes
falls to the fans as the 12th man, and he feels very strongly that
if they had their own stadium, that would be something that would
energize the Jets' fans even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, asked at a news conference about renewing the lease,
Johnson minced no words: ``I don't think that is going to be one of
our options of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   He brought up the Jets' long-standing gripe that they play 16
road games because they have always performed in someone else's
stadium. Shea Stadium was built for the Mets and Giants Stadium, of
course, was built for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game they have played for the last 39-plus years have
been away games,'' Johnson said. ``They have never had the
home-field advantage, so to speak. So I think this is going to be a
critical decision we look at down the line after we get some of
these other questions answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wore a gray suit and contrasting Jets-green tie as he
fielded more questions in 20 minutes from the news media than the
late news media-shy owner, Leon Hess, did in 37 years with the
team. Hess died last May, and his estate sold the team for $635
million.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is the Jets' third owner. They were created as the
Titans along with the American Football League in 1960. Harry
Wismer, a well-known sportscaster of the day, was the president. He
ran a ticket office out of his New York apartment and often did not
pay the players. The league actually met several payrolls before
the team landed in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   From there, five men, brought together by their common interests
in horse racing, banded together to buy the team for $1 million in
1963. Hess was one of the original five.

 &HT;    '''Carmina Burana''': A choral classic
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Here's what the legendary conductor
Leopold Stokowski had to say about Carl Orff's ``Carmina Burana''
when he introduced the work to New York and Boston audiences in
1954: ``I believe that Orff's genius _ an extraordinarily personal
blending of pagan and modern feeling _ will be recognized by future
generations as a major departure in the development of the art of
music.''
</P>
<P>
   And here's what Florida Philharmonic Music Director James Judd
has to say on the occasion of the orchestra's performances of the
choral classic this week: ``It's a hugely wonderful, empty work.
It's sheer entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, both conductors are right. ``Carmina Burana,'' which
premiered in 1937 when the German-born Orff was 42, is now
recognized as one of the quintessential musical testaments of the
20th century. Combining the ritualistic modernism of Stravinsky
with an almost minimalist aesthetic, it served as a model for
numerous other composers, including such greats from the late 20th
century as Philip Glass and Henryk Gorecki.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a work of disarming simplicity and ribald pleasures _
and thus one of a handful of classical pieces that have truly
crossed over into the pop mainstream. You can hear ``Carmina
Burana'' almost everywhere these days: in soundtracks to movies
ranging from ``Excalibur'' to ``The Doors'' to ``The General's
Daughter.'' In dance clubs, where it's often mixed with a disco
beat. Even Michael Jackson used it to open his ``Dangerous'' tour.
</P>
<P>
   And if you caught the trailer to the South Park movie, that's
Carl Orff's music that was accompanying the news of Kenny's death.
Of course, ``Carmina Burana'' has become such a fixture in movie
trailers, its usage in this instance was intended to mock its usage
elsewhere. It's like a sure-fire way of saying, ``Attention must be
paid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it goes to the same reason that people like Wagner,''
says Dan Goldwasser, an editor of the Soundtrack.net Web site.
``It's large, powerful music that captures the essence of an
emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the listeners who have heard ``Carmina Burana'' in a
pop context _ and even then, they're probably hearing only the
opening chorus, O Fortuna, its most famous excerpt _ are likely to
know little about the full, hourlong work or its composer. Indeed,
even classical buffs may be caught off guard when they hear details
about Orff's past, including his connections to Hitler's regime and
his ground-breaking educational methodology combining music and
movement.
</P>
<P>
   And if anyone bothered to read an English translation of the
lyrics to ``Carmina Burana,'' which are in Latin and what's called
Middle High German, they might need to brace themselves. They're
not exactly G-rated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the news went out that all these commercial forces are
using this obscene work, it would be rather amusing,'' says Judd.
``An obscene work by a Nazi, no less.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Carmina Burana'' is based on a group of poems from the 13th
century; the title translates as Songs of Beuren, a reference to a
region in Germany where they supposedly originated. Written by
defrocked monks and minstrels, they are hearty tales of love, sex,
drinking and gambling _ the very stuff that defined medieval times.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Orff (1895-1982) was hardly that adventurous. A
devout Roman Catholic and lifelong resident of Munich, he was a man
who, in the words of one of his musical associates, ``loved the
simplicity of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His house was not filled with precious antiques, but farmer's
furniture,'' says John van Kesteren, a world-renowned tenor, now
based in Tequesta, who worked with Orff numerous times.
</P>
<P>
   But Orff had a distinct musical vision. Although clearly a
product of the 20th century, he was not a modernist per se and
refused to follow the atonal path of Berg, Webern and Schoenberg.
Instead, he preferred a sonic world of almost primitive passion:
While he was clearly influenced by Stravinsky in this regard _ it's
no accident the Florida Philharmonic will play ``The Rite of
Spring'' on the same program _ he was also drawn to non-Western
music, especially the rhythmically rich African and Indonesian
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Orff established his career in the 1920s when he created the
Orff-Schulwerk method, an educational discipline that combined
music, dance and gymnastics. Even to this day, it remains a popular
way to introduce children to the arts: ``Orff instruments'' are
frequently found in kindergartens and pre-schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the '30s, Orff sought to expand his concepts, bringing them
to the stage for an adult audience. Despite the fact that it's
typically presented today in a concert setting, Orff always
intended ``Carmina Burana'' to be a work of theater, a ``scenic
cantata'' as he called it, making full use of dance and scenery.
The piece is subtitled, ``Profane songs for singers and vocal
chorus with instruments and magical pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   But because of the strength of the music _ Orff set about 25 of
the 250 poems in the manuscript _ orchestras have been able to
dispense with the visual accompaniment. Responding to the primal
message of the text, Orff created a ferocious animal of a score.
The appeal can be summarized in a word: ``'Carmina' has the
rhythms,'' says van Kesteren of the pulsating piece. And given the
emphasis that pop music has placed on rhythm over melody, the tenor
says it's no surprise that it's found a place in the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the German public always appreciated Orff, particularly
the Nazis, who found the pagan element in his music very
``un-German.'' Van Kesteren believes that Orff wrote the work
partly as a diatribe against the Nazis. ``He saw it as a fight
against the establishment. The Nazis were very clean . . . Orff was
much more interested in having fun,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Orff did make his peace with the German government and
accepted musical commissions from Hitler's henchmen, even if he
tried to distance himself from the Nazis after World War II. Van
Kesteren believes, ``Orff was a free-thinking man . . . He was
neutral as far as he told me,'' but he adds that the composer might
have gone along with the Nazis for the sake of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Is ``Carmina Burana'' a challenge to perform? Not really, says
Judd, who explains that the music has a blunt,
straight-from-the-page quality. ``It's in rather block form,'' he
adds, noting that the rhythms rarely change mid-section. The
biggest difficulty the conductor has is finding a good children's
chorus _ again, Orff's roots were in education, so it's no surprise
he included a place for young singers in ``Carmina.'' And the
conductor notes that the solo vocal parts _ for soprano, tenor and
baritone _ are ``grotesquely high,'' placing some unique casting
demands.
</P>
<P>
   Van Kesteren adds that tenors often make the mistake of trying
to ``finesse'' the work. In contrast, Orff wrote the part that way
precisely because he wanted it to sound crude. ``It should not be
sung beautifully,'' he emphasizes, noting he just accepted an
engagement to sing it in Ottawa next year.
</P>
<P>
   While Carmina established Orff's international reputation, it
was hardly the end of the line for the composer, who lived well
into his 80s. The choral work became the basis of a trilogy,
``Trionfi,'' that included ``Catulli Carmina'' (''Songs of
Catullus,'' 1943) and ``Trionfo di Afrodite'' (''The Triumph of
Aphrodite,'' 1953). There were other choral works and operas as
well, but nothing that enjoyed the reputation of Carmina, which was
also the basis for a 1959 ballet by John Butler and a 1970s film by
Jean-Pierre Ponnelle (Van Kesteren appeared in it). And then there
are the ancillary usages _ in movies, TV, etc.
</P>
<P>
   It's gotten to the point that filmmakers have started asking
composers to create Carmina clones in order to avoid paying
royalties, explains Dan Goldwasser, the soundtrack expert. Thought
you heard Carl Orff's score in the Civil War movie Glory? Actually,
it's a knock-off by Titanic composer James Horner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it sounds like it, but it isn't it. They change four
notes,'' says Goldwasser.

MAESTRO OF THE MOMENT AND STILL GROWING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23)

<P>
   If, as Simon Rattle likes to say, conductors don't really become
competent before their 60s, what might the bidding war be like in
2015?
</P>
<P>
   Sir Simon, who turned 45 on Wednesday, was for a decade or so
considered the heir apparent to succeed Seiji Ozawa as music
director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the event of a
vacancy. In recent years, as the likelihood of that eventuality
kept receding into an indefinite future, both Sir Simon and the
orchestra seemed to cool toward the prospect, and he was avidly
courted by the Philadelphia Orchestra to succeed Wolfgang
Sawallisch in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Then last June, a day after it was announced that Ozawa would
finally leave Boston in 2002 to direct the Vienna State Opera, the
Berlin Philharmonic elected Sir Simon (italics)its(end italics)
music director as of the same year.
</P>
<P>
   And these were only the more prominent bidders for his services:
not bad for a fledgling maestro. Then again, in experience if not
in age, he is anything but a fledgling.
</P>
<P>
   He conducted the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra from 1980
to 1998 with a single-mindedness and dedication that went out of
fashion decades ago, and he is widely credited with having
transformed it from a provincial band into, on any given night, one
of the finest and most adventurous ensembles in England. He is also
a principal guest conductor of the period-instrument Orchestra of
the Age of Enlightenment, a frequent presence at the Glyndebourne
Festival and elsewhere in Britain, a recent favorite of the Vienna
Philharmonic and the Salzburg Festival, and the darling of EMI
Classics.
</P>
<P>
   The big loser in the recent bidding war, at least for the
moment, appears to have been the Philadelphia Orchestra. But
presumably no hard feelings will erupt amid the musical cataclysms
when Sir Simon conducts the expanded orchestra, a large chorus and
vocal soloists in Schoenberg's ``Gurrelieder'' on Monday evening at
Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be an encounter group,'' Sir Simon said, referring not
so much to any potential friction as to the sheer crowd of
performers destined for the Carnegie stage, which will be extended
for the purpose. Sir Simon, for his part, voices regret at the
missed connection in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apart from the point where I decided to leave Birmingham,
(italics)not(end italics) to go to Philadelphia, to decide that
this was not for me, was one of the hardest calls,'' Sir Simon said
in his room at a hotel near Carnegie Hall on a recent visit to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether, when it came to it, they actually would have asked
me, I don't know,'' he quickly added, perhaps remembering the
etiquette of such courtships. Generally, public discussion of
candidates and especially of offers made is conspiratorially
avoided to keep the maestro ultimately chosen from feeling like a
consolation prize.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph H. Kluger, the president of the Philadelphia Orchestra,
gave the party line: ``We've had a lot of exploratory conversations
with a lot of conductors. In the case of Rattle, we have a close
relationship with him, and we are pleased that he is committed to
returning in the spring of 2002 and on a regular basis
thereafter.''
</P>
<P>
   In an odd anticlimax, after that once intimate connection, the
Boston Symphony seems to have played no part in Sir Simon's
thinking. ``I don't think anyone really has a clue what goes on in
Boston,'' he said of the orchestra he conducts from Thursday
through Saturday at Symphony Hall in Boston. ``It's a mystery to me
after all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Volpe, who became managing director of the Boston Symphony
in 1997, said: ``I don't know the whole history, but he's an
important conductor we've had a relationship with. His life is
changing, and our lives are changing with Seiji's departure, but we
hope to continue a relationship subject to his willingness to
conduct here.'' Be that as it may, no Rattle appearances are
scheduled there after this week.
</P>
<P>
   For him, in any case, Sir Simon explains, the choice came down
to America versus Europe. American wooers had anticipated that his
two young sons, Sacha and Eliot, now living in San Francisco with
his first wife, the American soprano Elise Ross, would be part of
the draw. But Sir Simon points out that by the time any American
post would open up, in that eventful year 2002, his older son,
Sacha, will be approaching college age and probably headed
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   As Sir Simon's concentrated activity in Birmingham showed, he
does not deal in half measures or take his responsibilities
lightly. And he is aware of the added social obligations that fall
to a music director in America: at a minimum, the need to cultivate
corporate sponsorship and community support. In fact, he sees the
role as much more, something approaching ``social engineering,''
though he backed off the term.
</P>
<P>
   ``An orchestra in a modern city has to be somehow a moral
center, a center for healing these desperately divided places,'' he
said in a monologue delivered mostly sotto voce and with long
pauses for rumination. ``And with all the wonderful music-making
that there is in this country, it is still way off the periphery of
most people's thought. It's not on any kind of political or social
agenda, and it must be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that to do this, I would have to live in America
and visit Europe for two or three weeks a year. If I wanted to have
a life and a marriage, and some kind of interior life as well, it
was a natural choice between the two continents, and I chose
Europe, rightly or wrongly.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also a ``philosophical point,'' Sir Simon added: ``I
wanted for now to be closer to the source of the music.'' Read
Vienna and Berlin. So Sir Simon, a native of Liverpool, intends to
remain in London with his second wife, Candice Allen, also an
American, as he establishes his musical home in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Not that only sweetness and light await him there. Indeed,
alarmist reports have appeared in the English press about the
parlous state of the orchestra and its financial base.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may make the sweetest noise on earth and symbolize all
that is enviable in German cultural affluence,'' Norman Lebrecht
wrote in a typical lather in The Daily Telegraph in London last
October, ``but behind the gleam of golden instruments the Berlin
Philharmonic are not a happy band.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebrecht went on to cite various causes or effects: the
announced departure next year of the longtime intendant, Elmar
Weingarten; the defection of several top players among the total of
nine vacancies; and reduced earnings due in large part to a decline
in recording projects and record sales, all within a climate of
greater governmental scrutiny and straitened public subsidies for
the arts in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   At the mere mention of alarmist reports, even before the name of
Lebrecht, the author of the ultimate alarmist tract, ``Who Killed
Classical Music?,'' had been raised, Sir Simon said with a touch of
sarcasm: ``You've certainly never read anything by Norman before,
have you? Those Brits who've learned the meaning of the word
`Schadenfreude' enjoy it. There's no doubt that there are problems
to solve. At the moment, it's not a very well-organized ship. It
plays wonderfully, but it's rather chaotic. Yet that's partly what
this job is about.''

 &HT;    Look to stars for stunning sky sights
 &HT;    By Michael Alicea
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If you got a telescope over the
holidays, you've probably spent the past couple of weeks trying to
figure out just where to point it. Here's some help.
</P>
<P>
   And no, we don't mean the moon. Let's go farther out.
</P>
<P>
   No . . . past Jupiter and Saturn . . .
</P>
<P>
   Pluto and Charon?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing to see there anyhow. Farther!
</P>
<P>
   Let's find something unusual to test your new gift. The winter
sky has a few stars to offer:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mu Cephei: This variable star in the constellation Cepheus is
named for the mythical king of Joppa, husband to Cassiopeia and
father to Andromeda.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mu Cephei isn't one of the brightest objects in the
sky, it easily can be called one of the most alluring for its color
and for the fact that it is a variable star, which means that its
apparent brightness changes over time. Some variable stars can
change their brightness over a matter of hours, but in Mu Cephei's
case, it takes some time to see the difference _ which is about
four times brighter at its maximum than at its minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Mu Cephei is a red hypergiant star. It is the largest star we
know of in the night sky. It has a radius 2,536 times that of our
own star, Sol. If Mu Cephei were where Sol is, it would fill the
solar system to the orbit of Saturn! On top of that, it is 38,000
times brighter than Sol. We should be glad it lies 1,550 light
years away.
</P>
<P>
   Sir William Herschel named Mu Cephei the Garnet Star, for
reasons that will become apparent once you look at this deep red
gem.
</P>
<P>
   The constellation Cepheus, where Mu Cephei resides, is in the
northern sky during the winter months, between the constellations
Ursa Minor and Cassiopeia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Capella: Latin for ``little she-goat,'' Capella is also known
as Alpha Aurigae.
</P>
<P>
   Capella is the sixth brightest star in the sky, but it really
isn't one star at all. It's two stars, both yellow giants _ 16
times bigger than our sun. But don't strain your eyes looking for
the twin, it's not visible even through your telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Capella is important to navigators here on Earth, as it is the
closest bright star to the North Star, Polaris in Ursa Minor, and
it can be seen for at least part of the night every month.
</P>
<P>
   Capella lies within the constellation Auriga, which is in the
northeastern sky.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mira: Mira, ``beautiful'' in Latin, is a red giant star within
the constellation Cetus the Whale.
</P>
<P>
   Humans have been watching this star for centuries. It expands
and contracts _ shrinking and cooling over a period that lasts 332
days. Each time it expands, it becomes a stunning deep red star,
and the brightest one in the constellation. At its minimum, Mira
cannot be seen by the unaided eye, so telescopes do come in handy
after all.
</P>
<P>
   Mira is 220 light years away and can be up to 500 times more
luminous than our sun. If Mira were where Sol is, we wouldn't be
here at all. It is 300 times more massive than Sol, so it would
fill in our system to the orbit of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Mira, and Cetus, are in the southwestern sky.
</P>
<P>
   _ Betelgeuse: Betelgeuse, ``shoulder of the giant,'' or ``hand
of al-jauza'' _ depending on whom you ask _ can also be known as
the ``Martial Star.'' By any name, this orange-red supergiant star
lies in the constellation Orion and could possibly be the most
recognized star after Sirius _ if only for its ``Hollywood'' name.
</P>
<P>
   Betelgeuse is the first star to be seen as a disc _ not as a
point of light _ by the Hubble Space Telescope on March 3, 1995.
This would make one think that it is MASSIVE, but it's teeny
compared with Mu Cephei _ only 630 times bigger than Sol. That
would make it as big as the orbit of Jupiter if placed in Sol's
stead, but it is 60,000 times more luminous than Sol. Take that Mu
Cephei!
</P>
<P>
   Betelgeuse, sad to say, is on its way out of stellar existence.
It is thought to be the next star that will go supernova in our
galaxy. When will that happen? Who knows. But, get in your gazes
while it's still intact.
</P>
<P>
   Orion rises in the eastern sky throughout the winter season.
</P>
<P>
   _ While in Orion: The constellation Orion has one more wonder to
offer: The Orion Nebula.
</P>
<P>
   The Orion Nebula is a large body of rarified gas, thinned out
and less dense gas, that is fueling the birth of new stars within
its boundaries. In fact, we can observe most nebulae only because
of the young, hot stars lighting them up from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   The Orion Nebula will appear in a hazy patch of three ``stars''
just below the line of three stars that form Orion's ``belt.'' In
the older illustrated maps of the heavens, this region is
represented as Orion's sword, hanging from the belt. In your
telescope, some haziness will surround the stars, but the general
shape of the nebula will be most apparent. It is a beautiful thing
to see.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't forget: On Thursday, South Florida _ and the entire
country _ will be treated to a total lunar eclipse beginning at
9:08 p.m. The moon will move deeper into the earth's shadow layers,
until it reaches totality at 11:09 p.m. At this time, the moon will
appear reddish-copper by the light of the earthshine reaching the
lunar surface. Look for stars normally washed out by the full
moonlight to appear for a cameo during this time.
</P>
<P>
   The moon will slip back into the inner and outer shadows
beginning at 12:20 a.m. Friday morning, and finally become full
again at 1:23 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy this spectacle. It won't happen again until May of 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Happy hunting.

 UNDATED: is about.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is also about change, in repertory and in the ways the
orchestra does business as it enters the 21st century. ``It's been
made abundantly clear that they feel they cannot simply dig the
same old gold mine, however wonderful,'' Sir Simon said, mixing
metaphors with abandon. ``They need more feathers in their
plumage.'' But not much else, evidently, has been made clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job is like being the pope,'' Sir Simon said, ``except for
the celibacy, I (italics)hope.(end italics) Nobody talks to you. I
have no contract. Nobody mentioned to me what the job description
was, how many concerts, what I'd be paid, if I'd be paid, what my
rights were, what my rights weren't. And it was just absolutely
considered, as it has always been, that you would be so thrilled to
have the job that you wouldn't ask.''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, he says, he does not know what he will be paid, but
neither is he worried. ``We conductors are all paid
(italics)fine,''(end italics) he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a concerted attempt to get a life outside conducting, he
plans to curtail his activities outside Berlin. ``It's really very
simple,'' he said. ``I don't want to work much more than seven
months of the year, just because I don't think you can stay
creative. In my 30s possibly, but now I need more and more time,
and more and more time to do things that aren't music, to read and
to discover.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects the Berlin job to require about five months a year,
including the annual opera performances in Salzburg at Easter. For
the rest, he plans to continue his work with the Vienna
Philharmonic, which he calls a great learning experience. In fact,
he is scheduled to record all the Beethoven symphonies with the
Vienna Philharmonic in 2002 for EMI, a prior commitment that a
record-hungry Berlin Philharmonic must surely eye wistfully, even
though it may counter with yet another Beethoven cycle of its own,
led by its current maestro, Claudio Abbado, on Deutsche Grammophon.
Sir Simon also intends to continue his work with the Orchestra of
the Age of Enlightenment and the Philadelphia Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   His work as an orchestra builder in Birmingham was altogether
admirable, and widely recognized as such. In Berlin matters will
probably be different. Whatever disarray the orchestra may now be
experiencing, it persists in the public mind as a great orchestra
in little need of rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibilities are so enormous,'' Sir Simon himself said.
``Unless I haven't been listening carefully enough, there isn't
another orchestra that has such individual soloistic skill in
depth. If they had any more technique, they'd be an international
menace.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also insists that there is never an end to orchestra
building: ``Just like a house, many things need constant
maintenance, and some of it is as basic as daily oral hygiene.''
</P>
<P>
   However all of that may be, in Berlin Sir Simon's reputation is
likely to ride most heavily on the quality of his interpretations,
and here, his history is spottier. ``Sometimes he smothered the
music with enthusiasm, and sometimes that enthusiasm brought
results so stupendously good that no one would have thought it
possible,'' the English critic Nicholas Kenyon wrote in 1987 in his
book ``Simon Rattle: The Making of a Conductor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon, who is now the director of the BBC Proms in London,
still holds much the same opinion. ``The performances either work
or they don't,'' he said from London the other day. ``Some of them
are incredibly exciting, but there isn't a comfortable level of
reliability.''
</P>
<P>
   This listener recalls only one of the incredibly exciting
variety _ a Mahler Seventh Symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic in
1995 at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam _ and several instances of
suffocation, whether by enthusiasm or calculation. This, at any
rate, appears to be the prime area for whatever learning and growth
Sir Simon has yet to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   With so much attention devoted to exotic repertory early in his
career, he was admittedly slow to come to the bread-and-butter
Germanic repertory. And although his work in Vienna and Berlin has
done much to remedy that gap, Kenyon points out that Sir Simon has
yet to devote significant attention to Bruckner, so beloved of
Berlin. Then again, Kenyon suggests, ``perhaps it's time to give
Bruckner a rest.''
</P>
<P>
   But he rightly points to another area in which Sir Simon is
likely to make his mark in Berlin. ``He could change concert life
there,'' Kenyon said. And indeed, Sir Simon went far beyond
orchestra building in Birmingham with his programming and repertory
adventures, his audience development and his fostering of
contemporary music.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he plays into Berlin as a new cultural center, there is
quite a lot he can do,'' Kenyon said. ``He can do what Abbado was
sort of expected to do but never did. He can address the issue of
how we are going to run a symphony orchestra in a major European
capital in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   And once all that has been achieved? ``To come to America,'' Sir
Simon said, ``would have been something either for a younger man or
for an older man.'' In, say, 2015, as a fully ripe and wise
maestro?

 &HT;    Bush proposes $2.3 billion Everglades plan but leaves gaps
unfilled
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK, Fla. _ Drawing cheers from
environmentalists, but leaving some key questions unanswered, Gov.
Jeb Bush outlined a $2.3 billion plan Tuesday for financing more
than half the money Florida will need to help restore the
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he opposes paying for the plan with higher property
taxes, except as a last resort. But he'd consider allowing water
managers to impose fees on the gallons people and businesses use.
</P>
<P>
   The only certainty in Bush's proposal is his call for the state
to spend $1.25 billion by 2010 to begin building a massive network
of reservoirs, filter marshes and storage wells. That money would
come from general state taxes, existing land-buying programs and
interest on a proposed Everglades trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $1 billion _ earning $82 million in interest _
would come from residents in South and Central Florida, also by
2010. But Bush declined to spell out how to raise that money,
leaving that decision largely up to the South Florida Water
Management District, along with the region's cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also doesn't say where Florida would get the money it
needs for the restoration for the decade after 2010 _ an estimated
$1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, Bush told lawmakers, environmentalists and
park managers: Florida is ready to join the federal government in
saving the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows that this is a long-term commitment,'' said
Bush, wearing khakis, hiking boots and an open-necked burgundy
shirt. He stood for the cameras in front of a vista that was scenic
but not entirely natural _ a cypress and cattail-lined pond
excavated years ago for the park's visitor center.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of almost all the state's major environmental groups
cheered the announcement, as did the sugar industry and U.S. Sen.
Bob Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is expected to vote this year on a $7.8 billion
Everglades restoration blueprint, which also aims to store the
water that South Florida's farms and cities will need in the next
half-century.
</P>
<P>
   The state and federal governments expect to split the costs
50-50. But environmentalists have said the plan is probably doomed
in Washington unless the state approves a concrete method this year
for financing its share of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Most environmental groups had pressed for the state to provide
at least $100 million each year. Bush's plan would average $125
million per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting a show of leadership from the governor, and
I think that's what we got,'' said Shannon Estenoz, co-chairwoman
of the Everglades Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   She added she's not worried that the plan outlines money for
only the first decade: ``It's kind of like building an aircraft
carrier _ once you build half of it, it's hard to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lee, senior vice president of the Florida Audubon
Society, said a decade is about as far in the future as Bush could
reasonably commit the state _ especially since the governor is
limited to two four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gov. Bush has done everything a governor could do,''
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Save Our Everglades leader Mary Barley chastised
Bush for not outlining money for the entire restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a 10-year project _ it's a 20-year project,'' said
Barley, an Islamorada Republican who has been a harsh critic of
Bush's actions on the environment. ``Do you just say, 'I'm going to
take out a 10-year mortgage ... and 10 years from now I'm going to
get the rest?'''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan leaves huge decisions facing the water district,
which levies $272 million in property taxes in all or part of 16
counties.
</P>
<P>
   For the Everglades restoration, the district would need about
$100 million each year _ while it pursues other projects, such as a
possible $1 billion cleanup of Lake Okeechobee, and maintains an
aging flood control system.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Everglades money would most likely come from the
dozens of cities and counties that would share water from the
project. The district also could steer money and employees from
lower-priority projects, or go after about $40 million that state
transportation planners spend each year on environmental programs
in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, who can veto the water managers' budget, said he wants
to avoid one of the most mentioned proposals: increasing the
district's property tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would consider another idea: Charging a fee of some
sort on water used by businesses, utilities and others. ``That's an
option that I think is appropriate,'' Bush said later Tuesday in
Tallahassee.

</P>
<P>
   In its most detailed look so far at how families have fared
during the nation's long run of prosperity, the Federal Reserve
said the strong economy pushed more households into the middle
class, and that the booming strong market showered benefits on all
but the lowest income groups. The report, based on an in-depth
survey of the finances of more than 4,000 households in 1998 also

had forecast. In its third profit warning since September, the
company also said its earnings for all of 1999 and 2000 will be

HARRY AND LOUISE COMMERCIALS RETURN WITH A HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Harry and Louise, featured in television
commercials that helped kill President Clinton's plan for universal
health insurance in 1994, are back.
</P>
<P>
   They still work for the insurance industry, but now, in a new
television commercial, they prod Clinton, Congress and political
candidates to do something about the problem of 44 million
Americans without health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's huge,'' Harry says. ``An epidemic.'' He insists, ``We
can't leave working families and kids without insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Louise replies that ``someone actually has a workable plan,''
and she praises the plan devised by the Health Insurance
Association of America. ``It has tax relief for workers and small
businesses, and special help for the working poor,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   Charles N. Kahn III, president of the association, said that
Republican candidates for president had ``basically ignored'' the
issue of the uninsured in recent months. ``Republicans are
floundering on the issue, to be frank,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kahn said the Republican nominee would have to address the
issue because the Democratic candidates for president, former Sen.
Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore, had made health insurance
coverage a defining issue in their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans without health insurance continues to
increase by about a million a year, even though the economy is
strong and the unemployment rate is at a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry's plan would make it easier for people to
buy private insurance, with new government subsidies for low-wage
workers and new tax credits for small employers. The proposals
would amount to a large federal subsidy for the industry, but
insurance executives said most of the money would be passed on to
doctors, hospitals and others who provide health care.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies see threats from both left and right. They
fear that liberal Democrats will try to supplant private insurers
with some type of government-run health program. They say that some
conservative Republicans would undermine the employer-based health
insurance system by creating tax incentives for people to buy
health insurance as individuals, rather than through large groups
organized by employers.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn said the industry was spending $1 million on newspaper
advertisements and television commercials, scheduled to run on CNN
nationwide and on some network affiliates in the Washington area in
the next 10 days. More advertising may follow, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry spent $17 million on the original Harry-and-Louise
campaign, which featured 14 television commercials from September
1993 to August 1994. In those advertisements, Harry and Louise
criticized Clinton's proposals as complex and bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   The same actors appear in the new spots, which were produced by
the same company, Goddard Claussen, now a unit of Porter Novelli,
which in turn is a unit of the Omnicom Group. Harry and Louise were
catapulted to national fame when Hillary Rodham Clinton attacked
their sponsor in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn denied that his organization was making a radical shift. In
1993 and 1994, he said, the association supported Clinton's goal of
universal insurance coverage and, at that time, even supported
proposals to require employers to provide or obtain coverage for
employees.
</P>
<P>
   On a related issue, White House officials said Tuesday that
Clinton would again propose tax credits for people providing
long-term care to relatives with chronic illnesses and
disabilities. But, they said, the maximum tax credit would be three
times as big _ $3,000 a year, instead of the $1,000 proposed last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on aging praised the president's proposal last year. But
many described it as a symbolic statement because, they said, many
people with chronic illnesses require home-care services costing
tens of thousands of dollars a year.

ON BASEBALL: JETER IS THE EXTRAORDINARY EXCEPTION
</HEADLINE>
  (With YANKEES-JETER) 
(rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Derek Jeter stares straight into your eyes when he is
involved in a one-on-one conversation with you, whether the topic
is college basketball, another chilly day in New York or his future
with the Yankees. Jeter's pale green eyes rarely stray because he
is absorbing every sentence. Do not try to figure out Jeter's gaze.
He will not allow it.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter was standing in a corner of a private room at the Official
All Star Cafe last Saturday, talking, then listening and staring.
The discussion shifted from thoughts about spring training to his
contract status and how it would be logical for George
Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, to sign Jeter, his
25-year-old shortstop, to a multiyear deal now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play here,'' Jeter said. ``Eventually, I think it
will all work out.''
</P>
<P>
   With those simple, smooth comments, Jeter stopped staring and
looked away. Maybe it was a sign. Maybe it was Jeter's way of
hinting that he was close to agreeing to a seven-year, $118.5
million contract, which would make him the highest-paid player in
major league baseball. When Jeter stopped staring, it might have
been because he had almost revealed too much about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never catch me bragging,'' Jeter said that day. ``I
won't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jeter could and he should because he is a remarkable player,
and this contract is one that the Yankees must complete. When it is
Steinbrenner's money, not mine, it is simple to write that Jeter is
worth $118.5 million, a staggering sum. It is easy to explain how
Jeter, who is already working out in Tampa, Fla., for the 2000
season, will only get better and how his salaries will only
increase if he continues going through the arbitration process and
then gets a whiff of free agency after the 2001 season. It is so
simple because it is all so true.
</P>
<P>
   Players like Jeter, who has the combination of immense talent,
incredible competitiveness, undeniable grace and the unbelievable
appeal that has made him the most popular Yankee, are extremely
rare. Four years ago, Steinbrenner might have envisioned the future
when he watched Jeter's full rookie year and said, ``There's not a
better shortstop in the game today than Derek Jeter.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Seattle's Alex Rodriguez and Boston's Nomar Garciaparra
are serious stars in the shortstop equation, too, but Steinbrenner
would definitely make the same remark today and be right. Jeter
does not have as much power as Garciaparra or Rodriguez, but he has
evolved into the best all-around player, he plays in New York and
he has three World Series rings. Steinbrenner has always hesitated
to sign young players to long-term deals before they are eligible
for free agency, but he is about to make a shrewd exception for
Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Jeter's .349 average, 24 homers, 102 runs batted in and
134 runs scored last season, the main reasons he could make almost
$17 million a season are his intangibles. Jeter is more likely to
play point guard for the Knicks than to ever embarrass the Yankees.
He was smart enough to leave a bar when someone shouted a racial
epithet at him a few years ago. He signs more autographs than any
other Yankee, and he has blossomed into the future captain of the
team with a cool clubhouse presence.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to Jeter said that Jeter has told his close
friend Rodriguez, who can be a free agent after the 2000 season, to
pursue his market value but not to let the contract motivate him:
do not be overly consumed with being the first $200 million player;
do not let the contract define you as a player.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter is acting that way by making some concessions in his deal
with the Yankees. Several baseball executives and agents recently
speculated that Jeter could earn from $135 million to $200 million
in deals of 8 to 10 years. But Jeter does not want to wait to see
what Rodriguez or Ken Griffey Jr. gets. Jeter does not want to test
free agency or sign for just five years so that he can rumble into
the always-escalating vault again. He wants to be a Yankee forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret I love playing in New York,'' Jeter said last
Saturday. ``I'd love to play in New York for the rest of my career.
But it's a business and I understand that. I don't worry about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner wants to meet with Jeter in Tampa before the
contract is made final. That will be easy to arrange since Jeter
bought a house there so he could work out at the Yankees'
facilities five days a week. Steinbrenner knows how to find Jeter,
who will be hitting or throwing and staring straight back at him.

 &HT;    Vulture caused crash of F-16
 &HT;    By Molly Hennessy-Fiske
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A turkey vulture that hit the canopy of
an F-16 caused the July crash that killed an Air Force Reserve
pilot in Okeechobee County, according to a report released by Air
Force investigators Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Samuel D'Angelo was a seasoned pilot who had patrolled the
no-fly zone over Iraq in April. The accident, which happened during
a low-altitude flight with the F-16 traveling at 500 mph, is among
a small number of fatalities recorded as being caused by bird
strikes. Federal experts say such rare occurrences are a
consequence of stealthier, more silent aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the only aircraft that's vulnerable to birds,'' Col.
Chip Taylor, who helped coordinate the investigation, said Tuesday,
``As long as we have flying machines and flying animals in the sky,
we're going to have accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said D'Angelo, 40, of Key Largo, Fla., left
Homestead Air Force Base en route to Avon Park Bombing Range with
three other F-16s at 10:42 a.m. July 1 and would have arrived about
an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gregory Lee and Lt. Col. Derek Rydholm flew 2 or 3 miles
ahead of D'Angelo and Maj. Keith W. Beam, who was in a separate
plane, approaching the Okeechobee County landfill about 15 miles
east of their destination at 11:30 a.m. when D'Angelo's plane
suddenly went down in a remote cattle ranch.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows the crash was not a result of error on the part
of D'Angelo, who had flown 727s with American Airlines since 1992
and received numerous Air Force commendation medals, an Air Force
achievement medal and the National Defense Service Medal. Taylor
said D'Angelo had flown the same route with his three fellow pilots
before, and that the training mission was fairly routine.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows the landfill D'Angelo skirted before the crash
was host to the culprit, most likely a turkey vulture, although the
group also noted high concentrations of black vultures, white ibis
and cattle egrets.
</P>
<P>
   According to Air Force Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard Team records,
turkey vultures have been responsible for more than 348 bird
strikes since 1985. Of the 18 species the team tracks, only
mourning doves and horned larks caused more accidents. Taylor said
the vultures are not only dangerous, they are also costly _ the
third costliest bird to run into. Because they are so large, they
cause more damage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force safety tests include shooting a four-pound ``bird-like
substance'' at a speed of about 360 mph into the canopies of $20
million F-16s like the one D'Angelo was flying. But Taylor said the
tests can only simulate real-world circumstances. Birds may be
bigger, and an F-16 often flies faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aircraft is designed for maneuverability. It's not
hardened,'' Taylor said of the F-16, a plane he has flown for about
14 years, ``The basic concept is 'Don't get hit.' ``
</P>
<P>
   D'Angelo and his fellow pilots were practicing evasive maneuvers
at the time of the accident, flying at about 500 to 1500 feet above
the ground, Taylor said. Beam, who flew directly over the landfill,
did not report seeing any birds, and although no bird remains were
recovered at the crash, Taylor said the force of the impact on the
canopy matched that in previous bird strike cases.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bird Strike Committee U.S.A., a research group
formed in 1991 by Federal Aviation Administration scientists and
engineers, there have been only about 300 fatalities reported for
civil or military planes nationally since 1960. Of those, most
resulted from birds being sucked into plane engines, according to
Richard Dolbeer, who chairs the committee. The Ohio-based group
recently started working with an engineering firm in Washington to
develop aircraft radar that could emit sounds to warn birds away as
planes approach, similar to the way propellers on older craft did
50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were few airstrikes then because planes were propeller
driven, noisy and slow,'' he said, ``Today there may be a lot of
noise behind the plane, but up front they're pretty quiet and
they're traveling at a much greater speed.''

COMMENTARY: CHICKS NIX HOSE ON STIX 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On my birthday, my girlfriend Alessandra and I raced over to
Saks Fifth Avenue to find miracle wrinkle creams.
</P>
<P>
   We careened up to the Estee Lauder counter. The woman there
suggested a shiny gook you smear on your face to create the
illusion of soft pink light dangling over your head.
</P>
<P>
   We bought it.
</P>
<P>
   Then we moved on to the Creme de la Mer counter. Standing before
an aquarium, the saleswoman gave us the back story. She said the
seaweed concoction had been developed by a handsome rocket
scientist who had had his face burned off in an accident while he
was testing fuels for NASA. He worked for 12 years in his garage to
come up with a cream that would get his face back. I said it
sounded too ``Phantom of the Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has healing powers,'' the saleswoman said portentously.
</P>
<P>
   I hesitated. It was $155 for two ounces. ``It's so expensive,''
I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharon Stone uses it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   We bought it.
</P>
<P>
   I had always thought one of the blandishments of feminism would
be a more flexible and capacious notion of female beauty. I was
wrong. The philosophers and poets may have equated beauty with
truth and goodness. But in the world of implants, collagen and
starlets so thin that an Altoid constitutes a hearty meal, Barbie
is bigger than ever. We went straight from Jayne Mansfield to
Pamela Anderson Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of broadening the choices of how to look good, we have
only broadened the ways we try to look alike. We spend $8 billion a
year on an infinite number of creams designed to make us
conformists with perfect complexions.
</P>
<P>
   Women's magazines have only two topics: how to trap men, and how
to look good enough to trap men.
</P>
<P>
   Kroger, the nation's largest grocery store chain, decided to
sheathe Cosmopolitan in a blinder rack, the sort that hides
Penthouse, to spare shoppers racy headlines such as ``Sex Tricks:
20 Earth-Quaking Moves That Will Make Him Plead for Mercy _ and Beg
for More.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gotten hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of e-mails
and calls to our headquarters thanking us,'' says Gary Rhodes, the
Kroger spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But if Kroger wants to crusade on this, it will have to toss all
the women's magazines. February's Glamour features a cover story on
``Sex and Size: How to Maximize your Pleasure Match.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening news, once the domain of stories about budget
deficits and guerrilla wars, now dwells on diets and laser surgery.
</P>
<P>
   When I try to keep up on beauty news, I get frightened and
confused. Harper's Bazaar has a story recommending ``precision
liposuction'' involving ``multiple micro reductions of hard-to-tone
areas.'' Then on Tuesday USA Today had a front-page story about the
alarming increase in death by liposuction. ``We're on top of this
problem,'' said Jack Bruner, a Sacramento doctor who is the
chairman of the plastic surgeons' liposuction task force.
</P>
<P>
   Liposuction task force? Women in the 50s vacuumed. Women in the
00s are vacuumed. Our Hoovers have turned on us!
</P>
<P>
   Harper's bubbles that ``programmed water and nuclear submarine
materials are finding their way into your face cream.''
</P>
<P>
   I would rather smear fissionable materials on my face than
figure out what's going on with pantyhose. The New York Post
reports that only the most gauche women still wear hose, even in
winter. Suffering for beauty is one thing. But gangrene for beauty?
</P>
<P>
   The article explained that women spurned hose as too binding.
But now that they have given up hose, they have started wearing
more foundation garments, because they want the control of hose
without the hose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard of women cutting the legs off of hose and just
wearing the control tops,'' said Linda Welles, the editor of
Allure.
</P>
<P>
   I was still trying to make sense of nylon sales dropping and
girdle sales rising when I got to the end of the article, which
reveals what they will be wearing this spring: hose.
Cashmere-and-herringbone-textured hose.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion slaves of New York have taken leave of their senses.
Bare legs in Arctic temperatures; cashmere-and-herringbone-swathed
legs in tropical temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. We'll buy that.

CLINTON PROMOTES $200 MILLION ANTI-GUN PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ President Clinton's penchant for devouring his way
through a city made a return during his visit here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After a speech at the Orchard Gardens Community Center, where he
promoted a $280 million proposal to crack down on the use of
illegal guns, Clinton seemed to have worked up quite an appetite.
Instead of cooling his heels at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel before
an evening fund-raiser, he asked Mayor Thomas M. Menino to take him
to get something to eat.
</P>
<P>
   They ended up at Mike's City Diner in the South End, where he
chowed down on ham and scrambled eggs, a big bowl of grits,
cornbread and rye toast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ate like a horse,'' he said. ``I need a nap.''
</P>
<P>
   His lunch-time companions, Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Menino
both ordered ham and cheese omelettes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had visited Roxbury, a neighborhood crippled by crime
and drugs, not to highlight its failures but rather to celebrate
its success in combating youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   The president plans to ask Congress to approve funding to hire
500 new agents and inspectors for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms to target illegal gun dealers and traffickers and
1,000 new state and local prosecutors to work on gun-related cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to send a message, an unambigious message, to
people who violate the law: if you commit crimes with guns or
violate gun laws, you will pay a heavy price. No city has sent that
message more clearly than Boston,'' said Clinton, flanked by more
than a dozen Boston uniformed police officers and political leaders
gathered in the center's gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   The next order of business for Clinton was attending a $25,000
per couple fund-raiser at the suburban home of Alan Solomont. The
event at the home of the former Democratic National Committee
finance chairman in Weston raised $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-gun proposal he unveiled Tuesday is part of his effort
to make gun control a top priority for his last year in office. It
is also a direct response to criticism from some Republicans and
the National Rifle Assocation that his administration has
emphasized gun restrictions over greater enforcement of existing
gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says the $280 million proposal, which will be included
in the fiscal 2001 budget he will send to Capitol Hill next month,
is designed to build on community policing and other efforts taken
by his administration that have created a 25-year low in the crime
rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want America to be the safest big country in the entire
world,'' he said. ``We can do that _ not with a silver bullet, but
by continuing to build on what has worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Other features of the proposal include funding 100 more federal
gun prosecutors in the offices of the US attorneys; expanding a gun
tracing program in Boston and 37 other cities to 50 cities,
tripling funding for ballistics testing, and doubling funding for
so-called ``smart gun'' technology designed to limit a gun's use to
its owner or other authorized users. He also proposed providing $10
million in Justice Department matching grants to support local
media campaigns on gun violence and gun safety.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Menino, who met Clinton at Logan International
Airport, acknowledged that by focusing on gun enforcement rather
than restrictions the proposal is limited and perhaps punitive.
But, Kennedy said, ``It may be built on. There will probably be
support to sort of build on.''
</P>
<P>
   The president ended his day at Solomont's home with 40 people
who contributed to the Democratic Party coffers.
</P>
<P>
   After a chorus of Weston Middle School students serenaded the
president with Jim Croce's ``Time in a Bottle'' and the civil
rights anthem ``We Shall Overcome,'' Clinton rose from his chair by
the fireplace to exhort the party faithful to stay the course
through November.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the lament of ``not enough time'' in Croce's
ballad, Clinton said, ``We do have time to do the things we want to
do, as a country and as a people.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, along with Democratic National Committee chairman
Edward Rendell, said the country's combination of ``economic
prosperity, social progress, and self-confidence'' bodes well for a
Democratic victory this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Decmocratic Party has been reformed, reenergized and
reborn in the last seven years in a way that is entirely consistent
with our history and with our values.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his ``unfinished business'' includes legislation on
a patients' bill of rights, hate crimes, and gun control, and that
increased tolerance among all Americans will continue to be a
priority through his last year in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to expand the real family of America,'' Clinton said.
``We have more in common than whatever divides us.''

 &HT;    Government fails to meet court-ordered deadline to surrender all
Davidian evidence
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The government failed to meet a court-ordered
deadline Tuesday to produce all evidence in a wrongful-death
lawsuit filed by surviving Branch Davidians _ even with the
shipping of 50 boxes of documents over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for plaintiffs' attorney Mike Caddell confirmed his
Houston office received the documents Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got about that number,'' the spokesman said. ``We haven't
had time to count them yet.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco ordered the
federal government to produce evidence related to the deaths of
David Koresh and 75 followers by Jan. 15. However, U.S. Attorney
Michael Bradford of Beaumont said federal rules allow for the
deadline to be extended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under federal rules, if the deadline falls on a weekend, it
can be extended to the next working day,'' Bradford said. ``Since
Monday was a holiday, the deadline would extend until Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said classified documents from the Department of
Defense, as well as records from the U.S. Attorney's office for the
Western District of Texas, are all that remain to be turned over.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that those are the only materials not
produced,'' Bradford said. ``We did a considerable amount of work
over the weekend. There are about 2,500 documents previously
classified. By law, we can't produce classified documents. We're
going through them to see if we can pull out the portions that are
classified so the rest can be produced. The process has not been
completed.''
</P>
<P>
   The originals of photographs taken from the U.S. Attorney's
office in Waco have been turned over to Smith, Bradford said.
However, the government is still reproducing them for the
plaintiffs. That work should be completed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hired a private contractor to make copies of everything,''
Bradford said. ``Going back through them, we discovered 31 boxes of
materials for which they failed to make copies. We sent the company
down to Waco to make those copies. We're told they'll finish that
process by tomorrow (Wednesday). We still have to go through and
review them for possible privileged information as well as for
duplicative photographs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford decline to estimate when the remaining documents will
be given to the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed Tuesday, Caddell questioned whether the
government was turning over the originals of documents to the
court, as ordered by Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell noted that in a memo to Bradford, a Justice Department
official reported that the FBI's laboratory was duplicating the
negatives of photographs taken by a former agent. The memo
concluded, ``... we expect to be able to ship a copy of them to the
court on Jan. 18, 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   That, according to Caddell's motion, ``raises grave concerns
whether the other negatives that are already apparently on file at
the courthouse in Waco are originals or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, however, maintained Tuesday that the government is
supplying the court original documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this instance, a former FBI agent had taken photographs (at
Mount Carmel) with a personal camera,'' Bradford said. ``The FBI
just found out about it. They got the negatives from him and
notified the court. The filing done with the court had language
that made it sound like copies of the negatives were being produced
for the court. In fact, we will produce the originals for the
court. If he (Caddell) had called, we would have told him that. The
language is confusing, however.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Caddell asked Smith to fine the government $50,000 if
it failed to meet the document deadline. Caddell argued he would
need the money to hire employees to go through the last-minute
documents.
</P>
<P>
   In another motion filed Tuesday, Caddell asked the court to
compel officials at the ATF and the Department of Defense to answer
on-the-record whether any of their agents fired shots at the Branch
Davidians on April 19, 1993. The FBI has already denied that its
agents fired a shot on the final day of the 51-day siege.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell noted that one of the Delta Force members at Mount
Carmel was described as a combat specialist.
</P>
<P>
   The two other Delta Force members present were communications
specialists, according to Caddell's motion, who testified during
their depositions that the third Delta Force member was not seen
until after the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Further, when he appeared, he was described as looking
'tired,' 'somewhat disheveled,' and 'red-eyed,' according to the
motion.

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Howard Dean, the governor of Vermont, is
expected to endorse Vice President Al Gore for president Wednesday
in Lebanon, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement is to take place during a tour of a children's
center there. Dean, who was not available for comment Tuesday, is a
former chairman of the national governors' association and of the
Democratic governors' association.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a physician who made health care the centerpiece of
his early tenure as governor of Vermont. In 1992, Dean signed a
bill to negotatiate with insurance companies for universal
coverage. That bill was later rejected by the Vermont legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Dean also promoted early childhood development with a Success by
Six prevention program that offered home visits to babies. And he
has worked to subsidize health insurance for children.
</P>
<P>
   In endorsing Gore, Dean is expected to say that he favors Gore's
health care plan over the proposal offered by Bill Bradley, the
former New Jersey senator. Gore's plan would attempt to cover all
children and their families by the end of the next president's
administration.

MICROSOFT ISSUES 70-PAGE RESPONSE TO JUDGE IN ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY with STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sailing against a fierce head wind, Microsoft
delivered the legal arguments Tuesday that it hoped would stave off
an adverse antitrust ruling, taking issue with a judge's
conclusions about the case and restating many arguments that he had
already rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's 70-page conclusions of law, sent to Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson and published on its Web site after the stock
market closed, contend that case law does not support either the
government's charges or the judge's findings of fact, published in
November. The filing does not, however, directly assail Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as Microsoft, the Justice Department and 19 state
attorneys general enter a critical stage in the settlement talks
that have been under way since November in which both sides are to
lay out their demands, or concessions. The state and federal
prosecutors are expected to ask for a serious structural remedy,
perhaps even a breakup of the company, which Microsoft has made it
clear it would not accept.
</P>
<P>
   Early in November, Jackson published his findings of fact, in
which he portrayed Microsoft as a rapacious monopolist that
dedicated considerable resources to maintaining its monopoly by
putting potential competitors at a disadvantage. His ruling is most
likely to come in March.
</P>
<P>
   The factual findings appeared to make an eventual ruling against
Microsoft in U.S. District Court in Washington all but inevitable.
But under the structure set up by the judge, both sides were to
file their conclusions of law _ the legal arguments behind their
cases _ after the judge had showed his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The state and federal governments issued their legal conclusions
Dec. 6, and they amounted to a stirring ratification of the judge's
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, on the other hand, said in its filing Tuesday that
the company ``respectfully disagrees with the court's findings and
believes they are unsupported by the record.'' The company added,
``Even accepting the court's findings, the plaintiffs have not
satisfied the burden under the governing law on any of their
claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The drift of antitrust case law, legal experts note, has been
broadly pro-defendant since the 1980s. In its brief, Microsoft
quoted nearly all of it in arguing that the legal restraints on
dominant firms are few, giving them much freedom to protect their
product designs and copyright. The company liberally cited cases
involving IBM and Kodak, two big companies that frequently won
private antitrust suits.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft also cited a federal appeals court ruling in 1982,
in which the court upheld the right of a copyright holder to
prevent unauthorized modification of its work. Microsoft contends
that its restrictions on how personal computer makers present
Windows is an entirely legal defense of its copyright. That 1982
ruling was written by Justice Richard Posner, who is now serving as
mediator in Microsoft's settlement talks with the government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Attacking the government's claims and the judge's findings one
by one, Microsoft first tried to rebut the conclusion that it had
illegally tied a Web browser, Internet Explorer, to the Windows
operating system. The central argument behind that assertion is the
same one Microsoft brought to court in October 1997, when the
Justice Department first challenged the company's decision to
integrate the two products.
</P>
<P>
   Then, and now, Microsoft argued that the browser and the
operating system were actually one product _ not two products tied
together. Following that assumption, which the judge has already
said he rejects, Microsoft cited several previous legal cases in
which other courts have dismissed tying charges because they have
found that only one product was actually involved.
</P>
<P>
   On another charge _ that Microsoft worked hard to block
Netscape, maker of a competing browser, from the market _ the brief
appeared to pick and choose from among the judge's findings to
highlight those that appeared to support the company's case.
</P>
<P>
   It quoted the judge as saying ``Microsoft did not actually
prevent users from obtaining and using Navigator.'' But in the same
paragraph, the judge also wrote that Microsoft blocked ``the
easiest and most intuitive paths'' for obtaining Netscape's
browser, so that ``few new users had any incentive'' to install it.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, while attacking the government's charge that
Microsoft sought a monopoly in the Web browser market, Microsoft
quoted from the judge's findings as follows: ``The evidence is
insufficient to find that Microsoft's ambition is a future in which
most or all of the content available on the Web would be accessible
only through its own browsing software.'' Microsoft asserted _
citing previous case law that hangs on that conclusion _ that the
conclusion is ``fatal to plaintiff's attempted monopolization
claim.''
</P>
<P>
   But once again, in the same paragraph, the judge wrote: ``The
evidence does, however reveal an intent'' to reduce the number of
Netscape users to a point where they are ``too few'' to be
meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rebutted the judge's finding that the company holds
substantial monopoly power in the market for personal computer
operating systems by repeating the arguments it made in court _ the
very ones that the judge rejected. As an example, Microsoft wrote
that it could not raise or lower output of its operating system at
whim _ a hallmark of a monopolist _ because competitors ``could
readily expand their output to meet the entire demand.''
</P>
<P>
   But the judge found that the niche operating systems Microsoft
cited have been unable to convince more than a handful of software
companies to write programs for their systems _ a fact, the judge
noted, that allows Microsoft to maintain its dominance.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft filing, antitrust experts say, is partly intended
to give Jackson reason to consider a milder legal judgment against
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Before this judge, Microsoft ``may be trying for a modest defeat
instead of a rout,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at the
George Washington University law school. ``They have little hope of
turning this judge around, but they do want to steer him away from
accepting the government's case in toto, and thus chip away at the
platform for sweeping remedies against it.''
</P>
<P>
   The filing, these experts say, also strongly suggests the line
of legal argument Microsoft is likely to take if it loses before
Judge Jackson and appeals his ruling. ``This is a preview of
Microsoft's arguments on appeal,'' noted Andrew Gavil, a professor
at the Howard University law school.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and the government are each entitled to file rebuttal
documents with the judge in the coming weeks. And final oral
arguments, summing up the cases both sides have made in their
conclusions of law, are scheduled for Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   After that, assuming the two sides do not reach a settlement,
the judge will issue his verdict.

 &HT;    Roberds CEO promises compassion for workers, families
 &HT;    By Tim Tresslar
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST CARROLLTON, Ohio _ Melvin Baskin, chief executive for the
embattled Roberds Inc., says compassion will be critical as the
retailer wends its way through the bankruptcy reorganization
process.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-store furniture, electronics and appliance retailer plans
to file court documents today seeking protection from creditors
through Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. Baskin declined
Tuesday to detail the company's specific strategy for emerging from
bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Roberds managers gathered workers Tuesday in Tampa, Fla., and
Cincinnati to explain the company's plans to shutter stores in
those places. Baskin went to Tampa; Robert Wilson, Roberds'
president, broke the news to the Cincinnati staff.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin thought it important that he travel to Tampa to explain
the decision to shut the market's eight stores and distribution
center. It's one of many Florida trips Baskin plans to make as the
company closes up shop there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're entitled to have that information as fast as they
can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin knows first-hand what its like to work for a company
embroiled in bankruptcy proceedings. The 56-year-old executive
worked for Federated Department Stores, parent company of Lazarus,
when the company went through its own reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   The process taught him the need for an open door, clear
communication and compassion for those affected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actions that we have announced today have been very
difficult, as they affect many outstanding, dedicated employees and
their families,'' Baskin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin came to Roberds as president and chief executive officer
in July 1998, later shedding the president's title but joining the
board of directors. Bask to Roberds after a stint with
convenience store chain Farm Stores Inc. His retail resume before
that included stints with Bruener's Home Furnishings Corp., The
Bombay Co., Kay Jewelers and Neiman-Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin, chosen from a field of 60 candidates, succeeded James F.
Robeson, who stepped in as interim chief executive after founder
Kenneth W. Fletcher resigned in November 1998. Fletcher remained
with the company as chairman and a consultant until his death in
January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin inherited a company challenged by losses and dropping
stock prices. The board, which includes local business leaders such
as banker Jerry Kirby, former NCR executive Gilbert Williamson and
real estate executive and Roberds co-founder Donald Wright, brought
Baskin in at a salary of $400,000 with a $25,000 bonus and stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin's strategy for turning around the company included
cutting costs, improving merchandise selection, emphasizing
high-margin furniture products and instituting performance
standards for sales staff.
</P>
<P>
   The company made numerous efforts to save itself, but lost an
average of $1 million per month between January 1998 and September
1999. Executives also saw performance improve in the first half of
1999. The company continued to post losses, but smaller ones than
during the previous year. During the third quarter, the company
posted a $3.3 million loss compared with $1.2 million during the
same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the company's bankruptcy filing, Baskin said he
came to the tough job with his eyes open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I knew what I was coming into,'' he said.

 Margy Rochlin's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
the WB network.  
 By MARGY ROCHLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was in 1986 that Catherine Keener decided that sitcom humor
might not be her calling. At the time, she had just got her first
real break _ making her network debut as the eldest of three
daughters in a pilot called ``The Alan King Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, she found herself on a CBS soundstage, worrying about
how she was going to get a live studio audience to laugh at a lame
joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something about blue chip cookies for the blue chip
crowd,'' said Ms. Keener, who turned to ``Gilligan's Island'' in
her time of need. ``I didn't know how to make it funny. So I
remember that I kind of clenched my jaw like I was Mrs. Howell or
something.'' It didn't work. After the taping, Ms. Keener was
ordered to something like sitcom detention. ``Everybody went home
and I was there until, like, two in the morning, trying to get it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the 40-year-old Ms. Keener's body of work since then, the
fact that she held herself, and not the material, accountable
sounds like a better joke than the one about the cookies. Whether
in a starring role as a helplessly distracted indie starlet in a
shoestring production like ``Living In Oblivion'' (1995) or in a
glorified supporting turn as a magician's assistant and the ex-wife
of an escaped convict in the 1998 crime caper ``Out of Sight,'' Ms.
Keener's ability to be effortlessly hilarious is all about
appearing as if she's never trying too hard.
</P>
<P>
   It's a brand of acting that Spike Jonze, who directed ``Being
John Malkovich,'' the dryly surreal hit in which Ms. Keener stars,
categorizes as ``un-flashy. Very real, but complicated.
Naturalistic. More like you're watching a person as opposed to a
character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' is about Craig Schwartz (John Cusack),
a puppeteer turned file clerk who discovers a portal that allows
people to view the world through the actor John Malkovich's eyes
for 15 minutes. In it, Ms. Keener plays Maxine, a co-worker of
Craig's who is flip, controlling and smug about her own sex appeal
in a way the outspoken but self-doubting '90s women Ms. Keener
often plays never are.
</P>
<P>
   Around mid-movie, Craig and his housepet-doting, frumpy spouse,
Lotte (Cameron Diaz), both become romantically obsessed with
Maxine. Jonze, who credits his wife, Sofia Coppola, for coming up
with the idea of hiring Ms. Keener, always felt that Maxine was
much trickier than she looked.
</P>
<P>
   ``In certain scenes, Maxine barely has any dialogue at all,''
Jonze said. ``And the dialogue she does have is quick and to the
bone. To make that kind of character feel not one-dimensional, I
thought would be really hard.'' He said Ms. Keener was so convinced
she was wrong for the part that she kept proposing she be Lotte and
Jonze give the role of Maxine to Ms. Diaz, her close friend.
</P>
<P>
   Once Ms. Keener stopped resisting, though, Jonze reveled in a
leading lady who would come to work, change into sleek Helmut Lang
attire and a don't-touch-me demeanor, and do something totally
unexpected in every scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one take, she just slapped Malkovich on top of the head,''
Jonze said of a scene in which Malkovich and Maxine make love on
his apartment sofa. ``It made a loud, smacking sound. She could
have prepared that before, but I doubt it. She was just in the
moment. Like, Malkovich's bald head was right in front of her and
she (italics)slapped(end italics) it. It was just perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Keener's on-screen vitality often has nothing to do
with her line readings. Sometimes, it's all about her well-timed
exhalations. One of her most memorable moments in ``Your Friends
and Neighbors,'' Neil La Bute's 1998 withering look at modern
relationships, comes when she dismisses her
soon-to-be-ex-boyfriend's weaselly attempts to reconcile with a
simple, corrosive (italics)pfffftttt.(end italics) Then there is
her gift for physicality, for tweaking a potentially forgettable
bit by tilting her head or flashing a smile that seems completely
out of context.
</P>
<P>
   ``She uses her whole body to play a scene,'' said the
writer-director Nicole Holofcener, whose 1995 feature debut,
``Walking and Talking,'' starred Ms. Keener and Anne Heche as
childhood best pals struggling to take their friendship into
adulthood. ``She does these things that are so lovely and unique.
Things you can't write. Things you can't say to an actress, like,
`When you run into the lake, make your arms go up and down like a
chicken.' If a director said that to an actress, she'd look at them
like they were crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Holofcener is currently trailing the writer-director Tom
DiCillo by 4 to 1 in the race to cast Ms. Keener in every one of
their movies. (Ms. Keener appears in DiCillo's ``Johnny Suede,''
``Living in Oblivion,'' ``Box of Moonlight'' and ``The Real
Blonde.'')
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, though, Ms. Holofcener will narrow the margin
late this spring when she begins shooting her as-yet-untitled
second film, in which Ms. Keener will appear as the angriest of
three siblings _ a part written with her theatrical strengths in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Don Coscarelli had better get cracking, though. His only film so
far with Ms. Keener is ``Survival Quest,'' a 1989 low-budget
action-thriller about dueling teams of Outward Bound-ish
adventurers. On the other hand, he can lay claim to giving Ms.
Keener her first co-starring feature role, albeit one that involved
activities she would probably rather not repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of physical challenges,'' said Coscarelli,
who recalled Ms. Keener, then a gap-toothed young actress with
waist-length hair. She wanted so much to make an impression on him
that she showed up at both her audition and her callback dressed in
a camping outfit of khaki shorts with a backpack. ``She'd be
rappelling down a sheer rock face, eating worms, throwing herself
into dangerous rapids and almost killing herself on a daily
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the rehearsal process, Ms. Keener was at a
rock-climbing class for the ``Survival Quest'' cast at Angeles
Crest Forest, on the outskirts of Los Angeles, when she spotted a
handsome, dark-haired young man who had managed to scale a steep
cliff. Or most of it, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was stuck,'' said Ms. Keener. ``He couldn't get up or down.
So he had to be rescued. And I thought: `Oh, look at the hot- dog.
Serves him right.' I didn't know he was one of the actors.''
Someday this will be a story Ms. Keener can tell her son, Clyde,
now 6 months old _ about how Mommy met Daddy, aka Dermot Mulroney
(``My Best Friend's Wedding''), her husband of nine years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Mulroney's first question to Ms. Keener showed a
certain prescience. ``You're a middle child, aren't you?'' he asked
her.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she is. The third of Jim and Evelyn Keener's five
children, Ms. Keener grew up in the Little Havana section of Miami,
the youngest of a huge pack of cousins who always hung out
together. Until her teens, Ms. Keener was the family ``good girl,''
the one who would give half of whatever she ordered to her father
on their after-church Burger King stops.
</P>
<P>
   She was afraid that his owning Slumber Plus, a bedding store,
did not bring in enough money for him to pay for so many Whoppers.
The teachers at Monsignor Edward Pace High School, though, might
offer up a less angelic image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lippy,'' said Ms. Keener, who was temporarily expelled
in the 11th grade and was considered a chief instigator in her
crowd of ungovernable teen-age girlfriends, ``but not the supreme
leader. I wasn't the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, her grades were good enough to get her into Wheaton
College, an expensive women's school in Norton, Mass. Tight on
money, she roomed with an aunt who lived nearby. Her classmates
were so affluent, they made her feel ``different, out of place.
Just this chick from Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   She majored in English and history. ``The theater never called
to me,'' she said. In fact, when she enrolled in a theater ensemble
class her sophomore year, it was only because the photography
workshop she coveted was closed. Although she liked being onstage
and even won some acting awards, it was not as if her game plan was
set.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, she moved to New York and worked as an
assistant to the casting agent Gail Eisenstadt. When NBC relocated
Ms. Eisenstadt to Los Angeles, Ms. Keener went with her. Then, in
1986, after learning she had lung cancer, Ms. Eisenstadt had a
heart-to-heart with Ms. Keener, convincing her green-eyed protegee
that acting was within her reach. A few pulled strings later, Ms.
Keener was bouncing alongside Rob Lowe and Jim Belushi, improvising
her Screen Actors Guild-card winning chant, ``Go! Go! Go! Chug it!
Chug it!'' in a drinking contest scene in ``About Last Night ... ''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Ms. Keener finds herself on the receiving end of the
cheering. On Jan. 8, the New York Film Critic's Circle gave her a
best-supporting-actress award for ``Being John Malkovich.'' And
this Sunday night, a limousine will ferry Ms. Keener and Mulroney
from their Hollywood Hills home to the Beverly Hilton Hotel for the
Golden Globes awards ceremony, at which she is up for best
supporting actress for the role of Maxine.
</P>
<P>
   That does not necessarily make her an award hopeful. Or so it
seemed a couple of weeks ago when Ms. Keener, dressed in a pale
blue sweatshirt and blue jeans, sat eating a bowl of chicken soup
at Victor's Square Delicatessen in East Hollywood. She was so
conflicted about the current Keener lovefest and what it portends
for her future that it was affecting the decibel level of her loud,
gravelly voice.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why she was whispering some of her responses, Ms.
Keener said: ``Maybe I'm embarrassed to say I already get really
good parts. And that I'm lucky. And that I don't know what the next
step will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Warchus, who directed Ms. Keener in her latest film,
``Simpatico,'' which opens on Feb. 4, feels that she need not worry
about steps. ``So many potential employers are already fans of
hers,'' said the London-based Warchus. ``She probably can get
almost anything you could wish for in terms of serious acting
challenges, really.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Simpatico,'' based on Sam Shepard's 1994 play of the same
name, Ms. Keener is a lonely supermarket checkout clerk who finds
herself traveling to Kentucky and serving as unwitting bag man to a
disgraced racehorse commissioner, played by Albert Finney. Ms.
Keener admits to having watched ``Tom Jones,'' the 1963 movie in
which Finney came to fame, at least ``a thousand times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so cool, that man,'' said Ms. Keener. ``I just revere
him. The first day I worked on the movie I was in a scene with
Albert on the track at Churchill Downs.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it get any better than acting opposite one of England's
foremost talents?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those moments where you're thinking, `I just
can't believe where my life has led me,''' she replied.

 &HT;    5 minutes, 5 babies: Family faces changes 3 boys, 2 girls are
only the third set of Ohio quintuplets
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The first quintuplets known to be born in
Southwest Ohio were breathing with minimal help from machines
Tuesday, and their parents were breathing sighs of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle DiLullo, 33, gave birth to three healthy boys and two
healthy girls by Caesarean section at Miami Valley Hospital between
7:27 and 7:32 a.m. Tuesday. The babies were born 10 weeks
premature, on the target date doctors set weeks ago. Their weights
ranged from 2 pounds, 8 ounces to 3 pounds, 3 ounces, which is
almost too big to be included in statistics on high-risk premature
infants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have unexpected problems with any prematurity, but at
30 weeks gestation, the incidences of complications are fairly
low,'' said Dr. Marc Belcastro, director of Miami Valley's neonatal
intensive care unit (NICU).
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't surprising that the quints were on respirators. They
were at ``fairly easy settings,'' Belcastro said, and are expected
to spend two to 2 months in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The quints were born on the 90th birthday of their
great-grandfather, Fred DiLullo, and two days before the second
birthday of their brother, Anthony. All six DiLullo children were
conceived with the help of fertility treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very glad it's over, as is my wife,'' said father Michael
DiLullo, also 33. The Sidney resident felt ``slightly overwhelmed''
and ``very joyful'' but mindful that the next few days will be
critical. Quintuplets are 30 times more likely to die in the first
month of life than single babies, according to the National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the health care field, so I'm aware of a lot of the
complications and risks,'' said Michael, a pharmacist at Wilson
Memorial Hospital in Sidney. ``That's kind of good and bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two sets of quintuplets had been born previously in Ohio,
the Ohio Department of Health said. The United States had 79 quints
and higher-order multiple births in 1997, the NCHS said, up from an
average of 20 in 1990-92 but down from 81 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are supposed to be the first millennium quints in the
U.S.,'' said Dr. Parviz Daneshjoo, the medical director of Miami
Valley's fertility center, who delivered the babies with Dr. Bruce
Banias, a fetal medicine specialist. Daneshjoo called the delivery
``perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of quints are born before 28 weeks, Banias said,
``so we were very fortunate with Michelle to get to this point.''
Beyond 30 weeks, he said quints tend to outgrow the supply of blood
and nutrients available in the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   As fertility treatments have gained popularity, multiple births
of three or more increased in frequency by 404 percent in the
United States from 1980 to 1997, the latest year for which the NCHS
has figures. The number of single births rose by only 6 percent in
that period.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle DiLullo has become pregnant both times Daneshjoo
treated her with fertility drugs to induce ovulation, for which
success rates are typically 20 percent. Mothers almost never have
multiple pregnancies after previously delivering single babies, and
Michelle didn't show signs of several births during the treatment,
said Daneshjoo, who has helped induce nearly 2,000 pregnancies in
24 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought there would be more than three,'' Daneshjoo
said. Both parents have had twins in their families, so Michael
said they weren't surprised that an ultrasound at four weeks
indicated twins or triplets.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks later, an ultrasound revealed four embryos, and a
more sophisticated image the next day turned up the fifth. ``So we
went from a shock scenario to an utter shock syndrome within 24
hours,'' Michael said. He was so stunned, he didn't say a word in
that 45-minute meeting with Daneshjoo.
</P>
<P>
   After it sunk in, ``We had a lot of emotions going,'' he said.
The DiLullos discussed their hopes and fears with each other, their
friends, family and pastor, Jonathon Schriber of St. John's
Lutheran Church in Sidney.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had such a beautiful, caring and bonded family that made
this possible,'' Daneshjoo said. ``In spite of all the things I
told them, the risks, they decided to go through with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides their faith, St. John's has helped the DiLullos with ``a
backbone of support,'' Michael said. ``These babies are going to
have a lot of adopted grandmas from the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Big brother Anthony has ``talked to them through the belly
button. He's patted them and hugged them,'' Michael said, hoping he
will at least somewhat understand he's no longer the family's
center of attention. ``We'll have to have some times that are
strictly for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle, a stay-at-home mom, saw the babies within hours of
their birth. ``We made it,'' Michael said his wife of six years
told him. After 12 weeks of bed rest and 5 weeks in the hospital,
she'll be going home in three days.
</P>
<P>
   The house with ``three very small bedrooms'' is on the market,
although Michael doubts that any house they find will have enough
bedrooms and bathrooms. After all, they'll have two 16-year-old
girls one day.
</P>
<P>
   In order of birth, the babies are named Daniel Fred, John David,
Angelina Marie, Lauren Renee and James Andrew. Most of the names
came from their parents' families, Michael said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was the most important thing,'' Michael said. ``Through
God's grace, we were able to get through this without any
complications. All this other stuff is inconsequential.''
</P>
<P>
   How to help
</P>
<P>
   _ St. John's Lutheran Church in Sidney, Ohio, has established
the DiLullo Five Fund to help Michael and Michelle DiLullo with the
expenses of their quintuplets Tuesday. Donations can be sent to The
DiLullo Five Fund, St. John's Lutheran Church, 120 W. Water St.,
Sidney, OH 45365.

KOHL RESIGNS AS HONORARY CHAIRMAN OF CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ADDS 5th graf with Kohl retaining seat in parliament.) 
 (rk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl resigned his post as
honorary chairman of Germany's Christian Democrats on Tuesday after
the party's leadership turned on him with extraordinary vehemence
and accused him of ``violating his duties'' by refusing to name
people who secretly gave him money.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's resignation came shortly after the executive committee of
the party instructed him to give up his post if he persisted in his
refusal to clarify the source of secret payments of more than $1
million he received when he was chancellor and party leader during
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The party statement, made after a five-hour emergency meeting of
the leadership, amounted to a rebuke of a man whose stature
appeared untouchable just two months ago. But it was far from clear
whether Kohl's resignation would arrest the party's rapid political
slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to resign is not an easy one,'' Kohl said in a
statement. ``I have been a member of the Christian Democratic party
for 50 years. The party is and will remain my political home.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl retains his seat in the lower house of parliament, which
shields him from criminal prosecution unless parliament votes to
lift his immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Indicating his continuing defiance, Kohl added: ``But I am in no
position to meet the party's demand that I break the promise I made
to those who financially supported my work in the Christian
Democratic party.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's fall from grace amounts to one of the most precipitous in
modern European politics. As the chancellor of German and European
unification, he had towered above his contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday he said: ``I have served in important offices over four
decades. In so doing, I have also made mistakes which I have
publicly acknowledged. I have always tried to do my duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats are in the midst of what the party
leader, Wolfgang Schaeuble, Tuesday called ``one of the worst
crises of our history'' as a result of the revelation of secret
cash payments, overseas accounts and other irregularities during
the 16-year rule of Kohl that ended in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble, who has himself admitted accepting a bag containing
100,000 marks ($52,000) from a fugitive arms broker, had been
widely expected to resign Tuesday. But a statement expressed the
``full confidence'' of the executive committee in Kohl's
57-year-old successor.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Schaeuble's position still appears acutely vulnerable.
His survival, pending a party congress in April, appears to owe
more to the absence of a viable successor than to any real
confidence in him. Two members of the 17-member executive committee
voted against the motion supporting him and one abstained.
</P>
<P>
   Bungled explanations this week attributing some of the money
found overseas to contributions by Jews have further compounded the
party's plight and poisoned the atmosphere with accusations of
anti-Semitism. The party Tuesday took the unusual step of
apologizing ``to our Jewish compatriots.''
</P>
<P>
   The disarray has been such that Germany's normally tight-knit
political system, marked by cozy arrangements between banks,
industry and political parties, has shown signs of unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble tried hard Tuesday to focus attention on his longtime
mentor, Kohl, who has admitted accepting more than $1 million in
secret payments to the party during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The former chancellor, who unified Germany and then hitched the
country to the fate of Europe by abandoning the mark in favor of
the euro, is under criminal and parliamentary investigation for
taking the secret payments, but has said he will not violate the
``word of honor'' he gave to the contributors that their identity
would not be revealed. Under German law, any donation to a party
that exceeds $10,500 must be declared.
</P>
<P>
   Some newspaper and television channels have taken to calling the
once sacrosanct Kohl ``Don Kohleone,'' a reference to the
corruption scandals, some of them Mafia-linked, that brought down
Italy's Christian Democrats in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But there is as yet no evidence that Kohl put the money to any
uses beyond that of cementing loyalty and bolstering local branches
within the party. Only if the identities of donors eventually
become known might it be possible to establish links between
payments and favors.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats are well aware that Kohl's defiance is
intensely damaging to them because it makes a swift conclusion to
the scandal impossible and provides cheap ammunition to the Social
Democratic chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, now revived as a leader
after a generally dismal first year in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The executive is convinced that Helmut Kohl is violating his
duties as honorary chairman if he continues to refuse to contribute
to the resolution of the crisis and the clarification of errors,''
the party statement said. ``As long as he does not make this
contribution, he should lay down his post as honorary chairman.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble, who uses a wheelchair since he was injured in an
assassination attempt a decade ago, said he had spoken to Kohl by
telephone before the meeting. ``His response made this statement
necessary,'' Schaeuble said, suggesting growing exasperation with
Kohl's defiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is respect for the law,'' he added. ``And that
goes for the honorary chairman, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Volker Ruehe, a former defense minister in Kohl's Cabinet, is
among the many leading Christian Democrats anxious for decisive
action to resolve the scandal. Long the favorite to win an
important state election next month in Schleswig-Holstein, he is
now trailing the Social Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   It is this sort of political repercussion that has made a host
of younger Christian Democrats anxious for change, including
Schaeuble's departure. One of them, Christian Wulff, has called for
a wave of resignations. In effect, the party's crisis is now
certain to last until the congress in April.
</P>
<P>
   `` Mr. Kohl's silence exposes the party to the wildest
speculation and damages it greatly,'' said Heiner Geisler, the
former secretary-general of the Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The party Tuesday apologized ``to our Jewish compatriots'' over
its hapless attempt to explain the illegal use of foreign bank
accounts by the leadership in the state of Hesse. Earlier this
week, the longtime treasurer of the party in Hesse, Casimir Prinz
zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, said the money came from bequests from
``Jewish citizens who passed away and wanted to show their
appreciation for the old city of Frankfurt.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the money, totaling about 17 million marks ($8.8
million) represented the untaxed capital gains on money illegally
smuggled out the country under the former Christian Democrat leader
in Hesse and former interior minister, Manfred Kanthner. The funds
appears to have no link to Jews or to Jewish contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Kanthner resigned from the Bundestag on Monday, saying that he
was determined ``to end the witch hunt.'' Tuesday the party said:
``The German Christian Democratic Party, as well as the Hesse
branch, apologizes to our Jewish compatriots for the gaffe with
regard to foreign bank accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveying this general disintegration of what has long been
Germany's best-oiled political machine, Schroeder Tuesday allowed
himself a tone verging on smugness: ``These decisions have neither
contributed to a clarification nor to the advancement of the
housecleaning of the Christian Democrats. The government will see
to it that the image of the Federal Republic abroad is not
damaged.''

GALPIN MOTORS ADDING MAZDA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SUZIE ST. JOHN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Galpin Motors, the nation's top selling Ford
dealer, will add Mazda to the company's collection of brands,
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The move should be good news for Mazda owners in and around the
San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, who must drive to Thousand
Oaks, Santa Monica or Culver City for dealer service after Keyes
Motors in Van Nuys traded that brand in for the Hyundai nameplate
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda had indicated it wanted to remain in the San Fernando
Valley. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Mazda officials could
not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Galpin Vice President Brad Boeckmann, son of Galpin Motors owner
Bert Boeckmann, said the fact that Mazda is not well-represented in
the Valley makes the need for a showroom even more expedient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention is to take it on as soon as possible but it
depends on how quickly we find something that works. We also have
to make sure we have our people go through the proper training so
they can help the customers make a good decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Galpin is searching for a short-term facility to house the
200-plus Mazdas while the former Lincoln-Mercury and Jaguar
showroom at 15430 Roscoe Blvd. is refurbished.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln, Mercury and Jaguar cars will be moving into a new
facility being built across the street. Construction is scheduled
to start next month and take about 10 months to complete.
</P>
<P>
   The new showroom will be a three-story building totaling 140,000
square feet including the parking spaces. The first floor will
sport the Lincolns and Mercurys, the Jaguars will be on the
mezzanine level and inventory parking is planned for the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very customer-oriented; a place where people walk
in and feel very comfortable,'' Brad Boeckmann said.
</P>
<P>
   The plans include a snack bar and coffee bar, a children's
playroom and customer workstations with Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Boeckmann has owned the land that the new showroom is being
built on for 20 years and uses it to store cars from the various
Galpin stores. Those cars will now be shipped to property near the
Van Nuys Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Lincoln Mercury transition is made, the old showroom
will be updated to turn it into a Mazda store.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building itself had already undergone some renovations a
while back but it will need some minor cosmetics,'' Brad Boeckmann
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Galpin Ford dates back to 1946 when Frank Galpin opened for
business in San Fernando. Six years later Bert Boeckmann started
working there as a sales associate and went on to buy it from
Galpin. He moved it to its current location in 1966.

 &HT;    Fire kills 2 men at truck stop
 &HT;    By Mark England and Brian Gaar
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The bodies of two men were recovered Tuesday
afternoon from Ed's Truck Stop No. 4 in Elm Mott, off Interstate
35, hours after the 2 a.m. fire that claimed their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of the truck stop said the victims were two fellow
workers, Freeman Bibbs and Antonio Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities sent the bodies to Austin, Texas, for autopsies. No
cause has been determined for the fire that destroyed the back of
the truck stop, which contained a lounge, storage facility and
upstairs area where employees slept. The truck stop's newer
section, featuring a restaurant and mini-mart, only suffered smoke
and water damage.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters from Elm Mott, Bellmead, Lacy-Lakeview, Gholson,
Chalk Bluff and Leroy helped put out the fire, which raged for more
than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got here, it was fully engulfed,'' said Elm Mott
firefighter Bobby Chappell. ``There was boiling smoke and flames
shooting out from the top. We tried to knock it down and keep it
from going into the restaurant and store.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashier Lorenzo Sisneroz said a truck driver reported smelling
smoke in a rest room about 2 a.m. Tuesday. Sisneroz sent a waitress
to warn Bibbs and Salazar, reportedly sleeping in rooms above the
lounge where truckers took showers, watched TV and made phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   When the woman opened the door into the lounge, though, she
found it filled with smoke and flames.
</P>
<P>
   She yelled out the names of Bibbs and Salazar, but no one
answered, Sisneroz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called 9-1-1,'' Sisneroz said. ``She hollered and hollered,
but there was no answer. That was it. It was too hot to go inside.
It was in flames. I ran everybody out of the restaurant and store.
We just had to watch it burn. We couldn't do nothing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice of the Peace David Pareya of West said both fire victims
were found upstairs. Pareya estimated the older victim was in his
60s; the younger victim, his early 20s. Both were ``burned beyond
recognition,'' Pareya said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that they were either in or near their beds at the
time,'' Pareya said. ``Apparently, they just didn't have time to
react.''
</P>
<P>
   Pareya said the upstairs area had an exit _ a door leading to a
portico.

   WASHINGTON _ In the most detailed look so far at how families
have fared during the nation's long run of prosperity, the Federal
Reserve said Tuesday that the strong economy pushed more households
into the upper middle class, and that the strong stock market
showered benefits on all but those with the lowest incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The report, based on an in-depth survey of the finances of more
than 4,000 households in 1998 and comparisons to similar surveys in
1989, 1992 and 1995, also found a sharp rise in the percentage of
families owning stocks directly or through retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   And while generally finding most households in slightly better
financial shape relative to 1995, the report, the Fed's survey of
consumer finances, flashed some warning signs about the
accumulation of debt. The proportion of families that had missed a
debt payment by two months or more, for example, rose to 8.1
percent in 1998 from 7.1 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``While income continued a moderate upward trend, net worth grew
strongly, and the increase in net worth was broadly shared by
different demographic groups,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It did not draw any explicit conclusions about the degree to
which the gap between rich and poor was growing. But it was
relatively clear in suggesting that education levels played a key
role in determining economic success.
</P>
<P>
   And the report showed that while white families tended to enjoy
strong growth in net worth _ assets like stocks and equity in a
home minus liabilities like mortgage and credit card debt _
nonwhite and Hispanic families were far less likely to have seen a
big jump in their wealth from 1995 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the report simply confirmed what other statistics
and common sense had previously suggested: that the combination of
a long economic expansion and a bull market on Wall Street left
most people making a little more money and feeling somewhat
wealthier.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that the net worth of the median household _
that is, the level at which half the families were above and half
below _ was $71,600 in 1998, up 17.6 percent from 1995, when the
figure was $60,900, adjusted for inflation. The Fed's data
suggested that much of the gain in net worth flowed to the very
wealthiest families. But it also showed substantial gains among
households with incomes starting at $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Median family pretax income rose to $33,400 in 1998, up 2.1
percent from $32,700 in 1995, the Fed said. It was the first time
during the 1990s that median income, adjusted for inflation, had
surpassed the level of 1989, when it was $32,800.
</P>
<P>
   The gains appeared to be concentrated on wealthy families,
though self-employed people also had large income gains in the
period.
</P>
<P>
   But the data also suggested that more households were slowly
pulling themselves out of lower-income groups and more firmly into
higher income brackets.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of families making less than $10,000 a year
declined to 12.6 percent of all families in 1998, from 15.1 percent
in 1995. Families making from $10,000 to $24,999 declined to 24.8
percent of the population, from 25.4 percent; families making
between $25,000 and $49,999 fell to 28.8 percent, from 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Families making $50,000 to $99,999 rose to 25.2 percent of the
total, from 21 percent in 1995, while those in the
$100,000-and-above bracket rose to 8.6 percent, from 7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers were positive in the aggregate, they struck
some analysts as showing remarkably little improvement given the
strength and duration of the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lived through a stock market such as none of us have
ever seen and few of us ever dreamed of,'' said Henry Aaron, a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a liberal-leaning
research organization. ``Unemployment has fallen to the lowest
levels in more than three decades. Yet these global measures of
well-being have moved little. Income is flat. Asset holdings are up
a few percent.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, Aaron said, ``it is very easy to see the effects of the
booming stock market in assets holdings _ in the increase in asset
holdings, in the increase in equity holdings, in the increase in
the value of retirement accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has long been concerned
about the way in which paper and realized gains from the stock
market are fueling consumer spending and the overall growth of
demand in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   He warned in a speech last week that the superheated market
might be pushing the economy to grow faster than could be sustained
over the long run without igniting inflation, and he strongly
hinted that the Fed would raise interest rates next month in an
effort to cool down both the markets and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's report Tuesday showed that the percentage of families
owning stocks directly or indirectly through mutual funds and
401(k) programs rose to 48.8 percent in 1998, from 40.4 percent in
1995 and 31.6 percent in 1989. The median value of those stock
holdings rose to $25,000 in 1998, from $15,400 in 1995 and $10,800
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Median net worth among households with incomes of less than
$10,000 fell to $3,600 in 1998, from $4,800 in 1995, the report
said, while net worth among those making $10,000 to $25,000 fell
from $31,000 to $24,800, adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But families earning between $25,000 and $50,000 saw their
median net worth grow to $60,300 in 1998, from $56,700 in 1995.
Those with incomes between $50,000 and $100,000 saw net worth grow
to $152,000 from $126,600 during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The median household with an income of $100,000 or more saw
virtually no change in wealth. But that statistic hid a large gain
among the wealthiest of households. Looking at average net worth
for the $100,000-plus income group more accurately captures the
wealth increase among the super-rich than median statistics, which
are typically used to identify the position of someone right in the
middle of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Average, or mean, net worth in the $100,000-plus income group
jumped to more than $1.7 million in 1998 from $1.4 million in 1995,
a rise of 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that families are taking on more debt, but that
debt did not rise as quickly as assets. Still, the report found
some troubling signs that households could get into trouble should
the economy slow.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the proportion of people making debt payments late
been rising, so has the proportion of people whose debt payments
exceed 40 percent of their annual income, a rough rule of thumb for
the level at which debt can endanger financial health. In 1998,
12.7 percent of families had debt-to-income ratios of more than 40
percent, up from 10.5 percent in 1995.  &QL;

<P>
   Soon, you'll be able to mosey up to the water cooler on Mondays
and casually tell you're co-workers how you outplayed Tiger Woods
in the latest PGA Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, your co-workers won't look at you as though
you're a pathological liar.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods PGA Tour Collection, a video game for personal
computers developed by EA Sports, has been designed to allow gamers
to play online during real PGA Tour events and compare their
performances against actual professional golfers, including Woods,
in near-real-time at PlayAgainstThePros
(www.playagainstthepros.com).
</P>
<P>
   According to a demonstration at the Las Vegas Invitational,
online players will be able to take their shots vs. the pros 60 to
90 seconds after he takes a shot _ all within the game's
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that consumers are going to be able to
play and compete in real-time against pro athletes,'' said Kathy
Frazier, public-relations manager for the Tiger Woods PGA Tour
Collection at Redwood City, Calif.-based EA Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty big deal for us.''
</P>
<P>
   As demonstrated in Las Vegas, EA Sports will employ two to four
trackers per hole to record the data from the course and relay the
information to the clubhouse via a two-way e-mail device. The
information is immediately uploaded online, and then it's up to you
to outstroke Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000 has been beta-tested with rave reviews
on online gaming sites, but its official launch is scheduled for
the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach (Calif.) Invitational on Feb. 3-6. Five more
tour events are planned, but gamers will be only able to compete
against Woods, Mark O'Meara and two unidentified golfers for now,
EA Sports confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Because the data is rushed for upload, it isn't precise. But
developers predict the use of global positioning systems to place
the ball in near-perfect spots and account for weather conditions
in the game's updates. Online players can also play against the
pros from archived games.
</P>
<P>
   Gamers won't be able to use the online version until Feb. 1, but
they can register. Online players will be eligible for prizes,
including new cars.
</P>
<P>
   So for those who don't believe you beat Woods over the weekend,
show them the brand new car you won.
</P>

   PENALTY-BOX CHAT: ESPN2 and ESPN.com took multimedia
interactivity a step further this month when it asked online
viewers to chat with selected players from a Colorado
Avalanche-Chicago Blackhawks game.
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 9 telecast attracted 10,304 questions for the players
and ESPN2's on-air analysts in less than three hours, according to
ESPN.com.
</P>
<P>
   Before the second and third periods, ESPN.com users participated
in audio chats with players Tony Amonte and Joe Sakic, who were
chosen in an ESPN.com user poll before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This special event is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of
future television-Internet editorial integration opportunities,''
said John Marvel, executive editor of ESPN.com.

MICROSOFT ISSUES 70-PAGE RESPONSE TO JUDGE IN ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (subs 9th graf to change Posner's title from `Justice' to `Judge') 
 (bl)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY with STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sailing against a fierce head wind, Microsoft
delivered the legal arguments Tuesday that it hoped would stave off
an adverse antitrust ruling, taking issue with a judge's
conclusions about the case and restating many arguments that he had
already rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's 70-page conclusions of law, sent to Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson and published on its Web site after the stock
market closed, contend that case law does not support either the
government's charges or the judge's findings of fact, published in
November. The filing does not, however, directly assail Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as Microsoft, the Justice Department and 19 state
attorneys general enter a critical stage in the settlement talks
that have been under way since November in which both sides are to
lay out their demands, or concessions. The state and federal
prosecutors are expected to ask for a serious structural remedy,
perhaps even a breakup of the company, which Microsoft has made it
clear it would not accept.
</P>
<P>
   Early in November, Jackson published his findings of fact, in
which he portrayed Microsoft as a rapacious monopolist that
dedicated considerable resources to maintaining its monopoly by
putting potential competitors at a disadvantage. His ruling is most
likely to come in March.
</P>
<P>
   The factual findings appeared to make an eventual ruling against
Microsoft in U.S. District Court in Washington all but inevitable.
But under the structure set up by the judge, both sides were to
file their conclusions of law _ the legal arguments behind their
cases _ after the judge had showed his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The state and federal governments issued their legal conclusions
Dec. 6, and they amounted to a stirring ratification of the judge's
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, on the other hand, said in its filing Tuesday that
the company ``respectfully disagrees with the court's findings and
believes they are unsupported by the record.'' The company added,
``Even accepting the court's findings, the plaintiffs have not
satisfied the burden under the governing law on any of their
claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The drift of antitrust case law, legal experts note, has been
broadly pro-defendant since the 1980s. In its brief, Microsoft
quoted nearly all of it in arguing that the legal restraints on
dominant firms are few, giving them much freedom to protect their
product designs and copyright. The company liberally cited cases
involving IBM and Kodak, two big companies that frequently won
private antitrust suits.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft also cited a federal appeals court ruling in 1982,
in which the court upheld the right of a copyright holder to
prevent unauthorized modification of its work. Microsoft contends
that its restrictions on how personal computer makers present
Windows is an entirely legal defense of its copyright. That 1982
ruling was written by Judge Richard Posner, who is now serving as
mediator in Microsoft's settlement talks with the government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Attacking the government's claims and the judge's findings one
by one, Microsoft first tried to rebut the conclusion that it had
illegally tied a Web browser, Internet Explorer, to the Windows
operating system. The central argument behind that assertion is the
same one Microsoft brought to court in October 1997, when the
Justice Department first challenged the company's decision to
integrate the two products.
</P>
<P>
   Then, and now, Microsoft argued that the browser and the
operating system were actually one product _ not two products tied
together. Following that assumption, which the judge has already
said he rejects, Microsoft cited several previous legal cases in
which other courts have dismissed tying charges because they have
found that only one product was actually involved.
</P>
<P>
   On another charge _ that Microsoft worked hard to block
Netscape, maker of a competing browser, from the market _ the brief
appeared to pick and choose from among the judge's findings to
highlight those that appeared to support the company's case.
</P>
<P>
   It quoted the judge as saying ``Microsoft did not actually
prevent users from obtaining and using Navigator.'' But in the same
paragraph, the judge also wrote that Microsoft blocked ``the
easiest and most intuitive paths'' for obtaining Netscape's
browser, so that ``few new users had any incentive'' to install it.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, while attacking the government's charge that
Microsoft sought a monopoly in the Web browser market, Microsoft
quoted from the judge's findings as follows: ``The evidence is
insufficient to find that Microsoft's ambition is a future in which
most or all of the content available on the Web would be accessible
only through its own browsing software.'' Microsoft asserted _
citing previous case law that hangs on that conclusion _ that the
conclusion is ``fatal to plaintiff's attempted monopolization
claim.''
</P>
<P>
   But once again, in the same paragraph, the judge wrote: ``The
evidence does, however reveal an intent'' to reduce the number of
Netscape users to a point where they are ``too few'' to be
meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rebutted the judge's finding that the company holds
substantial monopoly power in the market for personal computer
operating systems by repeating the arguments it made in court _ the
very ones that the judge rejected. As an example, Microsoft wrote
that it could not raise or lower output of its operating system at
whim _ a hallmark of a monopolist _ because competitors ``could
readily expand their output to meet the entire demand.''
</P>
<P>
   But the judge found that the niche operating systems Microsoft
cited have been unable to convince more than a handful of software
companies to write programs for their systems _ a fact, the judge
noted, that allows Microsoft to maintain its dominance.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft filing, antitrust experts say, is partly intended
to give Jackson reason to consider a milder legal judgment against
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Before this judge, Microsoft ``may be trying for a modest defeat
instead of a rout,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at the
George Washington University law school. ``They have little hope of
turning this judge around, but they do want to steer him away from
accepting the government's case in toto, and thus chip away at the
platform for sweeping remedies against it.''
</P>
<P>
   The filing, these experts say, also strongly suggests the lineof legal argument Microsoft is likely to take if it loses before
Judge Jackson and appeals his ruling. ``This is a preview of
Microsoft's arguments on appeal,'' noted Andrew Gavil, a professor
at the Howard University law school.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and the government are each entitled to file rebuttal
documents with the judge in the coming weeks. And final oral
arguments, summing up the cases both sides have made in their
conclusions of law, are scheduled for Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   After that, assuming the two sides do not reach a settlement,
the judge will issue his verdict.

AYLSWORTH IS CONTENT AT LEHIGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Four years later, everyone Steve Aylsworth bumps
into for the first time asks him the same question.
</P>
<P>
   It usually comes after Aylsworth tells classmates and others he
calls Malibu home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing everyone always says is, `What are you doing
here?' '' Aylsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here'' is Bethlehem, Pa., and Lehigh University, where
Aylsworth is a senior point guard for the Engineers' men's
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Migrating from ``Baywatch'' country to the quiet countryside of
Eastern Pennsylvania hasn't been easy for Aylsworth, a Westlake
High graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'll think, `I can be going to school in San Diego,'
'' Aylsworth said. ``Four years is a long time to be away. I
thought about going to work in New York after I graduate, but I
think I'm going to work in L.A. for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as if Aylsworth threw a dart at a map of the United
States and it landed on Bethlehem. Attending Lehigh is something of
a family tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Steve's father, John, and older brother, Bob, both played
football for the Engineers, John as a wide receiver in the early
'70s and Bob as a quarterback from 1993 to 1995 after transferring
from Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   Steve, a football and basketball star at Westlake, chose Lehigh
over several Ivy League and other East Coast schools.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman, Steve played wide receiver on the football team
and quickly switched over to basketball for the season's final 17
games.
</P>
<P>
   But the rigors of playing two sports _ Aylsworth played in a
handful of basketball games with a football-related
separated-shoulder injury _ and Lehigh's competitive academic
standards were too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I practiced nine months out of the year. I might have taken
two weeks off before the start of spring football. . . . I was just
getting beat up,'' Aylsworth said. ``In high school they encourage
you to play both sports because I really think football gets you
ready for basketball and basketball gets you ready for football.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the college level, everything is so specialized. When I
started playing basketball, I was so far behind everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Aylsworth, a 5-foot-10, 170-pounder, really didn't blossom on
the basketball court until his junior season. Despite starting just
six of 28 games, he led the Patriot League in assists with 107.
</P>
<P>
   As a senior, Aylsworth is again leading the conference in
assists with 76 (5.3 average). He's also averaging almost four
rebounds and six points per game.
</P>
<P>
   Aylsworth, a finance major, was the basketball team's
Scholar-Athlete Award winner the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   And though Lehigh has a composite record of just 22-74 during
his career entering tonight's game at Colgate, Aylsworth won't have
any regrets when he completes his eligibility in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   There have been special moments along the way. Such as last Feb.
27, when the Engineers upset two-time defending champion and 22-5
Navy 53-45 in the opening round of the Patriot League Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made a tough year worth it,'' said Aylsworth, who had a
steady game (seven points, six rebounds and five assists). ``I
didn't go to a school that had a winning tradition and in some ways
it's been tough, but in others it's been very rewarding.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Aylsworth's history of having his biggest games
against Lafayette, Lehigh's archrival.
</P>
<P>
   His career highs in points (31 last Jan. 20), assists (eight on
Jan. 8, 1997) and rebounds (eight on Jan. 8, 1997) were established
against the Leopards. He also scored 29 points as a freshman
against Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   Aylsworth had a similar habit in high school. As a Westlake
sophomore, he scored 32 points, including 16 in the fourth quarter,
against rival Thousand Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was kind of my coming-out game. I always had good games
against Thousand Oaks, too,'' Aylsworth said. ``My brother had a
big game to beat (Lafayette) in double overtime in football one
year. Now everywhere I go I hear `Aylsworth always has big games
against Lafayette.' That's kind of funny.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC freshman point guard Sandy Fletcher has been
pulled from the team by the football program after he encountered
academic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher, who is a free safety-wide receiver on the football
team, joined the basketball team last month to add depth. But the
day before last week's game against UCLA, the basketball team was
informed he would no longer be allowed to play.
</P>
<P>
   He did not suit up for last Wednesday's victory over UCLA.
Fletcher appeared in four games and averaged 1.0 points and 0.5
rebounds.

left to back up starter Brandon Granville.

<P>
   __ Record start If USC (10-5, 3-0) defeats Arizona State on
Thursday at the Sports Arena, the Trojans will have their first 4-0
start since the 1978-79 season, when the Pacific-10 Conference
expanded to 10 teams. USC finished 20-9 that season, which was Bob
Boyd's final year as coach, and finished second in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   __ Best team? USC coach Henry Bibby was asked Tuesday if this
was the best team he has coached in his four years?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year here was probably the best because we had some
fifth-year seniors like (center) David Crouse, but these guys are
learning a lot about each other,'' Bibby said. ``Is this the best
team? It could be. We're one or two pieces away from being a really
good team.''
</P>
<P>
   __ More attention: With a 3-0 start in the Pac-10, the Trojans
are detecting a different attitude surrounding the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed when we got back from the Washington trip
undefeated, a lot of people didn't think we could start like
this,'' forward Sam Clancy said.``And then we got a win over UCLA
and a lot of people are getting really excited now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we're 3-0, we feel like we can play with any team in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Three more steals: USC guard Jeff Trepagnier needs three more
steals to break the school record of 62 set by Derrick Dowell in
1987. Trepagnier is tied for first in the nation in steals per
game(4.3).

COMMUNIST KEEPS JOB IN RUSSIAN PARLIAMENTARY SURPRISE
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The political party most closely associated with Acting
President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly joined forces with the
Communists Tuesday to re-elect the Communist speaker of the Russian
Parliament's lower house.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected maneuver blocked two former prime ministers,
Yevgeny Primakov and Sergei Stepashin, from a chance to lead the
Duma, the lower house of Parliament, and prompted a furious walkout
by more than 100 deputies in protest against what one described as
a ``a cynical backroom deal,'' and another as a ``political
farce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot take part in this pigpen,'' declared Sergei Kovalyov,
a former dissident and liberal deputy for the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The exact motives of Putin, now the leading candidate in the
March 26 presidential elections, were not immediately evident,
except that the maneuver offered him at least the temporary support
of a party, the Communists, which is most likely to oppose his
policies in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
   The acting president, not a member of Parliament, hinted at the
coalition in a speech to legislators earlier in the day. ``For
normal work, we need the biggest possible base of support in the
state Duma,'' he said. ``This is not a political but a purely
pragmatic position.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was apparently put together between Unity, a party
closely linked with Putin, and the Communists in an all-day closed
negotiating session from which all other parliamentary factions
were eventually excluded. With 285 of the 450 votes in the lower
house, the current speaker, Gennadi Seleznyov, was assured easy
re-election, and other candidates withdrew. Seleznyov, a moderate
Communist, has been speaker since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Several party leaders called on their supporters to boycott the
vote, including Primakov, Grigory Yavlinsky, who heads the liberal
Yabloko party, and Sergei Kiriyenko, another former prime minister
and leader of the Union of Right Forces.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov and Yavlinsky said they would refuse to accept any
committee assignments allotted them by what Yavlinsky called the
``aggressive, obedient majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the allotment drawn up the Communists and the Unity party,
together with their respective allies, the Agrarians and the
People's Deputies, the Communists will head nine committees and
Unity, seven. Primakov's Fatherland party was given one
chairmanship, while Yabloko received none. Stepashin, one of those
who stepped down, is associated with Yabloko.
</P>
<P>
   After the walkout, Seleznyov, a former newspaper editor, who two
weeks ago lost a bid to become governor of a region outside Moscow,
dismissed the protesters as a minority of malcontents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   And in a telling shift of political tactics, Boris Berezovsky, a
financier and media magnate elected as deputy from a
poverty-stricken region of the North Caucasus, told reporters
Tuesday that he too was ready for a dialogue with the Communists, a
party he once accused of having ruined the country. ``They are a
real political force,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As several commentators pointed out, the deal between the
Kremlin and the Communists _ unthinkable before Dec. 31, when Boris
Yeltsin resigned as president _ seemed to fly in the face of the
results of parliamentary elections in December that many thought
had given the Kremlin a freer hand to pursue its agenda of economic
reform.
</P>
<P>
   `'People who voted for Unity did not intend to vote for the
Communist Party,'' said Boris Nemtsov, a leader of the Union of
Right Forces. ``They intended to support the current prime
minister.'' Putin, who became acting president upon Yeltsin's
resignation, will serve as prime minister until the March 26
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Yeltsin era, the Russian Parliament was dominated
by a Communist-led majority that frequently obstructed reform
legislation. Thanks largely to Putin's personal popularity, two new
pro-government parties soared ahead in the voting on Dec. 19,
opening the way for a Parliament that could, for the first time,
break the Communists' block on legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, with the Unity party now locked in a formal embrace
with the Communists, the lineup in the lower house looked very
different.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing Tuesday night on a television talk show, Kiriyenko and
Yavlinsky talked of joining Primakov in a new anti-government
opposition. But Kiriyenko said his party _ made up of young
free-market economists _ might still back Putin in presidential
elections. Yavlinsky is already a declared candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Since Yeltsin's unexpected resignation, Russia's political elite
has been lining up behind Putin, whose popularity continues to
soar. But other than the Chechen war, which he vowed to see through
to victory, Putin, a former agent of Russia's security agency, has
no political record, and so far no political program that
distinguishes him from several other Russian political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   By forming an alliance with the Communists, Putin seemed to
point at a new kind of political leadership that put pragmatism
ahead of ideology, or, some say, principle. ``It seems as though
with Yeltsin's exit, the Kremlin is looking to the Communists for
allies,'' Yavlinsky said. ``What we have is a bloc of the
Communists and the unprincipled.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, who has all but withdrawn from the presidential race,
warned that the uncontested nomination Tuesday for the speaker's
job was a dress rehearsal for an uncontested presidential election.
``There are things happening here which we deeply do not like,''
said Primakov, who six months ago was pegged as a leading contender
to succeed Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators Tuesday said the Kremlin, having won popular
backing for its candidate, was trying to provide Russia's next
president with a loyal and predictable Parliament. ``Seleznyov will
be dependent on the Kremlin, and thankful,'' said Masha Lipman,
deputy editor of the news magazine Itogi. ``This makes him a good
figure.''

ABN AMRO SET TO TRIM 10 PERCENT OF WORK FORCE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Dutch banking giant, ABN Amro Holdings NV, said on
Friday that it would eliminate more than 10 percent of its work
force as part of a sweeping reorganization program aimed at cutting
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, the world's sixth largest, also said that it would
upgrade its online banking operation to replace the branches that
would be closed as a result of the cost-cutting move.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization plan calls for the company to dismiss 2,500
of the bank's 24,000 workers over the next five years. The bank
also plans to shut 150 of its 900 branches in the same time period.
The company wants to save $161 million annually by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``ABN Amro is realizing that they need to be particularly
cautious about increasing costs,'' said Mathew Czepliewicz, a
banking analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in London. ``They aren't
certain what threat the Internet poses, but today's announcement
was a pre-emptive step.''
</P>
<P>
   European banks, which are just now beginning to embrace
electronic banking the way banks have in the United States, are
increasingly looking to cut costs by moving customers from using
full-service branches to using automated teller machines and online
banking operations.
</P>
<P>
   Very few European banks have an online platform, Czepliewicz
said.
</P>
<P>
   ABN Amro said that it would invest several hundred million
dollars in its electronic banking overhaul. The enhancements are
likely to include better telephone banking, more sophisticated
automated teller machines and full-service banking over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Rijkman Groenink, head of ABN Amro's European division, said
that the impetus for change came from the need to have ``a more
effective organization to offer competitive prices in the European
market.''
</P>
<P>
   One rival, Deutsche Bank, the largest bank in Europe, announced
last month that it would eliminate 1,200 jobs and would bolster its
Internet banking operation.

SCHOOLS PUT BOUNTY ON TRUANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KARINA BLAND  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Robert Simmons is a kid bounty hunter, tracking down
truant students and bringing them back to school or even into
court, if it comes to that.
</P>
<P>
   He picks up kids playing hooky who are as young as 7 and 8.
Girls who are chronically tardy sometimes turn out to have morning
sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Others tell him they don't come to school because they are bored
or bullied, that they don't have any friends or their parents don't
make them.
</P>
<P>
   Long considered a harmless part of growing up, school offi cials
are going after stray stu dents, mostly because kids who aren't in
school don't do well, and Arizona has one of the highest dropout
rates in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it costs them money. Schools are funded based on
student attendance, typically about $2,500 per child annually.
Simmons' services cost each school less than $2,500 yearly, and
every kid he puts back in class means at least that much.
</P>
<P>
   At Chandler's Andersen Junior High, Simmons meets on this
morning with two eighth-grade girls who cut classes the day before.
They asked a girlfriend to call in an excuse, pretending to be
their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   But Peggy Benes, the attend ance clerk, has been doing this for
18 years, and she knows a fake call when she hears one. &QL; 
GIRLS WENT TO THE MALL &QL; 
The girls, 13 and 14, admit what they did and tell Simmons they
went to a mall with a 17-year-old boy who got arrested there be
cause the car he was driving was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked him and possi bly loved him,'' the 13-year-old
said dramatically. She's known him for a week.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, yeah, they say, the boy hit a car in the school parking
lot when he came to pick them up but told them not to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned my lesson, be lieve me!'' said the 13-year-old
who is grounded at home and _ as ordered by Simmons _ will have to
go to school on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In that class, the girls will learn about state truancy laws,
the importance of education and how learning affects income.
</P>
<P>
   John Hittle, 14, already has been.
</P>
<P>
   He missed nine of the first 21 days of school, and his mother
wasn't happy about it. She called Simmons for help. John was
ordered by a judge to have 30 days of perfect attendance or face
fines, community service and possibly time in juvenile detention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just laziness, I guess,'' John said. ``I didn't want to
get up in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   This is his first year at Ander sen, transferring from Mesa af
ter his parents split up. It's been hard on him.
</P>
<P>
   But John has had perfect at tendance for three months. He went
from failing to better-than-average grades, including a B in math,
his favorite subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know school is important,'' he said, telling about a friend
who hardly ever goes. ``It just disappoints me that he's so lazy. I
tell him, `You have to go to school.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons has been at Andersen since 1996, and the truancy rate
has dropped from 5 to 3 percent. He works for both the Chandler
Unified and Kyrene Elementary school districts, writing 129 tick
ets for truancy last year. Only 19 were for a second offense.
</P>
<P>
   By Arizona law, kids must go to school from the ages of 6 until
16, an archaic upper age limit left from times when kids regu larly
left school and got jobs to help support their families. Stu dents
are truant if they miss one class or an entire day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the reality is we don't give truancy the atten
tion it deserves,'' said Judge Ron Johnson, who presides over the
Chandler Justice Court. TRUANCY COURT Every other Wednesday, he
hears truancy cases. Simmons is there, usually with 15 to 20
wayward students.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't keep kids in school today, the future is dim,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   If they can't make it to class in elementary or junior high
school, he said, they are not going to make it in high school,
where there is even less supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is, when kids are ditching school, they typi
cally are up to no good, he and Simmons agree. They often hang out
with older kids, experiment with alcohol and drugs and van dalize
things.
</P>
<P>
   In his courtroom, the kids often are surprised that they are in
so much trouble. They face fines of $75, community service and
mandated perfect attend ance.
</P>
<P>
   Hard cases end up in juvenile detention. Their parents are
shocked to find out this is their problem, too. Under Arizona law,
they face $150 fines and 30-day jail terms as well as a day in jail
for each day their kid misses school. PARENTS PUT IN JAIL A judge
for 25 years, Johnson has put parents in jail for their kids'
truancy, though not in Chan dler where he has only been on the
bench since March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps some parents realize this isn't just an
opportu nity for children to attend school, it's the law,'' said
Carol Parish, assistant superintendent of the Kyrene district.
</P>
<P>
   In districts without someone like Simmons, the duty most often
falls to assistant principals who deal with discipline. But they
have enough to do with kids on campus, let alone chasing them to
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons is certified by the Arizona Supreme Court to issue
citations for truancy, something assistant principals can't do. So,
his message carries more weight.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has volunteer inter preters for parents who do not speak
English because they often rely on their kids to tell them what's
going on, and one student told his parents he was getting an award
for good work.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Johnson's referrals come from Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not enough Mr. Simmonses to go around,'' John son
said.
</P>
<P>
   Children who are truant come from all kinds of families, said
Simmons, who traces them from housing projects to fancy houses with
red-tile roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Often, parents leave for work before their kids leave for
school, so they can't be sure they go. Some moms and dads just get
tired of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when Simmons knocks on a door, everyone inside _
including Mom _ is still asleep, and it's almost noon. He sees lots
of parents with sub stance-abuse problems.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, kids run when they see him. No matter, said the
former police officer from Ev anston, Ill. He always catches up
with them.

YET ANOTHER EXECUTIVE SET TO LEAVE GM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This story has now been added to the Times business front)  
 (af)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Roy S. Roberts, General Motors' group vice president
for North American vehicle sales, service and marketing, announced
Tuesday that he would soon retire, as the company struggles to
reverse a decline in its share of the United States vehicle market.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who has held his current job for 15 months, set April 1
for his retirement, when he will be 61. GM said that his
replacement, William J. Lovejoy, currently vice president for auto
repair parts and accessories, would be promoted on Feb. 1 to share
Roberts' job during a two-month transition.
</P>
<P>
   Lovejoy and Roberts will represent GM this weekend at the
convention of the National Automobile Dealers Association in
Orlando, Fla. GM is trying to mend fences with dealers, many of
whom are furious about the company's introduction of a
problem-ridden computer system for ordering cars early last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers are also upset about the company's short-lived plan last
autumn to buy up to 10 percent of its dealers and operate them
itself, in competition with the rest of its dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts presided over these moves, but many of the decisions
were made by senior executives before he took his current job in
October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday at the Automotive News World
Congress, an annual industry event, Roberts said the decision to
leave had been voluntary. ``I really wanted to retire last year,
and I was asked to stay on to manage the reorganization,'' he said.
He said that he planned to run a business, but declined to give
details.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts has been the most powerful black executive in the global
auto industry. With his departure, the only black manager in GM's
top five levels is Roderick D. Gillum who is the vice president for
public policy and diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts defended GM's record on encouraging diversity in its
executive ranks, saying the company was hiring more nonwhite
managers below the vice president level.
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, a group founded and led by the Rev.
Jesse Jackson that seeks to promote economic and political
opportunity for all races, has been critical in recent years of the
lack of racial diversity on Wall Street and at auto companies.
</P>
<P>
   Glenda Gill, the deputy director of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition's
Detroit office, said that while the group was ``saddened and
dismayed'' by Roberts' decision to retire, the group was ``hopeful
that the positive relationship established with General Motors will
continue uninterrupted, especially as it relates to diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   GM's market share has been falling since the 1960s, confounding
a succession of GM executives. The company had 31.29 percent of the
United States market in 1997, 29.4 percent in 1998 and 29.45
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives, including Roberts, had predicted early last
year that the market share would rise to at least 30 percent and
possibly 32 percent in 1999 because 1998 results had been depressed
by an eight-week strike that crippled production across North
America.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said Tuesday that he was proud of work he had done in
improving GM's profitability and expected the company to do better
this year as it produces new full-size cars, the Chevrolet Monte
Carlo and Pontiac Bonneville, and full-size sport utility vehicles,
the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and the GMC Yukon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaving here feeling pretty good about what I've put into
the equation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week at the North American International
Auto Show here, Roberts acknowledged that GM had market share
problems but said that changing this would require work by many GM
divisions, not just his marketing staff. ``I'll take my
responsibility and there are other people that will take theirs
also, I'm convinced of that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lovejoy, 59, has won strong reviews from dealers for reducing
the time it takes to fill orders for parts. In a conference call
Tuesday afternoon, Lovejoy said that he had spent 29 years as a
manager at GM's car loans and leasing arm, the General Motors
Acceptance Corp., rising to president in March 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He was transferred to the after-market auto parts job in 1992
after John M. McNamara, a a New York City car dealer, engaged in a
series of complicated financial transactions with the unit that
resulted in more than $400 million in losses for the division.
Lovejoy was cleared by GM of any misconduct, but his transfer was
viewed as a demotion at the time.

NARCS LIE IN WAIT, WATCHING THE NIGHT FOR `CONTRABANDIS TAS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a moonless night on the cactus and scrabble slopes of
Huachuca Peak, just north of the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   High on a ridge, the Arizona National Guard has parked a van and
covered it with black tarp.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, U.S. Customs Agent Marvin Tigert sits with eyes glued to
a video screen. He's watching images transmitted by an automated
scope mounted on a swiveling tripod outside.
</P>
<P>
   He can see most of the San Pedro River Valley below, thanks to
optical gear that turns night into day.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance team members have spent five hours watching for
drug smugglers, but they've seen only cows.
</P>
<P>
   Around midnight, a deer bounds down the mountain. A guardsman
named Guido swings the remote lens around and up, then blurts in
hushed excitement, ``There they are!''
</P>
<P>
   Smugglers loom as pale appari tions on the video monitor. They
are about 300 yards away, de scending single-file toward the
stakeout.
</P>
<P>
   Tigert marvels at the determi nation of the contrabandistas.
These have climbed like moun tain goats, hauling loaded packs in
the night through catclaw and over cliffs. He makes a radio call
for backup, then waits. &QL; 
A ROUTINE MISSION
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, surveillance teams were briefed in an aban doned
building at the Fort Hua chuca Army base.
</P>
<P>
   Tigert, looking over a map of the area, pointed out major
smuggling routes.
</P>
<P>
   There's a place called ``The Hole,'' just east of Naco, where
Mexicans opened fire on U.S. agents. At Ash Canyon, agents ambushed
30 backpackers, com monly known as mules, and seized 1,100 pounds
of pot. There were shootouts along the San Pedro River and up near
Here ford.
</P>
<P>
   All the narcs have these war stories, plus trophy pictures back
at the office to memorialize big busts.
</P>
<P>
   They are like big-game hunt ers, pursuing a prey that some times
shoots back. They thrive on the planning, the excitement, the
capture _ even the sound of bullets ricocheting overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zing! Zing! Some people say they're just shooting to scare
you,'' Tigert says. ``I don't care. There are a few cowboys out
there who want to make a name for themselves by taking one of us
out. They'd have a song writ ten about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tigert took down about 15,000 pounds of pot during the past
year. Most often, the mules ran for cover. But times are chang ing.
The smugglers have better communications gear. They're
trigger-happy. And, in a car chase, they'll smash into an agent's
vehicle and make a run for the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays,'' Tigert says, `` ` Alto' means run like hell. And
the louder you yell it, the faster they run.''A WAITING GAME
</P>
<P>
   Tigert's assignment at Hua chuca Peak grew out of an intelli
gence report: Mexican soldiers were camped on the border in a
corral routinely used by smug glers. Agents found bootprints on the
American side and assumed that the federales were scouts for a
narco-cartel.
</P>
<P>
   National Guard members were posted on opposite ridges over
looking the valley. A truck with a Long-Range Operations Infra-Red
System, or LORIS scope, was stationed to the east. Tigert's crew
would look down from Hua chuca foothills to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Tigert climbed into the four-wheel-drive Pathfinder and pulled a
Steyr AUG machine gun across the seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you don't mind sitting next to my girlfriend,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tigert nodded at a hole in the windshield. A fence post did the
damage when he crashed into barbed wire while chasing a smuggler's
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Tigert followed Arizona 92 south of Sierra Vista, veered onto a
dirt road and flicked off the headlamps. The drug war is fought
mostly at night, and sol diers on both sides are used to working by
feel.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard van was in position, its LORIS scope hum
ming. Even in inky night, the monitor revealed cattle more than
three miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The job is half science, half art. Depth perception is iffy.
Shapes are fuzzy, as if viewed underwa ter. A warm rock may be mis
taken for a man, or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Guardsmen huddled against a frigid wind and joked about spy ing
on 4-Charlie _ a nickname for steers. After mistaking yet another
cow for a smuggler, Tig ert grunted, ``Sneaky bastards, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   He grumbled because Wash ington won't buy him the newest,
brightest night scope on the mar ket, a thing called CYCLOPS that
costs $150,000 and detects a rabbit from five miles off.
</P>
<P>
   The watchers perked up when they spotted two men creeping along
the highway below, but carrying no loads.
</P>
<P>
   A truck pulled into a thicket by the river, but it turned out to
be a Border Patrol agent.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the deer spooked at midnight.MISSING GHOSTS
</P>
<P>
   As Tigert watches the video screen, the figures drop into a
ravine. Bright spots on the moni tor could be humans lying low, or
not. The waiting game goes on for an hour. Nothing moves.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Tigert calls in other agents who have assembled down
the road. They rumble up the hill, grab weapons and start climbing.
</P>
<P>
   The searchers scramble in darkness, not daring to use flash
lights that would make them targets.
</P>
<P>
   On the monitor, they stumble and backtrack to the ravine: No
smugglers, no dope. Nada.
</P>
<P>
   The team traipses back down the mountain. One has cactus needles
in his butt. Another's leg is bloody from a tumble.
</P>
<P>
   A guardsman apologizes for losing sight of the smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Tigert shrugs and lights up a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not your fault, man,'' he says. ``They're clever. You've
got to admire 'em. But now we know they've got a new route.''
</P>
<P>
   One week later, another sur veillance team works the same
location. Seven smugglers are arrested with 936 pounds of mar
ijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The narcs have a new war story to tell.

TEEN BIRTH RATE DIPS, STATE STILL RANKS HIGH

   Fewer teens are having babies, but it's not because more of them
are choosing to have abortions, a Washington, D.C.-based research
center said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Arizona, where the teen pregnancy rate is higher than
the national average, teens reportedly are having sex less often
and using contraceptives more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it's very good news,'' said Jennifer Manlove, senior
research associate for Child Trends, a non-profit research center.
``We see declines among all ages, all races, all states.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings are part of a national downward trend in teen
pregnancy since 1991. Nationally, the rate fell nearly 16 percent
from 1991 through 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That follows a slight increase from 1986, a record low, to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some groups want to claim it's due to abstinence,'' Manlove
said. ``Others want to say contra ceptive use. It's probably some
combination of both.''
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, birth rates for women ages 15 to 19 fell 13.6 per
cent during the same period. But the state's rate of 70 per 1,000
births still was higher than the national rate of 52 per 1,000
births.
</P>
<P>
   Manlove said that it is difficult to pinpoint why Arizona's rate
is higher, although the state's larger Hispanic population may
explain it. The largest proportion of teen births occurs among
Hispanics, she said.
</P>
<P>
   By ranking, Arizona is 31st for teen pregnancies. The lowest
rates are in Vermont at 27 per 1,000 births; New Hampshire, 29;
North Dakota, 30; Maine, 32; and New Jersey, 35.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, at 36 per 1,000 births, tied with Iowa and
Wisconsin for sixth place. Ne braska and Pennsylvania tied for
seventh at 37. Montana, 38, New York, 39, and South Dakota, 40,
rounded out the top 10. &QL;

 McCAUGHEY SEPTUPLETS AT CENTER OF FUND-RAISING STORM  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ The McCaughey septuplets are still 16 years
from voting age, but they're already playing a role in presidential
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the celebrated seven-at-once siblings, Bobbi and
Kenny McCaughey of Carlisle, are opening their home this week to
raise money for the presidential campaign of Republican hopeful
Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   For $250 a person, supporters of the former head of the American
Family Council can spend time with the candidate and the couple in
the home built specifically to house the family that grew from
three to 10 on Nov. 19, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday night, the McCaugheys will sponsor a
$25-per-person fund-raiser for Bauer at a Des Moines hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer has made opposition to abortion a central plank to his
long-shot campaign, which gets its first test in Monday's Iowa
caucuses. When the McCaugheys learned early in Bobbi's pregnancy
that she had seven fetuses in her womb, doctors suggested they
consider selective reduction. That technique would abort some
fetuses so others would have a better chance of living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe,'' Bobbie told NBC shortly after the births, ``the
life of a baby starts at the moment of conception and that if you
consider reducing that pregnancy, then you're killing a human
life.''
</P>
<P>
   For six months, their church and friends kept the McCaugheys'
secret about the impending births. But when the media horde came to
Carlisle, the family turned to the anti-abortion Iowa Family Policy
Center's Marlys Popma to act as their spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Now Popma is national deputy political director for the Bauer
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked Kenny and Bobbi to be involved in the campaign. I
did,'' Popma said. ``The McCaugheys are pretty big local
celebrities. When you do a house party, you want somebody people
would see something in. ... I never did ask if the children are
going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a campaign spokesman said whether the McCaugheys'
septuplets and big sister MiKayla would be home depended on their
schedule. That night a local television station ran a story that
included comments from people describing the event as exploitive.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, columnist Rekha Basu of The Des Moines Register
wrote: ``The McCaugheys, who vowed never to exploit their children,
are allowing the septuplets to be viewed for a $250 donation to
Gary Bauer. Please tell me this is a bad joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Popma said it was not a joke, just a ``misunderstanding by the
media'' that the children were being put on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may actually recommend that the children not be there,'' she
said.

WARNER, A WELL-TRAVELED PASSER, FINDS A COZY SPOT WITH THE RAMS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)  (rk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is it for Kurt Warner. This is his comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure of being the St. Louis Rams' starting quarterback,
the intense practice and preparation for the National Football
Conference championship game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on
Sunday in St. Louis, the quest for Super Bowl XXXIV, no, none of
that makes Warner quiver.
</P>
<P>
   The heat of handling his newfound stardom and filling the role
as the NFL's most valuable player, the leadership required, the
demands now on his time, no problem.
</P>
<P>
   For Kurt Warner, all of this appears amazingly easy. Confronted
with tremendous challenges, tugged from every angle, he firmly
stands. This is not pressure, he insists. This feels so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from being the whipping boy in the Rams' training camp
two seasons ago to these great opportunities,'' Warner said Tuesday
by telephone from St. Louis. ``When I first got with the Rams, I
don't know if all of the coaches and players even knew my name. I
didn't dress for several games my first year. This season in
training camp, I was the backup and the guy that was yelled at,
that couldn't do anything right. It was like I was used as a
go-through to make points to the starting quarterback. Coaches
don't like yelling at the starting quarterback, the leader, all of
the time. It was, `Let's dump it on Kurt, the backup.' I went
through a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Well before then, he went through a football maze.
</P>
<P>
   Warner went from a bright athletic high school career in Cedar
Rapids, Iowa _ he thought he might be better in basketball than
football _ to gaining only interest from Division III schools in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   He signed, finally, at a Division I-AA college, Northern Iowa,
and it was for only three-quarters of a scholarship. He spent a
redshirt year and, thus, five total years at Northern Iowa,
becoming the starting quarterback only as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   After that, five pro teams worked him out (Tampa Bay was among
them) but Green Bay offered the best chance and the most money (a
$5,000 bonus to sign) but they promptly cut him in training camp,
using him, Warner said, only as a ``practice dummy, a camp arm,
pretty much somebody to throw the ball in practices so they could
save the other guys' arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to Cedar Falls he went in the fall of 1994 and worked at
the local Hy-Vee supermarket, ``stocking shelves at night'' and
``throwing footballs during the day to anyone I could find to catch
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He did that for six months and then took a chance with the Iowa
Barnstormers in the Arena Football League. After three years of
that, he took another chance, in NFL Europe, with the Amsterdam
Admirals with the condition that the Admirals could find an NFL
team that was interested. Only the Rams showed true interest.
</P>
<P>
   So, after Amsterdam, Warner two seasons ago was third in line
behind the Rams' starting quarterback Tony Banks. Then this season,
he was the backup to Trent Green. Green wrecked his knee in the
preseason. Warner entered.
</P>
<P>
   And made history.
</P>
<P>
   This season he set eight Rams records, tied one and tied an NFL
record while becoming the 1999 season's passing whiz across the
league. A fanciful, big-play passer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest times in my life have been when I've had to sit
and watch and play behind other quarterbacks,'' Warner said. ``The
hardest was in college waiting for four years to get to play. Here
with the Rams, before Trent was hurt, it was like I was on the
outside looking in. But once I got in, there wasn't one particular
game this season where I thought: `Wow, this is it. I'm comfortable
now.' I played well in college, the Arena League, in NFL Europe,
wherever I got a chance to start. I expected to play well here. I
feel more comfortable being a starter than a backup. That's my
comfort zone. I want to take control and just play football.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this type of atmosphere, I'm more focused, more of a
leader, more in control. All of the great players want the ball in
their hands. It's why I like playing quarterback so much. The
decisions are on me. I don't like leaving my fate in anyone else's
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Few players in any sport have done more with an opportunity than
Warner did this season. He threw 41 touchdown passes and led the
Rams to a league-high 526 points and to a 13-3 record. He followed
that by throwing five touchdown passes against Minnesota last
Sunday in the Rams' 49-37 playoff victory.
</P>
<P>
   He is fortunate that the Rams feature an array of dynamic,
playmaking pass catchers and a stout offensive line that adeptly
protects him. Warner, however, maximizes those ingredients with his
cunning ability to read defenses quickly, with quick
decision-making, a strong arm, accurate passes and aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   How o many NFL teams that could have signed him have
ignored him? Even the Rams left him unprotected in the league's
expansion draft before this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, even here, my teammates had respect for me as a
person but as a player only the defensive guys on our team really
knew about me,'' Warner said. ``They got the chance to go against
me every day on the scout team. The guys on defense were wondering
why I didn't get more of an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, everybody knows: Warner is hot. He is humble. Late in
the Vikings game, he strolled up and down the sideline,
congratulating most of his offensive teammates, thanking them,
talking about goals achieved and goals yet realized.
</P>
<P>
   They all know that Warner and his wife, Brenda, have overcome
hardships. Brenda's parents were killed in a tornado in Mountain
View, Ark., in 1996. And one of his sons, Zachary, now 10, suffered
a brain injury when he was four months old. Kurt Warner's teammates
know their quarterback's story _ from supermarket to one step from
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents taught me respect, honesty and faith in God,''
Warner said. ``I know that family is important and we are teaching
those things to our three children. I've tried to put character at
the forefront of my life. It is how I've prepared myself for what's
happening now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Super Bowl is one game away, and that is really something.
I still don't think anybody can stop our offense, but if anybody
can, I'd guess it would be Tampa Bay. They match up with us. They
are solid everywhere on defense. They're good. But I believe our
offense would have to stop itself. Right now, we're all just in a
good zone.''

 NARCS LIE IN WAIT, WATCHING THE NIGHT FOR `CONTRABANDIS TAS'  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a moonless night on the cactus and scrabble slopes of
Huachuca Peak, just north of the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   High on a ridge, the Arizona National Guard has parked a van and
covered it with black tarp.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, U.S. Customs Agent Marvin Tigert sits with eyes glued to
a video screen. He's watching images transmitted by an automated
scope mounted on a swiveling tripod outside.
</P>
<P>
   He can see most of the San Pedro River Valley below, thanks to
optical gear that turns night into day.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance team members have spent five hours watching for
drug smugglers, but they've seen only cows.
</P>
<P>
   Around midnight, a deer bounds down the mountain. A guardsman
named Guido swings the remote lens around and up, then blurts in
hushed excitement, ``There they are!''
</P>
<P>
   Smugglers loom as pale appari tions on the video monitor. They
are about 300 yards away, de scending single-file toward the
stakeout.
</P>
<P>
   Tigert marvels at the determi nation of the contrabandistas.
These have climbed like moun tain goats, hauling loaded packs in
the night through catclaw and over cliffs. He makes a radio call
for backup, then waits. &QL; 
A ROUTINE MISSION
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, surveillance teams were briefed in an aban doned
building at the Fort Hua chuca Army base.
</P>
<P>
   Tigert, looking over a map of the area, pointed out major
smuggling routes.
</P>
<P>
   There's a place called ``The Hole,'' just east of Naco, where
Mexicans opened fire on U.S. agents. At Ash Canyon, agents ambushed
30 backpackers, com monly known as mules, and seized 1,100 pounds
of pot. There were shootouts along the San Pedro River and up near
Here ford.
</P>
<P>
   All the narcs have these war stories, plus trophy pictures back
at the office to memorialize big busts.
</P>
<P>
   They are like big-game hunt ers, pursuing a prey that some times
shoots back. They thrive on the planning, the excitement, the
capture _ even the sound of bullets ricocheting overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zing! Zing! Some people say they're just shooting to scare
you,'' Tigert says. ``I don't care. There are a few cowboys out
there who want to make a name for themselves by taking one of us
out. They'd have a song writ ten about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tigert took down about 15,000 pounds of pot during the past
year. Most often, the mules ran for cover. But times are chang ing.
The smugglers have better communications gear. They're
trigger-happy. And, in a car chase, they'll smash into an agent's
vehicle and make a run for the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays,'' Tigert says, `` ` Alto' means run like hell. And
the louder you yell it, the faster they run.''A WAITING GAME
</P>
<P>
   Tigert's assignment at Hua chuca Peak grew out of an intelli
gence report: Mexican soldiers were camped on the border in a
corral routinely used by smug glers. Agents found bootprints on the
American side and assumed that the federales were scouts for a
narco-cartel.
</P>
<P>
   National Guard members were posted on opposite ridges over
looking the valley. A truck with a Long-Range Operations Infra-Red
System, or LORIS scope, was stationed to the east. Tigert's crew
would look down from Hua chuca foothills to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Tigert climbed into the four-wheel-drive Pathfinder and pulled a
Steyr AUG machine gun across the seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you don't mind sitting next to my girlfriend,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tigert nodded at a hole in the windshield. A fence post did the
damage when he crashed into barbed wire while chasing a smuggler's
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Tigert followed Arizona 92 south of Sierra Vista, veered onto a
dirt road and flicked off the headlamps. The drug war is fought
mostly at night, and sol diers on both sides are used to working by
feel.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard van was in position, its LORIS scope hum
ming. Even in inky night, the monitor revealed cattle more than
three miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The job is half science, half art. Depth perception is iffy.
Shapes are fuzzy, as if viewed underwa ter. A warm rock may be mis
taken for a man, or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Guardsmen huddled against a frigid wind and joked about spy ing
on 4-Charlie _ a nickname for steers. After mistaking yet another
cow for a smuggler, Tig ert grunted, ``Sneaky bastards, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   He grumbled because Wash ington won't buy him the newest,
brightest night scope on the mar ket, a thing called CYCLOPS that
costs $150,000 and detects a rabbit from five miles off.
</P>
<P>
   The watchers perked up when they spotted two men creeping along
the highway below, but carrying no loads.
</P>
<P>
   A truck pulled into a thicket by the river, but it turned out to
be a Border Patrol agent.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the deer spooked at midnight.MISSING GHOSTS
</P>
<P>
   As Tigert watches the video screen, the figures drop into a
ravine. Bright spots on the moni tor could be humans lying low, or
not. The waiting game goes on for an hour. Nothing moves.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Tigert calls in other agents who have assembled down
the road. They rumble up the hill, grab weapons and start climbing.
</P>
<P>
   The searchers scramble in darkness, not daring to use flash
lights that would make them targets.
</P>
<P>
   On the monitor, they stumble and backtrack to the ravine: No
smugglers, no dope. Nada.
</P>
<P>
   The team traipses back down the mountain. One has cactus needles
in his butt. Another's leg is bloody from a tumble.
</P>
<P>
   A guardsman apologizes for losing sight of the smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Tigert shrugs and lights up a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not your fault, man,'' he says. ``They're clever. You've
got to admire 'em. But now we know they've got a new route.''
</P>
<P>
   One week later, another sur veillance team works the same
location. Seven smugglers are arrested with 936 pounds of mar
ijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The narcs have a new war story to tell.

VICE PRESIDENT REVS UP TO DISPEL STOIC IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERLOO, Iowa _ ``Before we begin,'' an energized Al Gore told
a crowd in the middle-school cafeteria, ``if you all have the time,
I'd like to go around and shake hands with each person here.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven hundred people stood up.
</P>
<P>
   It took 40 minutes. People with cameras snapped pictures of the
vice president with his arms around their children. Those with a
gripe, such as the farmer who hated gambling, had face time. A
hipster with a shaggy beard and a ``Porn Star'' stocking cap
stepped up just to say ``hey.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore had eight tables to go when campaign aides, tapping their
watches, nudged him away. ``I'll get to you folks later,'' he said.
``I'm here for a job interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore in Iowa is a man dressed down and revved up, speaking at
a volume of 10, pumping every hand in the joint, staying late,
slapping backs, lashing out at ``fancy, union-busting law firms,''
saying ``by God'' for effect, flashing his temper and his wit, and
reminding everyone within earshot he's a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the formal, subdued vice president who met with
Iowa Democratic leaders last spring to plan strategy for these
first-in-the-nation caucuses?
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then he was stiff, programmed, didn't seem to have the
energy,'' said former U.S. Rep. Dave Nagle of Waterloo. ``It was
like seeing your kid in the choir: He didn't do great but you were
proud of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he's captain of the football team: focused, ready, excited
about the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? Gore's supporters say Bill Bradley happened.
</P>
<P>
   After the former basketball star and U.S. senator from New
Jersey mounted a surprisingly strong challenge for the Democratic
nomination, Gore was transformed from the methodical ``heir
apparent,'' in Nagle's words, ``to someone who feels free to
formulate his own administration and wage his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in a race now, and he's liking it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his battle in New Hampshire, where opinion polls show
Bradley with a slight edge, the vice president has maintained a
20-point lead over Bradley in Iowa polls.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts credit the Gore campaign's attention to labor and
farm groups _ two elements key to the party base in Iowa. Gore
stresses to small-town crowds that Bradley voted against ethanol
subsidies important to corn growers, and he voted against a bill
providing federal aid to 1993 flood victims. Bradley also has
resisted Gore's proposal for a series of debates on farm policy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, using his own commercials that say he's ``Fighting for
Us,'' is just now beginning to conquer his image as the stoical,
trusting Tonto to Bill Clinton's Lone Ranger. ``He's been living in
the shadow of the presidency,'' said campaign manager Donna
Brazile, and it's a presidency tarnished by scandal at that.
</P>
<P>
   As such, it's not unusual for Gore to speak 30 minutes without
mentioning Clinton by name, referring instead to ``this
administration.'' For example, ``this administration'' has presided
over the ``longest economic expansion in the nation's history,'' he
notes at nearly every campaign appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore's vow to provide every child with health insurance
and preschool, his warnings of urban sprawl, and his $115 billion
plan for ``revolutionary improvements'' in public education subtly
suggest that Clinton, on the really tough fights, wasn't always
tough enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do more than just play defense'' against a
Republican Congress, says Gore, typically clad these days in a blue
denim shirt and tan slacks. ``I believe the presidency is a
day-by-day fight for Americans facing all different kinds of
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight for now is with Bradley, who has proposed sweeping
health-care reform that includes a program of monthly vouchers to
replace Medicaid. Gore argues that would cut benefits to the
nation's neediest.
</P>
<P>
   Battling for the party's left wing, Gore has emphatically said
the Confederate flag over South Carolina's statehouse should come
down, that Gov. George Bush's tax-cut plan is reckless, and that
affirmative action would stay in place under his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he said he would require members of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff to agree to allow gays to serve openly in the
military, then backtracked and said he would not impose such a
litmus test.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has accused Gore of thinking incrementally, of lacking
vision. He notes that Gore has proposed more new spending on the
military than on education, despite the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's chief nemesis, however, may be Al Gore
himself _ or at least the figure lampooned in the media as the
stiffest supporting character this side of Oz's Tin Man.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have not known me,'' he told reporters last month, but
knowing the true Gore remains a challenge for Iowans.
</P>
<P>
   One morning last month, Gore addressed a Jewish breakfast group
using the precise, measured voice of Albert A. Gore Jr., the
senator's son who attended an exclusive boys' school in Washington.
``We must be a facilitator of a process of peace that leads to
security in the Middle East,'' he told the audience.
</P>
<P>
   By afternoon he was just A Gore _ a summertime farm boy who
calls Carthage, Tenn., his home. At a forum for family-farm
activists in Ames, his dialect was more southern (``That's, what,
'bout twenty-five hunnerd hogs?''), his posture more casual, and
his emotion more direct as he criticized Bradley for refusing to
debate him that day on that stage.
</P>
<P>
   One farmer defiantly asked: ``When are the Washington
politicians and the fat cats at the World Trade Organization going
to start listening to us?'' Gore's jaw tightened. ``Well, I'm here.
I'm listening,'' which drew applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I work in Washington, D.C., and, yes, I grew up more
there than on my family's farm,'' barked Gore, now red in the face.
``But I've got a farm today and my heart's in Smith County,
Tennessee...And let me say one other thing...''
</P>
<P>
   But by now, his critic had sat down and hushed up.
</P>
<P>
   An aide whispered to the press, ``Now that's the real Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Some crowds need no convincing. At the United Auto Workers Local
838 in Waterloo, which endorsed Gore last summer, the vice
president recalled the group's struggle in the mid-1980s, and Larry
Goodwin nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, 56, was laid off from Deere and Co. for nearly five
years during the Reagan administration, when the farm crisis
reached its depth and organized labor struggled for political
clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked three part-time jobs, from 7 a.m. to midnight at a
golf course, a gas station and tending bar. And I was making half
the money I made at Deere,'' Goodwin said. ``These last seven
years, you know what? I haven't been laid off once.''
</P>
<P>
   So let Gore stomp and shout a little, he said. ``Mr. Bradley's a
nice guy,'' Goodwin explained with a grin. ``But we don't need
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   And before the pumped-up veep left the union hall, Gore made
sure he shook every hand.
</P>

CAN HOUSING AID EASE STUDENT TRANSIENCE, A CAUSE OF POOR GRADES? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly everyone has an idea for raising student achievement in
inner cities. Experts variously call for smaller classes, paying
urban teachers a bonus, demanding higher standards or offering
private vouchers. But some solutions rest where people have not
been looking: outside school.
</P>
<P>
   To see why, consider Hyde Park Elementary School in Los Angeles.
Few schools have lower scores. Only 10 percent of its fourth
graders test at the national median in reading. In math, only 5
percent do so.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde Park students, evenly split between blacks and Hispanics,
are almost all poor. But this cannot entirely explain their low
scores _ other schools with poor children do better. What marks
Hyde Park is student transiency.
</P>
<P>
   The school has an array of programs, like after-school tutoring,
to improve achievement. There is also an adult mentor group, family
counseling, and medical and mental health services.
</P>
<P>
   But many students came to the school too recently for its
services to make much difference. Hyde Park's test scores include
those of many students it has not had the chance to teach. Of
children enrolled in the fall, only two-thirds typically remain
through spring. Only one-third of those enrolled some time in the
year were present the entire time.
</P>
<P>
   Such instability is not unique. The General Accounting Office
reported in 1994 that 30 percent of children from families earning
less than $10,000 a year had attended at least three schools by
third grade. From families earning $10,000 to $25,000, 20 percent
had been to that many. Their teachers must frequently reorganize
classrooms and review old lessons. With continuity lost, stable
students also suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than trying (and failing) to compensate with extra school
programs, why not attack excessive mobility head-on? One cause is
no mystery: the dearth of affordable housing. Many families
double-up with relatives, moving on when stress becomes too great.
Others fall behind in rent and are evicted, resettling in other
school zones.
</P>
<P>
   Federal guidelines say families should spend only 30 percent of
income on shelter, if resources are to remain for other needs.
Forced to spend more, poor families often raid food budgets to pay
rent. Children then suffer nutritionally, compounding cognitive
problems. According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities,
a Washington research group, 80 percent of working poor families
with children spent more than 30 percent of income on housing in
1995. Nearly half of these spent more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton plans to ask Congress to expand the federal
rent subsidy program to cover 120,000 additional low-income
families. Although Clinton is not presenting this as an education
initiative, such housing programs could actually have a big effect
on student learning _ if they help reduce the transiency of
children whose families cannot otherwise afford stable living
places.
</P>
<P>
   Rental aid, called Section 8 vouchers, is one way to help.
Nonprofit groups also help by building affordable units financed by
tax-free private investments and federal, state, and local
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   An example is West Park apartments, down the street from Hyde
Park Elementary. This 60-unit complex was erected with public money
and then sold to a nonprofit manager. But West Park alone barely
dents the neighborhood's rental crisis.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal housing programs are terribly underfinanced.
Only one-fourth of working poor families receive any federal
housing assistance. In Los Angeles, Section 8 waiting lists are so
long that no new applications are accepted. Hyde Park's principal,
Brenda Rogers, says she often hears parents bemoan their inability
to obtain vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposal would add $690 million a year to
Section 8. But an added $3 billion is needed to cover all working
families with children who spend more than 50 percent of income for
rent.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a lot of money compared with school money now
intended to improve scores of poor (and often mobile) students.
Title I (federal aid to schools with poor children) now costs
nearly $10 billion a year. Most states supplement this with extra
compensatory money. This spending might be less needed if poor
children had stable residences with some quiet space for homework.
They could then remain in the same classrooms long enough to make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Improving academics is not the only reason to subsidize housing
for the working poor. Yet to raise scores, people usually think
only of school reform, forgetting that dollars spent elsewhere
might help. By focusing only on schools, government may waste money
trying to fix academic problems that it could have prevented in the
first place at less expense.

 SCHOOLS PUT BOUNTY ON TRUANTS  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KARINA BLAND  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Robert Simmons is a kid bounty hunter, tracking down
truant students and bringing them back to school or even into
court, if it comes to that.
</P>
<P>
   He picks up kids playing hooky who are as young as 7 and 8.
Girls who are chronically tardy sometimes turn out to have morning
sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Others tell him they don't come to school because they are bored
or bullied, that they don't have any friends or their parents don't
make them.
</P>
<P>
   Long considered a harmless part of growing up, school offi cials
are going after stray stu dents, mostly because kids who aren't in
school don't do well, and Arizona has one of the highest dropout
rates in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it costs them money. Schools are funded based on
student attendance, typically about $2,500 per child annually.
Simmons' services cost each school less than $2,500 yearly, and
every kid he puts back in class means at least that much.
</P>
<P>
   At Chandler's Andersen Junior High, Simmons meets on this
morning with two eighth-grade girls who cut classes the day before.
They asked a girlfriend to call in an excuse, pretending to be
their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   But Peggy Benes, the attend ance clerk, has been doing this for
18 years, and she knows a fake call when she hears one. &QL; 
GIRLS WENT TO THE MALL &QL; 
The girls, 13 and 14, admit what they did and tell Simmons they
went to a mall with a 17-year-old boy who got arrested there be
cause the car he was driving was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked him and possi bly loved him,'' the 13-year-old
said dramatically. She's known him for a week.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, yeah, they say, the boy hit a car in the school parking
lot when he came to pick them up but told them not to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned my lesson, be lieve me!'' said the 13-year-old
who is grounded at home and _ as ordered by Simmons _ will have to
go to school on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In that class, the girls will learn about state truancy laws,
the importance of education and how learning affects income.
</P>
<P>
   John Hittle, 14, already has been.
</P>
<P>
   He missed nine of the first 21 days of school, and his mother
wasn't happy about it. She called Simmons for help. John was
ordered by a judge to have 30 days of perfect attendance or face
fines, community service and possibly time in juvenile detention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just laziness, I guess,'' John said. ``I didn't want to
get up in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   This is his first year at Ander sen, transferring from Mesa af
ter his parents split up. It's been hard on him.
</P>
<P>
   But John has had perfect at tendance for three months. He went
from failing to better-than-average grades, including a B in math,
his favorite subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know school is important,'' he said, telling about a friend
who hardly ever goes. ``It just disappoints me that he's so lazy. I
tell him, `You have to go to school.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons has been at Andersen since 1996, and the truancy rate
has dropped from 5 to 3 percent. He works for both the Chandler
Unified and Kyrene Elementary school districts, writing 129 tick
ets for truancy last year. Only 19 were for a second offense.
</P>
<P>
   By Arizona law, kids must go to school from the ages of 6 until
16, an archaic upper age limit left from times when kids regu larly
left school and got jobs to help support their families. Stu dents
are truant if they miss one class or an entire day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the reality is we don't give truancy the atten
tion it deserves,'' said Judge Ron Johnson, who presides over the
Chandler Justice Court. TRUANCY COURT Every other Wednesday, he
hears truancy cases. Simmons is there, usually with 15 to 20
wayward students.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't keep kids in school today, the future is dim,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   If they can't make it to class in elementary or junior high
school, he said, they are not going to make it in high school,
where there is even less supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is, when kids are ditching school, they typi
cally are up to no good, he and Simmons agree. They often hang out
with older kids, experiment with alcohol and drugs and van dalize
things.
</P>
<P>
   In his courtroom, the kids often are surprised that they are in
so much trouble. They face fines of $75, community service and
mandated perfect attend ance.
</P>
<P>
   Hard cases end up in juvenile detention. Their parents are
shocked to find out this is their problem, too. Under Arizona law,
they face $150 fines and 30-day jail terms as well as a day in jail
for each day their kid misses school. PARENTS PUT IN JAIL A judge
for 25 years, Johnson has put parents in jail for their kids'
truancy, though not in Chan dler where he has only been on the
bench since March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps some parents realize this isn't just an
opportu nity for children to attend school, it's the law,'' said
Carol Parish, assistant superintendent of the Kyrene district.
</P>
<P>
   In districts without someone like Simmons, the duty most often
falls to assistant principals who deal with discipline. But they
have enough to do with kids on campus, let alone chasing them to
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons is certified by the Arizona Supreme Court to issue
citations for truancy, something assistant principals can't do. So,
his message carries more weight.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has volunteer inter preters for parents who do not speak
English because they often rely on their kids to tell them what's
going on, and one student told his parents he was getting an award
for good work.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Johnson's referrals come from Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not enough Mr. Simmonses to go around,'' John son
said.
</P>
<P>
   Children who are truant come from all kinds of families, said
Simmons, who traces them from housing projects to fancy houses with
red-tile roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Often, parents leave for work before their kids leave for
school, so they can't be sure they go. Some moms and dads just get
tired of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when Simmons knocks on a door, everyone inside _
including Mom _ is still asleep, and it's almost noon. He sees lots
of parents with sub stance-abuse problems.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, kids run when they see him. No matter, said the
former police officer from Ev anston, Ill. He always catches up
with them.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ No news was Wood news Tuesday at the Waldorf-Astoria,
where Robert Wood Johnson IV announced that the New York Jets would
remain in a holding pattern on the subjects of the former and
possibly future coach Bill Parcells (until the weekend) and a new
stadium (presumably not until 2008).
</P>
<P>
   But along with four AA batteries, Mr. Woody (I am not sure if he
prefers his intimate tabloid designation or a more formal
appellation, such as did the late Hess) made it very clear that he
is hoping his $635 million toy comes equipped with each. ``The Jets
have never had their own stadium,'' Mr. Woody said, without
mentioning what he might contribute to help them get one. ``They
have been in the Mets stadium and now this, since 1984. Every game
they played for the last 39-plus years has been an away game. They
have never had the home-field advantage, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that right? Then why is it that the new owner, despite
longstanding connections to the Hess family, not to mention the
Johnson &AMP; Johnson family fortune, said that Jets' season tickets
have been ``impossible'' for a longtime fan such as himself to
obtain?
</P>
<P>
   That's because Jets games have been sold out for years, with a
long waiting list of wishful thinkers. These tickets have been
purchased by people presumably rooting for the Jets on the days
Giants Stadium dresses up in green.
</P>
<P>
   Let's make one thing clear, before the mayor of New York begins
his usual act of supplication, and starts whistling in the West
Side wind, bidding taxpayer money against no one. The Jets have not
been without a home-field advantage since Leon Hess moved them
across the Hudson, while continuing to call them the New York Jets.
What they have not had is a home-owner's advantage, the kind of
profit-friendly lease arrangement that Hess never worried about
because his original $250,000 investment had multiplied like an ant
colony over the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
   In a bidding frenzy against Charles Dolan, Mr. Woody emerged as
the so-called winner last week in the Jets sweepstakes, paying
hundreds of millions more than many industry analysts believed the
Jets were worth. ``I think,'' he argued Tuesday, ``it is worth what
I paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was not a very attractive deal, compared to more
recent NFL acquisitions in Washington and Cleveland, which came
with sparkling new stadiums, and all the pricey operational
amenities such as naming rights. Bill Parcells could promise to
coach this team until the Guy in the Glass has a long, white beard,
and the Jets would still require financing and land for a new home
before they would be worth what Mr. Woody paid.
</P>
<P>
   So here we go again, with another case of a very rich guy buying
something terribly inflated and wasting precious little time before
asserting that somewhere doroad, he will need bailing out.
``Eight years from now, they will be playing somewhere else,'' Mr.
Woody said of the Jets, a motion that was hip-hip-hoorayed by Paul
Tagliabue, the NFL commissioner, who rambled on about how a new
facility ``would energize the Jets' fans even more than they are
energized.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, most Jets' fans wouldn't care if the team played
on a landfill in Staten Island, as long as Parcells was still the
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Next season is what fans care about, and rightly so. Politicians
should see the big picture. If I were negotiating for New York, I
would tell Mr. Woody to take a number, and a comfortable seat in
the waiting room. If we find a solution to the housing problems
currently posed by the Yankees and the Mets, maybe we'll get around
to you.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wilpon, the Mets' co-owner, Tuesday threw out the
possibility of Shea Stadium being done over for football, after a
new baseball park rises next door. A fine idea, as long as the Jets
offer to privately finance a healthy portion of the project.
</P>
<P>
   New York shouldn't pay for what it doesn't need. Its economy
seems to have survived quite nicely without a professional football
team and the eight playing dates that come with it. All of Mr.
Woody's Republican donation-making and name-dropping isn't going to
make Christie Whitman or any succeeding New Jersey governor throw
up another football stadium. He has no leverage, so for what
potential benefit other than trophy hunting should the city invest
in a team that deserted it 16 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   That was Hess, of course, but Hess' team is what Mr. Woody has
bought. For $635 million, he gets the track record, the bad stadium
lease and the opportunity to talk Parcells into keeping him company
for another year or two. What a steal.

JOHNSON HAS THE TEAM, NOW FOR THE NEW STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his first hour as the new owner of the New York
Jets, Robert Wood Johnson IV insisted that his team would leave
Giants Stadium after its lease expires in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years from now, they will be playing somewhere else,''
Johnson said Tuesday after National Football League owners voted,
29-0, to approve his $635 million purchase. Atlanta and St. Louis
were not there. ``The Jets have never had their own stadium. Every
game they have played for the last 39-plus years have been away
games.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets left Shea Stadium _ more home to baseball and the
Mets _ in 1984, they moved into a facility built expressly for
football and one with clean rest rooms to please the late owner
Leon Hess. But the Jets' lease is one of the NFL's worst, placing
them at a disadvantage to teams in new, revenue-rich stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have to depart that facility,'' Johnson said of
Giants Stadium. ``This is an area that I think would be very
important ultimately for the Jets.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate prospects for relocation include the West Side
rail yards in Manhattan, a site proposed by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
for a domed football and Olympic stadium, and Shea Stadium, which
Fred Wilpon, the Mets' co-owner, has proposed overhauling for
football when the Mets' new stadium is built.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a design scheme to do a first-class stadium with
luxury suites and everything else you'd need,'' Wilpon said. ``The
mayor is aware of the sketches and likes them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilpon described the plan as an extensive, but not a total
overhaul of the 36-year-old stadium, which would add about 20,000
seats to its existing capacity of 55,575.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the outfield from the press box, you see a
U-shape,'' Wilpon said. ``You'd almost enclose the U and add
seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has suggested building an enclosed football stadium
that would help attract the 2012 Summer Olympics to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Johnson said that he would meet soon with Giuliani, but
``not this week,'' referring to the pressing task of persuading
Bill Parcells to unretire as head coach or naming his successor.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are a cornerstone tenant at the Meadowlands Sports
Complex. The landlord, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition
Authority, cannot afford to lose the Jets, and the main tenants of
Continental Arena, the Nets and Devils, who want new arenas but may
end up under one roof in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   ``If his intention is the development of a stadium after the
lease expires, that's something we'd be interested in being
involved in,'' John Samerjan, a spokesman for the sports authority,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Jets are profitable, Johnson needs a lot of new
revenues to justify paying $635 million. ``Everything is based on
future revenues,'' he said. During the 1999 season, the Jets
generated $39.3 million in gross stadium revenues but paid the
sports authority $4.8 million in rent and visiting teams $12.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Washington Redskins generated gross stadium
revenues of $88.1 million in 1998, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers $65.5
million and the Carolina Panthers $63.5 million, according to
estimates by Michael Ozanian, the statistics editor of Forbes
magazines. All three teams play in new stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who covets similarly sweet cash flows, said he was a
devout football fan who had attended games with the Hess family.
But he never contemplated buying the team until Hess died last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is basically the moment that I had the stars lined up for
me to be able to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In early December, Johnson and Charles F. Dolan, the chairman of
Cablevision, became the two last bidders. Both had to show the
financial ability to afford $500 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the price of entry to buy an NFL team,'' Johnson
said. Although he can evidently afford the acquisition, he said,
``I flinched the whole way'' at the price.
</P>
<P>
   In the final bidding, ownership tilted toward Johnson because
Dolan's business interests _ including cable television systems
serving 3.4 million subscribers, Madison Square Garden, the Knicks
and the Rangers _ concerned NFL owners.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he never perceived an edge because his business
interests did not make owners fret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not confident at all,'' he said. ``The only thing that
gave me ultimate confidence was when John Hess walked into the room
and I saw his hand kind of reaching in my direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, John Hess, an executor of his father's estate,
chose Johnson over Dolan at a meeting of the NFL finance committee.
The handshake came after Johnson raised his bid by $10 million.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When you come from a family of survivors, you've got to look
around the corner constantly. My father left Germany in 1938; he
had many siblings but was only able to get two sisters out. He
masqueraded them as princesses.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, he set up an export-import business in cheese and
poultry. During the '48 war, I remember looking out the window at
the British soldiers in their red berets. My mother's sister in the
United States sent us care packages.
</P>
<P>
   I came to this country by boat, alone, when I was 14, to live
with my aunt and uncle. I was in a cabin with several other boys.
Our first port was Halifax; I was wearing short pants when I saw
snow for the first time. I was shocked to be able to make a phone
call without paying for it; it never occurred to me that the people
on the other end had to pay.
</P>
<P>
   I worked for my aunt and uncle in their gift shop in Danvers,
Mass. I was the first foreigner, and the first Jew, that kids in
the high school had seen. I was an outsider and had to work hard to
become an insider. This is a country that takes outsiders and lets
them become insiders.
</P>
<P>
   I learned my English from John Wayne movies and answered
questions with words like ``yup'' and ``nope.'' My English teacher,
Miss Williams, stayed after school to help me improve my speech. At
the end of my freshman year, I was the only kid who didn't get a
report card. The principal, Cornelius Xavier Dunn, told me it
wasn't fair to grade me because I had only been in the country a
few months. But he said: ``I'll make a deal with you. We'll promote
you to the sophomore class, and if you do well, you can stay.''
I've been doing deals ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Like in college, I became the head of food services for my
fraternity. Let me tell you, waiting tables for a fraternity,
you've got to serve fast. If you dawdle, your life is in danger. On
the other hand, Introl of the kitchen and the fridge on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   My father wanted me to be an engineer _ a real profession, he
said. But I fell in love with economics while at Tufts and accepted
a scholarship to the University of Chicago Business School. I
called Dad _ he was now back in Germany _ and asked for pocket
money. He wanted to know why I had to go to business school.
``You're either born a businessman, or you're not,'' he said. But
he sent the money.
</P>
<P>
   My first full-time job was as a lending officer at the Chase
Manhattan Bank. Then I joined PepsiCo as an assistant treasurer.
When the Nixon administration let exchange rates float, I urged the
brass to liquidate a loan of 80 million German marks. ``Take the
loss now or pay more later,'' I said. I was 29. They followed my
advice, and a year later, I was a big hero. You have got to be
successful early.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I haven't made my share of mistakes. Aramark bought a
trucking company right at the beginning of deregulation. We didn't
understand what we were doing. Later, we said we ``sold'' it, but
in fact, we gave it away, along with a cash prize, like a dowry.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, my fellow managers and I fought a hostile
takeover attempt. We mortgaged our homes; we mortgaged our
children; we mortgaged anything we could find. Today, Aramark is 93
percent owned by employees, and we've created hundreds of
millionaires. Our people sell hot dogs. They do laundry. This is
not a dot-com company. We have real earnings.

STARTING WEDNESDAY: A GLOBAL CAMPAIGN TO PROMOTE THE OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two ways marketers confront crises that threaten to
tarnish the reputations of their brands. One is to frankly address
the problem in advertising, acknowledge shortcomings and pledge
reforms. The other is to pretend the problem never happened and
introduce a warm and fuzzy campaign that hopes to woo consumers
with emotional rather than rational appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Guess which approach the International Olympic Committee is
taking in its first worldwide campaign promoting the Olympics,
coming months after a vote-buying scandal sullied the squeaky-clean
image of the Games?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a hint: The announcer whose voice you'll hear in the
television commercials, narrating footage of athletes hugging, is
the king of touchy-feely Hollywood filmmaking, Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Still wondering? Well, the TV, radio, print and Internet
campaign, scheduled to begin appearing Wednesday, features choir
music and phrases like ``Your spirit ennobles me.''
</P>
<P>
   One final clue: The theme is ``Celebrate humanity,'' not ``We're
sorry we blew it.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it's difficult to imagine that the Olympic committee
or the media companies that are spending billions of dollars for
television and sponsorship rights to the games would endorse the
``mea culpa'' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   And the idea for the campaign _ reminiscent of upbeat Olympic
promotional efforts created in-house by television networks like
CBS and NBC or the work of the sports documentarian Bud Greenspan _
predates the scandal, which was centered on shenanigans in the
selection of Salt Lake City as the site of the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, according to executives of the Olympic committee and
its agency, the TBWA/Chiat/Day unit of TBWA Worldwide, there is no
need for breast-beating because research among consumers around the
world _ and the interest among marketers in becoming Olympic
sponsors after the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia _
indicate no lasting damage to the reputation of the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign is not designed as a response to the events of
last year,'' Michael R. Payne, marketing director for the Olympic
committee, said Tuesday at a news conference in midtown Manhattan
where reporters were offered a preview of the ambitious advertising
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything,'' he added, ``the crisis served to reinforce the
direction we were already focusing on, the values that make the
games ial,'' among which he listed ``the idealism of the
athletes, respect for one another, the balance between body and
mind and fair play.''
</P>
<P>
   One brand marketing expert said he approved of the decision to
ignore the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst possible thing to do,'' said David Aaker, vice
chairman at Prophet Brand Strategy in San Francisco, ``because all
you're doing is calling attention to it.''
</P>
<P>
   To confirm the wisdom of its course, the Olympic committee had
an independent company, Sponsorship Research International, poll
consumers after the scandal broke to gauge the implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were interested to see whether the basic values, the
interest in watching, the interest in the athletes, would be
adversely affected by the crisis,'' said Richard W. Pound, vice
president of the Olympic committee and chairman of its marketing
commission. ``Perversely enough, the interest has increased.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he added, ``we didn't change the scope or the basic
emotional story line'' of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal to ``Celebrate humanity'' is illustrated through
archival footage and photographs of triumphant Olympians like Jesse
Owens, Mary Lou Retton, Greg Louganis and Wilma Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   Aaker gave thumbs-up to that, too, saying: ``The Olympics is all
about prestige and being global, which is why everyone wants to be
associated with it. But it lacks energy and emotion. So by doing
this, they're exactly on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign is not all about the thrill of victory, as ABC
Sports would say; the agony of defeat is also prominent as tales
are retold about athletes like Derek Redmond, whose serious injury
in a race in the 1992 Summer Games forced him to hobble to the
finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories that touch your heart,'' said Lee Clow, chairman
and chief creative officer at TBWA Worldwide, owned by the Omnicom
Group, ``come from more than looking in the record books to see who
won gold, silver, bronze.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in one TV spot, Williams declares: ``Just a reminder. At
the Olympic Games, you don't have to come in first to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Another spot tweaks Nike Inc. for a taunt made in a smart-alecky
campaign by Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, which ran during the 1996 Summer
Olympics. As footage shows a Bulgarian athlete celebrating his
silver medal in weightlifting, Williams says: ``Someone once said
you don't win the silver, you lose the gold. Obviously, they never
won the silver.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial is intended to ``respond with a certain amount of
good humor'' to Nike's paean to winning gold, Pound said, which
``we thought was not appropriate.'' Since 1996, he added, the
Olympic committee has ``built a very strong partnership with
Nike,'' that includes sponsorship ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident we will do very, very well with renewals''
among sponsors, Pound said, in addition to the two that have
already re-signed, Coca-Cola and Visa International.
</P>
<P>
   First-time advertisers are making Olympic deals, too.
Monster.com, the job search Web site owned by TMP Worldwide, signed
agreements with the Salt Lake City Organizing Committee and the
United States Olympic team to become their initial dot-com sponsor
for 2002 and 2004, in the category of ``online career management
services.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic committee's media partners, which include NBC, a
unit of the General Electric Co., and the Time Inc. division of
Time Warner Inc., have agreed to donate commercial time and ad
space to run the campaign, which will continue through the Summer
Games. And plans are already being made for similar campaigns for
2002 and 2004, Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   The executives at the news conference declined to quantify the
value of the time and space. But they described estimates in news
reports of $150 million as possibly low because the campaign will
run in more than 200 countries and appear often in large, expensive
media markets like Europe, Japan and North America.

EDITORIAL: SECURITY COUNCIL STALLING ON IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, Jan. 19: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the past 14 months the world has been in the dark about
whether Saddam Hussein has rebuilt his stocks of biological and
chemical weapons. Last month the United Nations Security Council
passed a resolution aimed at getting international arms inspectors
back inside Iraq. But that goal is now being thwarted by Russia,
France and China, which Tuesday objected to Secretary General Kofi
Annan's able nominee to head the new inspection commission, Rolf
Ekeus.
</P>
<P>
   All three countries are permanent members of the Security
Council. It will be up to Washington to make sure that Ekeus or an
equally firm and credible chief inspector is approved this month.
Richard Holbrooke, America's U.N. representative and council
president for the month of January, has the diplomatic skills to be
the point man in this effort, but he will need the energetic
involvement and support of President Clinton and his secretary of
state, Madeleine Albright. Appointing a qualified inspections chief
would increase pressure on Iraq to readmit U.N. weapons monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and France are the chief obstacles here. Both are putting
narrow commercial interests ahead of their broader international
responsibilities. Instead of working to ensure that council
resolutions are enforced, they are cultivating Baghdad's good will
in the hope that Iraq will reward them with valuable contracts once
sanctions are no longer in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Ekeus served as chief arms inspector for Iraq from 1991 to 1997.
He was widely regarded as both tough and diplomatic in his efforts
to ensure that the disarmament provisions of the peace agreement
that ended the Persian Gulf war were obeyed. That agreement
requires Baghdad to supply complete information on its programs for
making biological, chemical and nuclear weapons as well as
longer-range missiles, and to cooperate in shutting these programs
down.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best efforts of Ekeus and his successor, Richard
Butler, Iraq continued to defy its international obligations,
exploiting every division in the Security Council to stall, evade
and obstruct. The last U.N. inspection team was withdrawn just
before the United States' bombing of Iraq in December 1998. Baghdad
remains intransigent, saying it has no intention of readmitting
U.N. inspectors, although that is the only way it can qualify for
relief from economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Before Ekeus' nomination, Secretary General Annan informally
suggested more than 20 other candidates. All of those willing to be
considered had been turned down by one or another member of the
Security Council, several by countries friendly toward Iraq. As a
result, the original Jan. 16 deadline for naming a commission
chairman has already been missed. Further delay is extremely
dangerous, giving Baghdad additional time to reconstitute its germ
weapons and nerve gas programs, undetected and unmolested,
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, working closely with Washington, must now try to
reunify the Security Council behind its own Iraq resolutions. The
world needs a robust system of international arms inspectors under
tough and unflinching leadership to protect itself from the dangers
posed by Saddam Hussein's diabolical weapons programs. &QL;

U.S. INDICTS ALGERIAN HELD BY CANADA IN BOMB PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Wash.)   (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An Algerian man arrested in a veil of secrecy in
Canada last week was a central figure in a group of Algerian
terrorists suspected of planning a bomb attack, federal prosecutors
in Manhattan charged Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   An indictment unsealed Tuesday night in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan linked the suspect, Mokhtar Haouari, to another Algerian
accused of smuggling bomb parts into the United States near Seattle
and to a Brooklyn man identified as an accomplice of the smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment traces the plot back to 1997, almost two
years earlier than the authorities had said up to this point.
Haouari was also charged with providing false identification
documents to members of the terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   In the most explicit link to others already charged in the plot,
prosecutors said Haouari ordered the Brooklyn man, Abdel Ghani
Meskini, to travel to Seattle in December to meet Ahmed Ressam.
Until Tuesday night, Meskini had been known as Abdel Ghani.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb plot, the authorities have said, was interrupted by
Ressam's arrest as he crossed the Canadian border near Seattle,
trying to bring explosives and bomb components into the United
States. Ressam is suspected of belonging to a gangster-terrorist
group with a base in Montreal, antiterrorism investigators have
said.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari, 31, was arrested in Montreal on Jan. 10 by Canadian
authorities, a law enforcement official said Tuesday night. It is
not known when he was first brought before a judge in Canada. He
was held in Montreal under a warrant seeking his extradition to the
United States, where he will face charges in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Haouari is one of a handful of people they are
most interested in as they try to untangle a plot whose tentacles
have reached from Canada into New York, Boston, Vermont and
Seattle. Despite the latest indictments, however, the outlines of
the alleged plot remain sketchy, and the authorities have not
identified a specific bombing target of the plotters.
</P>
<P>
   It was also not clear Tuesday night whether more arrests were
expected.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major questions for investigators has been who
ordered the plot, which the authorities believe was being carried
out by Algerian Islamic militants affiliated with an organization
known as the Armed Islamic Group, or GIA.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment does not say whether Haouari, who was seeking
political asylum in Canada, was a member of the GIA, or for whom he
may have been working.
</P>
<P>
   But it does place him at the center of activities on two coasts,
which now appear even more coordinated, in what the authorities
believe was an effort to detonate a bomb somewhere in the United
States, perhaps in connection with millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini was also charged in Tuesday night's indictment. His
arrest as an accomplice of Ressam's was first announced in New York
in late December. At the time, the authorities said Meskini, 31,
had traveled to Seattle in mid-December to meet Ressam as he
crossed into the United States with his bomb-making materials. The
government had also accused Meskini of having knowledge of ``a
terrorist network of Algerian nationals,'' which included Ressam,
and that the two had planned to go to Chicago to raise money for
the group.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new details in Tuesday night's indictment were charges
Haouari had directed Meskini's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment said that last November, Meskini made phone
calls from New York to Haouari's business and cellular phones in
Montreal. In December, it said, Haouari requested that Meskini make
his trip to Seattle to assist Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late December, Haouari advised Meskini Ghani to discard
his pager and to change his telephone numbers in the wake of
Ressam's arrest, the indictment said.

DUVAL DOESN'T MIND NUANCES OF PRO-AM STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERMUDA DUNES, Calif. _ David Duval has played in five Bob Hope
Chrysler Classics and has three top-five finishes, including last
year's memorable victory.
</P>
<P>
   But Duval, otherwise known as ``Mr. 59'' in these parts after
shooting his stunning, 13-under-par score in the final round a year
ago, said there is no great secret to playing well in this five-day
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Learn to live with it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Embrace it as much as anything,'' Duval said as he prepared
for today's first round of the $3 million event. The first-place
check is worth $540,000. ``I enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hope tournament, however, isn't for everyone. Some pros stay
away because the first 72 holes are played with four amateur
partners, and that can lead to slow play and occasionally frayed
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, for example, said he knows an amateur will step in his
line as he gets ready to putt. He knows he will be far down the
fairway waiting for his amateur partners to catch up and sometimes
hit over his head.
</P>
<P>
   He knows they will look for errant shots deep in the trees. He
also is aware there might be problems with overeager galleries
anxious to get a closer look at celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that is part is playing in the Hope, and Duval said
he has grown to enjoy it. He certainly has been successful at it,
with more than $728,000 in winnings in five previous appearances
and a scoring average of just over 68 strokes a round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be a normal tournament where there's two or
three pros,'' he said. ``It's going to be slow and we're going to
have to wait. It doesn't bother me or fluster me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy being out here. I get a kick out of the fact that we
as pros are kind of forgotten for the first few days. When they get
to choose between me and Roger Clemens (his playing partner in
today's first round at PGA West), you know they're going after him
to get an autograph. They're not coming after me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a kick out of that. I just think it's a neat event.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval is one of 17 former Hope winners in this week's field.
Among them are Fred Couples (1998), John Cook (1992 and '97), Tom
Kite (1993) and 70- year-old Arnold Palmer, a five-time winner.
</P>
<P>
   The field also includes tour rookies Casey Martin and Gary
Nicklaus, John Daly, Davis Love III and Jesper Parnevik. The pro-am
is loaded as well, with celebrities like Rush Limbaugh (who is
paired with Palmer today at PGA West), Bill Murray and Joe Pesci.
</P>
<P>
   The host course is Bermuda Dunes Country Club, which will be the
site of Sunday's final round. Other courses in the rotation are the
Palmer course at PGA West and Indian Wells and La Quinta Country
Clubs.

MISSOURI COURT REJECTS EFFORTS TO SHARE IN TOBACCO SETTLEMENT
MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ The Missouri Court of Appeals on Tuesday
tossed aside one of the last roadblocks to the state's receiving
its tobacco settlement payments, adding a tone of realism to
lawmakers' debates over how to handle an estimated $6.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The court's Eastern Division ruled 2-1 that Missouri hospitals
and three other groups are not entitled to a share of the state's
settlement with cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Jay Nixon praised the decision, saying that the
more than 50 hospitals involved should press their own lawsuits
against cigarette makers instead of trying to siphon off part of
the state's settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court found that if they want to bring lawsuits, they can
bring them,'' Nixon said. ``But they should not have tried to get
inside our pot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The money is Missouri's share of the $206 billion that the major
U.S. cigarette makers agreed to pay over 25 years to reimburse
states for the cost of treating smoking-related illness.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said Missouri is one of just six states still trying to
clear up legal issues surrounding the settlement. Kansas received
the first payment last year on its share of the settlement, which
is expected to total $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon called on hospitals, which have now been rebuffed twice,
to drop further appeals and let Missouri receive its first-year
payment of $183 million by April.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Coleman, a Kansas City attorney representing the
hospitals, promised that he would appeal the ruling to the Missouri
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   An appeal would delay receipt of the money for months because
the settlement requires the end of litigation before disbursements
begin. The lawsuit already has held up the first payment of $105
million, which sits in an escrow account until all legal action is
finished. Another payment, of $78 million, is scheduled in April.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals panel upheld the St. Louis Circuit Court's ruling
that the hospitals had no right to the proceeds of the state's
lawsuit. It said the hospitals, along with plaintiffs representing
taxpayers, consumers and family members who died of smoking-related
diseases, needed to file their own lawsuits to recover damages.
</P>
<P>
   What hospitals lost in court, however, they are seeking to
obtain from the legislature. The Missouri Hospital Association was
among a long list of health-related industries that on Tuesday
asked a Senate committee for a share of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital groups testified at hearings in November that they
wanted up to $1 billion of the settlement as compensation for
having treated indigent patients.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Steve Ehlmann of St. Charles was incredulous.
The request, he said, seemed a bit cynical, given the hospitals'
legal action against the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're saying you want to claim a portion of the settlement,
but if you lose, you still want the money from the legislature,''
Ehlmann said. ``After you've caused us to spend money on litigation
and you've delayed the state's access to the tobacco money, then
you come here and want us to give the money to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital association is not a party to the lawsuit, but many
of its members are.
</P>
<P>
   Ehlmann's observation came during a hearing by the Senate
Pensions Committee to take testimony on half a dozen
tobacco-related bills.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Pro Tem Ed Quick, a Liberty Democrat, proposed
a constitutional amendment that would ask voters for authority to
spend 60 percent of the money on health-related programs, 20
percent on anti-smoking efforts and 20 percent for an emergency
fund for state government. A companion bill would set up a trust
fund to receive the money once it is available.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Franc Flotron, a St. Louis County Republican, said such
a plan could leave the money in ``Hancock purgatory.'' If the money
stayed in the trust fund, it would not be subject to the Hancock
Amendment, which sets a limit on total state revenue.
</P>
<P>
   If voters reject the ballot proposal, then the money would build
up in the account, but would not be available for the legislature
to spend or refund, Flotron said.
</P>
<P>
   Quick said that if voters rejected the proposal, the account
would allow the money to accrue until another plan could be
submitted to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses testified in support of Quick's plan, urging
senators to use most of the money for health programs. But many of
the programs went far beyond health care. In many cases, the
Pensions Committee heard more about job creation than medical care.
</P>
<P>
   A big push has started to see that the money is used for
life-sciences research, which could boost economic development
efforts in Kansas City and St. Louis, witnesses said. The current
and former chancellors of Washington University talked about how
subsidized research would lead to more high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Civic Counsel of Greater Kansas City also suggested using
tobacco money to boost scientific research. But the group also
urged spending money on early childhood care because good programs
could reduce adult smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Associated Industries of Missouri suggested using the money to
fund a tax-credit for small businesses that provide health
insurance for their employees. Increasing the number of workers who
have health insurance would give health-care providers less
incentive to shift costs to patients insured by large companies,
AIM said.
</P>
<P>
   Even a school nurses' group said its members hoped they would be
included in health-care programs funded by tobacco money. And an
anti-abortion lobbyist said anti-smoking programs should be funded
because cigarettes increase the likelihood of a miscarriage.

GROUPS PLAN POLITICAL STRATEGIES FOR KANSAS SCHOOL BOARD RACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The statewide election for the Kansas Board
of Education usually doesn't attract much attention, let alone
voters.
</P>
<P>
   But this year shapes up to be different, as incumbents and
challengers focus on the board's vote last August on new science
standards that de-emphasize evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Five board seats are up for grabs this year in the Nov. 7
balloting. Four of them are held by board members who voted for the
new science standards.
</P>
<P>
   The election could be a test of Christian conservatives'
political resilience, said Rob Boston, communications director for
Americans United for Separation of Church and State, based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's potentially a bellwether race,'' Boston said. ``Already
you're seeing this little spurt of anti-evolutionism around the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be the highest-profile state board race ever in
Kansas, said Mark Tallman of the Kansas Association of School
Boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything else,'' he said, ``the evolution issue put
the state board in the spotlight.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is mobilizing people to get involved in the
races, but whether that will translate into greater turnout at the
polls is another question, Tallman said.
</P>
<P>
   Groups from the moderate Mainstream Coalition to the
conservative Kansas Republican Assembly are forming plans and
committees to try to get their candidates elected.
</P>
<P>
   David Raffel of Shawnee, Kan., is working to make sure Kansans
don't forget what the board did last summer.
</P>
<P>
   A billboard on northbound Interstate 35 at the Cambridge Circle
exit depicts a backlighted Bible and the words, ``Science textbook
in Kansas public schools. No!!! Vote Aug. 1, 2000.'' The billboard,
aimed at Kansans driving into Kansas City, was put up by Save Our
Schools, a group Raffel started last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Raffel said the evolution controversy inspired him to become
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I have to pay closer attention to the people I'm
voting for on a local level,'' Raffel said.
</P>
<P>
   Raffel, who said his group didn't have many members yet, has
spoken at several state board meetings, vowing to oust conservative
Republicans Linda Holloway of Shawnee, Scott Hill of Abilene, Kan.,
Steve Abrams of Arkansas City, Kan., and Mary Douglass Brown of
Wichita, Kan. None of the four has filed for re-election, although
Brown said Tuesday that she intended to.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only two candidates have stepped forward: Sue Gamble, a
Shawnee Mission Board of Education member, has filed for Holloway's
2nd District seat, and Bruce Wyatt of Salina, Kan., has filed for
Hill's 6th District seat.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway has said she'll decide by March whether she'll seek
re-election. Abrams said he'd announce in the spring, too. Hill
hasn't said publicly whether he will run again.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wagnon, a Topeka, Kan., Democrat who voted in August
against the science standards, said he planned to run for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The filing deadline is June 12. The primary is Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Mainstream Coalition says it wants to form a loose statewide
network of like-minded moderate and liberal organizations so money
isn't wasted on duplicate efforts across Kansas. The coalition's
political action committee, which meets Monday, can endorse and
contribute to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Republican Assembly's first fund-raiser for board
candidates _ the ``I Back the Board'' Reception for the six board
members who voted for the science standards _ is set for Jan. 28 in
Topeka.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups say they're ready to recruit candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit groups can't take direct political action but are
gearing up for educational campaigns. Kansas Citizens for Science,
formed after the board's August vote, plans to conduct workshops
for science teachers, hold events on Charles Darwin's birthday, and
distribute brochures and fliers detailing the changes made in the
science standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition of Kansas will send questionnaires to
candidates and publish their answers in voter guides, which will be
distributed through churches and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Several board members of the Jewish Community Relations
Bureau//American Jewish Committee want to get involved in the
election, and the organization plans to hold candidate forums as
the election nears, Executive Director Marvin Szneler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can educate people about the choices out there,'' Szneler
said. ``We can encourage people to be pro-active, to be vigilant.''
</P>
<P>
   Few national groups have weighed in.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't surprise University of Kansas political scientist
Burdett Loomis. He doesn't expect national groups to send money and
resources to Kansas for the state school board races. After all,
there's a presidential election and a chance for the composition of
Congress to change this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But national groups are watching.
</P>
<P>
   Americans United for Separation of Church and State has followed
situations in other states in which local school board members
tried to inject religion into public schools, Boston said. Voters
traditionally haven't re-elected those members. But the Kansas
state board race will be the first test of this pattern on a
statewide basis, Boston said.
</P>
<P>
   The elections also have caught the attention of People for the
American Way, a liberal watchdog group based in Washington. It's
early in the election cycle for the group to get involved, said
Mary Jean Collins, national field director. But her organization
will be watching to see who the candidates are, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   There will be some high-caliber challengers, said Craig Grant of
the Kansas National Education Association. His union's members _
most of the state's public-school teachers _ will make sure of
that, Grant predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe that we won't have enough folks running
to make it a pretty darned important race,'' Grant said.

 PROJECT ISSUES RAISED AGAIN  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a battle that telescope oppo nents thought they already had
won, and they resent having to fight it again. And they fear that,
in the end, their sweat lodge, prayers and ``talking circles''
won't stand against the mighty Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a picturesque parcel of Montosa Canyon, at the base
of Mount Hopkins south of Tuc son. The Smithsonian wants the site
for a giant telescope array to study quasars, pulsars and super
novas.
</P>
<P>
   Native Americans say the proj ect would destroy the sanctity of
their sweat lodge.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle is the U.S. Forest Service, which ultimately will
decide who gets the canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a popularity contest or who has more money than
someone else,'' John McGee, su pervisor of the Coronado Na tional
Forest, told a group of telescope opponents last week.
</P>
<P>
   McGee, who last August re jected the Smithsonian's original
request to build the array, says that decision is valid, but he had
to consider the second proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Foes fear that the Smithsonian will wield its influence and en
croach on the land they use for purification ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe we're incompati ble in that space,'' said Noel
Cree-Taulabee, a board member for the non-profit group To All Our
Relations, which is leading the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can the Smithsonian build elsewhere, or is our ceremonial
place disrupted forever?''
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Weekes, a senior Smith sonian astrophysicist, said the
Smithsonian has proposed an al ternate site, north of its visitor's
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not nearly as pro tected from the light'' of metro
Tucson, Weekes said. ``What we're detecting is lights, so we need
the darkest site possible, and Montosa Canyon is shielded in all
directions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian has not pro posed building the telescope out
side the forest because, Weekes said, ``as we go farther and
farther away from the base camp, we lose the advantage of
infrastructure _ the road, the power, all the support that the
observatory needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's denial of the Smithsonian's first request re
lieved sweat lodge operator Cayce Boone, a Navajo, who believed it
was final.
</P>
<P>
   But the Forest Service's recon sideration indicates otherwise.
McGee said he has no choice but to evaluate the new request.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision I made last August stands,'' he said. ``But when
I get a proposal, we have to evaluate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service spokeswoman Gail Aschenbrenner said the most
recent proposal includes lowering the profiles of each telescope
dish, building individ ual fencing around them, moving an access
road away from the lodge and eliminating an alter nate site to the
south.
</P>
<P>
   But those changes don't amount to much for opponents, who
maintain their quiet, spiri tual getaway will be disturbed by the
telescope's appearance, whir ring motors and vehicle traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``A win-win to you is a loss to us,'' Ricardo Harding, a member
of To All Our Relations, told McGee.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian, which oper ates an observatory atop Mount
Hopkins, wants to build a $21 mil lion gamma ray telescope 1,000
yards from the sweat lodge. The telescope would have six 34-foot
dishes arranged in a hexagon with a seventh in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The dishes would be used to detect faint blue flashes of light
known as Cherenkov radiation, which is produced when gamma rays
strike the Earth's atmos phere. The Smithsonian main tains that the
telescope won't be visible to surrounding property.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian has argued that it has operated in the area
longer than the sweat lodge has. The observatory opened in 1968;
the lodge about a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Boone, who says his medi cine man grandfather instructed him
to build the lodge, calls that argument spurious. ``We're still
using the ancient religious site of our ancestors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He finds it ironic that the Smithsonian, which works so hard to
preserve Indian artifacts and history, would ignore the wishes of
living Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Chucki Singer, a member of To All Our Relations, said she fears
Forest Service officials are ig noring nature's laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The land is here to use, but if you rip up the land to build a
telescope, that's not natural,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others complained that they should not have to keep fighting the
Smithsonian's application.
</P>
<P>
   ``To our way, it's disrespectful to keep coming back until you
get your way,'' Johnson Jose said. Indian Country Today contrib
uted to this article.

side the forest because, Weekes said, ``as we go farther and
farther away from the base camp, we lose the advantage of
infrastructure _ the road, the power, all the support that the
observatory needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's denial of the Smithsonian's first request re
lieved sweat lodge operator Cayce Boone, a Navajo, who believed it
was final.
</P>
<P>
   But the Forest Service's recon sideration indicates otherwise.
McGee said he has no choice but to evaluate the new request.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision I made last August stands,'' he said. ``But when
I get a proposal, we have to evaluate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service spokeswoman Gail Aschenbrenner said the most
recent proposal includes lowering the profiles of each telescope
dish, building individ ual fencing around them, moving an access
road away from the lodge and eliminating an alter nate site to the
south.
</P>
<P>
   But those changes don't amount to much for opponents, who
maintain their quiet, spiri tual getaway will be disturbed by the
telescope's appearance, whir ring motors and vehicle traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``A win-win to you is a loss to us,'' Ricardo Harding, a member
of To All Our Relations, told McGee.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian, which oper ates an observatory atop Mount
Hopkins, wants to build a $21 mil lion gamma ray telescope 1,000
yards from the sweat lodge. The telescope would have six 34-foot
dishes arranged in a hexagon with a seventh in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The dishes would be used to detect faint blue flashes of light
known as Cherenkov radiation, which is produced when gamma rays
strike the Earth's atmos phere. The Smithsonian main tains that the
telescope won't be visible to surrounding property.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian has argued that it has operated in the area
longer than the sweat lodge has. The observatory opened in 1968;
the lodge about a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Boone, who says his medi cine man grandfather instructed him
to build the lodge, calls that argument spurious. ``We're still
using the ancient religious site of our ancestors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He finds it ironic that the Smithsonian, which works so hard to
preserve Indian artifacts and history, would ignore the wishes of
living Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Chucki Singer, a member of To All Our Relations, said she fears
Forest Service officials are ig noring nature's laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The land is here to use, but if you rip up the land to build a
telescope, that's not natural,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others complained that they should not have to keep fighting the
Smithsonian's application.
</P>
<P>
   ``To our way, it's disrespectful to keep coming back until you
get your way,'' Johnson Jose said. Indian Country Today contrib

UCLA IN MUST-WIN SITUATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No one is sure how UCLA will play Thursday against
No. 2 Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   As poorly as it did against USC? As well as it did against North
Carolina? Or in some impassioned yet imprecise purgatory?
</P>
<P>
   But there's no denying the stakes: The Bruins (10-4, 1-2) must
win to keep their Pac-10 championship hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
   A loss drops them three games behind Arizona (15-2, 4-0) with a
Feb. 19 date in Tucson looming. What's more, the Wildcats already
swept the Bay Area schools (Cal and Stanford), an accomplishment
the Bruins will have difficulty duplicating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to win (Thursday) if we're going to stay in the title
picture,'' UCLA senior Sean Farnham said. ``If we drop three back
in the first half (of league play), we'll be digging ourselves a
large hole.''
</P>
<P>
   If past is prologue, the game will be decided in the final
minute. The Bruins won seven of 10 in Pauley in the 1990s, but a
mere 21 points separated the teams. In fact, UCLA has not beaten
Arizona by double digits at home in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the most telling statistic of all is this: The winner of the
UCLA-Arizona game in Pauley has won the conference championship 11
of the last 14 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to compete for the Pac-10, then we have to beat
Arizona and we have to defend our homecourt,'' junior Rico Hines
said. ``This is a must-win game.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's challenge is avoiding the temptation of tempo. Depleted
by injuries and attrition, the Wildcats have just seven scholarship
players and seem vulnerable to pressure defense, fast breaks and
fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, as always, love to run. But they have played best
this season when using tempo-killing defenses like a 3-2 zone or
sagging man-to-man. The closer big men Dan Gadzuric and Jerome
Moiso are to the basket, the better UCLA's chances. It worked
against DePaul, it worked against Purdue and it worked against
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to keep our two 7-footers in the game and out of foul
trouble, it makes sense to have them as the last line of defense
protecting the basket,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``The
(zone) and the (sagging) man-to-man accomplish the same thing: They
force people to shoot over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona leads the Pac-10 in 3-point shooting (37.3 percent), but
with speedy freshman guards Jason Gardner and Gilbert Arenas, the
Wildcats prefer fast breaks to half-court grinders. They struggled
against Washington and Washington State last weekend, and both
teams made Arizona play slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can tire Arizona,'' said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery, who lost to the Wildcats two weeks ago. ``Over the
course of an 18-game (league) season, it's possible they could get
worn down. But in any given game, they're used to playing big
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA needs to do what it does best.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rush update: UCLA forwarded the JaRon Rush investigation to
the NCAA last week, but school officials don't expect a decision
until late this week at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Once the NCAA rules on the case, the Bruins have the right to _
and are expected to _ appeal. That process could take another week
or two.

 GIULIANI REBUKES GOP FOR BID TO KEEP McCAIN OFF BALLOT   By CLIFFORD J. LEVY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani rebuked New York's Republican
State Committee Tuesday for trying to knock Sen. John McCain off
the presidential primary ballot in roughly half of the state's
Congressional districts, risking a new rift with party leaders he
had otherwise been courting in his expected run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is supporting Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in the
presidential race, as is the state party. But he said he had long
opposed efforts to use the state's famously cumbersome ballot laws
to fend off insurgents, describing what he said was the value of
primaries in battle-hardening the front-runner and showcasing the
party's principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primaries should be open, whether you like the people who
are going to be in it or not,'' Giuliani told reporters at City
Hall. ``It gives a chance for the party to really demonstrate what
it's all about. I think it would be a very, very good contest
between Senator McCain and Governor Bush. I think Governor Bush
would ultimately win, and I think it would strengthen him in his
ability to carry the state in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani did not specifically refer to Gov. George E. Pataki,
who approved of the petition challenges, or other state Republican
Party leaders. The mayor made his comments as lawyers for the
Republican State Committee filed challenges to McCain's nominating
petitions in 16 of the state's 31 Congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   In adding his voice to the longstanding criticism of the primary
system in New York, Giuliani is likely to complicate his relations
with the state party, which have been improving in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate race is expected to be close, and Giuliani could face
difficulties if he does not have the spirited backing of party
cadres in Republican strongholds in the suburbs and upstate, which
he has sought to cultivate in the last year. These are the same
officials who have lined up behind Bush, spearheading his petition
drives and running as his delegates to the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mayor is known for being outspoken, and some party
officials responded to his remarks Tuesday by saying that while
they were not pleased, Giuliani was still their candidate against
the prospective Democratic nominee, Hillary Rodham Clinton. They
also suggested that Giuliani's attack on the system could bolster
his reputation for independence, which could help him with
Democrats and unaffiliated voters, not to mention McCain
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is suing in U.S. District court to gain a ballot
spot across the state in the March 7 primary, said once again
Tuesday that the party was using communist tactics to ensure a
victory for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican contender, Steve Forbes, whom the state party
considers less of a threat to Bush, spent $750,000 on lawyers and
petition gatherers in New York and is expected to be on the ballot
across the state. The party is not challenging his petitions. Three
others _ Gary L. Bauer, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch and Alan Keyes _ have
withdrawn from the New York primary because the rules are too
daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Allen, a spokesman for the state party, declined to comment
on Giuliani's remarks. But the party issued a long statement
calling McCain a hypocrite, pointing out that he twice brought
petition challenges against weaker candidates when he ran for
re-election to the Senate from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator John McCain did not hesitate to use the ballot access
provisions of Arizona law,'' the party's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's press office did not respond to three requests for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who is a friend of both Bush and McCain, has
repeatedly feuded with the state party since he endorsed the
incumbent, Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat, for governor in 1994 over
his challenger, Pataki, who won.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the schism began to heal last summer after Pataki
persuaded Rep. Rick A. Lazio of Long Island to abandon plans to
force a Republican primary against Giuliani in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Giuliani said that while he would not have necessarily
wanted a Senate primary, he would not have resorted to using the
ballot laws to clear the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody welcomes a primary,'' the mayor said. ``Even when it's
good for you, you don't realize it at the time. You only find out
later when you won the election that it actually helped you win.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, when he first ran for mayor, Giuliani unsuccessfully
challenged the petitions of Ronald S. Lauder, who entered the
Republican primary, and then, after he lost to Giuliani, ran on the
Conservative Party line in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   After Giuliani lost the general election to the Democratic
nominee, David N. Dinkins, he questioned whether the expensive
primary challenge by Lauder was one factor in his defeat. Giuliani
did not face a primary in 1993, when he won his first term, or in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Under the complex system, campaign organizations are required to
collect signatures in all 31 districts, with the threshold
depending on the number of registered Republicans in the district.
Candidates can qualify in some districts and not others.
</P>
<P>
   In each district, voters cast ballots for delegates to the
national convention who are pledged to the candidates. The
delegates with the three highest totals win convention spots.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidates are also required to collect
petitions, but their system is relatively easier. Both major
contenders this year, Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, are
expected to be on the ballot statewide.

WITH A PEEK AT SPRING, RANGERS BEAT HURRICANES
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first time in more than two months, the New
York Rangers can call themselves a playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Nov. 11 had the Rangers been one of the top eight
teams in the Eastern Conference. Not until Tuesday night. Valery
Kamensky had a goal and two assists, and Mike Richter did the rest,
making 24 saves as the Rangers held off the Carolina Hurricanes,
3-2, at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The victory avenged a 1-0 loss in Carolina last week and moved
the Rangers past the Hurricanes and into a tie with the Pittsburgh
Penguins for seventh in the conference standings with 44 points.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Rangers' fifth in their last six games,
third in a row, and it improved their record to 17-20-7-3. Two
months ago, the fans were calling for the firing of coach John
Muckler and Neil Smith, the team president and general manager.
Now, the Rangers are in position to earn their first postseason
berth in three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes, still without the unsigned center Keith Primeau,
were playing their second game in two nights, and it showed.
Carolina, on a three-game losing streak, was 5-11-1 over their last
17 games. The Rangers, meanwhile, had won four of their last five
games.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Rangers jumped on the Hurricanes early _ on the
game's first shot.
</P>
<P>
   The goal belonged to Kamensky, who has now scored a goal in each
of the Rangers' last three games. His fourth goal of the season
came two minutes into the contest and was set up by defenseman
Sylvain Lefebvre, who chipped the puck from his own blue line over
Carolina defenseman Marek Malik, just as Kamensky was jumping onto
the ice for a line change.
</P>
<P>
   Lefebvre's heads-up play sent Kamensky in on goaltender Arturs
Irbe for a breakaway. Irbe was no match for Kamensky, who beat the
Hurricanes goaltender from the edge of the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   The one-goal lead lasted until 13:44 of the first period, when
Bates Battaglia tied the score off an assist from Paul Coffey, who
leads all active players in points against the Rangers with 83.
Battaglia took a pass from Coffey, which Radek Dvorak tipped, and
beat Richter with a backhander through the skates.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also went into the first intermission on the power
play, after Kamensky drew a holding penalty on Curtis Leschyshyn
with 18.2 seconds left in the period. The Rangers have been better
on the power play lately, and Kamensky has been one of the reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This time he assisted on Adam Graves' 16th goal of the season,
at 1:07 of the second period, and the Rangers had a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Graves' goal _ he poked in the rebound of a little Kamensky
wrist shot _ was the 263rd he has scored with the Rangers, moving
the left wing _ and acting captain in the injured Brian Leetch's
place _ past Vic Hadfield and into sole possession of fourth on the
Rangers' career scoring list.
</P>
<P>
   At 13:46, the Rangers took a 3-1 lead, about 3 1-2 minutes after
Richter had preserved the 2-1 lead with a phenomenal kick save with
his right leg to rob Andrei Kovalenko.
</P>
<P>
   John MacLean's 10th goal of the season, his third in two games,
and his seventh goal over the last nine games, made it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   This one was set up by Kevin Hatcher, who gobbled up a loose
puck at the left point before jumping into the rush. Hatcher, an
offensive-minded defenseman, made a strong play, carrying the puck
beyond the goal line, then dropping a one-handed pass back to
MacLean just off the left post.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was important because the Hurricanes seized the
momentum late in the period. At 17:33 _ seconds after Irbe stoned
Hatcher's backhand attempt on a 2-on-1 break _ Sami Kapanen scored
his 17th goal of the season to cut the lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Kapanen had originally been trying to pass from the right
circle. Mathieu Schneider blocked the pass, but the puck went right
back to Kapanen. Richter had anticipated the pass and was now
off-balance. As Richter fell backward, Kapanen's shot went off the
goalie's glove and into the net.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be the last goal of the game.

RAYTHEON TURNS DOWNBEAT ON EARNINGS A 3RD TIME
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., R.I., Va.)   (rk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Raytheon Co. shocked Wall Street again Tuesday by lowering
its profit forecast for the third time since September, the latest
sign that the military contractors created by a wave of mergers in
the 1990s are proving difficult to manage.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexington, Mass., company said it now expected earnings for
the fourth quarter of 1999 to be 20 to 25 cents a share, less than
half the analyst consensus of 59 cents. The company also reduced
its profit expectations for all of 1999 and for 2000 to well below
the levels it had forecast in October, when it had last lowered its
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon class B stock plummeted 25 percent, closing at $19 a
share, down $6.375. The shares have lost about three-quarters of
their value since July, with the biggest fall _ 44 percent _ coming
on the day of the last profit warning in October. The first warning
came in September.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon acquired several military businesses, notably those of
the Hughes Electronics Corp. and Texas Instruments, as part of a
consolidation encouraged by the Pentagon that was intended to
adjust the industry to the end of the Cold War. But the company,
which makes the Patriot missile and the Tomahawk cruise missile,
has had trouble integrating and managing its new properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assessment of markets and competition that they would
normally do continuously probably fell by the wayside in this
consolidation process and they lost track of what was happening in
their business,'' said Paul Nisbet, analyst with JSA Research in
Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   What was especially worrisome to some analysts was that the
latest profit shortfall stems not only from problems in the
military business but from delays in producing and shipping
business aircraft. That operation, known as the Raytheon Aircraft
Co. and built around the Beech Aircraft Co. that Raytheon acquired
in 1980, had appeared to be running smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of like a one-two punch for Raytheon,'' said
Loren Thompson, military analyst at the Lexington Institute in
Arlington, Va. ``Back in October, most of the problems were in the
defense area. Now it appears they are having additional problems in
the general aviation unit.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems represent a setback to Daniel P. Burnham, who took
over as Raytheon's chief executive in December 1998 after having
had success running the aerospace business of AlliedSignal.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon, which has eliminated thousands of jobs in the last two
years, seems to be following the pattern set by Lockheed Martin
Corp., which suffered setbacks and earnings disappointments as it
sought to digest acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing Co., another of the Big Three aerospace companies,
also has had difficulties, but mainly in commercial aircraft
manufacturing. Boeing has suffered fewer problems from its
acquisition of McDonnell Douglas and the aerospace unit of Rockwell
International because those companies did not overlap much with
what Boeing was already doing, Nisbet said.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon said it expected earnings per share for 1999 as a whole
to be $1.15 to $1.20, compared with the $1.40 to $1.50 that the
company had given analysts in October, when it last lowered its
forecast. For 2000 the company expects earnings per share of $1.60
to $1.75, down from the $2.10 to $2.25 forecast in October and less
than half the $4 or more that analysts had estimated before then.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the latest setback in 1999 results, the company
said that production and shipment of 19 aircraft were delayed and
that it made accounting adjustments to the results of Raytheon
Aircraft. It also cited a delay in signing a $1.3 billion airborne
radar contract with Britain and higher interest expenses and
banking fees because its credit rating was lowered in November.
</P>
<P>
   The reduced profit expectations for 2000, it said, stem from a
three-month delay in Federal Aviation Administration certification
for a new business jet, a lower outlook for shipments of commuter
aircraft and fewer sales prospects overseas for various missiles,
especially the Patriot.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon said it would restate its earnings for 1997, 1998 and
1999 to reflect new accounting standards on recognizing revenue
from aircraft sales. The company said the restatement would change
revenues less than 1 percent each year and earnings less than 6
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said executives would have no further comment until
results were released next Tuesday. &QL;

N.J. SENATOR PROFITS FROM PRIVATE STOCK INVESTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Sen. Robert Torricelli's $5,000 investment in a
privately held Internet company has grown to a value of $225,000,
even though he promised five years ago to avoid making investments
that are not available to the general public, his aides
acknowledged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But faced with criticism from campaign finance groups, his aides
defended the action, saying that elected officials should be able
to profit from the surging stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The Asbury Park Press reported Sunday that Torricelli, a
Democrat, stood to make an enormous profit from his 1999 investment
in e.Volve Technology Group, a company that was bought later in the
year by a publicly traded Internet company, eVentures Group, which
is based in Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction does not violate the law or the U.S. Senate's
ethics regulations. Torricelli was one of 15 people offered a
chance to buy the stock, but his aides said it did not constitute
any form of preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
   They also defended a separate transaction in which Torricelli
bought shares in a company that sells diet plans on the Internet
and has announced that it plans later this year to offer stock for
public sale, its initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed his mind about participating in IPOs after
consulting with his financial advisers, because the senator knew
that all his investments would be disclosed to the public,'' said
Richard McGrath, his spokesman. ``But there has never been a
conflict of interest. He completely adheres to the Senate ethics
rules. And if he does eventually make a proft, it's because he's
willing to take a big risk.''
</P>
<P>
   But government watchdog groups say that elected officials raise
troubling ethical questions whenever they take advantage of
investment offers that are not available to the public because they
create the perception of preferential treatment and the potential
for conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of transaction creates the potential for the person
doing a big financial favor for an elected official and coming back
later to ask for a payback,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of
Democracy 21, a nonpartisan public policy group. ``They shouldn't
do it,''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said the senator felt comfortable in investing in the
companies, and in reversing his policy of avoiding private
investments, because neither company was involved in any business
concerned with his official duties.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath also indicated that Torricelli's profit was only on
paper so far. He is forbidden to sell the stock in eVentures until
Sept. 21, 2001, and its price could fall by then, McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   During the last decade, several members of Congress have been
harshly criticized for investing in a stock before it was available
to the public. When he was in the Senate, Alfonse M. D'Amato of New
York, and Rep. Tom Foley of Washington state, who was speaker of
the House, both profited from such deals.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli's two stock purchases last year are the latest in a
series of investments and fund-raising entanglements that have
placed his financial dealings under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   He made his pledge to avoid participating in such offerings in
1994, after he was heavily criticized for a $144,000 profit from a
private purchase of stock in a New Jersey bank. At the time, he
promised to avoid such offers in the future and to put his entire
portfolio in a blind trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``My integrity is worth more than profits,'' he said at the
time.

U.S. BREAKS UP DELIVERY RING OFFERING DOOR-TO-DOOR COCAINE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Tuesday that
they had broken up an extensive home-delivery cocaine ring whose
customers included lawyers, business executives and other
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The ring, run most recently out of an apartment in Queens, used
more than 100 cellular phones, pagers and six livery cars to take
orders and deliver the illegal drug at prices of $25 to $150,
according to an indictment filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   There were hundreds of buyers in apartments in Manhattan and in
restaurants and bars throughout the city, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the number of customers and frequency of deliveries,
the case was the largest ever brought by the Drug Enforcement
Administration involving a home-delivery cocaine organization, a
federal prosecutor, Marc L. Mukasey, said last week during a bail
hearing for a defendant who had been arrested earlier. But at the
time, the authorities did not announce the breakup of the ring, or
issue any indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Ten people _ eight of them drivers who made the deliveries, the
government said _ were charged with conspiracy to distribute
cocaine. Four have been arrested, including the two men described
as leaders of the organization. The two, Jose Fernandez and Rafael
Felipe, were arrested on Jan. 6 and held without bond.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Magistrate Judge Sharon E. Grubin ordered two other
defendants detained. The prosecutor, Mukasey, told her that some of
the other defendants were believed to be in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charged that the delivery service was run out of
an apartment in the College Point neighborhood of Queens, which the
DEA raided on Jan. 6. Fernandez and Felipe were arrested in the
raid. Mukasey said in court Tuesday that the operation made as much
as $11,000 in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   Agents also seized a notebook that contained the names and phone
numbers of suspected customers, the authorities said, but no
customers are known to have been charged.
</P>
<P>
   One customer who was reached by phone said he had learned about
the service from a friend and had used it ``more than a few times''
over the past year. He would only speak on the condition of
anonymity and said that the service was ``very erratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Fernandez and Felipe both said Tuesday that their
clients would plead not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez's lawyer, Vincent D. Scala, said that to the best of
his knowledge ``there were never any narcotics recovered'' by the
authorities, and his client was ``waiting to see whether or not the
government had proof and evidence to support what they are
alleging.'' The government did not say whether any drugs were found
in the apartment, and a spokesman would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Carl S. Spector, the lawyer for Felipe, said: ``The government's
allegations are quite grandiose. Whether or not they can prove any
of the charges, time can only tell.''
</P>
<P>
   As described in government filings, a typical purchase worked
this way: a customer called one of the organization's pagers, and
Fernandez or another defendant returned the call, often using a
cellular phone registered under a false name.
</P>
<P>
   The service offered three quantities of cocaine: small, about
half a gram, for $25; medium, about a gram, for $50; and large,
about 3 grams, for $150, the indictment said. A delivery person,
posing as a livery driver, carried the order to the customer, the
indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said no legitimate business was done by the drivers.
One customer was overhead on wiretaps asking whether the driver
could, after delivering the cocaine, take him to an address. The
customer was told that the drivers did not do that.

JOHN MORRIS RANKIN, 40, A MASTER CAPE BRETON FIDDLER  
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ John Morris Rankin, a master fiddler and pianist who
helped spark a North American renaissance of Celtic music and
culture, died Jan. 16 in his native Cape Breton Island when his
truck skidded off a twisting coastal highway and plunged into the
icy sea. He was 40.
</P>
<P>
   Rankin's son, Michael, and two of his friends survived the
accident. An investigation is under way to determine whether Rankin
died from drowning or impact injuries.
</P>
<P>
   From a humble start selling tape cassettes from the trunk of a
family car in the late 1980s, Rankin led his family group, the
Rankins, to sell two million records, introducing to a new
generation the joys of Gaelic song and music. After a decade that
included hundreds of concerts around the world, the five Rankin
siblings dissolved the group last summer so they could spend more
time with their families.
</P>
<P>
   Near dawn on Sunday, Rankin was driving his son, Michael, and
two other boys to a hockey game when he swerved his Toyota 4-Runner
to avoid a pile of road salt in the road, police said. As the truck
sailed off a 75-foot high cliff and crashed into a cove, Rankin
shouted to the boys to get out. The boys, unhurt, broke a window
and swam ashore. Michael Rankin, 15, then clawed his way up the
cliff, a precipice so steep that volunteer firemen who retrieved
Rankin's body later said they could only climb it with ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in the tiny, isolated Cape Breton village of Mabou,
Rankin came to the attention of the outside world in 1973 when he
was featured in a Canadian Broadcasting Corp. documentary called
``The Vanishing Cape Breton Fiddler.'' Time proved the title
inaccurate, but the closing scene proved prophetic. In the shot,
John Morris Rankin, then 13, walked down a Mabou back road with the
legendary Cape Breton fiddler, Dan R. MacDonald. Conveying the
human link of musical traditions between the generations,
MacDonald, now deceased, placed his hand on the young fiddler's
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the Gaelic and Highland Scottish traditions
preserved by older people in rural Cape Breton were definitely not
in fashion, and John Morris routinely hid his fiddle on the way to
school.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '80s, Rankin, already a professional musician,
organized the Rankin Family, drawing on the Gaelic singing talents
of three of his sisters, Cookie, Heather and Raylene, and the
guitar and song-writing talents of a brother, Jimmie. They melded
pop rhythms and lyrics with ancient Highland Scottish musical
traditions, cutting their first album, ``The Rankin Family,'' in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of their mother, Kathleen, they managed to sell
close to 100,000 albums independently before signing a multi-album
deal with EMI in 1992. Renamed the Rankins, the group made six more
albums, ending with ``Uprooted'' last year. They won five Juno
Awards, Canada's equivalent of the Grammy.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of 12 children, Rankin was the group's unofficial
bandleader and arranger. A quiet man, he played behind his more
flamboyant siblings on the front line. But when he stepped into the
spotlight, he enchanted audiences with his slow and haunting fiddle
solos.
</P>
<P>
   The Rankins' success drew Cape Breton music into the mainstream,
sparking revived interest in Celtic culture. Exposing modern
Scotland to this sometimes forgotten Scottish settlement on
Canada's eastern fringe, their music prompted many Scots to visit
Cape Breton in the 1990s, seeking traditions that have petered out
at home but have survived in a corner of North America where every
home seems to have a fiddle player and where children learn to
dance as soon as they can walk.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, Rankin is survived by his wife, Sally,
and a daughter, Molly.

U.S. ASKS U.N. TO SETTLE AIRCRAFT NOISE DISPUTE WITH EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States, deadlocked on another trade
dispute with Europe, will ask the United Nations to resolve a
battle over aircraft noise that Washington says has already cost
U.S. companies $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said Tuesday that it would file a
complaint with the International Civil Aviation Organization, a
U.N. specialized agency that sets global aviation standards. It
will seek to force the Europeans to repeal a regulation banning
aircraft powered by engines they deem too loud or polluting. The
appeal follows a breakdown in two-party talks between the United
States and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations, adopted by the European Parliament last year
but suspended pending talks with the United States, are to be
enforced beginning May 4. They would crack down on planes that use
engine mufflers known as ``hush kits.'' The Europeans say the
muffled engines still pollute more than new engines.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the aviation industry have put pressure on the
administration to get the European rule overturned. Companies
including Federal Express, United Technologies and Northwest
Airlines have complained about lost sales and a plunge in the
resale value of older planes after the Europeans adopted the
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The House responded last March with a resolution that would ban
the Concorde, the supersonic showcase of British Airways and Air
France, from landing at U.S. airports. That has not become law, but
the Clinton administration says it shows how the engine dispute
could spiral into a larger trade war unless it is resolved soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to defend our interests now,'' said Commerce Secretary
William Daley in describing why Washington decided to take the case
to the aviation organization. ``We all want more quiet aircraft,''
he said, ``but we are not going to let Europe set the standards
unilaterally.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though the United States and Europe trade more than $300 billion
in goods annually, they often seem more like adversaries than
commercial partners. The two have feuded over steel, farm
subsidies, genetically modified goods, enforcement of trade laws
and a variety of other things. Last year, the Clinton
administration imposed tariffs on Louis Vuitton handbags, pecorino
cheese, Scottish cashmere and other luxury goods because the
European Union would not change its rules for importing bananas.
</P>
<P>
   Tension between the two economic blocs also took center stage at
the Seattle trade meeting a month and a half ago. The inability of
the United States and Europe to agree on an agenda for moving trade
talks forward was one of the main reasons the talks broke down.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft dispute also resonates on both sides of the
Atlantic. The United States maintains that the European rule
focuses narrowly on certain aircraft engines, including many used
on older Boeing 727 and DC-9 jets that are prevalent in American
fleets but not widely used in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The European rule, if enforced, would also demolish the market
for hush kits used to bring older aircraft into compliance with
recent noise regulations, industry experts say. Pratt &AMP; Whitney,
the aircraft engine subsidiary of United Technologies, is a leading
manufacturer of the kits.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department estimates the European rule costs U.S.
companies $2 billion, including $1 billion in lost sales of kits
and $1 billion in diminished market value of older aircraft, some
of which might have otherwise been sold to European airlines.
</P>
<P>
   European officials said the rule protects people who live near
the region's congested urban airports and does not discriminate
against U.S. aircraft.

DAVOS: ALPINE LOOKOUT ON THE WORLD'S ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Starting next week, the World Economic Forum will
gather a small army of international business and political
leaders, including President Clinton, for an annual five days of
private meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But the forum's lofty goal of giving meaning to the contentious
word ``globalization'' is under threat from protesters who would
like to duplicate the disruptions of the recent trade talks in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the forum will travel to Davos, a secluded
Alpine ski town in eastern Switzerland not far from the Austrian
border, which is known more for exclusivity than for public
outreach. The resort, once a sanitarium for wealthy tuberculosis
patients, may seem like an unlikely setting for confrontation over
globalization and world trade.
</P>
<P>
   Its remoteness and frigid winter climate will make it hard for
protesters to gather in force. Still, some seem determined to draw
attention to their views. Protesters were recently prevented from
entering the Geneva headquarters, but they distributed leaflets
declaring their intention to demonstrate on Jan. 29, the day
Clinton will be at Davos.
</P>
<P>
   The president is expected to speak about globalization to
political leaders and more than 1,000 business executives. If the
activists get their way, they will be demonstrating against ``an
economic policy which reinforces the injustices between the north
and the south, the rich and the poor, and worsens the situation of
women,'' a campaigner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss faced demonstrations over trade in May 1998, when
protesters clashed with the police, closing the section of central
Geneva where the World Trade Organization and the U.N. European
headquarters are situated. The police sealed off the area, a
practice that officials in the canton of Grisons, where Davos is
situated, would like to copy. But a Swiss court fined Davos
officials for banning demonstrations during last year's forum.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting is the first major international trade gathering
scheduled since the World Trade Organization's Seattle conference
ended in failure at the beginning of December. Some people said
that the informality and intimacy of the Davos sessions _ which the
World Trade Organization's chief, Mike Moore, and his designated
successor, Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand, are to attend _ would
present a good opportunity to restart the process on trade talks
and globalization.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic forum's managing director, Claude Smadja,
sought to dampen expectations. ``Trade does not have a very
significant place on the agenda,'' he said, ``because with the
present situation and also particularly with the forthcoming U.S.
elections, I don't feel we can make a very strong contribution''
now.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 companies pay an annual membership fee around
$15,000 to attend forum events. In addition, corporate executives
will pay $22,500 to attend, where they will sit in on panels and
hear speeches by experts of one kind or another. Among prominent
executives expected this year are Bill Gates of Microsoft and
Stephen Case of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The World Economic Forum's 30th annual meeting _ called ``New
Beginnings: Making a Difference'' _ is to focus on the future of
globalization, including methods for making the process more
inclusive. Other areas for discussion, Smadja said, will include
advances in information technology and biotechnology, the role of
the United States and its application of power, and methods for
sustaining the economic boom in industrial nations.
</P>
<P>
   Guests will include such heads of state and government as Prime
Minister Tony Blair of Britain, President Ernesto Zedillo of
Mexico, President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, President
Abdurrahman Wahid of Indonesia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of
Malaysia, and President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland. Standing in
for the acting Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, will be Finance
Minister Mikhail Kasyanov.
</P>
<P>
   Also confirmed are the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and
the head of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Economic specialists who will attend include Secretary of the
Treasury Lawrence Summers; Finance Minister Hans Eichel of Germany;
the Bank of France's governor, Jean-Claude Trichet; and a Japanese
vice finance minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi. Also coming from
Washington will be Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; the U.S.
trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky; the national security
adviser, Sandy Berger; Secretary of Commerce William Daley; Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson; and Clinton's economic policy adviser,
Gene Sperling.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: BRANDING COMPETITION IN MARKET FOR INTERNET
BOOKINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the landmark 1967 film ``The Graduate,'' there is a famous
scene at a cocktail party where a helpful older man whispers this
single word of business advice into the ear of the callow,
befuddled young Dustin Hoffman: ``Plastics.'' Remake the movie
today and you'd have to change the line to ``Branding.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the branding game more intense than in Internet
commerce. And the competition is especially rough in online travel
booking, where about three dozen companies, with Expedia.com and
Travelocity.com far out in front, are competing for a share of the
rapidly expanding Internet travel market. Though the online
domestic travel market is currently a minuscule $5 billion out of
about $550 billion spent on travel annually, it is expected to
reach $38 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   By then, after an inevitable shakeout, only a few major brands
will dominate the consumer part of the business, which now accounts
for about 30 percent of online sales, most of them in leisure
travel.
</P>
<P>
   As the overall online travel market grows, however, projections
indicate that business-to-business sales _ which encompass most
corporate travel spending _ will grow to 80 percent of the online
market from the current 70 percent, while business-to-consumer
sales _ of the sort now dominated by Expedia.com and
Travelocity.com _ will decrease to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of creating brand awareness is staggering,'' said
Gadi Maier, the president and chief executive of GetThere.com, an
online travel company that used to be known as Internet Travel
Network before Maier and other top executives took a hard look last
year at the high-stakes playoffs his company was competing in and
said, in effect, we're outta here.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company _ which regards its booking engine
technology as superior to the competitors for the complexities of
corporate travel booking _ chose a new game. With financial backing
from United Airlines, American Express Travel Related Services and
others, the company changed its name, went public last November,
and has begun concentrating instead on licensing its technology to
businesses that will in one way or another repackage and resell the
online product, mostly for business travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've basically outsourced the branding to companies who are
established brand names and have the wherewithal to support those
brands,'' Maier said.
</P>
<P>
   GetThere.com has quietly lined up an impressive roster of
corporate customers, among them American Express, to license its
technology. American Express is about to start offering its clients
a new booking engine from GetThere.com. Since 1998, American
Express, through its American Express Interactive unit, has used
Expedia.com's online booking engine.
</P>
<P>
   An American Express spokeswoman said that it would shortly begin
offering the GetThere.com engine ``side by side'' with the
Expedia.com engine to corporate clients, who can decide whether to
go with the GetThere.com technology.
</P>
<P>
   Maier said that the GetThere.com booking engine and corporate
services, adapted to reflect a specific company's travel policies
and usage, would ultimately become the industry standard for the
complexities of corporate online booking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' he said, ``a lot of business travelers have to
make arrangements with a phone call to the corporate travel
agency.'' That is often frustrating for the employee and
inefficient for the corporation, since most of the booking work is
done, in effect, by hand, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, arranging travel is really a computer
problem,'' he said. ``It's really just a linear program.'' That is
especially true for corporate travel, where technology can keep
track not only of individual employee travel portfolios but also of
bulk discounts, upgrades and other intricate variables. Also,
technology never acts like it is being imposed upon, the way a
travel agent at the end of the phone line can, Maier said.
</P>
<P>
   American Express, for its part, said it would welcome the cost
savings represented by a shift of more of its travel business to
online booking rather than using its travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   Expedia.com contends that it is happy with the way things are
working out _ even though American Express is replacing Expedia.com
altogether in favor of GetThere.com as the booking engine for its
own consumer travel Web site. American Express is planning to
rejuvenate the site (www.americanexpress.com/travel) for a bigger
push into the market now dominated by the Expedia.com and
Travelocity.com brands.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with one-time competitors like GetThere.com sublimating
their brands to focus on a new strategy, Expedia.com cannot resist
noting that its own brand is riding high in the online travel
business, whatever American Express does at the corporate end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are focused on owning and not renting our
customers,'' said Suzi Levine, the Expedia.com product manager. &QL;

SAFETY REIGNS AT YEARLY LAS VEGAS GUN SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM HERMANN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Las Vegas, Nev.) - Wilhelm Bub its stood amid thousands of
gleaming revolvers, rifles and other deadly weapons Tuesday and
addressed the hottest topic at the world's biggest gun show:
</P>
<P>
   Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the safest pistols in the world,'' Bubits, a
Steyr Pistols engineer, said about his newest creation, the M-9
semiautomatic pistol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I design safety right into the heart of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He showed how the M-9 can be disabled by turning a key in the
base of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``See?'' he said triumphantly, noting that he couldn't pull the
trigger or even disassemble the pistol. ``This gun is so safe it's
even approved for sale by Mas sachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the approximately 1,200 booths at the annual Shot Show
displayed many of the most lethal weapons legally available. But at
display after display, this year's main message was safety.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. firearms industry _ having seen what happened to Big
Tobacco _ feels besieged by lawmakers seeking new gun-con trol laws
and public officials threatening to litigate.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the show's safety products seem to be saying more
than just: ``You can no longer shoot this gun.''
</P>
<P>
   They're also pleading: ``Don't sue me!''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine U.S. cities and counties are suing gunmakers,
seeking compensation for the costs of police, emergency, court and
jail services related to illegal or irresponsible firearms use.
</P>
<P>
   None is in Arizona. Last year the Legislature prohibited the
state, counties or cities from suing gun manufacturers except for
defective products.
</P>
<P>
   Still, gunmakers have gotten the point.
</P>
<P>
   Remington is showing off its new EtronX rifle system, which
fires a cartridge electronically instead of by having a firing pin
slam into a primer within a brass case.
</P>
<P>
   The safety advantage, Reming ton spokesman Abe Deffenbaugh said,
is that, ``When you turn and withdraw a safety key on this rifle
the whole electronic firing system is shut down.''

   Several manufacturers, includ ing Heckler &AMP; Koch Inc., are
offering trigger-blocking devices that, once locked, make it impos
sible to activate the weapon's firing pin.
</P>
<P>
   Another booth touts CCL Secu rity Products gun locks. Spokes man
Jim Stafstrom noted that three years ago there were only three
manufacturers showing gun locks at this big trade show.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I've counted 25 companies selling locks,'' he said.
``Does that tell you what is important in the business right now?''
</P>
<P>
   In October, several gun manu facturers including Sturm, Ruger _
based in Prescott _ Smith and Wesson, Colt, Glock and Beretta met
in Washington, D.C., with city representatives on how to improve
safety in their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to work with the mayors on gun safety,'' said Doug
Painter, director of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an
industry association and the sponsor of the Shot Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened at Columbine High School has put a new spot
light on this industry. We are in a climate of litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far from Painter, Scotts dale businessman Tom Loeff, owner
of Advanced Security Systems, was displaying his locked gun cases.
</P>
<P>
   Loeff designed the small pis tol-sized Gun Vault for people who
want to be able to grab a pistol fast but have it remain
untouchable by anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The little metal safe has a hand-sized impression on top. By
moving one's fingers in a set sequence within the impression, a
door swings open to reveal the pistol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the idea for the vault 10 years ago,'' Loeff said. ``But
only recently has it caught on big. Our sales are up 80 percent in
the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safety is what the industry has got to start being about,''
Loeff said. ``Manufacturers know it, the states know it, the public
knows it.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is 2,000 miles due south on Interstate 95 from
Staten Island to Miami Beach, which is far, but not far enough for
a man to escape his past.
</P>
<P>
   That is the story of Chris Paciello. In the last 12 years, this
handsome 28-year-old, bundled in muscle and charm, has embarked on
a journey that has taken him from what the government calls the
gritty ranks of a New York Mafia crew to the glittering nucleus of
southern Florida's pink-martini-with-a-supermodel crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Paciello, who owns a miniature empire of South
Beach night spots, has surrounded himself with starlets, ocean
vistas and a swing-first macho allure. Despite his success, federal
prosecutors say he is nothing but a street tough who fled his
Staten Island neighborhood and never thought that the neighborhood
would yank him back.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Paciello's roots caught up with him. He was
charged in a federal racketeering indictment with killing a Staten
Island woman in 1993 while running with what has been described in
the court papers as a vicious Bonanno crime family robbery crew.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of relaxing in his beachfront manor on San Marino
Drive in Miami Beach, he is confined to house arrest at his
mother's home on Staten Island. He no longer hobnobs with
superstars. He appears in court with his co-defendants _ guys with
nicknames like Gonzo, Little Joey and Fabritz.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which is to begin in September, is so emblematic of
the cross-pollination between celebrity culture and the mob that it
sometimes seems as if the main players are auditioning for their
movie roles.
</P>
<P>
   Paciello appears at court hearings blowing kisses to his
supporters. His former girlfriend, a model, is whisked from the
courthouse in a white limousine. Even the receptionist at the law
firm representing Paciello has a part: she refers all callers to a
publicity agent who has been managing Paciello's image during his
defense.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 18, 1993, prosecutors say, Paciello drove the getaway
car in a robbery that resulted in the death of a Staten Island
woman, Judith Shemtov, 46. Three months earlier, the government
says, Paciello smashed through the window of a bank in the Staten
Island Mall with a sledgehammer and made off with more than
$300,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   From 1987 to 1993, according to other court papers, Paciello
robbed numerous stores, pharmacies and video shops. He took part in
nearly a dozen club and bar brawls, prosecutors say. He earned the
name the Binger, prosecutors said, because of his penchant for
bingeing on mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the government has asserted that Paciello was not ``a
lone player in instances of street thuggery'' but was tied to a
``powerful organized crime syndicate.'' According to the
indictment, he was a member of the Bath Avenue Crew, a group of
young street thugs who grew up along Bath Avenue in Bensonhurst,
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The crew reported to Anthony Spero, the former acting boss of
the Bonanno family, and Joseph Benanti, a Bonanno family soldier,
the indictment said. Six crew members as well as Spero and Benanti
are awaiting trial with Paciello.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most chilling evidence against Paciello comes from a
secretly made tape that was introduced at a detention hearing.
According to a transcript of the tape made in September, two months
before his arrest, he is heard discussing a South Beach nightclub
owner who once worked with him , Gerry Kelly, with an undercover
agent posing as a dishonest cop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always drives drunk, you can arrest him,'' Paciello tells
the agent. Later, his intentions turn darker: ``We got to get him
beat up. I got to get him whacked.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Kelly, who is under 24-hour police protection, said
he was stunned by the tape. ``All of us thought he was just a young
guy who made it big, who was very handsome, who hooked up with the
right people and made it into the celebrity circle,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Paciello has denied the charges against him. His lawyer, Roy
Black, has said that Paciello is a self-created man, a Staten
Island boy reinvented in Miami Beach, who has been accused by the
government because of his fame, not for ties to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Paciello's colleagues in Florida agree.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Paciello was adored in South Beach. He has been featured
in publications like People, Details, and The Wall Street Journal.
He has donated to charities. Last year, he was the host of a gala
for Miami Beach's mayor, Neisen Kasdin. In December, 70 friends
turned up in U.S. District Court in Miami for his bail hearing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Raised in a humble home on a humble street on Staten Island,
Paciello was born Christian Ludwigsen. According to his lawyers, he
has gone by his mother's maiden name since moving to Florida in
1993 because he has ``no meaningful relationship'' with his father,
George Ludwigsen.
</P>
<P>
   Paciello wanted to be a mobster shortly after graduating from
high school, prosecutors said. Around the same time, he appeared on
the fringes of New York City's nightclub scene. He made inroads
into the club world through a man named Michael Caruso, a club
promoter who worked at the Limelight in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the two men opened a nightclub in Miami Beach on a lot
owned by Carlo Vaccarezza, a former driver for John J. Gotti, the
one-time Gambino family boss, according to testimony by Caruso at
the trial of Peter Gatien, the Limelight's owner, who was acquitted
of drug conspiracy charges in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The club was called Risk. Months after it opened, Risk burned
down under suspicious circumstances, federal prosecutors say,
allowing Paciello to collect a $250,000 insurance claim and open a
new club, Liquid, with the better-connected Ingrid Casares, the
heir to a wealthy Cuban family and a friend of celebrities like
Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   With Ms. Casares as his partner, Paciello's credibility and
income skyrocketed. They opened a restaurant called Joia in 1998,
and soon after, another club, the Bar Room. Gossip columnists
linked Paciello to Jennifer Lopez, the actress; Niki Taylor, a
model; and Sofia Vergara, the co-host of a Spanish-language
television show.
</P>
<P>
   But Paciello felt diminished by his success. During his
conversation with the undercover agent, captured on tape four
months ago, he said he had become a weakling in Miami Beach.
According to the transcripts, he talks about putting on his
``costume'' to go ``out trick or treating'' again _ a phrase the
government says is a euphemism for returning to his days as a
robber.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Casares has supported Paciello, saying through Ms.
Grubman, the publicity agent, ``I stand behind Chris 100 percent.''
She and Paciello were days from opening their fourth business, the
West Palm Beach Liquid, when he was indicted on Nov. 28. Days
later, he turned himself in.
</P>
<P>
   Paciello openly acknowledges knowing the members of the Bath
Avenue Crew from his days in New York City, although his lawyers
contend that he never committed a crime with them. Back in U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn for a hearing on Jan. 7, he found
himself reunited with the old gang: Charles and Joseph Calco,
Fabrizio DeFrancisci, Joseph Dellatorre, Anthony Gonzalez and
Thomas Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   He switched between making loose chatter with his buddies and
smiling at Ms. Casares and Ms. Vergara, who had turned up to
support him.

   Irving I. Stone, who helped turn a small family business,
started in 1906, into the world's second-largest maker of greeting
cards, died Jan. 17 at University Hospitals in Cleveland. He was 90
and lived in Beachwood, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Stone began at age 5 by stuffing postcards into envelopes for
his father, Jacob Sapirstein, who set up shop the year after he
arrived from Russia and had his entire inventory stored in the
family living room in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Stone was 9 when his father became seriously ill and the boy, as
a full partner, took charge of all aspects of the business: sales,
deliveries and billings.
</P>
<P>
   At age 12, he assumed the bookkeeping chores at Sapirstein
Greeting Card Co., years later to be confidently renamed American
Greetings Corp. He worked for it through high school and college,
and he and his two younger brothers delivered their cards to stores
in outlying districts and small towns to make the business grow.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, unhappy with the quality of what they were buying
for resale, Stone directed the company to begin designing and
printing its own cards. This gave rise to the American Greetings
Creative Department, which remains one of the biggest art studios
in the United States, with 400 artists and writers producing some
20,000 designs a year.
</P>
<P>
   He served as the department's editor, writer, art director and
manager, taking night courses in art and creative writing to
improve his skills. One of his earliest efforts, ``From Someone Who
Likes to Remember Someone Too Nice to Forget,'' sold more cards
than any other in the company's repertory and remains part of the
line.
</P>
<P>
   Once Stone's early designs were printed, they sold quickly and
led the company to start sales campaigns far beyond Cleveland and
its environs. His innovations helped to transform the industry's
methods of making and distributing its products. Into his 80s, he
had the final say on every card verse and took hundreds of them
home each weekend to pore over.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Cleveland, he attended Case Western Reserve University
and the Cleveland Institute of Art. He was named president of
American Greetings in 1960, succeeding his father, and became
chairman and chief executive in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, Stone held the titles of founder-chairman and
chairman of the executive committee, which he assumed in 1992.
Although no longer active in day-to-day operations, he still went
to the office frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Still based in Cleveland, American Greetings most recently
listed its annual sales as $2.2 billion, with more than 21,000
employees sending its products to 75 countries around the world. It
ranks second after the industry leader, Hallmark. Besides greeting
cards its products now include gift wrapping, tags, seals, ribbons,
party goods, posters, candles, gifts, display fixtures and
nonprescription eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Stone was active in many civic and Jewish organizations. He was
chairman of the Hebrew Academy of Cleveland, a trustee of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies and a vice president of the
American Association for Jewish Education and the American Friends
of Boys Town Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Stone is survived by his wife of 23 years, Helen Sill Stone;
three daughters and a son from his earlier marriage, Hensha S.
Gansbourg, of New York, Myrna S. Tatar, of San Francisco, Judith S.
Weiss, of Cleveland, and Neil, of Idaho; his brother Harry H., of
Cleveland, a company director; a sister, Bernice; 15 grandchildren;
and 34 great-grandchildren. His first wife and the mother of his
children, Beatrice Weider Stone, died 24 years ago.

EDITORIAL: GIULIANI DEFENDS VOTING RIGHTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, Jan. 19: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has broken the shameful silence among top
New York state Republicans about their party's effort to prevent
Sen. John McCain from running statewide against Gov. George W. Bush
in the March 7 presidential primary. As Giuliani noted, a party
that supports open elections ``ends up being a much more active and
growing political party.'' Unfortunately, he does not speak for the
powerful stealth wing of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, the power behind that wing, has sent word
that this primary system works just fine, and asserting that a few
feeble changes in the outrageous qualifying rules amount to real
reform. Meanwhile the state Republican chairman, William Powers,
sits smugly behind the scenes, authorizing legal challenges
intended to keep McCain off the ballot in half of the state's 31
congressional districts. And the supposed beneficiary of this
rigged election, Bush, drifts along obediently, apparently content
to take a tainted victory rather than face a real contest.
</P>
<P>
   The New York mayor's tribute to the advantages of open elections
points up a painful truth for Republican voters in New York state.
If they could have a real primary, the state might be pivotal in
the nominating process. Suppose McCain does handsomely in the New
Hampshire primary on Feb. 1 and then shows staying power in the
next primaries, which include his home state of Arizona. After
those few contests, March 7 arrives like a windstorm with a dozen
primaries including those in Maryland, Ohio, Missouri and
California, as well as New York. Normally, New York would be a big
trophy for any candidate. But since the whole country knows the fix
is in there, a Bush victory will be discounted as a staged event,
producing delegates but no real test of the winner's appeal in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   New York's anachronistic ballot-access rules require candidates
in both parties to gather signatures from registered voters.
Democrats need 5,000 signatures statewide to get on the ballot. The
entire exercise is unnecessary, but at least that number is low
enough that voters will have a chance to vote for their party's
major contenders, Al Gore and Bill Bradley. Because of the
Republicans' more complicated rules, only three of six prominent
candidates tried for a spot on this year's ballots. Bush's
petitions were easily harvested by the state GOP machine. Steve
Forbes had to spend $750,000 to amass the required signatures. To
keep McCain from competing effectively, the state party will
challenge his petitions in 15 to 17 districts.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of Bush's docile endorsement of this flagrant
trickery, McCain has taken his case to federal court. He is
arguing, correctly, that New York voters are being deprived of the
constitutional rights under the First and 14th amendments. The
court should direct that McCain's name appear on the ballots, as it
required the addition of Forbes' name on ballots statewide four
years ago. In years past, the federal courts often stepped in to
prevent the disfranchisement of Southern voters by discriminatory
state laws. Now it is time for the courts to secure the voting
rights of New York Republicans. A simpler solution would be for
Bush to join Giuliani in urging a fair primary with a full ballot
on March 7.

NELSON SHAULIS DIES AT 86; REVOLUTIONIZED VINEYARD PRACTICES
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nelson Shaulis, whose grape-growing experiments in the Finger
Lakes region of New York revolutionized vineyard practices
worldwide, died Saturday in Newark, N.Y. He was 86 and lived in
Geneva, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Before Shaulis retired in 1978 as professor of viticulture, the
science and methods of grape growing, at Cornell University's New
York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, he developed
a vine-training system known as the Geneva Double Curtain. He also
worked at Cornell's Vineyard Laboratory, a station branch in
Fredonia, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Shaulis' trellising concepts ``have been applied in every major
grape-producing region in the world, and served as the knowledge
base that allowed New World winegrowing to emerge as a major factor
in international trade in the last 20 years,'' said Robert Pool,
who succeeded him as chief viticulturist at the experimental
station.
</P>
<P>
   The concepts have been most widely applied in the United States
_ especially California _ Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Shaulis also worked with Cornell's department of agricultural
engineering to develop the mechanical grape harvester, especially
for use with the Double Curtain. Today, harvesters modeled after
the Cornell machine bring in grapes everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in modern viticulture consider Shaulis the father of
canopy management, a term used in the industry for a spectrum of
techniques to control vine diseases and improve grape yields and
wine quality. The canopy consists of all vine growth above the
soil, including trunks, canes, stems, leaves and fruit. The core
principle of leading-edge management is to broaden the exposure of
leaves and grapes on trellises to the sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   While working with vines that produce Concord grapes, a red
variety that once dominated upstate winegrowing and is still most
familiar to consumers in sweet kosher wines, Shaulis observed that
excessive shade inside canopies reduced grape yield and ripeness.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered that by separating one thick canopy into two less
thick ones, more sunlight (and thus more photosynthesis) could be
introduced on leaf surfaces, improving vine maturation and
increasing not only grape yields, sometimes by 90 percent, but also
quality.
</P>
<P>
   The Double Curtain technique was first tried at Geneva in 1960,
and four years later field trials with growers began. Although
Concord belongs to a species of native North American grape known
as labrusca, Shaulis' discovery was quickly applied to vinifera
grapes, the classical European variety that produces today's
premium wines. Bordeaux was quick to see its merits.
</P>
<P>
   Late-summer visitors to grape farms who look straight down a
Geneva Double Curtain row will see that the vine wood and luxuriant
vegetation are trained both to the left and right over wires,
supported by cross arms that are four feet apart and five or six
feet above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly nothing escaped Shaulis' investigations. He looked,
too, into proper siting of vineyards, the physiology of grapevines,
mineral nutrition, root stocks and microclimates.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every properly educated and trained winegrower in the
English-speaking world has a copy of ``Sunlight Into Wine: A
Handbook of Wine Grape Canopy Management,'' a 1991 book whose
principal author is Richard Smart, a renowned Australian
viticulturist. Smart was a student of Shaulis, and the book's
content owes a significant debt to Shaulis' findings.
</P>
<P>
   Shaulis received a bachelor's degree in horticulture in 1935 and
a master's degree in agronomy in 1937, both from Pennsylvania State
University. He received his doctorate in soils from Cornell in
1941.
</P>
<P>
   Shaulis' wife of 55 years, Lillian, died in 1996. He is survived
by two daughters, Catherine Shaulis-Santomartino of Scotia, N.Y.,
and Margaret Harty of Sodus, N.Y.; three grandchildren; and three
great-grandchildren.

SAM JAFFE, 98, HOLLYWOOD AGENT WHO REPRESENTED ICONS OF HIS DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sam Jaffe, the pre-eminent agent of his day and a producer
credited with saving Paramount Studios from financial ruin in the
1920s, died Jan. 10 at a hospital in Los Angeles. He was 98 and
lived in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe represented some of the biggest stars in Hollywood from
the 1930s to the 1950s, including Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall,
David Niven and Richard Burton. He also , invented the production
method of shooting ``night for day,'' a gamble that allowed
Paramount to continue making movies despite an electrical fire on
Jan. 16, 1929, that destroyed stages being soundproofed for talking
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   With disruptive repairs estimated to take five months, the
studio feared financial ruin because of the difficulty of filming
in the daytime. Jaffe came up with the idea of shooting at night,
using strong lighting to simulate daylight. The inventive measure
was credited by many with allowing Paramount to maintain its
financial footing and move from silent to sound pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York's Harlem, Jaffe dropped out of DeWitt Clinton
High School to enter the movie industry as an office boy at
Paramount-Famous Players-Lasky Studios in New York. By 22 he had
become a local movie mogul as the production manager of films
directed by Ernst Lubitsch, Josef von Sternberg and Rouben
Mamoulian. He also helped to negotiate the deal for the studio's
move to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s Jaffe worked briefly for Harry Cohn at Columbia
Pictures until his wife persuaded him to go into business on his
own. He opened the Jaffe Agency and represented film icons like
Bogart and the directors Fritz Lang, Raoul Walsh and Stanley
Kubrick.
</P>
<P>
   While an agent, Jaffe kept his hand in movies, persuading Darryl
F. Zanuck, the head of 20th Century Fox, to let him produce ``The
Fighting Sullivans,'' a 1944 film based on the story of the five
Sullivan brothers who lost their lives when the Japanese sank their
destroyer during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaffe Agency suffered during the McCarthy era, when many of
its clients were singled out by the House Un-American Activities
Committee. In 1959 Jaffe retired and moved to London, where he
lived for 20 years and produced the 1966 film ``Born Free,'' Joy
Adamson's story of raising Elsa the lioness in the wilds of Africa,
and ``Theater of Blood,'' a 1973 comedy, starring his longtime
friend and fellow art-collector Vincent Price, about a
Shakespearean actor who kills his critics.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by three daughters, Naomi Carroll and Barbara
Kohn of Los Angeles and Judith Silber of Chevy Chase, Md.; four
grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.  &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Doris Parker, widow of the jazz saxophonist Charlie
(Bird) Parker, who used his memory to fight drug addiction, died
Jan. 17 in Manhattan. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   She died of respiratory failure said a friend, Sarah Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parker was the third wife of Charlie Parker, the bebop
innovator, who died in 1955 at 34, his life cut short by alcohol
and drug use. They were married in 1948 and separated in 1950.
(Parker considered Chan Parker, who died last year, his fourth
wife, but a spokesman for his estate said they were not legally
married.)
</P>
<P>
   Doris June Sydnor Parker was born on Aug. 16, 1922, in Rock
Island, Ill. She came to New York at 22. At 6 feet tall, she became
a striking figure as a hat-check girl at the Three Deuces, a West
52nd Street nightclub, where she met Charlie Parker in 1945. They
began living together in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   When Parker, a heroin addict since his teen-age years, spent six
months in a California mental hospital in 1947, she moved to Los
Angeles to visit and care for him. They were married in 1948 in
Tijuana, Mexico, while Parker was on a West Coast tour with the
Jazz at the Philharmonic concert series.
</P>
<P>
   After his death, Mrs. Parker worked for 25 years as a secretary
for Columbia University. She also had a long career as a community
activist, working with groups like the Northwest Central Park
Multiblock Association and the Federation of West Side Block
Associations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, she organized the first Evening with Friends of Charlie
Parker. These benefits, at which associates of her husband like Max
Roach and Dizzy Gillespie performed without pay, became annual
events to raise money for Veritas, a drug rehabilitation program on
the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,' Mrs. Parker said of her husband in 1993, ``he'll be
remembered as not just the most famous junkie of his time.''
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.  &QL;

   DES MOINES, Iowa _ This is the time of year when presidential
candidates tramp around Iowa and proclaim their yearning for a
better America. For Bill Bradley, that includes better motel beds.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally in his high-minded stump speeches, Bradley pauses
to complain impishly about the ``rubberized pillows'' in Iowa's
far-flung hotels and motels, and the sheets that ``come loose from
the mattress every time you turn over.'' He leaves out that it
can't be any easier to sleep in a small bed for someone who is 6
feet 5 inches.
</P>
<P>
   From Bradley's point of view, the bed that doesn't fit is an apt
reflection of the Procrustean format of the Iowa caucuses next
Monday, where the system so clearly favors Al Gore. Iowans choose
their candidates not in a statewide primary but in 2,100 local
caucuses, throwing the advantage to the entrenched unions,
political clubs and community groups backing the vice president and
long accustomed to getting their supporters out. The Bradley
campaign compares its troubles to running against the Chicago
Democratic machine.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides say they have no choice but to mobilize people
who have never shown up at caucuses before _ kids, idealists, labor
dissidents and others inclined toward the former senator's low-key
fervor. Since the beginning of the year, he has spent $1.3 million
in television advertising. He has devoted 10 days to traveling
around the state, slipping into the role of itinerant preacherlike
outsiders going back to Eugene McCarthy and Jimmy Carter, who used
to quote the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr to the effect that ``the
sad duty of politics is to establish justice in a sinful world.''
But while often authentically inspiring, Bradley's appeals can come
across as pious, ethereal and even a little grumpy.
</P>
<P>
   There are of course the standard references to health care,
poverty and economics in Bradley's speeches. But the candidate
seems most distinctive when talking about making Americans feel
``less lonely, less fearful and less isolated'' in a changing
world. ``The untapped potential of the presidency is to unlock in
each of us the capacity for self-fulfillment,'' he told a group
celebrating Martin Luther King's birthday this week. He went on to
promise to work for ``a world of new possibilities guided by
goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   Less artfully, Bradley told a separate group of students that it
was not enough to battle bigotry in others. ``If you haven't had a
conversation about race in a long time with someone of another
race, you are part of the problem,'' he said sternly, and perhaps a
little sanctimoniously as well.
</P>
<P>
   The former senator's style does not get much overt audience
reaction, but that is OK with him. ``I don't want applause,'' he
said in a conversation aboard his bus as it rolled across central
Iowa. ``I want people to listen, and in the process be moved.'' His
style, Bradley said, is ``to lead from idealism and not
interest-group politics'' and ``awaken in people what they believe
politics could be.'' If his approach does not work, he said with a
shrug, ``I'm out, and life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore seems to revel in his organized support and
theatrical applause lines. At the Union Baptist Church in Des
Moines, a black congregation in the eastern part of town, Gore
jumped up and down and rolled his head from side to side during a
rollicking refrain of ``Restore it!'' from the choir. At the pulpit
he got cheers when he declared, ``I am a Baptist,'' and cascades of
applause as he growled out a list of African-Americans who have
served in the Clinton administration. When someone shouted, ``Run,
Al, run!'' he threw back his head with a dramatic laugh and shouted
back: ``I will! I will! I will!''
</P>
<P>
   With less than a week to go before the caucuses, Gore remains
the front-runner while Bradley hopes to make a showing respectable
enough to proclaim a moral victory he can ride into New Hampshire
the following week. Both states are getting a close look at two
styles of Democratic presidential politics that have been around
since Adlai Stevenson, the cool egghead, and Hubert Humphrey, the
happy warrior. This year's version is Laconic Bill versus Pumped-Up
Al. In a few days, voters will get to decide which style is more
attractive _ or at least less irritating.

DEREK ANSON JONES, 38; DIRECTED OFF-BROADWAY PLAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Derek Anson Jones, the director of ``Wit,'' which won
the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for drama, died Jan. 17 at St. Vincent's
Hospital in Manhattan. He was 38.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was AIDS, said his companion, Denis O'Hare.
</P>
<P>
   With a clean, precise vision of an emotionally complex play,
Jones received the best reviews of his short career for ``Wit,''
the story of a haughty literature professor whose defenses are
broken down by her battle with ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It was a play with which Jones had long been associated; he and
the playwright, Margaret Edson, had been best friends since the two
were students togetnd each other's prom dates _ at the
Sidwell Friends School in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Passionate about Ms. Edson's work, Jones played the role of the
stricken professor during an informal reading of the script in 1991
and kept a copy of the play with him for several years, continually
showing it to artistic directors of theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1997, Jones convinced the Long Wharf Theater in New
Haven to produce the play, with Kathleen Chalfant in the lead role.
Positive reviews led to a New York production at the MCC Theater on
West 28th Street, where the play became the surprise hit of the
1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief flirtation with Broadway, Jones helped take
``Wit'' Off-Broadway, to the Union Square Theater, where it is
still running. Lisa Harrow of the Royal Shakespeare Co. recently
took over the lead role from Judith Light.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' approach to the play was simple, allowing Ms. Edson's
language to dominate the stage. Still, using a series of sliding
curtains and minimal lighting, Jones managed almost seamlessly to
conjure settings as varied as a hospital, a lecture hall and a
family's living room. His work was honored with the 1999 Lucille
Lortel Award for direction as well as a Drama Desk nomination.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Brown University and the Yale School of Drama,
Jones also worked extensively in the regional theater, directing at
the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, the Guthrie Theater in
Minneapolis and at New York Stage and Film in Poughkeepsie.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Wit,'' Jones had also recently directed ``An American
Daughter'' and ``Much Ado About Nothing'' at the Long Wharf, and a
new play, ``Angelique,'' at MCC Theater.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to O'Hare, Jones is survived by his parents, Raymond
and Gladys Jones of Washington, and a brother, Raymond Jones Jr. of
Aurora, Colo.

MISSOURI COURT REJECTS EFFORTS TO SHARE IN TOBACCO SETTLEMENT
MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ The Missouri Court of Appeals on Tuesday
tossed aside one of the last roadblocks to the state's receiving
its tobacco settlement payments, adding a tone of realism to
lawmakers' debates over how to handle an estimated $6.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The court's Eastern Division ruled 2-1 that Missouri hospitals
and three other groups are not entitled to a share of the state's
settlement with cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Jay Nixon praised the decision, saying that the
more than 50 hospitals involved should press their own lawsuits
against cigarette makers instead of trying to siphon off part of
the state's settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court found that if they want to bring lawsuits, they can
bring them,'' Nixon said. ``But they should not have tried to get
inside our pot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The money is Missouri's share of the $206 billion that the major
U.S. cigarette makers agreed to pay over 25 years to reimburse
states for the cost of treating smoking-related illness.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said Missouri is one of just six states still trying to
clear up legal issues surrounding the settlement. Kansas received
the first payment last year on its share of the settlement, which
is expected to total $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon called on hospitals, which have now been rebuffed twice,
to drop further appeals and let Missouri receive its first-year
payment of $183 million by April.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Coleman, a Kansas City attorney representing the
hospitals, promised that he would appeal the ruling to the Missouri
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   An appeal would delay receipt of the money for months because
the settlement requires the end of litigation before disbursements
begin. The lawsuit already has held up the first payment of $105
million, which sits in an escrow account until all legal action is
finished. Another payment, of $78 million, is scheduled in April.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals panel upheld the St. Louis Circuit Court's ruling
that the hospitals had no right to the proceeds of the state's
lawsuit. It said the hospitals, along with plaintiffs representing
taxpayers, consumers and family members who died of smoking-related
diseases, needed to file their own lawsuits to recover damages.
</P>
<P>
   What hospitals lost in court, however, they are seeking to
obtain from the legislature. The Missouri Hospital Association was
among a long list of health-related industries that on Tuesday
asked a Senate committee for a share of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital groups testified at hearings in November that they
wanted up to $1 billion of the settlement as compensation for
having treated indigent patients.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Steve Ehlmann of St. Charles was incredulous.
The request, he said, seemed a bit cynical, given the hospitals'
legal action against the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're saying you want to claim a portion of the settlement,
but if you lose, you still want the money from the legislature,''
Ehlmann said. ``After you've caused us to spend money on litigation
and you've delayed the state's access to the tobacco money, then
you come here and want us to give the money to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital association is not a party to the lawsuit, but many
of its members are.
</P>
<P>
   Ehlmann's observation came during a hearing by the Senate
Pensions Committee to take testimony on half a dozen
tobacco-related bills.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Pro Tem Ed Quick, a Liberty Democrat, proposed
a constitutional amendment that would ask voters for authority to
spend 60 percent of the money on health-related programs, 20
percent on anti-smoking efforts and 20 percent for an emergency
fund for state government. A companion bill would set up a trust
fund to receive the money once it is available.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Franc Flotron, a St. Louis County Republican, said such
a plan could leave the money in ``Hancock purgatory.'' If the money
stayed in the trust fund, it would not be subject to the Hancock
Amendment, which sets a limit on total state revenue.
</P>
<P>
   If voters reject the ballot proposal, then the money would build
up in the account, but would not be available for the legislature
to spend or refund, Flotron said.
</P>
<P>
   Quick said that if voters rejected the proposal, the account
would allow the money to accrue until another plan could be
submitted to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses testified in support of Quick's plan, urging
senators to use most of the money for health programs. But many of
the programs went far beyond health care. In many cases, the
Pensions Committee heard more about job creation than medical care.
</P>
<P>
   A big push has started to see that the money is used for
life-sciences research, which could boost economic development
efforts in Kansas City and St. Louis, witnesses said. The current
and former chancellors of Washington University talked about how
subsidized research would lead to more high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Civic Counsel of Greater Kansas City also suggested using
tobacco money to boost scientific research. But the group also
urged spending money on early childhood care because good programs
could reduce adult smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Associated Industries of Missouri suggested using the money to
fund a tax-credit for small businesses that provide health
insurance for their employees. Increasing the number of workers who
have health insurance would give health-care providers less
incentive to shift costs to patients insured by large companies,
AIM said.
</P>
<P>
   Even a school nurses' group said its members hoped they would be
included in health-care programs funded by tobacco money. And an
anti-abortion lobbyist said anti-smoking programs should be funded
because cigarettes increase the likelihood of a miscarriage.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO SEEK PLAN TO PAY OFF U.S. DEBT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois plans to
announce on Wednesday that House Republicans will work to develop
an economic plan to pay off the national debt by 2015, Hastert's
aides said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The aides said Hastert would ask the House Budget Committee to
begin work on legislation that would use all of the projected
Social Security surplus and part of the projected federal surplus
to eliminate the nation's $5.8 trillion debt within 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   John P. Feehery, Hastert's press secretary, confirmed Tuesday
night that the goal of the Republican plan would be to retire the
nation's debt, but he refused to divulge details.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been in debt since 1835.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we eliminate this debt, that money can be freed up for use
on other priorities like tax relief, investing in our schools or
fortifying our national defense,'' according to a text of a speech
that Hastert is scheduled to deliver on Wednesday in Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Jan. 6, Hastert pledged to reveal
details on a long-term plan to eliminate the national debt. At that
time, he promised that the effort would not affect three tax cuts
that the Republicans, who control Congress, have vowed to pass this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed cuts would eliminate the so-called marriage
penalty, establish tax-free savings accounts for education and
create tax incentives to help revitalize the nation's poorest urban
and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have said they will send the proposed cuts to
the floor as separate spending bills, which would provide a total
of $135 billion in tax cuts over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   As the election year gets under way, Hastert's announcement
would demonstrate that Republicans were trying to establish an
aggressive legislative agenda before President Clinton delivered
his final State of the Union address on Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that Hastert's announcement was motivated in
large part by election-year politics, an aide said the booming
economy would allow the Republicans to pass their proposed tax cuts
and still be able to accommodate the $483 billion multiyear tax
cuts proposed by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the front-runner for
the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Hastert said he intended to call on the president to
assist Republicans in their effort to retire the debt. Hastert also
intends to ask that the long-term debt retirement plan be presented
to the Republican leadership by April 15.
