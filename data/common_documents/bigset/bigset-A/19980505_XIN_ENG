<HEADLINE> Latvia's Top Legislator Criticizes Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Latvian legislator has
accused Russia of "political blackmail" and seeking to hinder the
small Baltic nation's development.
</P>
<P>
Latvia wanted to maintain good relations with Russia but found
unacceptable Russia's "patronage and political blackmail,
resembling the notorious role of the elder brother", said Latvian
parliament speaker Alfreds Cepanis, according to Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
Cepanis, at a ceremonial parliamentary meeting to mark the
eighth anniversary of the adoption of the former Soviet republic's
declaration of independence, criticized Russia for creating a
certain international isolation of the Baltic state and slowing
down its advance towards the European Union and NATO.
</P>
<P>
However, Cepanis said Latvia was ready for an open dialogue
with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Russia and Latvia turned tense when Latvian
police forcefully disbanded a rally by Russian-speaking pensioners
in Riga in early March, triggering a backlash from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Some 700,000 Russian-speaking people are living in Latvia,
accounting for one-third of the country's population, but only
4,000 have received Latvian nationality.
</P>
<P>
Cepanis said that Russia had reacted inadequately to events
and unleashed a campaign against Latvia, including insulting
comments by Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
He claimed the tone and form of Russian statements and the
threat of economic sanctions were unacceptable.

<HEADLINE> Parliamentary Assembly of Russia-Belarus Union Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The eighth assembly of the parliament
of the Russia-Belarus Union opened Monday in Gomel, Belarus, with
a call for more initiative from members.
</P>
<P>
At the session Russian State Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov was
re-elected chairman of the parliament of the Union, and Speaker of
the lower house of the Belarussian parliament Anatoly Malofeyev
was elected deputy chairman.
</P>
<P>
Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said at the session that
preparations for a new bilateral treaty stipulating the Union's
tasks should be completed by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the Supreme Council of the Union, Lukoshenko
highlighted the importance of the parliament, noting the
initiative of members of the parliament had "begun to ebb".
</P>
<P>
"If the integration process dies down, people will lose faith
in the union's development," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries' unity should be restored on a
qualitatively new democratic basis with regard to mutual
interests, national sovereignty, mutual respect and peaceful
co-existence.
</P>
<P>
The Russia-Belarus Union was founded in April 1997 for
promotion of the two countries' economic development.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Levies Excise Duty on Imported Beverages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has levied
excise tariffs on imported beverages one month after it lifted a
ban on these commodities, the East African paper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The affected goods include soft drinks, beer and car
batteries.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner for Taxation in the Ministry of Finance, Mr.
K. Kiiza, said that an excise duty of 230 and 650 Uganda
Shillings (0.2 and 0.6 U.S. Dollars) would be introduced on every
liter of imported soda and beer respectively.
</P>
<P>
A 17 percent valued added tax and 12 percent COMESA (Common
Market for East and Southern Africa) duty, he added, will also be
put on these imports.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a finance official as saying: "the new tariff
schedule is meant to protect our industries or at least to put
imports at par with locally produced products."
</P>
<P>
Some businesses, however, rapped the measure, saying it just
made imported beverages more expensive than local ones.
</P>
<P>
The recent lifting of the beer ban sparked concern among beer
manufacturers here. The Kampala-based Uganda Breweries Limited
and Nile Breweries Limited, the two beer manufacturers in the
country, have invested in plant expansion in an effort to
increase production capacity and competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> Jordanians Leave for Kuwait to Visit Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-six Jordanians left here on
Monday for Kuwait to meet with their loved ones currently jailed
in the Gulf sheikdom.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanians, mostly spouses and children of the prisoners,
will stay in Kuwait for three days, Mu'in Qassis, spokesman for
the Amman Office of the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The trip came after Kuwait pardoned 13 Jordanian prisoners on
April 27 in a moved aime at improving bilateral relations. The 13
Jordanians have not returned to Jordan yet.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 Jordanians were sentenced by Kuwaiti security courts on
charges of collaborating with Iraq during its seven-month
occupation of Kuwait from August 1990 to February 1991.
</P>
<P>
"This is the fourth ICRC-sponsored visit since the end of the
Gulf War (in 1991)," Qassis said. The previous visits took place
in June and September 1995 and January 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Through these trips, the ICRC has enabled 133 Jordanians to
meet with relatives detained in Kuwait," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Jordan-Kuwait relations soured due to Jordan's perceived
tilt toward Iraq during its occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been inching for reconciliation,
especially since Jordan distanced itself from the Iraqi
leadership. But their diplomatic relationship has not been fully
restored.

<HEADLINE> Romania: Government to Support Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The government of Romania must be
involved in supporting export trade-- this is the highlight of a
survey on Romanian export options initiated and financed by
European Union's PHARE program.
</P>
<P>
According to the state news agency of Romania Rompres, the
survey published on Monday remarked that "the Government's
involvement in supporting export trade, exists in most of the
developed or developing countries", and "a Romanian Foreign Trade
Center and a Department for export promoting must be set in place
under the Ministry of Industry and Trade."
</P>
<P>
The survey says that "Romania has to include all the
responsibilities in a sole body, like Hungary does".
</P>
<P>
"Very important in promoting exports is to help people with
more information about the best opportunities for their own
companies", the survey said. To this respect, Romania "has to take
the cue from other countries and those who know how to do
business".
</P>
<P>
As for the financial measures, "the high nominal interest rates
bring about insecurity and affect people's confidence in the
business milieu, this adds to the doubt about the long-term
exchange rate", the same survey pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The subsidized loans for exports seem to cover at the moment
but 10-15 percent of the goods exports, the survey also said.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Leader Winds up Visit to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The founder and spiritual leader of
the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) Sheikh Ahmad
Yassin wound up his six-day visit here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Iran's official news agency IRNA before his
departure, Yassin said that his talks with Iranian officials had
been "highly fruitful," adding that he had briefed Iranian
officials on the latest developments in Palestinian and Hamas'
stance on regional situation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the release of four Palestinian prisoners captured
by Iran during the Iran-Iraq war (1980-88) was an affirmative
response given by Iranian officials to his request.
</P>
<P>
Some Palestinians joined the Iraqis in their bloody fightings
with Iranians which left about 1 million people from both sides
dead or injured.
</P>
<P>
Yassin told reporters that support for the Palestinian nation
and its right to self-determination is quite obvious in the
position of the Iranian officials and people.
</P>
<P>
The paraplegic Hamas leader, who was released from Israeli jail
last October, arrived here on Tuesday after visiting Egypt, Syria
and Qatar. He is reportedly to visit Kuwait on the fifth leg of his
multi-nation tour in the region.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, he met Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, President Mohammad Khatami, former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani and other senior Iranian officials, who reiterated
Iran's support for Palestinian resistance against Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Yassin has repeatedly pledged to continue struggle against
Israel until "the liberation of Palestine without ceding an inch
of Palestinian land."

<HEADLINE> UK Plans to Give Parents Child Sick Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain is planning to give parents
of sick children legal right to time off work to look after their
children under new laws which will come into force in the country
at the end of 1999, national newspapers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that under a European directive in the Social
Chapter, which the UK government signed up after last year's
general election, employers will have to grant time off for
parents of sick children.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that the move will be discussed with
employers as to how much time off should be given and whether or
not it will be paid.
</P>
<P>
At present, parents of sick children declare themselves sick
when they really need time off work to care for a sick child. Some
others take paid holiday to look after their sick children.
</P>
<P>
Harriet Harman, the Social Security Secretary, is reportedly
very keen to see such measures as part of the government's package
of "family friendly" employment policies, together with childcare,
the minimum wage and working family tax credits.
</P>
<P>
Harman said in a recent speech: "This package of measures is
crucial to making sure that mothers and fathers can take time out
to care for their children without jeopardising their employment
prospects".

<HEADLINE> Sudan Peace Talks Resume as Famine Spreads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
(by Xu Jianmei)
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The warring sides in Sudan
restarted peace talks here Monday as famine continues to bite in
southern Sudan where civil war has dragged on since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Few are expecting a breakthrough from the talks, which is the
second round to be ended here Tuesday compared to the first one
which lasted for about two weeks late last year, a senior
Khartoum diplomat told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The parties to the conflict have not reconsidered their
positions" since then, sighed Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya
Godana when opening the talks.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman heads a seven-member
delegation while Nhial Deng, the rebel governor of southern Bahr
el Ghazal Province, acts as the top negotiator for the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and its political wing
Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), Xinhua was told.
</P>
<P>
Their talks are under the auspices of the Inter-Government
Authority of Development (IGAD) which groups Kenya#,Uganda,
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Sudan and Somalia. The talks also
have a sideshow of an IGAD ministrial-level meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the last talks, "the two parties could not agree on
two issues, namely the right of self-determination for the people
of southern Sudan and the relationship between state and
religion," Godana noted.
</P>
<P>
"This stalemate led to the adjournment of the negotiations"
and brings about great pessimism on the prospect of the ongoing
talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
A report by special envoys mandated to shuttle between the
two sides when the last round of talks broke up in November "was
not encouraging," he lamented.
</P>
<P>
However, Godana called for "an urgent solution" to the
conflicts as southern Sudanese "have for long been faced with
famine due to the ravages of war."
</P>
<P>
Famine crisis in southern Sudan, especially in the Bahr el
Ghazal area, "has now reached catastrophy," said SPLM spokesman
John Luk Jok after the opening ceremony, urging for more
international humanitarian aid to the area.
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds and thousands of people (there) are starving to
death due to famine" caused by the protracted war and poor
weather last year, said Jok.
</P>
<P>
"The SPLM/A resolves to respect and observe free and
unhindered access of humanitarian relief assistance to the needy
people of our country and particularly in Bahr el Ghazal region
through the establishment of corridors of tranquillity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Operation Lifeline of Sudan (OLS) said that it was
allowed Sunday by the Sudanese government to use four more
aircraft to fly aid to southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"With five C-130 aircraft and other modes of transport, OLS
will be able to deliver approximately 6,000 tos of food
assistance per month," said the OLS in a news release.
</P>
<P>
"This will greatly assist OLS to meet the food needs of
380,000 people in both government and rebel-held areas of Bahr el
Ghazal and an additional 410,000 people facing severe hunger in
other parts of southern Sudan," the OLS said.
</P>
<P>
Peace negotiations between Sudan's warring sides restarted at
the end of October last year after a three-year deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The war, broke out in 1983 between the Moslem-ruled Khartoum
government in the north and the SPLA fighting for more autonomy
and religious freedom in the animist and Christian-dominated
south.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 1.3 million Sudaneses have been killed by
the war and war-related famines. Another 365,000 have now been
forced to live on alien lands as refugees.

<P>
HANOI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting General Secretary of ASEAN
(the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Rodolfo Severino said
here Monday that he was confident that with Vietnam's active
preparations, the upcoming sixth ASEAN summit scheduled for
December in Hanoi will result in success.
</P>

Action" and other documents to be submitted to the upcoming ASEAN
summit.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese Prime Minister hoped that cooperative ties
between Vietnam and ASEAN would be further enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Khai said the Hanoi summit should concretize its plan of action
in line with the spirit of the "ASEAN Vision 2020" approved by
leaders of member countries at the second informal ASEAN summit in
Kuala Lumpur late last year.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese leader said that ASEAN should find its own
development way to overcome the adverse impacts of the current
financial crisis in the region and continue to achieve high
socio-economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam expressed the hope that cambodia would be considered to
become the tenth member of ASEAN, said the Vietnamese Prime
Minister.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam joined ASEAN, which also groups Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand,
in july 1995.

be reduced by 20 percent annually until they are fully exempted
from customs fees in years, he added without specifying.
</P>
<P>
He said this accord was signed to activate a 1996 trade
agreement between the two countries. It will be referred soon to
the concerned ministers of the two countries for final
approval.

<HEADLINE> Somali S. Town Kismayu Declared Battle Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 4 (Xinhua)-- Militia officers of the Marehan
sub-clan fighting for the control of the port town of Kismayu,
500 km south of Mogadishu, Monday declared this southern town of
Kismayu as a battle zone.
</P>
<P>
They also issued a stern warning to the international aid
agencies and business communities against coming in and operating
in the town.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement read on the VHF radios seven km
outside Kismayu to reporters here in the Somali capital, the
Marehan militiamen and their battle wagons won't shoulder the
security guarantees of any international or local flights trying
to use the airport in the town.
</P>
<P>
The statement also warned against any damage to the business
or humanitarian ferries trying to bring supplies to the town.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Omar Jama Artan, the militia leader of the Marehan SNF
faction, said the statement will also apply to the international
or local aid workers inside the town, adding that the aid
agencies and their flights will be given a further notice as soon
as the situation changes.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kismayu said a commercial ferry that left
Mogadishu for Kismayu four days ago could not dock into the port
following the increased insecurity precipitated by armed clashes
that drew very close to the town Sunday. The ferry, Al-Mansor,
has reportedly passed on to the Kenyan port of Mombasa Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the mass refugees exodus to the relatively
safer areas south of Kismayu, the militia commanders of the
Marehan Somali National Front (SNF) faction called civilians in
the town to remain calm and stay in their houses, adding that
"the militiamen of General Morgan themselves will be forgiven if
they disarm and surrender to the SNF forces."
</P>
<P>
Colonel Artan also said he is going to his house inside
Kismayu town together with his fellow clan compatriots who were
ousted from the town last year. He also said his men won't kill
or take vengeance on anyone despite the current hostility between
the two sub-clans of Darod, Majerten and Marehan.
</P>
<P>
The Marehan militia commanders also warned against the
possible spread of the fighting to other regions where the two
sub-clans live together, including Somalia's central region of
Mudug.
</P>
<P>
They accused General Morgan of trying to instigate armed
clashes in the town of Galkayo among the supporters of the two
sides. Nearly 100 people have been killed and 200 others wounded
since the clashes began over 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Kismayu was tense Monday with almost all its
people mobilized to defend the town against the Marehans. More
fighting for the control of the town is eminent in the next few
days as both sides continue their preparations to launch more
attacks.

<HEADLINE> IFAD to Finance Agricultural Projects in Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD) will extend an 8-million-dollar
loan to finance a number of agricultural development projects in
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
A delegation representing the Rome-based fund is to start
Monday a four-day visit to the Palestinian self-rule areas for
talks with to Palestinian National Authority President Yasser
Arafat and a number of senior officials, the Middle East News
Agency quoted U.N. sources here as saying.
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to focus on the progress made so far in
the fund's relief and development programs and new projects to
which IFAD plans to contribute in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The new loan, to be inked Thursday, will be a soft one in a bid
to assist in increasing per capita income and living standards of
Palestinian small-scale farmers, according to U.N. sources.
</P>
<P>
The loan comes after the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank paied attention to the Palestinians' poor living
conditions and low per capita income in the Palestinian self-rule
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli policy of closure has made Palestinians' life even
harder and inflicted serious damages to the Palestinian economy.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa to Import 2 Million Tons of Maize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries
will need to import more than two million tons of maize this
year, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two million tons would cover an estimated deficit of
between 2.18 million and 3.08 million tons of the staple food in
the region, SAPA quoted a regional food magazine as saying.
</P>
<P>
The magazine report, which covered 11 of the 14 members of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC), said maize
harvests were forecast at between 15.24 million and 16.14 million
tons this year, compared with last year's 17.05 million tons.
</P>
<P>
While production was forecast to increase in Angola, Malawi,
Mozambique, Swaziland and Zambia, where rainfall was normal to
above normal, Lesotho, South Africa and Zimbabwe were adversely
affected by delayed rains and dry spells in February.
</P>
<P>
Angola's maize output was forecast to rise by 10 percent from
last season's yield, but it still faced a maize shortfall of over
381,000 tons this marketing season, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Maize deficit in Zimbabwe would go up to 610,000 tons this
year, as the country's production was expected to decline by 35
percent to 1.42 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Only Mozambique and South Africa were projected to have maize
surplus.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's yield was set to rise to 1.2 million tons, which
means a surplus of 157,000 tons for 1998/99. South Africa was
expected to have a small domestic surplus of 112,000 tons as
maize output fell from nine million last year to 7.75 million.
</P>
<P>
The region was predicted to have a total cereal shortfall of
4.56 million tons in the 1998/99 marketing year, more than double
last year's shortfall of 1.83 million tons.
</P>
<P>
This would require an import of between 3.2 million and 4.56
million tons of cereal, the report said.

<HEADLINE> 3 S. African States Suffer Power Blackouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe, Zambia and Botswana
experienced power blackouts Monday following a major fault on the
Bindura (Zimbabwe) - Cahora Bassa (Mozambique) line, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Francis Masawi, transmission director of the Zimbabwe
electricity supply authority, said the loss of power was due to a
failure of Southern African Development Community (SADC)'s
inter-connected power system.
</P>
<P>
Zambia and Zimbabwe were the worst affected as they are in the
middle of the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe experienced a nationwide blackout for about five
hours from 10:17 am until services were restored around 14:30 pm.
</P>
<P>
There was another blackout around 15:30 pm following a line
fault on the South African Eskom-Matimba-Insukameni line with
services restored on an on-and-off basis.
</P>
<P>
Botswana experienced a blackout following Zimbabwe's failure
to transmit its imported power from South Africa during the
blackout.
</P>
<P>
"We are operating in an inter-connected power system and any
event on the network will affect all the power systems in the
SADC region, with Zambia and Zimbabwe being the worst affected as
they fall in the center of the system," Masawi said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe imports 300 and 400 megawatts from South Africa and
Mozambique respectively.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Disappointed Over Failure of U.S. Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus expressed disappointment on
Monday over the failure of the latest United States efforts to
resume the intercommunal dialogue on the island.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government was "disappointed and displeased" that
the U.S. effort to revive the Cyprus peace talks aimed at forming
a bizonal and bicommunal federation has broken down, government
spokesman Christos Stylianides told reporters.
</P>
<P>
His comments came after U.S. presidential emissary Richard
Holbrooke ended his three-day shuttle mission here without
succeeding to get Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash back to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides blamed the Turkish Cypriot side for the lack of
progress, which he said was caused by its intransigence.
</P>
<P>
"The international community must understand that the Turkish
side is exclusively responsible for the lack of progress in
efforts to reach a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus
question," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island after a failed pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been trying to reunify the
island under the bizonal and bicommunal formula proposed by the
United Nations. But so far no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides
has briefed Greek Cypriot political leaders on the outcome of
Holbrooke's visit, and the National Council will probably meet on
Friday to discuss the developments.
</P>
<P>
The council, which comprises leaders of Greek Cypriot political
parties, is the top advisory body to the president on handling the
protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference during the day at the end of
his visit, Holbrooke said that Denktash demanded his entity in
northern Cyprus be recognized and Cyprus suspend its accession
talks with the European Union before the peace talks can be
resumed.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that Denktash's preconditions "make progress
difficult."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 the
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by
Turkey, against the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus
predominated by the Greek Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Defends EU Central Bank Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Monday
made a talk to defend a European Union compromise to split the
term of the first president of the European central bank (ECB)
between rival French-and German-back candidates, stressing that
the decision would not undermine the independence of the new bank.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that there had been a hard fight between
Germany and France on the ECB leadership issue, Kohl also stressed
in Bonn that the relations between the two countries had not been
marred for this reason.
</P>
<P>
"Friendship means that one can talk about everything with a
friend even when they have different views," Kohl argued at a news
conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
After more than 10 hours of heated squabbling at their weekend
summit in Brussels, leaders of the 15 EU members decided to
appoint the former Dutch central bank chief Wim Duisenberg as the
first ECB president.
</P>
<P>
The decision, however, was followed by a statement from
Duisenberg, who is favored by most EU states except France, that
he would only serve half of his eight-year term in order to make
way for the French central bank governor Jean-Claude Trichet.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement has drawn widespread criticism in Germany with
the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) accusing Kohl of
caving in to French pressure on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"The rotten compromise of Brussels is a personal defeat for
Kohl," said SPD European policy spokeswoman Heidemarie
Wieczorek-Zeul.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, however, noted that the Dutchman had offered to retire
early under his own free will and due to his old age.
</P>
<P>
The German chancellor also denied speculations that Bonn and
Paris had agreed previously to install a Frenchman at the head of
the European central bank in return for locating the bank in
Frankfurt, Germany.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's ANC Rejects Smear Campaign Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling African
National Congress (ANC) Monday rejected again National Party
(NP)'s claims that the ANC is behind a smear campaign against NP
leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk.
</P>
<P>
ANC member of parliament Willie Hofmeyr Monday repeated a
statement made by the ANC last week that it was not involved in
any way in allegations that van Schalkwyk paid for homosexual
sex.
</P>
<P>
He said his party would not "stoop to such tactics" and would
seek a meeting with the NP leader to set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
A weekly newspaper reported Friday that van Schalkwyk was at
the center of a police probe, following allegations by a
convicted thief, David Hermanus, who is serving a prison
sentence, that the NP leader paid him 20 Rand (4 U.S. Dollars)
for sex in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report triggered immediate reaction from the NP, the
country's biggest opposition party, which claimed that the ANC
was the mastermind of the allegations aimed at smearing the NP
leader ahead of the 1999 general election.
</P>
<P>
The NP said Sunday that Hofmeyr was kept informed about the
development on the homosexual charges, and his subordinate had
regular telephone contact with Hermanus.
</P>
<P>
It also said a list of possible questions and answers relating
to Hermanus's allegations was found in his cell, creating the
impression of "a coaching document."
</P>
<P>
Hofmeyr said the NP claims showed it had resorted to the kind
of cheap smear tactics of which it claimed had been a victim.
</P>
<P>
ANC's national leaders had dealt with the matter with complete
integrity and had been entirely open about Hermanus' approach to
his office, Hofmeyr said.

<HEADLINE> New Phone Lines Link Cyprus' Divided Communities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus inaugurated an automated
telephone system on Monday aimed at improving the communications
between the two divided communities of Greek Cypriots and Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, visiting United States
presidential emissary Richard Holbrooke urged the two communities
to "use these lines to reach out to old friends they have not
talked to in many years."
</P>
<P>
"I believe firmly in communications. Communications break down
barriers. Let us not minimize the importance of today's step,"
Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy attended the ceremony hours before his departure
from here. He failed to talk Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash into returning to the
negotiating table during his three-day shuttle mission here.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Resident Representative for Cyprus Gustave
Feissel has said the new, automated system will increase the
annual handling capacity of telephone calls from 100,000 to more
than 750,000.
</P>
<P>
The system, at an estimated cost of 80,000 U.S. dollars, was
funded by the U.S. through Office of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
For years, the U.N. has provided the only phone connection
between Turkish Cypriots in the north and Greek Cypriots in the
south on the Mediterranean island, through the switchboard of the
U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. says the existing system, which is manually operated,
has become overburdened because of increasing demand from the two
sides and it was unable to cope with it.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed pro-Athens coup by the Greek Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Sudanese, Somali Warring Sides to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday called on parties to conflicts in Sudan and
Somalia to expedite their search for a peaceful settlement of
their conflicts by making compromise.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here at the headquarters of the
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the U.N. chief
expressed his support to the peace efforts made by the
Inter-Governmental Authority for Development (IGAD) in settling
these conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to learn that the IGAD mediators and the parties
to the conflict in southern Sudan are reconvening their talks in
Nairobi during my stay here," said Annan.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he was briefed Monday morning by the
managers of Operation Life-Line Sudan (OLS) which is striving to
avert a catastrophe in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program (WFP) warned last month that the food
situation in Bahr el Ghazal region in southern Sudan has reached
a critical level and the threat of thousands of people dying from
lack of food and disease was becoming reality.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to note the flight approvals given yesterday
(Sunday) in Khartoum by the government of Sudan which will allow
us to increase nearly threefold our deliveries of assistance in
the coming four months," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
It is essential that this humanitarian access be maintained in
the months to come regardless of the outcome of the on-going
peace talks held in Nairobi, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the OLS, following the flight approval by
Khartoum, OLS is able to deliver about 6,000 tons of relief food
per month to southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"This will greatly assist OLS to meet the food needs of
380,000 people in both government and rebel-held areas of Bahr el
Ghazal and an additional 410,000 people facing severe hunger in
other parts of southern Sudan," John Luk Jok, spokesman of the
Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), said in Nairobi
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief who arrived here Sunday for a three-day
official visit to Kenya appealed to donor governments to respond
urgently to the crisis in southern Sudan through provision of
food and cash assistance.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Kenya, Annan said, he had talks with
President Daniel arap Moi, Foreign Minister Bonaya Gadana and
other leaders, during which they had serious discussions about
regional issues, notably the Great Lakes, Sudan and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief told Kenyan leaders that the United Nations
would maintain a strong presence in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
"I have appointed Klaus Topfer to be Director-General of the
United Nations office in Nairobi, thus putting the U.N. presence
here on a par with the offices in Vienna and Geneva," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is on an African tour which is aimed at seeking
ways of boosting the continent's efforts to prevent conflicts, is
scheduled to leave the country for Tanzania on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A three-day international
woman's conference on the "future perspective for the Kuwaiti
women in the society" started here on Monday to discuss ways of
boosting woman's role in Kuwait's economy.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Minister of Planning and Minister of State for
Administrative Development Affairs Ali Moussa Al-Moussa said in
the inaugural speech that woman's contribution to the Kuwaiti work
force and economy will double in the near future.
</P>
<P>
President of the Women Committee Haifaa Al Abd al-Jaber told
the conference that the women in Kuwait account for one third of
its work force.
</P>
<P>
He said that activating woman's role would be a way to
restructure the labor force and then the demographic makeup.
</P>
<P>
The conference organized by the Women Committee in the Social
Reform Society is attended by researchers from Kuwait, the United
States, Malaysia, Britain and Sweden and several international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Chairwoman of the committee Saud Al-Jarallah has said that the
conference will focus on bringing to Kuwait new ideas as "office
at home," a system she said would enable the women to have new
access to the labor market.
</P>
<P>
"This will open up opportunities for women to work from home in
about 46 occupations," she said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Jarallah said during last two years, over 4,300 working
women, including 1,600 university graduates, were forced to give
up jobs because of social commitments.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics have shown that only 60,000 out of more
than 147,000 Kuwaiti women who hold educational qualifications,
including over 23,000 university graduates, are working.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there are over 87,000 educated women,
including 2,367 university graduates, are not working due to
domestic and social commitments.
</P>
<P>
Female population currently account for 50.4 percent of the
710,000 citizens in Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Reduce Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Five countries of the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) have reduced tariffs by
80 percent in line with the organization's goal of establishing a
free trade area by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
They are Zimbabwe, the Comoros, Kenya, Sudan and Uganda.
Meanwhile, Eritrea, Malawi and Mauritius have managed to reduce
their tariffs by 70 percent, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a report on regional integration, COMESA said all other
member countries except Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Ethiopia and Tanzania which have not reduced tariffs even by 60
percent and those which still enjoy a derogation from publishing
these tariffs, are deemed to have reduced by either 60 percent or
70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho, Swaziland and Namibia, which are also members of the
South African Customs Union, are mentioned in the report as
countries that enjoy lessening authority or law from publishing
the tariffs.
</P>
<P>
"The problems some countries face are that they are applying
tariff reduction rates to already low national rates, leading to
inequitable revenue losses and making exports to countries with
higher national rates less competitive," COMESA said.
</P>
<P>
"There is also a problem with application of the tariff
reduction program at different stages by different countries," it
said, adding: "These problems are seen as temporary, if the free
trade area is achieved by 2000, and by the principle of
reciprocity."
</P>
<P>
The COMESA treaty includes a standstill provision so that
intra-COMESA tariffs are reduced together, avoiding one country
raising tariffs after initial reduction.
</P>
<P>
COMESA was established in December 1994 to promote regional
integration through trade development, replacing the Preferential
Trade Area for Eastern and Southern Africa, which had been in
existence since 1981.
</P>
<P>
Its members are Angola, Burundi, the Comoros, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Seychelles, Sudan,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

BAGHDAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A mass funeral of 52 Iraqi children
who died because of shortages of food and medicine resulting from
the sanctions imposed on Iraq was held here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The funeral procession, attended by hundreds of people
including Arab delegations attending the 5th Arab People's Forces
Conference, started from al-Rasheed street and headed for the
U.N. Development Program (UNDP) building in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Sultan al-Shawi, chairman of the Iraqi Children Society, said
in a statement that this new batch of innocent Iraqi children
represents the "martyrs of the unjust embargo," which is
maintained because of the positions adopted by the U.S. and
British governments.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said that the United States and Britain refused to
lift the sanctions even after Iraq has fulfilled its obligations
under the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
These two governments should bear the responsibility for this
crime, he added, appealing to the international community to take
urgent actions to lift the sanctions and put an end to the
"genocide."
</P>
<P>
Family members and relatives of these dead children shouted
slogans condemning the "inhumane actions" taken by U.S. and
British governments' against the Iraqi people and children in
particular.

lift the sanctions immediately to put an end to the suffering of
the Iraqi Children.
</P>
<P>
More than 1 million Iraqi children have reportedly died due to
the acute shortage of food and medicine caused by the
U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Armenia Returns WWII Booty to Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Armenia Monday returned to Germany a
total of 575 pieces of German cultural treasures seized by the
former Soviet Union after World War II.
</P>
<P>
The returned treasures include valuable books, manucripts and
music records. Most of them had been removed shortly before the end
of the war from libraries in large German cities to avoid allied
air bombings and hidden in rural areas where they were seized by
Soviet troops after 1945.
</P>
<P>
Armenia is the second former Soviet republics to return war
booty to Germany after Georgia.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that this is a signal for other countries," said Kinkel
Monday in Bonn in a clear reference to Russia, which still holds
most of the so-called "booty art" seized from Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
Although Russian President Boris Yeltsin has agreed to return
the art works, the Russia parliament has so far asserted Moscow's
ownship.
</P>
<P>
Many Russians view the art as legitimate compensation for the
wartime suffering of the Soviet people and for the many Russian
treasures destroyed during the German invasion.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Vice President Meets U.N. Chief's Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan on Monday met with Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's Special Envoy in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ramadan mentioned the Iraqi leadership's
open letter to the U.N. Security Council early this month, and
reiterated the threat that if Iraq gets no positive response, its
relation with the Security Council will be harmed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has demanded the Council to remove the nearly eight-year
old crippling sanctions in recognition of Iraq's compliance with
the relevant U.N. resolutions and its fulfillment of obligations.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council last week decided to keep the sanctions in
place, on the basis of the assessment of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq that there has been
"virtually no progress" in verifying Baghdad's banned weapon-free
claims.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler said Iraq failed to come up with
sound evidence to substantiate its claims that it has dismantled
all nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as ballistic
missiles.
</P>
<P>
However, Ramadan told the special envoy that Iraq had exposed
the lies and allegations written in the half-yearly UNSCOM report
submitted by Butler to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The report is a political one instead of a technical one, and
reveals Butler's ill intentions, Ramadan said.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq will continue to expose the anti-Iraq policy
pursued by the American and British governments and Butler, which
aims to maintain the embargo and continue aggressions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Shah praised Iraq's cooperation with the United
Nations, pointing out that many members in the Security Council
believe that progress has been made through the Iraqi cooperation
with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy said the atmosphere now is to the advantage
of Iraq and more positive than several months ago.
</P>
<P>
During the latest Iraq-U.N. weapons inspection crisis, the
United States and Britain threatened military action to force Iraq
to open its presidential sites suspected of hiding prohibited
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
Under the Annan-brokered agreement which defused the crisis in
February, a special group of senior U.N. diplomats and UNSCOM
inspectors visited all the eight presidential sites, but found no
banned weapons or materials.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov on
Monday sent a massage to Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
expressing regret over the capture of Russian presidential envoy
to Chechnya, the Itar-Tass news agency reported from Grozny.
</P>
<P>
According to Chechen press secretary Mairbek Vachagayev, the
Chechen president in his massage said that the organizers and
perpetrators of the political provocation had the purpose to
complicate relations between Moscow and Grozny and aggravate the
situation in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov meanwhile briefed Yeltsin on the measures taken by
the Chechen police to find and release Russian envoy Valentin
Vlasov.
</P>
<P>
He as well expressed hope that the incident will not
complicated the bilateral relations between Russia and Chechnya
and that through joint efforts Chechen and Russian law enforcers
"will detain and keep most severely, no matter where they come
from."
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov assured Yeltsin that he personally controls the
entire operation for finding and freeing Vlasov and will do his
utmost for the speedy liberation of the envoy.
</P>
<P>
Vlasov was kidnapped on May 1 on his way from Grozny to
Nazzran, and his whereabouts is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held Monday with prefects and clergymen in Grozny
the Chechen president urged the public to unite and rebuff the
criminal world.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
will testify on Tuesday at a public hearing of the information
commission of the French National Assembly on Rwanda, reported
Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine will be the first government minister in service to be
summoned by the information commission. He will answer questions
concerning the role played by France in Rwanda from 1990 to 1994,
during which time he served as secretary general of President
Francois Mitterrand.
</P>
<P>
In his book entitled ""the World of Francois Mitterrand,"
Vedrine said that it is ""false, absurd and disgraceful" to
accuse France of deliberately supporting" Rwandan President
Juvenal Habyarimana.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary commission will also summon on Wednesday
Admiral Jacques Lanxade, former chief of staff of the French armed
forces under President Mitterrand, at a public hearing.
</P>
<P>
Three other military personalities who participated in the
""Noroit" military operation staged by French troops from August
1988 to July 1991 in Rwanda will also testify at a separate
closed-door hearing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The commission earlier summoned former Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur and three former ministers in his government, as well as
the son of President Mitterrand Jean-Christophe Mitterrand who
served as advisor on African affairs of his father, for testifying
on the role played by France in Rwanda before and during the 1994
genocide against Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
All of them denied any involvement by France in the genocide,
in which about one million people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government accuses France of ""having Rwandan blood
on its hand."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Backs Russian Proposal for Demilitarization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government backs the
Russian proposal that Cyprus must be demilitarized and an
international force must be set up on the island, a government
spokesman said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Christos Stylianides
said a Russian proposal for demilitarization and transforming the
U.N. peace-keeping force into an international force, contains
elements which President Glafcos Clerides outlined in his proposal
 for the demilitarization of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Clerides put forward his proposal to the U.N. Secretary-General
in December 1993 and suggested that the National Guard and the
Turkish Cypriot armed forces be disbanded in parallel with the
withdrawal of Turkish forces from Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also calls for the delivery of armaments to the
U.N. peace-keeping force for custody and the establishment of a
fund where money saved from disbanding the armed forces should be
deposited for the benefit of both communities.
</P>
<P>
"Our firm policy was and continues to be the demilitarization
of Cyprus and the presence of an international force with terms of
reference from the Security Council," Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian proposal, he added, is "an indication of the
interest of the Russian Federation, a permanent member of the
Security Council, and the great important of the idea for
demilitarizing Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman's comments came following a failure of the
U.S. envoy for Cyprus, Richard Holbrook's attempt to resume the
intercommunal negotiations.
</P>
<P>
After a three-day shuttle diplomacy on the island, Holbrooke
admitted Monday that the two preconditions put forward by the
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash could not allow peace
negotiations to resume.
</P>
<P>
The Russian proposal, submitted on April 24, notes that the
purpose of demilitarization is "to create in Cyprus an equal
level of security for all inhabitants and an atmosphere of
genuine mutual trust and cooperation between the two communities
within the framework of a federal Cypriot state."
</P>
<P>
The demilitarization will be effected by means of an agreed
system of international guarantees under the auspices of the
Security Council, it adds.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops on the island and took over the northern third
following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained about 40,000 troops in northern part
of the island, which was declared by Turkish Cypriots in 1983
as a breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", recognized
only by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> French Communists Call for Strict Control of Lay-offs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The deputies of the French Communist
Party (PCF) in the National Assembly Monday presented a draft law
to fight against social exclusion, in which they urged a strict
control of lay-offs of workers by enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The PCF deputies said that unemployment is the primary cause of
poverty in France and that there can be no efficient fight against
unemployment without a strict control on lay-offs of workers by
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no lasting fight to lower unemployment rate
without fighting the lay-offs, and in the first place operate a
strict control on the lay-offs," they said.
</P>
<P>
France's unemployment rate now stands at 12 percent, which
means that around three million people of working age remain
jobless.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly will begin to discuss the draft law from
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The PCF deputies proposed that the government impose more taxes
on those enterprises which make great profits but are laying off
workers.
</P>
<P>
They also proposed that the government subsidize new fund to
help young people look for jobs, provide free transports to the
unemployed, and offer more financial support to build public
residences.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Fails to Curb HIV/AIDS: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma
admitted Monday that her department had failed to curb the spread
of HIV/AIDS in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the department's budget vote in parliament in Cape
Town, Zuma said HIV/AIDS had become "a very serious problem which
was threatening to destroy the socio-economic fabric of the
country.
</P>
<P>
"We admit we have not been successful in curbing the spread of
HIV/AIDS," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Health Department said earlier it intended to make AIDS
disease and deaths notifiable by law this year.
</P>
<P>
This would ensure that the necessary information could be
collected for planning and the provision of adequate services,
the department said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to successes of the Health Department, Zuma said the
dire shortage of doctors, especially in rural areas, had been
alleviated through government-to-government agreements, while a
permanent solution was being sought with the introduction of
community service for young doctors as from July this year.
</P>
<P>
The South African government headed by President Nelson
Mandela has promised to make health care accessible to all those
South Africans who had disabilities.
</P>
<P>
Of the 35,000 wheelchairs needed by 1997, 28,530 had been
delivered. Of the 800 hearing aids needed for 1997, the
government had delivered 732, the department said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Further OPEC Production Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday expressed welcome to
further oil production cuts by members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in order to shore up oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
"Iran welcomes any further production cuts by the OPEC members
to stabilize the oil market," Ali Akbar Gharni, an official from
the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) in charge of the OPEC
affairs, was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gharni said that cooperation among the OPEC member states to
honor the production quotas will help stabilize the oil prices,
adding that Iran is abiding by its quota reduction fixed by OPEC
in March.
</P>
<P>
In order to strengthen oil prices, the OPEC ministerial
meeting decided to cut a total of 1.245 million barrels per day
(bpd) while Iran promised to cut its crude output by 140,000 bdp.
</P>
<P>
"After OPEC announcement on production cut, the oil prices
rose by two dollars per barrel" to reach 13 dollars, he said,
predicting that the price for OPEC crude basket will maintain
13-14 dollars per barrel this year.
</P>
<P>
The NIOC director of international affairs and crude marketing
Hojjatollah Ghanimifard confirmed on Saturday that Iran has cut
oil output by 140,000 bpd from April 1 according to the OPEC
decision.
</P>
<P>
As the world's third largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia
and Norway, Iran relies on petrodollars for around 80 percent of
its hard currency earnings and up to 40 percent of government
revenues on a production quota of 3.6 million bpd in 1997 and 3.94
million bpd in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, oil prices plunged to the lowest point in more
than nine years, inflicting a serious blow to Iran's ailing
economy.
</P>
<P>
Expecting more badly-needed petrodollars, Iran hopes the OPEC
members agree on a new round of production reduction in the June
meeting in Vienna when it will decide on the production quotas for
the next six months.

<HEADLINE> Greece Says Disappointed With Impasse of Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday voiced its regret and
disappointment with the impasse of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas described the
conditions raised by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash during
talks with U.S. presidential emissary for Cyprus, Richard
Holbrooke, as "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Denktash reportedly insisted that he would not return to the
negotiating table unless his northern Cyprus was recognized and
the Republic of Cyprus stopped its efforts to join the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman said that the Russian proposal for the
demilitarization of Cyprus displayed the interest of Moscow in
disarmament and included points which Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides had put forward in the past.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive-coup
backed by Athens.
</P>
<P>
To protest against the EU's decision to include Cyprus in the
list of countries waiting to join the community, northern Cyprus
suspended its talks with Cyprus for the settlement of the
protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece, Cyprus' major supporter, warned in recent days that if
anyone tried to create problems over Cyprus' accession to the EU,
there would be no EU enlargement.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Chiefs of Defense Staff Meet on S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The chiefs of defense staff from west
African countries began to draw a plan Monday to consolidate
security in war-ravaged Sierra Leone after the successful
reinstatement of the elected government to power.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, held in the Ghanaian capital Accra, is
expected to enable the chiefs of defense staff to make
recommendations to their heads of state on the future role of the
sub-regional peace-keeping force ECOMOG in securing a durable
peace in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Some of the issues that should be addressed at the meeting,
according to Ghana's foreign minister, include the objectives
insisted to achieve the role of ECOMOG, the rules of engagement,
the strength of the force required and the resources needed for
the task.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Timothy Shelpidi of
Nigeria said in addition to 10,000 troops already on the ground,
at least 6,000 soldiers and logistics are required to commission
the job.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional force dislodged the military junta in
mid-February which paved the way for the return of Sierra Leone's
legitimate government, ousted in a coup last May, from exile in
neighboring Guinea in March.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is now carrying out a final campaign to mop up the
remnants of the junta and allied rebels in eastern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The force earlier completed its peace keeping mission in
Liberia, ensuring a successful election of the post-war
government of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the security situation in both countries may still
have an impact particularly on the fragile economy of west
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the pledge of the international community to
assist the restoration of democracy in Sierra Leone, The United
Nations appealed in March for a three-month emergency support of
11 million U.S. Dollars for Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
However, U.N. Special Envoy to Sierra Leone Francis Okello
disclosed at the meeting Monday morning that only 1.9 million
Dollars had been in place so far.
</P>
<P>
It was one thing to restore the government and quite another
to consolidate the peace, he said, quoted by a British
Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
But the Ghanaian minister added that he was confident that the
donor countries would not let Sierra Leoneans down.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by representatives of only seven out
of the 16 member countries of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS), according to the report.
</P>
<P>
However, a delegate was quoted as saying that this did not
necessarily translate into apathy on the part of the countries
that were absent.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Moves for W. Central African Shipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has initiated
moves to establish a coastal shipping company in the west and
central African sub-region in a bid to boost trade in this area.
</P>
<P>
So far the preliminary stage for the setting up of the company
has been completed, according to Transport Minister Maj.-Gen.
Ibrahim Gumel.
</P>
<P>
"Government has created the enabling framework for the company
to be established and has equally sensitized the nations in the
sub-region on the need for the company," Gumel said here over the
weekend, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria Monday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Nigerian government is committed to the
objectives of trade liberalization and economic integration,
particularly as it affects the west and central African
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
"But for our country to benefit from the gains of economic
integration, we must have our own facilities to service the trade
in the sub-region," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said Nigeria must position itself to take advantage of the
large volume of consignments that pass through its territorial
waters as trans-shipment cargos.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, the government has begun to review the
national shipping policy.
</P>
<P>
"In so doing, government is not loosing sight of the need to
harmonize all national shipping policies within a broad policy
for the west and central African sub-region."
</P>
<P>
Gumel also urged a strong presence of relevant enforcement
agencies for a round-the-clock surveillance at the sea ports of
Nigeria to keep them perfectly safe for ships, cargos and lives.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the major threats to maritime trade
in Nigeria include piracy, smuggling and pilfering, as well as
pollution of the sea and channels, and more recently drug
trafficking and toxic waste dumping.

<HEADLINE> Israel Positive in Trade Talks with Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli officials Monday sent positive
signals to Jordan's demands for expanding exports to the
Palestinian self-rule areas and enlarging a Jordanian-Israeli
industrial zone, Jordan's official news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordan stressed the importance of putting more Jordanian goods
on the A1 and A2 lists between the Palestinians and the Israelis,
which allow duty-free exports to the Palestinian markets,
Jordanian Minister of Trade, Commerce and Supply Hani Mulqi said.
</P>
<P>
Among the Jordanian products destined for the Palestinian
markets through the two lists include cement, fruits, vegetables
and minerals, Mulqi said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side responded positively to the request, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mulqi held talks with his Israeli counterpart Natan Sharansky
on bilateral trade during the day in Petra, a town about 240
kilometers south of Amman.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Jordanian side also asked to expand the
Qualified Industrial Zone (QIZ) in Irbid, some 80 kilometers north
of the Jordanian capital, whose products can be exported to the
United States duty-free.
</P>
<P>
"The Jordanian side expressed the willingness to extend the
QIZ to other areas in the future so that there will be more
factories to be established in the kingdom to benefit from
privileges given to the QIZ," Mulqi said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have also expressed readiness to accept the
demand, he added.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Jordan and Israel agreed on the need to put technical
standards and specifications on the companies in the QIZ, so that
their products can be really qualified for the duty-free
treatment, according to the Jordanian minister.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's exports to the Palestinian self-rule areas reached 12
million U.S. dollars in 1997 and its imports stood at 22.9 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accused Israel of trying maintain
monopoly of the Palestinian markets, as only 5 percent of the
Palestinian imports have come from countries other than Israel.

<HEADLINE> Drug Trafficking Increases in Africa: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations agency has
found that Africa is likely to emerge as a key transit region for
traffickers of drugs such as cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. International Drug Control Program (UNDCP) cited weak
law enforcement structures, acute economic, political and social
problems and the strengthening of legal controls in other parts of
the world as the reasons for the situation.
</P>
<P>
In its note to correspondents here on Monday, the UNDCP said it
will enlighten the press on the situation at a briefing on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Already South Africa, Kenya and some West-African countries
are being used by international trafficking syndicates," the UNDCP
said.
</P>
<P>
It said: "resource and technical constraints make it difficult
for law enforcement agencies to take effective action against
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
"Leakage from drug trafficking through sub-Saharan Africa into
local communities and major cities is exacerbating the social
problems associated with poverty, political and tribal conflicts
and the spread of HIV/AIDS infection."
</P>
<P>
The briefing serves as a lead-up event to the Special Session
of the General Assembly on Drugs, which will take place in New
York from June 8-10.
</P>
<P>
Thirty heads of state and government have confirmed their
attendance with more expected, according to UNDCP.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Critical of U.S. Envoy's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
Monday expressed disappointment with remarks of United States
presidential envoy for Cyprus Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made a statement that Holbrooke has misinterpreted his
position on the intercommunal talks, stressing that he has never
ceased to represent the Republic of Cyprus, which is recognized
internationally.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before leaving here after a failed,
three-day mediation mission, Holbrooke said that "no one can
dispute that Glafcos Clerides does not represent or has control
over the people of northern Cyprus. He does not deny that, that is
a fact."
</P>
<P>
Clerides' statement underlined that "the President of the
Republic has never accepted that the relevant article of the 1960
Constitution, which specifies that he represents the Republic of
Cyprus, has ceased to be valid."
</P>
<P>
Clerides "regrets that it was not possible during the
consulations with Mr. Holbrooke for progress to be made in the
process for a solution to the Cyprus problem," the statement read.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Turkish Cypriots insisted on "unreasonable
demands," namely the recognition of the Turkish entity in northern
Cyprus, the withdrawal of the application of Cyprus for European
Union membership and the lifting of trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
During his shuttle diplomacy, Holbrooke tried but failed to get
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash back to
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' peace process came to a standstill last summer when
Denktash, angered by European Union's decision to open accession
negotiations with Cyprus, walked out of talks with Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since Turkey landed its troops and
took over the northern third after a failed coup by Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece in 1974.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Insist on Two States on Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash said on Monday that his followers will not give up
their principle of two states in Cyprus, according to a
report reaching here from Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Following his talks with U.S. president's Special Envoy
Richard Holbrooke on the divided island, Denktash told reporters
that the reason why no progress was reached concerning the Cyprus
issue during the visit of Holbrooke is the refusal of Greek
Cypriot side to recognize the Turkish Cypriot entity.
</P>
<P>
Denktash stressed that Holbrooke showed to the Greek Cypriot
side that the U.S. can not persuade the Turkish Cypriot side to
accept the views of the Greek Cypriots by force.
</P>
<P>
"We could not make the world recognize our sovereignty for 24
years, but we will not give up our principle of two states on the
island", said the Turkish Cypriot leader.
</P>
<P>
He said that the refusal to recognize the Turkish Cypriot
people as a community and treating them as second class citizens
are mistakes which will impede the solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Denktash stressed that he will not participate in any kind of
negotiation which aims to bargain the sovereignty of the Turkish
Cypriots with the S-300 missiles scheduled to be deployed on the
divided island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island after a failed pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been trying to reunify the
island under the bizonal and bicommunal formula proposed by the
United Nations. But so far no tangible results have been
achieved.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on the same day at the
end of his visit, Holbrooke said that Denktash demanded his
entity in northern Cyprus be recognized and Cyprus suspend its
accession talks with the European Union before the peace talks
can be resumed.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke ended his three-day shuttle mission in Nicosia
without succeeding to get Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and
Denktash back to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared the breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which is only
reconized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> WTO Director-General Hopes to See China's Early Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Renato Ruggiero said here on Monday that he and
the WTO members hoped that China would join the WTO as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in the WTO believes that we need to have China in
the WTO because without China we will not have a world system,"
Ruggiero said when answering a question by Xinhua. "So it is
absolutely necessary to have China in the WTO."
</P>
<P>
"I do believe that it is in the interest of China to be in the
WTO as soon as possible in order that China can participate to the
improvement of the trading system for the 21st century," the WTO
director-general said.
</P>
<P>
However, Ruggiero said that China and those wishing to join the
WTO should also agree to abide by the rules and disciplines of the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
"We are making progress with China," Ruggiero said. "As for
when China will join the WTO, we really mean as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
But he declined to give a date or timetable for China's WTO
accession.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview, Ruggiero said that he hoped that China
would participate, as a full member of the WTO, in new round of
negotiations on services starting in 2000 according to the WTO
built-in agenda.
</P>
<P>
Besides China, there are 30 others negotiating their accession
to the 132-member WTO.

<HEADLINE> UAE Banks Dollars in Lebanon to Support Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
on Monday announced that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has agreed
to deposit 100 million U.S. dollars in Lebanon's central bank to
support the country's currency.
</P>
<P>
Hariri made the announcement at the end of the weekly cabinet
session. He added that the loan, which carries a low interest rate
for a period of three years, will be transferred to the Bank of
Lebanon on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the loan was signed in UAE Monday by Lebanon's
central bank governor Riyad Salama and the representative of the
president of Abu Dhabi National Bank Mohammed Hablush, reported
Lebanon's National News Agency.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Salama as saying that the agreement shows
international confidence in Lebanon's currency and the future of
its economy at large.
</P>
<P>
The loan is the third one in less than a year with the same
purpose of shoring up the Lebanese pound. Saudi Arabia granted
Lebanon 600 million U.S. dollars at the end of last year and
Kuwait, 250 million dollars early this year.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese currency is under heavy devaluation pressure due
to the difficult economy and political uncertainty in anticipation
of the late-May local elections, the first in 35 years, and the
presidential election in October.

<HEADLINE> Greece Welcomes EU Statements on Greek Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday welcomed the European
Union's statements on the economic progress Greece has made in the
past months, saying that such statements were "a recognition of
the effectiveness of Athens' policies and encouragement for the
Greek government to continue its efforts towards the entry into
the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
In a weekend statement issued in Brussels, the EU finance
ministers expressed their satisfaction over the determination of
the Greek government to implement its policy on fiscal
restructuring and structural adjustment to enable Greece to
participate in the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in
January 2001.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that the Greek
government was confident that it would meet the Maastricht
criteria in 2001 as ensuring social cohesion and unity.
</P>
<P>
Greece would submit a revised two-year economic convergence
plan to the EU by the end of May ahead of the planned adoption of
the euro in 2001, he added.
</P>
<P>
The new plan to align with other EU economies would carry an
extension to 2000 and take into account a devaluation of the Greek
drachma by 14 percent on March 14 that based entry into the
exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
</P>
<P>
Of the 15 EU members, Greece is now the only country which will
not join the EMU in January 1999 because it has failed to meet the
convergence criteria.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Web Users Continue to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The population of U.S. Web users
grew by 1.6 million to over 57 million from January to April of
this year, according to a market research firm.
</P>
<P>
ReleavantKnowledge Inc., which based its research on interviews
with 10,000 people, including users and non-users, and on
demographic profiles of 1,440 Web users, said that the growth can
be attributed to an heightened awareness of the power and
offerings of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
While the growth was slower than in past studies, users are
using the Net more and more in their everyday lives for commerce,
entertainment and information, the firm said.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that men composed 56 percent of the Web
audience. About 48 percent of the U.S. population is male.
</P>
<P>
The 18-34 age group comprised the largest single age group
online, making up 39 percent of the Web universe,
RelevantKnowledge said, although it accounts for only 30 percent
of the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
Industry watchers believe that the continued growth of the
online population is essential if the Internet is to become a
truly mass medium. Most sites now rely on advertising to bring in
revenues. But experts say such ads can only become a significant
source of funds once the audience reaches a critical mass.
</P>
<P>
Different sources estimate worldwide Web users differently. One
estimation is 119 million by April 1998, or 2.4 percent of the
total world population.

AMMAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan, Saudi Arabian
King Fahd Ibn Abdul Aziz and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
Monday expressed hope that the Palestinian and Israeli leaders
will come out of the London meeting with a breakthrough in the
stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
In his separate telephone calls to Fahd and Mubarak, Hussein
hoped that the London meeting will be successful and the peace
process see some new lights, particularly on the
Palestinian-Israeli track.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu are now in London meeting U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright separately to find a way out for the impasse of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Fahd echoed the king's hope that the meeting should achieve
tangible progress for the peace process on the Palestinian-Israeli
track and a just, comprehensive peace be reached in the region,
Jordan's official news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak on his side also responded positively saying that the
meeting should help avoid any setback or diversion that might
befall the peace march and push it astray from its right course.
</P>
<P>
All the three leaders expressed their satisfaction with and
support for the Palestinians' positive response to a proposal put
forward by the United States to Israel to evacuate from some 13
percent of the occupied Palestinian land in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has reportedly accepted the proposal, while Netanyahu
rejected it, insisting that Israel can evacuate from no more
than 9 percent of the land.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been deadlocked since
last March due to the expansion of Jewish settlements in Arab
East Jerusalem and other Israeli hardline policies.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Officials Urged to Beware of HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of the
Zanzibar government have been challenged to enhance awareness of
the hazard of HIV/AIDS and ensure that the scourge does not
necessarily drain meager financial resources of the isles.
</P>
<P>
The challenge was delivered Monday by the chief minister,
Mohammed Bilal, when opening a five-day workshop on HIV/AIDS and
socio-economic development in the isles, according to a report
reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"For us in Africa, AIDS is always around the corner and the
majority of people who are infected do not know that they have
contracted the deadly disease," Dr Bilal told senior government
officials at the Breeze Beach Club.
</P>
<P>
"This is true for Zanzibar," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bilal said it is disheartening to note that the epidemic has
produced devastating effects in Africa, where people have the
lowest per capita income in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said it is necessary to sensitize the people to the hazard
of AIDS and make them know how it is so easy and unexpecting to
contract HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The seminar has been organized by the Zanzibar AIDS control
program and is being funded by the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
The objective of the workshop is to create awareness among and
impart the basic knowledge to officials at the Zanzibar
government on the varied dimensions and implications of HIV/AIDS
and its impact on social development.
</P>
<P>
Similar workshops involving senior officials have already been
conducted in various sub-Saharan African countries including
Malawi, Zambia and Burkina Faso.

<HEADLINE> Fire Destroys Beijing's Largest Furniture Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A major fire engulfed the Yuquanying
Furniture Center, the largest furniture market in Beijing, at
around 17:30 (Beijing time) today and totally destroyed the
complex.
</P>
<P>
The center complex, covering 17,000 sq.m., is located in the
southwestern Fengtai District some 10 km from Tian'anmen Square.
</P>
<P>
The major portion of the structure was destroyed and most
furniture sustained heavy damage. "Combustible materials used to
construct the market halls fueled the blaze," according to a
fire-fighter.
</P>
<P>
Local fire departments responded to the fire immediately after
receiving reports at around 18:00. Some 70 emergency vehicles
went to the scene and fire-fighters extinguished the inferno
shortly before 7:00 this evening.
</P>
<P>
Heavy black smoke could be seen from Tian'anmen Square in the
center of the Chinese Capital. Fire-fighters prevented the blaze
from spreading water to surrounding buildings.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 onlookers and automobiles blocked access to
the area and law enforcement personnel prevented curious
onlookers, reporters and insurance inspectors from entering into
the site.
</P>
<P>
No casualties have been reported, according to a Fengtai
official. The fire was brought under control and officials from
concerned departments are currently investigating the cause.
</P>
<P>
The local public security bureau confirmed the blaze, but
refused to disclose further details.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the Beijing Fengtai Hospital were not called to the
scene. However, large numbers of fire-fighters, law enforcement
personnel and government officials immediately responded to the
scene.

<HEADLINE> UK Farmers Disappointed by EU Ruling on Beef Export Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's National Farmers Union
(NFU) expressed its disappointment on Tuesday over a European
Court of Justice ruling to maintain the ban on British beef
exports.
</P>
<P>
NFU president Ben Gill said in a statement that the farmers
were disappointed by the EU ruling and would continue their
efforts to get the ban lifted.
</P>
<P>
"The UK now has the toughest anti-BSE controls anywhere in the
world - it is only a matter of time before Europe must lift this
ban," Gill said.
</P>
<P>
He said the NFU was confident that the great progress now being
made meant the lifting of the ban was in sight.
</P>
<P>
The European Court of Justice on Tuesday upheld the European
Commission's right to ban British beef exports in March 1996 over
mad cow disease (BSE), ruling against Britain which challenged the
decision's validity.
</P>
<P>
There were two separate but related cases against the
Commission brought by the British government and others including
the UK's National Farmers Union, which has argued the ban did
irreparable damage to the country's livestock industry.
</P>
<P>
The European Union banned the British beef export in March 1996
after the British government admitted a possible link between mad
cow disease or BSE and a new variant of the human brain-wasting
condition Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD).

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton has agreed to nominate a conservative judge selected by a
Republican Senator to a federal appeals court in exchange for the
confirmation of one of his nominees, the New York Times reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will nominate Barbara Durham, the chief judge of the
Washington state Supreme Court, to the ninth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, the Times quoted unidentified sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
In return, Senate Republicans will no longer stall William
Fletcher's appointment to the same appeals panel.
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, 52, a friend of Clinton who teaches law at the
University of California at Berkeley, has been waiting for the
appointment for more than three years.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans also agreed to stop blocking confirmation of
other Clinton nominees, the Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Presidents have traditionally handled nominees to federal
appeals courts.
</P>
<P>
Senate and administration sources told the Times the deal was
made to a large extent with Senator Slade Gorton, a Republican who
insisted that the president nominate Durham.
</P>
<P>
Some Washington state newspapers have called Durham, 55, the
most conservative judge on the state's high court.
</P>
<P>
The ninth Circuit is the largest of 13 regional courts which
are just below the U.S. Supreme Court. It covers nine western
states and two territories.

GENEVA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A group of Swiss politicians and

HONG KONG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A bridge linking the urban areas
of Hong Kong and Kowloon to the Western "New Territories" and the
Lantau Island, where the new airport is located, opened
Tuesday and will be put to use Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony Tuesday evening, Leung
Kwok-sun, director of highways of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, said that Ting Kau Bridge has advanced the
design and construction techniques of major cable-stayed bridges.
</P>
<P>
The bridge has introduced for the first time the economy

</P>
<P>
There are altogether three such pylons, being a rare double
main span cable-stayed bridge. The separate main decks are
suspended on both sides of the three bridge pylons.
</P>
<P>
Each deck carries three traffic lanes and a hard shoulder. With
main spans of 448 meters and 475 meters, and a total cable
supported length of 1,177 meters, the Ting Kau Bridge ranks among
the longest cable-stayed bridges in the world.

<P>
The project cost 1.73 billion HK dollars (222 million U.S.
dollars) and took 44 months to complete.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Ng, secretary for transport, said that the completion
of the Ting Kau Bridge clearly demonstrates the government's firm
commitment to providing a comprehensive transport infrastructural
network that will sustain and further improve economic
development, land use and hosing development in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Addresses Reform of Grain Marketing System (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Delegates agreed that the high growth rate for the national
economy accompanied by low inflation and successive good grain
harvests, an abundant market supply and basically stable prices
have created a good macro-environment for deepening reform.
</P>
<P>
The government has also gained experience in efficiently
regulating the grain market.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji urged concerned government departments to
refrain from directly interfering in the market activities of
grain companies, and noted that state-owned grain firms must
compete on the market and halt the practice of administrative
roles.
</P>
<P>
The central government will concentrate on the macro-control of
the national grain supply, while local governments will be
responsible for regional grain production and circulation, said
Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Grain reserves by the central government must be
separated from local grain reserves, and efforts must be
made to accelerate improvements in both central and local grain
reserve systems, according to the premier
</P>
<P>
"Under normal conditions, grain prices will be mainly set
by market supply and demand," said Zhu, adding that grain
companies should sell grain at market prices.
</P>
<P>
Zhu stressed that state-owned grain companies must play their
role as the main channel of grain marketing, and noted that
private firms will be strictly prohibited from directly purchasing
grain from rural markets.
</P>
<P>
He termed restructuring of the grain marketing system as one of
the central government's major reform measures for this year, and
pointed to it as a major task for the year's economic work.
</P>
<P>
The policy for purchasing excessive grain products from farmers
must be followed to the letter in order to ensure farmers maintain
their initiative for growing grain, said Zhu.

During his stay here, Suharto will discuss with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak issues tabled on the summit's agenda such
as South-South cooperation in addition to the longstanding
bilateral relationship, according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first Mubarak-Suharto tete-a-tete summit in 15
years, although both of them have met at larger regional or
international conferences, said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Suharto's visit to Egypt, which will begin Monday, will also
afford a great chance to discuss the ongoing financial crisis in
Southeast Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that this visit comes at a time Indonesia is
trying to recover from the shocks of the regional economic crisis,
the ambassador expressed belief that it will mark progress in
activating bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesians can benefit from Egypt's experience with the
International Monetary Fund in economic reform, Othman said,
voicing hope that bilateral talks would narrow the gap in their
trade balance that sharply tilts to Indonesia's favor.
</P>
<P>
Three agreements will be signed between the two countries on
avoiding double taxation, cooperation between central banks and
maritime transportation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was the first country to recognize Indonesia 50 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 was founded in 1989 as an offshoot of the Non-Aligned
Movement.

The G-15 members represent the emerging economies of the Third
World. They have 30 percent of the world's population and 27
percent of the Third World land area.

<HEADLINE> Environment Network Formed for Accession Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on Tuesday
officially launched its environment network for the 11 countries
that are seeking union membership.
</P>
<P>
The network, known as AC-IMPEL, comprises officials from the
accession countries who deal with the implementation and
enforcement of environmental legislation.
</P>
<P>
The 11 accession countries are Hungary, Poland, the Czech
Republic, Estonia, Slovenia, Cyprus, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia,
Latvia and Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard, in charge of
environmental affairs, said: "The idea behind this network is a
simple and practical one. It is based on the recognition that
environmental law, which isn't implemented, is not worth the paper
it is printed on."
</P>
<P>
The commissioner stressed that both the 15-nation EU and the
accession countries had held enough talks on the environment and
it was time for genuine action.
</P>
<P>
"Action which addresses the real problems and difficulties for
the environment and does something about them. Action to control
industrial, urban and agricultural practices with an impact on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Action to monitor the quality of the air, water and soil, and
action to improve the situation where it is found not to be
acceptable," she added.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Trekking Lower on Bearish Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar shed more
than half a U.S. cent Tuesday and is expected to trek lower as
Australia's dismal trade performance continues to fuel sales of
the currency both offshore and at home.
</P>
<P>
Unfounded rumors that international ratings agency Standard &AMP;
Poor's could move to downgrade Australia's debt rating helped
drive the Australian dollar to a four month-low of 64.07 U.S.
cents Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The currency finished the local session at 64.14 U.S. cents,
from 64.65 at Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the trade figures had put Australia's exposure to
the Asian financial crisis in the spotlight in offshore markets.
</P>
<P>
"This whole Asian region is going to continue to be under the
microscope, and the prospects don't look that good for Aussie in
the short term," said Macquarie Bank associate director of foreign
exchange Brent Aggar.
</P>
<P>
"I think the sentiment is still bearish on the Aussie dollar
and I think we can expect to see it lower," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics Monday reported that the
trade deficit had blown out to a record 1.33 billion Australian
dollars (851.2 million U.S. dollars) in March, from 462 million
Australian dollars (295.6 million U.S. dollars) in February.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar closed at 85.37 from
86.08 against Japanese yen, and at 1.1431 from 1.1521 against
Deutsche marks.

<HEADLINE> UNITA's Massing of Troops Threatens Stability in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Massing of troops by the former
Angolan rebel National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) has posed great threat to the stability in the central
areas of the country, Mayor of Caala City, Paulino Maquina told
media Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maquina said that the buildup of UNITA troops to the
south of Caala City of Huambo Province has enormously endangered
the stable situation there, both militarily and politically.
</P>
<P>
The looming-up of UNITA buildup is "extremely worrisome," the
mayor said, adding that safety of people's lives and their
properties is in great danger.
</P>
<P>
The rebels ambushed the vehicles running between Caala City
and other cities. And livestocks which is urgently needed in
farming are the hot target of robberies.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the remnants of UNITA troops launched attacks
in the suburb of Caala last Friday, killing three clan leaders
and forcing many villagers to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA remnants took Kuale Town in Malanje Province Sunday,
the Angolan News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the operation, the mayor of the town and two national
policemen were missing, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The police commander responsible for Malanje Province held
that they had been kidnaped by the UNITA troops.
</P>
<P>
This has been the second time that UNITA troops occupied Kuale
since the local government was reestablished early this year in
the town.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA troops blew up Lucala Bridge near the town in a bid
to resist the counterattack of the Angolan government army, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
Disturbing situation has lasted for quite a long time in the
central Angola. Both the Angolan government and the
United Nations observer missions have repeatedly stressed that
measures should be taken to crack down on the organized
criminals, and armed patroling has since been strengthened in the
areas.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia's new cabinet, with just two
or three posts still to be filled, has been granted more power and
independence from President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who met Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko Tuesday to
decide on the last appointments, promised that Russia's new
government apparatus would be half the size of the outgoing one,
said Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also said he had granted the new government more power
by issuing a decree.
</P>
<P>
"Everything has been going through presidential structures. We
believed that this order was better, but it has proved bad," he
said.
</P>
<P>
That system had been "abolished", he said.
</P>
<P>
A basic agreement on relations between the presidential
agencies and the government had been signed earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under new rules, Yeltsin said Premier Sergei Kiriyenko "will
simply sign documents and the Cabinet will be responsible for
their implementation".
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also discussed with Kiriyenko "current issues" such as
wages, the funding of the army and the procedure of funding all
state organs.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday was the third time Yeltsin and Kiriyenko had announced
new members of the reshuffled government.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of cabinet members, including two deputy prime
ministers, were appointed on April 28. And the second, including a
deputy prime minister and 10 ministers, were appointed on April
30.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland to Raise Spending on Government Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Despite warnings by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) against increasing public
expenditure, the Swazi government is to spend 18 million Rand
(3.6 million U.S. Dollars) this year on housing public servants.
</P>
<P>
Accountant-general David Dlamini recently disclosed that the
government had only 2.8 million Rand (560,000 Dollars) in rentals
for existing government housing, South African Press Association
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was due to the failure of the government to update
rentals charged to public servants, Dlamini said.
</P>
<P>
He said that they were paying between 60 Rand (12 Dollars) and
100 Rand (20 Dollars) a month for houses which would fetch up to
3000 Rand (600 Dollars) a month on the open market.
</P>
<P>
Many public servants are reported to be subletting rooms in
their government-owned houses and using the proceeds to buy their
own houses.

HONG KONG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation
(HKMC) purchased or undertook to purchase 3.2 billion HK dollar
(410 million U.S. dollars) floating rate mortgages by the end of
March this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a 1997 annual report published by the HKMC here
Tuesday, the HKMC also launched a pilot scheme for promoting fixed
rate mortgages on March 18 this year.
</P>
<P>
On the funding side, the report said that the HKMC signed an
agreement with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to appoint the
latter as the arranger, custodian, agent and operator of a 20
billion HK dollar (2.56 billion U.S. dollars) HKMC Note Issuance
Program on 6 January 1998.
</P>
<P>
Two issues had been launched so far which were very well
received by the market, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Donald Tsang, chairman of the Board of Directors of the HKMC,
said in the report that the incorporation of the HKMC in March
last year marked an important milestone in the development of the
residential mortgage market in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
As a pioneer institution, the HKMC provides an important piece
of market infrastructure to kick-start and promote the development
of a secondary mortgage market in Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Board and the Management of the HKMC look forward to
working closely with the banking community and the capital market
participants to develop a healthy and robust secondary mortgage

<HEADLINE> Well-Known Macao-Born Portuguese Welcomes Macao SARPC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A well-known Portuguese descendent
born in Macao congratulated the formation of the Macao Special
Administrative Region Preparatory Committee (SARPC) Tuesday in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Joaquim Carvalho, 45, chairman of the Islands Municipal
Council, told Xinhua Tuesday that the establishment of the SARPC
means the accomplishment of a historic task in Macao, and that he
was delighted at it.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to see that the interests of different community
groups and aspects in Macao have been taken into consideration at
the SARPC," he said. "The working procedure of the SARPC clearly
shows that the Chinese government pays special attention to the
Macao Basic Law and the policy of 'Macao people administering
Macao.'"
</P>
<P>
There are several Macao-born Portuguese (MBP) residents at the
SARPC. They include Leonel Alberto Alves, a certified lawyer, and
Raimundo Rosario, an engineer.
</P>
<P>
Born in Macao, Carvalho speaks good Cantonese and Putonghua
(spoken Chinese) as well as Portuguese. He was vice-chairman of
the Macao Municipal Council before he was appointed to the current
post.
</P>
<P>
Carvalho said the presence of MBP members at the committee
demonstrates that China respects the history of Macao and takes
care of the interests of the MBP residents.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the MBP residents are and will continue to be
an important community in Macao. He said it is his hope that the
MBP members will work for Macao's future and represent the
interests of MBP residents.
</P>
<P>
Carvalho said that he was delighted and has "full confidence"
as the Chinese government has reiterated the SARPC will not be a
second power center in Macao, thus avoiding interference in the
Portuguese administration in Macao.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Addresses Reform of Grain Marketing System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has cited
the inevitability and urgency to restructure the nation's grain
marketing system.
</P>
<P>
Reform must be carried out in line with the principles of
separation of administrative functions from State-owned
grain companies, storage from management, central from local
responsibilities and new from old accounts, as well as improving
the pricing system for the grain market, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, made the remarks at a national work conference on
restructuring the grain marketing system held between April 27-29,
</P>
<P>
The conference was the first held since the new central
government was formed early this year. Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
delivered a report on reform during the three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Reports presented during the conference indicated that China
has scored remarkable achievements in grain production in recent
years, as well as certain levels of progress in restructuring the
country's grain circulation system.
</P>
<P>
China has has established the State Special Grain Reserve
System, the Protective Pricing System, and the Grain Risk Fund,
</P>
<P>
However, the country's existing grain marketing system, which
is still a model of "sharing rice from the same big pot", features the
backward management on state grain firms, overlapping of
government and enterprise functions and overstaffing and rising
cost. Said factors have resulted in a shortage of grain purchase
funds, losses resulting from poor management and deficits which
have exceeded the financial capacity of the State.

housing, filling up of vacancies and setting up of a nursing
directorate, DNU sources said here.

JOHANNESBURG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- South African Health Minister
Nkosazana Zuma said she intended slapping a ban on tobacco
advertizing in an effort to stop the country's children from
smoking.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are underway to ban smoking in public and work places
to help reduce the dangers of passive smoking and protect the

Zuma, a medical doctor, said in a parliament debate that
although South Africa has made progress in raising people's
awareness on the dangers of smoking, 30 percent of its 41 million
people still smoke.

<P>
Zuma said her department is particularly concerned about the
number of women who smoke during pregnancy and of children who
puff in their early teens.
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys in South Africa showed seven out of 10 people
support government measures to make smoking more difficult.

<HEADLINE> ADB Finances Agriculture Reforms in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has agreed to grant a technical assistance of 900,000 U.S. dollars
to assist the Nepali government in undertaking institutional
reforms in the agriculture sector, the ADB said Tuesday in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
The technical assistance will be used in supporting the reforms
of the agriculture institutions which include the fertilizer unit
at the Agriculture Ministry, the Agriculture Inputs Corporation
and the National Food Corporation, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the assistance is also for enhancing sustainable
infrastructure development in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Nepali government launched major policy reforms
for the liberalization of the agriculture sector under the
ADB-funded second agriculture program loan and in the context of
the Agriculture Perspective Plan (APP), the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The APP, introduced in Nepal in 1997, aims to boost agriculture
production through policy and institutional reforms and investment
in specific areas such as irrigation and rural infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The bank noted that the continued stagnation in the country's
agriculture production has been attributed to ineffective public
interventions in the procurement and distribution of agriculture
inputs and outputs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sanctions, No Practical Consequence to Pakistan: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for Pakistan's Foreign
Ministry has said that "the newest (U.S.) sanctions are of no
practical consequence as the KRL (Khan Research Laboratories) has
no dealings with American firms."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was referring Tuesday to the reports about the
imposition of U.S. restrictions pertaining to the Missile
Technology Control Regime (MTCR) on the Khan Research
Laboratories, named after Pakistan's eminent scientist Dr. Abdul
Qadeer Khan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman recalled that Pakistan has, for a long time,
faced restrictions and sanctions under various U.S. laws "which
are one sided, discriminatory and unjust."
</P>
<P>
According to reports appearing on the major English newspapers
here Tuesday, the U.S. has slapped two-year sanctions against
Pakistan and a Korean organization for violating the MTCR.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. sanctions, effective from April 17, bar any U.S.
government contacts with the KRL and Korea's Changgwang Sinyong
Corporation (Mining Development Trading Corporation) of Korea for
two years, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The KRL developed and test-fired a surface-to-face missile
"Ghauri" on April 6. The missile has a range of 1,500 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
One report quoted the U.S. State Department as saying that the
sanctions were imposed because Pakistan had obtained missile parts
from Korea. Pakistan, however, has denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government had imposed similar sanctions on Pakistan
in 1991 and 1993 for allegedly receiving missile technology from
other countries.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Hopeful of Progress After Talks With Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Tuesday that he was hopeful the London peace talks
could achieve some progress in restoring the flagging Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said after a 75-minute meeting with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair early Tuesday that Israel was working to move
the process forward.
</P>
<P>
"We are working on it. We are working to move the process
forward and if everyone is committed to that, we can do it,"
Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman said that Blair and Netanyahu, who
held talks Monday, exchanged views on all issues concerning the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli government spokesman David Bar-Illan told
BBC television Tuesday morning that progress had been made Monday
and predicted that the talks would not collapse.
</P>
<P>
"I think there has been quite a bit of progress. I think it is
not going to be a dramatic breakthrough nor is there going to be a
collapse of the talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinians have accused the Israelis of blocking
the crucial London talks by refusing to accept the American peace
initiative under which Israel will have to cede another 13 percent
of West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
"It is really taking too much time. I don't think they (the
Israelis) want to go through with it," Palestinian Planning and
Coordination Minister Nabil Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian President Yasser Arafat was in a very anxious
mood, said Shaath, who was worried that the whole peace process
might "go bust".
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, whose government is
striving to revive the peace talks, is due to hold another round
of talks with Netanyahu and Arafat in a bid to broker a pact.
</P>
<P>
The crucial London talks, which started early Monday, were
forced into a second day of heated argument after Albright failed
to bridge "significant gaps" between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process was plunged into a stalemate for
more than a year due to Israel's staunchly maintained Jewish
settlement projects in defiance of the opposition by the
Palestinians.

years. He added that China still has a long way to go when
compared to developed countries.

He said the nation has developed smoothly in general terms, but
cautioned the China must be fully aware of lingering difficulties
as it continues to advance,
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely welcome comments and suggestion on our work from
foreign friends," said Li. However, with regard to actual
practice, China will proceed in line with specific conditions and
act in a prudent manner to ensure that no problems crop up in
providing subsistence for its over 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
Reid said her first visit to China has been short, but
nonetheless unforgettable, and noted that she has gained a better
understanding of China's development and changes.

meeting in Washington on Monday (early Tuesday in Indonesia) to
release immediately 989.4 million U.S. dollars as part of the
second series of its 43 billion U.S. dollar bailout package for
Indonesia. The rest of the 3 billion U.S. dollars will be released
between May and July.
</P>
<P>
The release of fresh funds is expected to open the door to
funding from bilateral donors and other multilateral institutions.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said from this month to July, Indonesia hopes to get
7.05 billion U.S. dollars in funds, including the 3 billion U.S.
dollars from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The rest is expected to come from the World Bank (one billion
dollars), Asian Development Bank (1.5 billion dollars), Japan (one
billion dollars) Malaysia (250 million dollars) and Australia (300
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Indonesia also hopes Singapore and Brunei would disburse their
loans shortly after the release of the second tranche of the IMF
aid, he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, in October last year, turned to the IMF after the
crash of the rupiah exposed weaknesses in its financial system.
</P>
<P>
It signed an economic reform package prescribed by the IMF, and
supported by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and
friendly countries, in exchange for 43 billion dollars in bailout
funds.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, the IMF disbursed the first 3 billion
dollars tranche of the bailout package.
</P>
<P>
The second tranche of the IMF aid was scheduled to be released
on March 15 but was delayed pending fresh negotiations on the
economic reform package to be implemented by Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
On April 8, the two sides signed a new agreement on the
economic and financial reforms in the country.

<HEADLINE> EU Court Rejects Britain's "Mad Cow Disease" Argument </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Court of Justice has
rejected Britain's challenge to the legality of the European
Commission ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The court stressed that the commission, the executive body of
the 15-nation European Union, had acted in the interests of public
health.
</P>
<P>
But Britain argued that the commission had exceeded its power
in imposing the ban in March 1996 after London admitted a link
between "mad cow disease" and its human variation,
Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease (CJD).
</P>
<P>
Britain also claimed the EU ban was disproportionate to the
threat to human health posed by the bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease, which
was first found in Britain in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission agreed earlier this year to allow
Northern Ireland to export certain types of beef that come from
herds with a traceable computer database to prove their BSE-free
status.
</P>
<P>
Britain has hitherto confirmed that 170,000 head of cattle had
contracted BSE and that CJD had claimed 23 people's lives so far.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A countdown board marking Macao's
return was erected at the eastern side of Tian'anmen Square here
today, 594 days before Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Sixty Macao members and 40 inland members of the Preparatory
Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR)
attended today's unveiling ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The board, 16 meters tall and 9.6 meters wide, features the
designs of golden five-pointed stars and green lotuses, the
regional emblem of the Macao SAR, and also the characters which
read "Chinese Government Resumes Exercise of Sovereignty Over
Macao."
</P>
<P>
According to a designer of the board, its design reflects the
theme of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Edmundo Ho Hau Wah, vice-chairman of the Preparatory Committee
for the Macao SAR, said that the countdown board not only reminds
the public of the time remaining prior to Macao's return to the
motherland on December 20, 1999, but also urges all members of the
Preparatory Committee to expedite work for the establishment of
the Macao SAR.

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR Preparatory Committee Holds First Plenum (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In referring to the localization of civil servants and laws,
and the status of Chinese as an official language, Qian said the
three major issues are vital to the smooth transition and the
operation of the future SAR, and the Preparatory Committee will
attach adequate importance to them.
</P>
<P>
He said the return of Macao is an important component of
China's reunification cause, and the state will adopt the same
policies, which are "one country, two systems" and "a high-degree
of autonomy," toward Macao as Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Macao is smaller than Hong Kong in area and in population, he
said, adding that with good cooperation between China and
Portugal, Macao's transition should be smoother than Hong Kong's.
</P>
<P>
Qian reminded the committee members of the special nature and
complication of the Macao question, which includes many problems
in politics, economy, law, culture and history that were not
encountered in handling Hong Kong's transition.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Preparatory Committee members to solicit opinions
and suggestions put forward by Macao compatriots and create
favorable conditions for them to participate in the preparatory
work of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
This is not only the need to fulfill the current task, but also
will lay a foundation for the realization of "Macao people
governing Macao" and "a high-degree of autonomy" after 1999, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Qian also expressed the hope to cooperate with the Portuguese
government in handling transitional issues, saying it will comply
with the fundamental interests of both countries.
</P>
<P>
The successful practice of the "one country, two systems"
policy in Hong Kong has set an example for Macao's return, he
said, and he hopes the members of the Preparatory Committee will
make concerted efforts to contribute to China's peaceful
reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was presided over by Xie Fei, vice-chairman of
the Preparatory Committee.

<HEADLINE> Establishment of Global Information Infrastructure Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Kwong Ki-chi, Secretary for
Information Technology and Broadcasting of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), called on the telecommunications
industry to cooperate in the development of a global information
infrastructure as well as human resources and information
technology education.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 4th Asian Telecommunications Industry Exchange
Forum here Tuesday, Kwong said people in the Asia-Pacific region
needed to fully equip themselves for the journey to the
information world of tomorrow. It is necessary then to construct
the information infrastructure on which all other things rely.
</P>
<P>
"Technological advances in the last decade and the anticipated
developments in the future should provide us with the capability
to fully participate in the construction of a global information
infrastructure," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is now a matter of finding the right investment climate and
incentives to build the infrastructure," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the applications which make use of the
network, would be far more important than the network itself.
</P>
<P>
Electronic commerce was expected to make the most use of the
global information infrastructure and was a likely candidate to
help finance the building of the infrastructure, he said. But
development of other applications on the infrastructure for
interpersonal interaction is equally important.
</P>
<P>
Education and manpower training in information technology and
related applications was of paramount importance in the journey to
an information society, he added.
</P>
<P>
To make Hong Kong a leader in the information world of tomorrow
and to keep it in the forefront of the world in the development of
telecommunications, the SAR government had set up the new
Information Technology and Broadcasting Bureau with overall policy
responsibility for the coordination and development of
telecommunications, information technology applications, and
broadcasting in the public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that this institutional change will enhance
coordination and efficiency in policy formulation and will help
promote the development of telecommunications, information
technology, as well as broadcasting in Hong Kong," he
said.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Hails Founding of Macao Prep Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- An editorial to be published in the
People's Daily Wednesday hails the setting up of the Preparatory
Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) today.
</P>
<P>
Now that the Preparatory Committee has been founded, the work
to establish the Macao SAR has been ushered into a new stage, the
editorial states.
</P>
<P>
"The 100 Preparatory Committee members from Macao and the
inland areas (of the motherland) will exercise the sacred
responsibilities endowed by the National People's Congress (NPC)
and its Standing Committee. The pace of Macao's steady transfer
and smooth return will be faster," the editorial states.
</P>
<P>
Macao has been China's territory since ancient times, but was
taken by Portugal in the middle of the 16th century. Through
negotiations, the two countries sealed an agreement that China
would resume sovereignty over Macao on Dec. 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
On March 31, 1993, the First Session of the Eighth NPC passed
the Basic Law of Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), which
fixed the fundamental principles concerning Macao's return to the
motherland in the form of law, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The 60 Preparatory Committee members from Macao extensively
represent the people of various social sectors in Macao, and the
40 members from China's interior areas come from departments
related to Macao affairs and scholars on Macao studies.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to see that many questions during the transfer
period of Macao have scored progress through friendly cooperation
and joint efforts between China and Portugal," the editorial
states. "But some key questions which have close links with the
transfer of power of Macao have to be addressed faster."
</P>
<P>
The editorial notes that the two sides should strengthen
cooperation and consultation in the coming 20 months to resolve
remaining questions.
</P>
<P>
Under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, Macao's
smooth return will surely be a success on the basis of broad
participation of compatriots in Macao and the active support of
people in the interior areas, the experience of Hong Kong's return
and friendly cooperation between China and Portugal, the editorial
states.

<HEADLINE> China to Automate Handling of Bulk Mail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The State Postal Bureau has decided
to phase out manual handling of bulk mail by introducing postage
machines at local post offices and offering them to users.
</P>
<P>
The decision will affect 70,000 post offices around the
country. Some 5,000 postage machines will be installed, worth
100-to-350 million yuan (12 million to 42 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Xu Kui, deputy director of the former General Administration of
Posts, said that modernization of counter service at post offices
calls for adoption of new technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Though China has already used machines to handle mail from
individual users, it still manually processes bulk mailings from
collective users such as companies and institutions.
</P>
<P>
He said that the introduction of postage machines will greatly
increase the speed of handling large batches of mail from major
users. The machines will help streamline the staff, improve the
efficiency of the post office and improve the administration of
the postage payment system, he said.
</P>
<P>
The State Postal Bureau began phasing out manual handling of
bulk mail from major users this month. It will first install
postage machines in post offices around the country and later
lease or sell them to collective users.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A new service system with the China
Construction Bank (CCB), one of the nation's four biggest
commercial banks, will allow securities investors to trade through
a current banking account.
</P>
<P>
The bank's Guangzhou branch recently took the lead in starting
the system, which eliminates the need for investors to open
stock-trading accounts with securities companies.
</P>
<P>
The system, co-developed by the CCB Guangzhou branch and the
Guangzhou-based Southern Securities Co. Ltd., now covers all CCB
subsidiaries in the city.
</P>
<P>
The securities investors need to open a current deposit account
with the city's CCB branch and apply for the securities-trading
service. They also need to sign an agreement with the securities
company to authorize the company to be their trading agent.
</P>
<P>
With the current deposit account, investors can check their
balance and their securities equity as well as their trading
record of stocks, funds and state treasury bonds. The dividends
of their stock equity will be automatically deposited into their
account.
</P>
<P>
The investors can also receive a number of other services with
the new account. They may deposit and withdraw cash at any of the
300 banking outlets in Guangzhou, get a credit card and use it in
more than 500 designated shops, and entrust the bank to pay
utilities fees on their behalf.

<HEADLINE> S. African Gold Mines Double Quarterly Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's gold mines
doubled their earnings during the last quarter, and many expect
even better results this quarter as the higher gold price feeds
through into greater profits, analysts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earnings grew from 98 million Rand (19.6 million U.S. Dollars)
to 196 million Rand (39.2 million Dollars), mainly because of a
dramatic fall in capital expenditure from 898 million Rand (179
million Dollars) to 698 million (139 million Dollars), The Star
reported.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said the fall in capital expenditure was
normal in the March quarter owing to the end of the tax year.
</P>
<P>
Profit for the gold sector as a whole rose 19 percent during
the quarter from 937 million Rand (187 million Dollars) to 1,114
million Rand (223 million Dollars), the report said.
</P>
<P>
Margins extended out from 306 Rand (61 Dollars) an ounce in
the last quarter in 1997 to 318 Rand (64 Dollars) in the first
three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
This was despite large-scale retrenchments in the industry and
deep restructuring, analysts said. Retrenchment costs were
"huge", and this led to profit before tax edging up "slightly "
from 778 million Rand (155 million Dollars) to 782 million Rand
(156 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
It would have been larger without these costs, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the other figures for the gold industry were much
improved during the quarter, with costs falling from 207 Rand
(41.4 Dollars) a ton to 202 Rand (40.4 Dollars).

<P>
MAPUTO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Despite the price drop of about 16
percent, Mozambique's cotton production is expected to rise to
80,000 tons over the 70,000 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
The price set for the year's cotton is 2,500 Meticals per
kilogram (one U.S Dollar equals about 11,650 Meticals) from the
current 3,300 Meticals a kilogram, the Mozambican Institute of
Cotton (IAM) said in a suggestion report to the government.
</P>
<P>
Eugenio Gove, director of the IAM said the reason for the
price adjustment is the low demand at the world cotton market.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is the third cotton producer in the world, with its
peak production of 140,000 tons in 1973 and the lowest annual
production of 5,200 tons in 1985, the lowest in the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 farmers are growing cotton in central and
northern part of the country, with a cotton growing acreage of

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Curb Increasing Medical Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The South African Health
Department is to introduce a legislation aimed at addressing the
rocketing health costs.
</P>
<P>
Addressing parliament during a debate on the 1998-99 health
budget Monday, Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma said the
ever-increasing medical aid costs had become "a real crisis" in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
Zuma attributed the rise in medical aid costs to, among
others, the inappropriate use of expensive technology as well as
incorrect diagnosis by doctors.
</P>
<P>
She said her department would develop a comprehensive social
security system which would help the poor.
</P>
<P>
The government reportedly would also present to parliament
tobacco bills aimed at preventing children from smoking,
protecting the right of non-smokers and helping smokers who want
to stop smoking.
</P>
<P>
Zuma also called on politicians to join the fight against
HIV-Aids and mobilize the people of the whole country to take
precautions to prevent the deadly disease from spreading.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that 1,500 people were infected daily and two
million South Africans were already infected, Zuma told
parliament.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's High Interest Rates Stall Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- South African government and
the private sector said Monday that the country's high real
interest rates and tough anti-inflation monetary policy were
getting in the way of an "investment boom".
</P>
<P>
In separate submissions to parliament, both the Trade and
Industry Department and the South African Chamber of Business
(SACOB) targeted the high real interest rates of about 10 percent
as problematic in promoting investment, job creation and growth,
Business Day paper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The department said compared with its competitors' rates of
between two and five percent, South Africa's real interest rates
are too high and are "constraining a more widespread and
substantial investment boom".
</P>
<P>
The department said evidence also disproved the theory that
high interest rates lead to more labor-intensive investment
</P>
<P>
It said the country, having had high interest rates for some
years because of concerns over inflation, should now decrease
rates rapidly, providing a boost to industry in times of low
demand.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures showed that South Africa's producer inflation
fell to a 28-year low in March at 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
SACOB said the high real cost of capital in the country, which
was 40 percent more than in Europe, was a "significant factor".
</P>
<P>
The SACOB submission noted that the Growth, Employment and
Redistribution Strategy (GEAR), the government's macro-economic
policy, set a target of five percent for the real bank rate at
the end of last year. But the rate was 8.3 percent at that time.
</P>
<P>
The rate had risen to just below 10 percent this year despite
the GEAR target of 4 percent for this year, it said.
</P>
<P>
SACOB also claimed red tape in the trade department's
administration of export and investment incentive programs had
driven investors to South Africa's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
It criticized the department's supply side measures,
particularly the tax holiday scheme, saying it was a "relatively
poor instrument for promoting investment".

TEHRAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The proven reserves of iron ores in
Iran reached 1 billion tonnes, providing the country with good
potential to develop steel industry, the morning newspaper Iran
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The daily pointed out that the abundance in iron resources has

</P>
<P>
In 1997, steel production was estimated at around 7 million

<HEADLINE> Uganda Airlines Goes Privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The sale agreement for Uganda
Airlines' shares in Entebbe Handling Services Limited (ENHAS) has
been signed in Kampala among strong protests from its staff.
</P>
<P>
The stake buyers made a two billion Ugandan Shillings (2
million U.S. Dollars) down payment for the 45 percent shares in
the company, with the Efforte Corporation and Global Airlines
holding 20 percent each and Sabena Airlines having the remaining
five percent, The New Vision paper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Privatization Unit Director Michael Opagi said the buyers were
given a maximum of three months to complete the payment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a seminar on Uganda Airlines' privatization last
Wednesday, the sale of the shares was sharply criticized by the
workers. They blamed the Privatization Unit for not consulting
the staff before selling off the shares.
</P>
<P>
The airlines' head of commercial services, Joshua Mugizi,
wondered why the Privatization Unit sold the shares at a
give-away price when Dairo Air Services was ready to offer about
6.5 billion Ugandan Shillings (6.5 million U.S. Dollars) for the
purchase.
</P>
<P>
He said Alliance Air had also planned to buy the shares at 4.5
billion Shillings (4.5 million U.S. Dollars) but they were not
considered.
</P>
<P>
But the Enterprise Development Project Executive Director
Leonard Muganwa denied ever receiving any offers from the two
airlines, arguing that ENHAS stake holders had pre-emptive rights
to acquire the shares before other interested buyers could be
invited.
</P>
<P>
The staff could not be consulted during the sale because the
divested 45 percent shares belonged to the corporation and not
workers, he added.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is currently launching a privatization drive and is
becoming more open to the outside world. It has recently decided
to sell some shares in big state-run businesses like the Uganda
Commercial Bank, Uganda Telecom and the Uganda Airlines,
attracting investors from around the world.

PARIS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Germany's ruling Christian Democratic Union (DCU) Monday
kicked off a campaign to promote the euro, in a bid to rally the
Germans around the single currency and to convince them that
Helmut Kohl is capable to run it safely in this new adventure.
</P>
<P>
But Kohl was strongly criticized by the financial circles, the
press and the oppositions for agreeing to a compromise with France
over the presidency of the European Central Bank (ECB).
</P>
<P>
-- Algerian Security Forces have killed nearly 100 Islamic
extremists over the past six days in operations against the Armed
Islamic Group in the western part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The psychodrama last weekend around the designation of the
president of the European Central Bank did not disturb the market
of exchanges and interest rates. The stocks continued to escalate
in the indexes of Wall Street, while the CAC 40 index in Paris
gained 2.4 percent and the index in Frankfurt by 4.06 percent.
</P>
<P>
-- Maurice Papon, who was former chief of the Paris Police
Department, said in an interview with Le Figaro that the figure of
casualties provided by an official report on the 1961 suppression
of Algerian demonstrators in Paris was correct. The official
report said that dozens -- instead of hundreds as some claimed --
of Algerians were killed by police on October 17 and 18, 1961,
during a crackdown on demonstrators supporting the National
Liberation Front (FLN) of Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Papon was sentenced last month to 10 years in prison for crimes
against humanity he was convicted to have committed when he was
number three of the collaborationist regime in Gironde, southwest
France, during the German occupation. He deported 6,900 Jews to
Nazi death camps from Gironde.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Olaara Otunnu, United Nations
Special Representative of the Secretary General on children and
Armed Conflict who is on a week long visit to Sri Lanka, met
foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
An official news release issued Tuesday afternoon said in his
discussion with kadirgamar, Otunnu pointed out the need to build a
positive political atmosphere in order to provide relief measures
for the victims of war.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu said that concerted post-conflict action must be taken
to address the needs of trauma, rehabilitation and psychological
healing. For this purpose action programs in the field of health,
education and social services were necessary, said the release.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar explained to Otunnu that in Sri Lanka children were
affected by the war in many ways. Children have become victims of
the conflict as a result of a father being killed or disabled by
serving in the armed forces or by living in the conflict areas.
</P>
<P>
All children who are subjected to trauma, disabilities in the
war would be the beneficiaries of a national program to be
implemented in Sri Lanka, the release was quoted the minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu appreciated the keenness of the government to have
practical measures in place as soon as possible. He undertook to
work towards obtaining the maximum support for the Sri Lankan
program from the various agencies, organizations and countries
that operate in this area.

<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao today refuted Indian Defense Minister George
Fernandes' recent remark to the effect that China is India's top
potential threat.
</P>
<P>
Such a remark is ridiculous and fragile, Zhu said at today's
news conference, adding that Fernandes' criticism of China's
relationship with other countries is also groundless fabrication.
</P>
<P>
What the Indian Defense Minister said seriously damaged the
sound environment for developing Sino-Indian relations, and the
Chinese side has to express its deep regret and dissatisfaction,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China has always sought to develop friendly,
cooperative relations with India, Pakistan, and other neighboring
countries under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
China does not pose any threat to other countries, and this
principled stance of China is open, aboveboard and also known to
all, he said.

<HEADLINE> Macao Newspapers Hail Establishment of SARPC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Leading Chinese newspapers in Macao
all carried editorials on Tuesday, hailing the establishment of
the Macao Special Administrative Region Preparatory Committee
(SARPC).
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News said in its editorial that the SARPC
establishment marks the start of the preparatory work for the
Macao SAR (special administrative region), turning a new page in
the history of Macao.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment will help increase liaison with Macao
residents, and map out proposals for a smooth handover and the
establishment of the Macao SAR," it said.
</P>
<P>
The committee, set up in Beijing Tuesday morning, has 100
members, with 60 from Macao and 40 from China's mainland. China
will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macao on December 20,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The editorial urged Macao residents to take an active part in
the work of the committee by submitting their opinions and
suggestions and supporting the work of the committee.
</P>
<P>
It expressed the belief that the committee will prove again the
success of Deng Xiaoping's theory of "one country, two systems" in
Macao, saying the committee can draw upon the successful
experience of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
preparatory committee and start from the actual situation in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the committee will work hard in the national
interests of China, and work strictly in accordance with the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and the Macao Basic Law," it
said.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese daily, Tai Chung Pou, said the SARPC is a "big
and happy thing" long expected by Macao residents. It also urged
all Macao residents including those non-Chinese nationals to air
their opinions to the committee.
</P>
<P>
It said that the committee will not be a second power center in
Macao, but rather a body conducive to Macao's smooth transition
and development.
</P>
<P>
The Correio Sino-Macaense Daily said that the committee will
successfully accomplish its mission as it is guided by the Macao
Basic Law and can draw upon the experience of Hong Kong SAR
preparatory committee.
</P>
<P>
It is under the correct leadership of the Central Government of
China and has the support of the residents of Macao, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The "Cheng Pou" newspaper said that it hopes members from Macao
 and China's mainland can work in good coordination so that the
committee can lay a "solid and sound track" for the realization of
 "one country, two systems" and "Macao people governing Macao."

<HEADLINE> Parliamentary Crisis Solved in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen and deposed First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh
reached a conciliation Thursday on the election procedure dispute,
thus avoiding a National Assembly (parliament) crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen told the reporters after an assembly session that he
had called Ranariddh Tuesday, asking him to send assembly
members to attend the parliamentary session for the amendment to
the Election Law.
</P>
<P>
In the call, Hun Sen told Ranariddh that "for the people and
the country, we should cooperate."
</P>
<P>
The second prime minister also said that they agreed the
ballots will be brought to the communalities for counting instead
of being counted in villages, but not in district or provincial
capitals as those opposition parliamentary members demanded.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers loyal to Ranariddh and Buddhist Liberal Democratic
Party founder Son Sann have been boycotting the assembly meetings
in the hope of holding negotiations on the disputed electional
procedure.
</P>
<P>
Due to the boycott, a session of the National Assembly
scheduled for Monday failed to meet the quorum that requires the
attendance of 84 members. Only 77 members appeared at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
If it continues, the boycott could force a delay of the
election now scheduled for July 26.
</P>
<P>
However, after the aborted session on Monday, Hun Sen warned
that if the general election can not be held before September 24,
on which the term of the current parliament is to expire, the
National Assembly will be dissolved automatically.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen is expected to leave for Bangkok Wednesday for a
two-day official visit.

CAIRO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs from
Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- A factory, with an annual production capacity of
30,000 tonnes of feed concentrate for livestock and fish, went
into operation Monday.
</P>
<P>
Its fodder will serve the markets in Jordan, Sudan, Yemen, Iraq
and Syria, semi-official Jordan Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) signed an agreement Monday to provide 60 million
dollars for the government's reform campaign.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used for diversifying maritime activities to
break state monopoly, readjusting customs tariffs, reducing budget
deficit, decreasing state-owned companies' debts and intensifying

CAIRO -- Egypt has sounded alarm against the sharp decline in
investments in Arab countries, which dropped to 21 percent of the
gross national products in 1996 from 72 percent in 1990, the
Egyptian Gazette reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar here Monday, Egyptian Economy Minister Boutros
Ghali attributed the plunge to sluggish economy and the wide gap
between investments and savings in these countries.
</P>
<P>
The savings can cover only 60 percent of the funds needed for
investment, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ghali also said that the rapid growth of population in most
Arab countries has aggravated food shortage there.
</P>
<P>
The annual natural population growth rate in Arab countries is
three percent on average.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran is planning to build a 300-kilometer pipeline
from the Caspian Sea port city Neka in Mazadaran province to the

<HEADLINE> Relocation of HK Airport Starts Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The process of relocation of the
Hong Kong International Airport from Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok will
start on Wednesday to be consistent with new airport opening on
July 6, a senior Airport Authority official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented move comprises of five phases over a
three-month period, of which the night move during the late hours
of July 5 and the early hours of July 6 is "the most critical", AA
Corporate Development Director Clinton Leeks said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an Airport Consultative Committee plenary meeting.
Leeks said, the objectives of the relocation are "to achieve a
seamless transfer of airport operation from Kai Tak to Chek Lap
Kok and to ensure that Hong Kong, at all times, has a fully
functional airport whether at Kai Tak or Chek Lap Kok."
</P>
<P>
Detailed planning of the relocation began in late 1996, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The dates and times of the various phases are as follows:
pre-advance move, from May 6 to June 4; advance move, from June 5
to June 21; main body move, from June 22 to 17:30 hours July 5;
night move, from 17:30 hours July 5 to 06:30 hours July 6; and
follow-on move till August 5.
</P>
<P>
"The relocation exercise is being planned on the basis of three
inter-linked operations: the departure from Kai Tak; the journey
from Kai Tak to the new airport, including allocation of time
slots for moves by road, sea and air; reception and distribution
at Chek Lap Kok," Leeks said.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the movement of vehicles and equipment will take
place by road, but will be supplemented, especially in the final
stages, by barge transportation and in night move by air
transport.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 10,000 land movements, 70 barge movements
and 30 aircraft movements will be required through the exercise,
said Leeks.
</P>
<P>
The success of the move requires close coordination between the
AA, various government departments such as Police, Transport
Department and Marine Department, and all business partners, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Leeks also told of contingency planning in case of bad weather
as early July is prone to typhoon and rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
The postponement of the final stages of the move will be
considered if there is any likelihood of winds high enough, for
example, 40 kilometers per hour or above, to necessitate partial
closure of the Lantau Link, a major road link between Kowloon and
the new airport.
</P>
<P>
The hoisting of a No. 3 typhoon signal will also mean the
automatic suspension of the sea move as barge operators' insurance
is no longer valid under the conditions, he said.

<HEADLINE> Information System Urged to Promote HK's Hotel Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government should establish a
comprehensive hotel development information system in its efforts
to promote local hotel business, the Hong Kong Tourist Association
(HKTA) suggested Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The system will provide market data to developers and the
industry, and assist the SAR government in the planning of sites
for hotel development, according to the results of a study
released by HKTA.
</P>
<P>
The data should be reviewed every six months and the findings
made public, HKTA said.
</P>
<P>
"Study on the Demand and Supply of Hotels in Hong Kong",
commissioned by the association, was a follow-up to
recommendations in the Association's "Visitor and Tourism Study
for Hong Kong" completed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Study takes into account committed development projects as
well as hotels currently holding planning or building
applications.
</P>
<P>
Hotel development decisions are driven not only by
tourism-related factors, but also by underlying real estate
considerations, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Policy initiatives implemented by the government have also
resulted in increased interest in hotel development since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The designation of hotel use in statutory zoning plans will
facilitate the emergence of a land market for hotel projects, the
study said. It also recommended that the designation of
site-specific zoning continue to be part of the plan-making
process.
</P>
<P>
The study noted that, in the long term, while there will be an
increase in the number of hotels in the peripheral urban areas
along the Mass Transit Railways (MTR) lines, the supply of hotel
sites in the Central Business District (CBD) and prime urban sites
may not be sufficient to cope with the long-term growth in demand.
</P>
<P>
The study suggested that the government consider the
application of specific zoning to satisfy the projected long-term
demand for top-quality hotels in the CBD over the next five
years.

ISLAMABAD, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Gohar Ayub Khan, who has expressed
his inability to carry on his assignment as foreign minister owing
to his personal reasons, attended his office and performed his
duty as foreign minister Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to sources in the Foreign Ministry, Ayub Khan may
continue to work as foreign minister till he is assigned a new
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
The sources clarified that he has not resigned from the
cabinet, and had only requested re-assignment of his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
The decision on his request is pending, and it is almost
certain that Ayub Khan would work as foreign minister till Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif makes a decision on his request, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Ayub Khan has dispelled the impression that he had to resign
from his office because of differences with the Cabinet on any
issue and said, "I have not resigned from the Cabinet," adding
that he has only asked the prime minister to change his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Prime Minister's Secretariat
said in a press release Tuesday that Prime Minister Sharif, "while
acceding to Ayub Khan's request for allocation of another
portfolio to him, has decided that for the time being he should
continue to function in his present post."

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan, China to Enhance Bilateral Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh Prime Minister Nurlan
Balgimbaev said his forthcoming visit to China will give a fresh
impetus to the development of relations between Kazakhstan and
China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua before leaving for China Thursday,
Balgimbaev said the Kazakh-Chinese ties have made remarkable
progress in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the progress to the friendly and good-neighborly
relations between the two countries, the statement by the major
nuclear powers including China on providing security guarantee to
Kazakhstan, confidence-building measures taken in the military
field along the border areas of the two countries, regular
contacts between leaders of the two countries and the signing of
important documents on furthering bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of the bilateral economic and trade
cooperation, Balgimbaev said that China is Kazakhstan's biggest
trading partner in Asia and Kazakhstan ranks second only to Russia
in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) that have trade
ties with China.
</P>
<P>
China will remain as the most potential trading partner to
Kazakhstan in the future, and the economic and trade cooperation
between the two countries will be further expanded, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has planned to set up an automobile joint venture and
build hotels and trading centers in Kazakhstan, he said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, a number of documents on promoting
cooperation between the two countries will be signed, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic situation, Balgimbaev said Kazakhstan's
economic policy has been consistent in recent years. Its
macro-economy is stable, the decline in production has been
curbed, a steady economic growth ensured and the standard of
living improved.
</P>
<P>
He said six years of development in the Commonwealth of
Independent States shows that the road is not even to a realistic
and efficient integration beneficial to all its member states.
</P>
<P>
He believed that integration should be achieved first of all in
economy and then extended to other fields. That's why Kazakhstan
has proposed the establishment of a unified economy in the CIS.
</P>
<P>
Balgimbaev, 51, a former minister of the Oil and Gas Industry,
was appointed as prime minister on October 1997.

<HEADLINE> 2 Million HK Dollars Worth of Pirated VCDs Seized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Police Monday night
closed down a distribution center of pirated video compact disks
(VCDs) following the arrest of two men and the seizure of 130,000
pirated VCDs in Kwai Chung, New Territories.
</P>
<P>
While patrolling in Kwai Chung Sunday night, police officers
spotted two men acting suspiciously at a car park of an industrial
building.
</P>
<P>
During a search of a light goods vehicle parked nearby, police
found two master disks for manufacturing pirated VCDs and a large
quantity of VCD covers. Police later located about 10,000 pirated
VCDs at a lift lobby inside the building.
</P>
<P>
Police on Monday night searched a flat on the third floor of
the industrial building and seized about 120,000 pirated VCDs. A
large quantity of VCD covers and packing materials were also
found. The haul could fetch about two million HK dollars (256,000
U.S. dollars) in retail markets.
</P>
<P>
The two men, aged 22 and 27 respectively, are now being
detained for interrogation and the case will later be handed over
to the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department.

<HEADLINE> China's Southernmost Island Province Attracting Taiwanese Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's southernmost island province
of Hainan has attracted nearly 200 Taiwanese-funded agriculture
enterprises and 150 million US dollars of their investment.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises have at least 13,000 hectares of land in almost
all Hainan's cities and counties producing fruits, flowers, and
aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Ever since a Taiwan farmer leased 55 hectares of land here in
1988, other Taiwanese-funded enterprises have been following suit
and, although it was somewhat affected by the financial crisis in
East and Southeast Asia, Taiwanese farmers still show confidence
in their investment in Hainan.
</P>
<P>
They say that Hainan has advantages in its climate, available
land, cheap labor, and capital, and still has more than a million
hectares of arable land ready for use.
</P>
<P>
Investing in Hainan is one way for Taiwanese agro-businesses to
enter mainland markets. And their fruits and flowers have been
exported not only to the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and
Guangzhou, but to Japan and Europe as well.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the provincial government has given "national
treatment" to Taiwanese investors, attracting even more funds from
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Some experts say that agricultural co-operation across the
Taiwan Straits has great potential. The present 150 million US
dollars worth of Taiwanese investment is only a small part of the
7.5 billion US dollars worth of overseas investment in the
province during the past 10 years. Most Taiwanese-funded
agriculture enterprises are solely managed by Taiwan investors and
are involved in planting and cultivation, with only a few involved
in technology, processing, transportation, and sales.
</P>
<P>
They also say that a greater effort should be made in
increasing cooperation. It is learned that the provincial
government has applied to the State Council for a
Hainanese-Taiwanese experimental agricultural development center
and more policy support.

<HEADLINE> Israel Decides to Join International Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel has decided to join the
International Development Association (IDA) of the World bank with
the aim of facilitating access to other world institutions and
helping Israeli firms reach to more countries.
</P>
<P>
The decision came following a series of meetings between
Israeli Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman and the president of the
IDA, James D. Wolfensohn, local daily Haaretz reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Israel believes that joining the IDA will
reinforce its standing in the international community, thus making
easier its entry into other important global institutions.
</P>
<P>
Though Israel has to pay for the IDA membership 1 million
dollars a year, Israeli companies will be able, in return, to bid
for tenders issued by the bank, which total some 6 billion dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
The IDA membership will also open a vast market of projects to
Israel's companies, some in countries in which Israel has not yet
been active, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The IDA is the economic aid arm of the World Bank. It provides
subsidized aid to some 80 poor countries with a total population
of about 3.5 billion people -- 60 percent of the world's total
population.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China always values and takes a
positive attitude toward the growth of Sino-American military
relations, said General Zhang Wannian in a meeting with visiting
U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Franklin Kramer here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, vice-chairman of the Chinese Central Military
Commission, said President Jiang Zemin paid a successful state
visit to the United States last fall. Jiang and U.S. President
Bill Clinton affirmed their joint commitment to set up a
constructive and strategic partnership between the two countries
oriented toward the 21st century, which laid down the framework
and direction for the development of bilateral relations in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also reached common understanding on
cooperation between the armed forces of the two countries, Zhang
said, adding that China is ready to make concerted efforts with
the United States in a bid to bring these understandings to
fruition.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the healthy development of relations between Chinese
and American armed forces not only is in accord with the
fundamental interests of citizens of the two countries, but is
also conducive to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region
and the world.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of future exchanges between the two armed forces,
he said, the Chinese side is willing in the spirit of equality and
mutual benefit to actively consult and discuss with its US
counterpart the possibilities of cooperation in various fields to
promote the further advancement of relations between the two
countries and their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
With regard to President Clinton's upcoming state visit to
China, Zhang expressed his conviction that this visit will inject
new energy into Sino-U.S. relations.

Kramer said that Jiang Zemin's visit to the United States last
October yielded important results and the joint commitments
affirmed by the two presidents to develop constructive and
strategic partnership that laid the groundwork for long-term
development of bilateral relations. The US is anticipating a
successful visit by President Clinton to China, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kramer noted that the establishment of long-term, friendly and
constructive relations between the United States and China
conforms to the interests of both countries as they are both large
nations and standing members of U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the United States recognizes the
important common interests with China, and that US hopes that
relations between the two armed forces can be improved in
conjunction with the growth of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Kramer conveyed to Zhang a former letter of invitation to visit
the United States from U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen and
said he hoped Zhang would visit after President Clinton's trip to
keep the momentum going between the two countries and their armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
Zhang expressed his appreciations and said he expected his
official visit to the United States would come within the year at
a time convenient to both sides.

Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and U.S. Ambassador

<HEADLINE> Economic Exchanges Between China's Urban, Rural Areas (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- More and more city people are moving
to the countryside for business opportunities, while many Chinese
farmers are still flooding to the cities for better-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
The city dwellers come to the countryside not only for fresh
air, delicacy of vegetables, and solitude, but also to make a
fortune.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Dijun is one such new rural resident. He used to work in
a machine-building plant in Shijiazhuang City, capital of north
China's Hebei Province. But he quitted and leased a barren
mountain, which covers about 70 hectares in Pingshan County near
Shijiazhuang.
</P>
<P>
"I was employed as a consultant by a township enterprise in
Pingshan County several year ago and found the county is rich in
natural resources and cheap labor, so I decided to settle down
here," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
But Zhang is not the only one who quit a job in town to move to
countryside. A substantial part of China's 10 million hectares of
barren mountains are now operated by people from cities, not local
farmers, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Also in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, some
graduates from Beijing and Qinghua universities bought 4,000
hectares of land in the Dayao Mountain area at a cost of five
million yuan years ago. Now their farm has become the area's best.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, enterprises in urban areas have been extending their
arms into the countryside seeking lower production costs. The
Shuanghui Group, one of the largest Chinese producers of ham and
sausage in central China's Henan Province, has established several
farms raising livestock in eight counties.
</P>

At the same time, many Chinese farmers have entered cities,
working in construction, manufacturing and retail.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the Ministry of Agriculture, China
now has 60 million farmers working in cities, accounting for 13
percent of the total rural labor.
</P>
<P>
Wang Daming, a farmer of Wangying Village of Laohekou City in
central China's Hubei Province, rented in the city a box-making
plant that was near bankruptcy. He has turned losses into profits,
and earns 500,000 yuan in pre-tax income every year.
</P>
<P>
"This, the dual migration of people, will lead to an economic
integration between rural and urban areas, which used to be
separate economic units before," said Xu Pengxian, a researcher
for the China Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
City dwellers bring new operation methods, new ideas, money and
technology when they move to countryside. They help accelerate the
industrialization of rural areas and increase exchanges between
cities and rural areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xu said it was because of the rapid development of township
enterprises in recent years that rural and urban people could
migrate freely.
</P>
<P>
The bulging pockets of farmers have also enhanced their
position in the urbanization of rural areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Yuncheng City in northwest China's Shanxi Province
have invested nearly 500 million yuan in urban construction since
1985 when expansion was approved. Yuncheng now is called "a new
city on farmers' shoulders."

<HEADLINE> China's Info Industry Beats Expectations, Says Top Intel Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Chinese economic
official and a world-famous U.S. entrepreneur this morning shared
their views on trends in the information industry and discussed
possible cooperation between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, Chinese minister of the State Development Planning
Commission, said the information industry has propelled global
growth and China's domestic economy. He added that the sector has
been a major cause of growth for China.
</P>
<P>
A technical guru himself, Zeng asked cyberspace celebrity
Andrew Grove, president of Intel Corp., to brief him on the latest
developments in computer technology. "Now engaged in routine
office work and meetings, I would like to recharge myself," Zeng
said.
</P>
<P>
Grove responded by predicting that there will be "more than one
billion personal computers inter-connected" in the next century,
thus fundamentally changing the landscape of the world's economy
and trade, and even people's lifestyles. "This is not just a
vision, but a reality turned bigger and bigger," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his eyes, Grove said the development of the information
industry in China is also "ahead of expectations."
</P>
<P>
Intel's business in the fast-growing Chinese economy also is
exceeding expectations, he said. In his current China trip, Grove
will unveil a big research-and-development center in Beijing. An
Intel manufacturing plant with an investment of 200 million
U.S. dollars will be in operation "four months ahead of schedule
with the support of the Chinese government," Grove said.
</P>
<P>
Grove said he hopes China becomes a leading participant in the
application of new technologies. Some local companies have already
done so, he said. Grove said he will attend a ceremony marking the
production of the one millionth China-made PC produced by the
Legend Group, the country's leading PC manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government always takes an active and supportive
attitude to the investment of high-tech corporations in China,"
Zeng said. To encourage such investment, the Chinese government
has resumed a preferential taxation policy for importing high-tech
equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said China's vast market and the recent restructuring of
its government bodies also presents opportunities for overseas
companies.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese leaders attach importance to high-tech
development," Zeng said, adding that Chinese president Jiang Zemin
in recent years has met with many high-tech entrepreneurs and
experts.
</P>
<P>
Zeng then picked up a copy of "Time" celebrating Grove as the
magazine's "Man of the Year" in 1997 for his contribution to the
information industry. "It is an honor for all working in the
industry," Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
Grove said he was excited to share "similar views" in many
fields with Chinese officials. He then demonstrated
photo-recognition software using high-performance Intel-made
chips.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Grove and his party met with Wu Jichuan, Chinese
minister of Information Industry, and exchanged views on the
future trends and applications of the high-tech industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Wu Zhongliang, a U.S. citizen of
Chinese origin, was recently honored as a "citizen of Neijiang" by
the city government in southwest China's Sichuan Province for his
decade-long efforts to help the province develop education.
</P>
<P>
Wu, whose ancestral home is Neijiang, settled in the United
States in 1968. He has donated more than six million yuan (about
750,000 U.S. dollars) to set up 14 schools in the province. His
total donation for education is the biggest the province ever
received from an overseas compatriot.
</P>
<P>
He began his charitable efforts in 1986, then established
kindergartens, primary schools, high schools and homes for the
elderly in Neijiang. He participated in a charitable project last
year, establishing 10 schools in Neijiang, and set up an
educational fund of more than 2 million yuan (240,000 US dollars)
to encourage excellent local teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
The charitable project sponsored by the provincial government
in 1994 has received overseas donations exceeding 15 million yuan
(1.8 million US dollars) and has built 66 primary schools.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Coal Port To Mark Centennial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's largest coal port --
Qinhuangdao port on Bohai Bay in the northern part of the country
-- will celebrate its 100th anniversary in June.
</P>
<P>
Opened by the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) in 1898, Qinhuangdao was
the first port of its kind in China's history. All the ports
preceding Qinhuangdao were forced to open by foreign invaders.
</P>
<P>
In its 100 years, Qinhuangdao port has functioned as a hub of
coal transport from the mines in the north to the urbanized south.
</P>
<P>
China is rich in coal resources, but they are unevenly
distributed. Coal production centers are concentrated in north and
northwest China, while the economically developed southeast
regions run short of coal.
</P>
<P>
Situated at the juncture of north and northeast China,
Qinhuangdao is a natural choice as the coal transportation hub.
</P>
<P>
To transport more coal from the production centers in the north
to the south, China has invested 12 billion yuan since 1978 in
building four large coal wharves in Qinhuangdao port, together
with the Datong-Qinhuangdao multiple railway to speed up coal
transportation. By these actions, a complete system for coal
transportation has been formed.
</P>
<P>
By July 1997, Qinhuangdao port had built four modern coal
wharves, with a yearly handling capacity of 106 million tons of
coal.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, Qinhuangdao port will have 60 berths from the current
38, with a yearly handling capacity of 124.8 million tons. At that
point, Qinhuangdao is expected to become one of the world's top
coal ports.

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Tel Aviv Mayor Ronni Milo announced on Sunday that he is

The plan includes an Israeli withdrawal of less than the 13
percent that the U.S. has been proposing but more than 11 percent
Israel has so far offered.

<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- According to latest opinion polls, 35 percent of Israelis
would vote for the incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if
the general election was held now while 27 percent would vote for
the opposition Labor party leader Ehud Barak. Only 13 percent
would be in favor of Ronni Milo, who decided Sunday to run for
prime minister.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Family Life Movement of Zambia
(FLMZ) has called on parents to freely discuss sexual issues with
their children for the benefit of the young generation.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by FLMZ Deputy Provincial Program officer,
Regina Lungu, during the opening of a five-day workshop held here
Monday, according to Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
She said there is need to empower the parents with
communication skills aimed at creating dialog between the parents
and their children over sex education.
</P>
<P>
She urged the parents who have a tendency of failing to dialog
with their children over the critical sexuality issues to reflect
and stop the habit.
</P>
<P>
Lungu told the participants that unlike in the past where sex
education was a taboo among family members, families should now
be able to discuss the topic openly.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, parish priest Edgar Pillet said there is
need to educate children when they are young.
</P>
<P>
This will enable them to dialog with parents when they reach
the youthful stage, he said.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is also attended by representatives of the girl
child adolescent reproductive health and the United Nations fund
for population activities.

SHANGHAI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Tongling Metallurgy Group
Company is in the city of Tongling in east China's Anhui Province,
more than 500 km from Shanghai, China's largest foreign trade
center.
</P>
<P>
It used to cost the company a lot of time, money, and manpower
just to send its products to Shanghai, but these days, things are
much easier and more efficient, because the group has established
an export company in Shanghai. Shanghai has done its best to make
itself into an international economic, financial, and trade center
and into an ideal place to export goods from other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Shanghai Port handled 30.1 billion US dollars worth of
exports and imports for other provinces and cities, accounting for
51.3 percent of the port's total. And the port handled 18 percent
of China's exports and imports last year.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Port now ranks twelfth in the world, with an
annual handling capacity of 2.52 million TEUs. Domestic and
foreign shipping companies have 106 regular container routes,
making Shanghai the only port in the country with routes to all 12
of the world's major shipping areas.

<HEADLINE> Poverty-Stricken Population Drops in Chinese Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The poverty-stricken population in
China's urban areas shrank by 80,000 last year, according to a
report released this week by the State Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The poverty-stricken population in urban China is now
estimated at 11.68 million, accounting for 4.1 percent of the
country's urban residents.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's random survey of 17,000 urban families shows that
85.5 percent, or 9.97 million, of the urban poor population live
in central and western China, where economies are underdeveloped.
</P>
<P>
Of them, 6.8 million are in central China and 3.17 million in
western China, the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the 1996 figure, the proportion of
poverty-stricken people in China's urban population in 1997
decreased by 0.5 percentage points in eastern China, and 0.8
percentage points in western China. However, central China
reported an increase of 2.3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 61.47 percent of the poverty-stricken
people in urban China are victims of the ongoing depression in
state-owned enterprises, which has caused a swelling unemployment
rate in cities.
</P>
<P>
This "temporary unemployed population" will shrink quickly, as
the country completes reforms in the state enterprises and
provides more job opportunities than before, the report stated.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government at all levels should give economic
development a top priority as an effective means to eradicate
poverty in cities, in addition to establishing a far-reaching
social welfare system and providing more professional training for
unskilled laborers, the report stated.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Expand Defense Exchange with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Japan is prepared to expand its
exchanges with China in the defense sector, according to Fumio
Kyuma, director-general of the Japanese Defense Agency.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an audience at the Chinese People's Liberation Army
University of National Defense, Kyuma said that exchanges between
defense sectors in the two countries would contribute to regional
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that the National Institute for Defense Studies of the
Japanese Defense Agency and China's University of National Defense
would engage in exchanges. He added that both sides can also
cooperate in medical science.
</P>
<P>
Kiyuma said he hopes that warships of the two countries would
visit each other in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
As a guest of Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian, Kiyuma said
the two countries have established friendly and cooperative
relations in a wide range of areas since the conclusion of the
Sino-Japanese treaty of peace and friendship 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said that an exchange of visits between defense ministers of
the two countries this year is of significance not only to
relations between Japan's Self-Defense Forces and the Chinese
People's Liberation Army but also to Sino-Japanese ties as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Defense Minister Chi visited Japan in February.
</P>
<P>
Kiyuma reiterated that Japan will continue to take the path of
peaceful development.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions after his speech, Kiyuma said that the
Japanese government fully recognizes the government of the
People's Republic of China as the sole legal government
representing China and understands and respects the fact that
Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
He also said that a bill adopted by Japan's cabinet on April 28
points to developments in areas surrounding Japan that have an
important influence on Japan's peace and security, but does not
point to a geographic concept in which any area would be included
or excluded.
</P>
<P>
On the Korean peninsula issue, he said that this should be
resolved basically by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) and the Republic of Korea (ROK) through consultations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Japan supports the four-party talks by the United
States, China, the DPRK and the ROK.
</P>
<P>
Kyuma's China visit began on May 1.

<HEADLINE> China Allows Foreign Banks to Enter Interbank Call Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Some foreign banks operating in
China recently got the go-ahead to enter China's national
interbank call market.
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, eight foreign banks with the right to do Renminbi business
in the Pudong New Area in Shanghai now can participate in
interbank borrowing, bond trading and bond repurchasing through a
national trading and information network.
</P>
<P>
The eight banks include Industrial Bank of Japan, Daiichi
Kangyo Bank, Citibank, Standard Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank,
Charter Bank and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
Since Pudong was opened to foreign banks in April of 1997 the
interbank activities in Renminbi have been performed through the
Shanghai Financing Center.
</P>
<P>
Chinese financial experts call the move a further step in
opening China's financial market.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Shipping Group to Set Up New Subsidiaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The China Yangtze Shipping (Group)
Corp., the country's largest inland-river shipping enterprise,
plans to set up five big subsidiaries this year specializing in
transportation of passengers, cargo, oil, containers and in
tourism.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Ministry of Communications said the
reorganization will intensify regional cooperation and increase
the group's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The companies will replace the four existing branches in the
cities of Shanghai, Wuhu, Wuhan and Chongqing. The branches have
similar industrial structures and duplication of navigation
routes, thus causing excessive internal cost, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze Shipping Group's transport volume has fallen
continuously in the past years to 12 million tons in 1997,
with two-thirds of its capacity unused because of the challenge
from railways, highways and air routes.
</P>
<P>
The reorganization plan calls for the group to form a
management pattern with shipping as the pillar and covering
tourism, industry, real estate, trade and finance early next
century.
</P>
<P>
At present, the group has 110,000 employees and more than 10
billion yuan in assets.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Population Growth Rate to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's population growth rate will
decline by 2.5 percent by 2000, Planning and National Development
Minister George Saitoti has said.
</P>
<P>
The decline in population growth and fertility is being
achieved by changing people's perception on the costs and
benefits of small families, he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Tuesday's East African Standard newspaper as
saying that Kenya has also played its part in internalizing the
International Conference on Population and Development
resolutions by revising its population policy guidelines,
outlining development targets and expanding the time-frame to
2010.
</P>
<P>
Over the period of 1984-93, the total fertility rate fell from
8.1 to 5.4 percent, while contraceptive prevalence almost
doubled, from 17 to 33 percent, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Population growth also fell in the east African country from
3.8 percent between 1969 and 1979 to 3.4 percent from 1979 to
1989.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government will further reinforce the trends in
fertility decline through improving survival for infants,
improving income earning opportunities for women and enhancing
socio-economic development, said Saitoti.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Willing to Accept Abu Dis as Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- In a surprising stance change,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has expressed his willingness to
accept Abu Dis on Jerusalem's eastern suburb as the capital of a
future Palestinian state, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The prestigious Hebrew daily Haaretz said in a front-page story
that Arafat made the statement in Ramallah during this weekend's
meeting with a U.S. delegation from the New York-based Council of
Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, the idea of Abu Dis, which belonged to Al Qods
(Jerusalem) under Jordanian control, is acceptable," he told the
American visitors when asked if an agreement could be reached on
the sensitive issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem problem is considered as one of the most sticking
points in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks as both of Israel
and the Palestinians insisted that the city should be the capital
of their own states.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo peace accords reached in 1993 between the
Palestinians and Israelis, the issue should be resolved in
the final-status talks between the two sides. Jerusalem is not
only a holy city for Jews, but also for Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat pointed out that he viewed understandings between the
two sides in the 1996 as realistic foundations for a final
settlement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan formulated by Israel's Labor lawmaker
Yossi Beilin and Arafat's deputy Abu Mazen on the eve of the last
Israeli general elections in 1996, most settlements under Israeli
control will remain, whereas settlers living in highly populated
Palestinian areas could live in the Palestinian state or move to
Israeli territories.
</P>
<P>
The plan also envisioned that the Jordan Valley would remain
under Israeli control for seven years from the signing of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Arafat's remarks has surprised both of the
American visitors and the Israeli officials who were especially
excited by the Abu Dis solution.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation met with Beilin Monday to brief him on
Arafat's surprising positions regarding the future of Jerusalem,
the principle of territorial compromise and the establishment of a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Beilin said that Arafat's remarks proved how attainable peace
was and that the current Likud government would be missing a
huge opportunity if the Oslo process fell apart.
</P>
<P>
He urged responsible persons in the government and the
coalition not to lend a hand to the head-on collision to
which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is leading, when it is
clear that a permanent peace can be reached and can save the
whole nation.
</P>
<P>
Members of the American delegation included Lester Crown,
President of General Dynamics Corporation, Patrick Lang, a former
director of human intelligence collection for the U.S. government,
Robert Lifton and a former President of the American Jewish Congress.

<HEADLINE> Macadamia Yield Hits New High in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Macadamia yield in Kenya has more
than doubled over the past six years and hit new high last year,
thanks to the liberalization of the industry, according to a
local report available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,800 tons of wet in-shell nuts were produced in
1997, up by 38 percent over 1996. Exports were a record 918 tons
of processed kernel worth 412 million Shillings (6.9 million U.S.
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The hike is attributed to favorable weather conditions toward
the end of 1996, high farmer morale, good prices and the fast
increasing number of macadamia nut trees across the east African
country, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, the report only predicted a marginal increase in
macadamia yield of two percent this year due to heavy El Nino
rains between October, 1997 and March this year.
</P>
<P>
The rains have led to substantial abortion of flowers in the
fields and this is likely to affect overall production in most
areas.
</P>
<P>
Macadamia tree growing is mainly a small holder farmer
activity mainly in Eastern, Central and recently in Western and
Rift Valley provinces of the country. Most farmers inter-crop
macadamia trees with coffee or other crops.
</P>
<P>
As the export demand has remained high for years, the price
for a seedling in the country went up to 100 Shillings (1.7
Dollars) last year from 60 Shillings (about one Dollar) in the
previous year.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Raises Oil Price to Increase Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Supreme Petroleum
Council has decided to raise domestic fuel prices by 40-50
percent as part of the measures to curb dropped income arising from
world oil price fall, Arab Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The prices of regular and premium petrol now available in
Kuwaiti market will be separately raised to 60 and 70 fils (about
0.198 and 0.231 U.S. dollars) per liter from the current 40 and 50
fils (about 0.132 and 0.165 dollars), the paper quoted Kuwaiti Oil
Minister Sheikh Saud Al-Sabah as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah said the planned increase, the first of its kind over
the past 15 years, was "necessary" to deal with the current
situation.
</P>
<P>
The rise is expected to go into effect four months from now
after it is approved by the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Due to the sluggish oil price in world markets, the
oil-depending Kuwait, which hosts 10 percent of the world proven
oil reserves and exports 3.5 percent of the world oil demand, is
estimated to see a 6.6 billion dollars of budget deficit in its
1998-99 fiscal year (July 1 to June 30), the highest since the
Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah warned last month that Kuwait could face an "economic
catastrophe" if Kuwait's crude remained at 10.5 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
And Kuwaiti Cabinet last month asked its economic committee to
search for new sources of income in response to the oil price
fall.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister Nasser Abdullah Al-Roudhan said
"we are talking about a package of measures linked to both
expenditures and revenues," including the planned domestic fuel
price hike.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad
Al-Jaber Al-Sabah said Monday that Kuwait would support a further
OPEC oil output cut to help boost world oil prices.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Urges OAU to Be Resolute in Ending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President and current
Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Robert
Mugabe has urged the organization to be resolute in ending
conflicts for economic prosperity on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Briefing journalists at the Harare international airport
shortly before the departure of Burkina Faso's President Blaise
Campaore Monday, Mugabe said it was the wish of the OAU to have
established an African economic community by 2030, but its
efforts were being frustrated by political instability in some
countries, The Herald reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said lack of adequate financial resources was also
hindering the continental body from establishing the economic
block aimed at achieving economic progress.
</P>
<P>
He added there are still some areas of conflict in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In Sierra Leone, rebels are still fighting the legitimate
government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
There is turmoil in Comoros, while the Great Lakes region is
also not yet totally stable.
</P>
<P>
In Angola the situation is also unpredictable, as the peace
process in that country is moving at a snail's pace. The 1994
Lusaka Peace Protocol has not yet been fully implemented, and
there are still reports of skirmishes between the government
troops and former rebel guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
"With all these conflicts, it's difficult to have a smooth
economic program. The OAU has to be resolute and grapple with all
these conflicts," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
In view of all these problems, the heads of state and
government were expected to pay particular attention in the areas
of conflict resolution, among other issues, during the next OAU
summit to be held in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, during the first
week of June, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same occasion, Compaore said there was need to
consolidate what had so far been achieved by ensuring stability
on the continent.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in Harare Sunday on a two-day working visit to
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders held private talks. During the meeting Mugabe
briefed Compaore on OAU's peace efforts, and the current
situation on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe will hand over the chairmanship of the OAU to Compaore
at next month's OAU heads of state and government summit in
Burkina Faso.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Airlines is to open
a direct air route from Nanjing City in east China to Macao
on May 22, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of
China (CAAC).

<HEADLINE> Experts Urge Preserving Bengal Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Experts have called for preserving
Bengal tigers which they said are on the brink of extinction, The
New Nation daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bengal tigers live in Bangladesh's southeast district of Kulna
where there is the largest mangrove forest in the world -- the
Sundarbans.
</P>
<P>
A census conducted by the Forest Department in 1973 showed that
there were 350-400 Bengal tigers in Bangladesh then, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
But the number of Bengal tigers has being gradually decreasing
because a tiger preservation project initiated 24 years ago has
failed to provide a safe sanctuary for the tigers.
</P>
<P>
Now there are only 300 Bengal tigers, the newspaper said,
quoting an official of the Forest Department.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes hungry male tigers eat up cubs, some tigers are
killed when they enter the adjacent townships or villages, and
some by poachers who want the skin, teeth and nail, and all these
may be the main causes of the reduction of tigers, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, in deep forest there is no sweet water which is
necessary for the tiger, and there are also no treatment
facilities for the sick ones.
</P>
<P>
Project plans had been prepared for four times in the country,
but all yielded no result.
</P>
<P>
The latest plan was prepared in fiscal 1994-95 with an
involvement of 71.1 million taka (about 1.76 million U.S.
dollars), and the World Wildlife Preservation Fund offered to
provide financial support for the project. But the project could
not start due to alleged bureaucratic bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
Experts called on departments concerned to take effective
measures immediately to save the Bengal tigers from further wane.

<HEADLINE> But Now They're Faster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- It took the Chinese princess Wen-Cheng
three years to go from Xi'an, the capital of the Tang Dynasty
(618-907), to Tibet's Lhasa to meet her bridegroom Songzain Gambo,
a famous Tibetan king of the 7th century.
</P>
<P>
She'd be delighted to know that the trip can now be done in
three hours by plane because the Tibet Autonomous Region now has
two commercial airports with domestic and international flights to
other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Before the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951, there was only
one automobile there and that was the exclusive property of the
Dalai Lama. It had been put together from parts carried in on the
backs of pack animals and could only be used on the road that ran
from the Potala Palace to the Dalai Lama's summer palace -- a
distance of less than two kilometers.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, the PLA cut through 14 ridges and built a
highway on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where the average elevation
is 4,500 meters above sea level, giving Tibet its first
highway. Now, the autonomous region has more than 22,000 km of
highways linked to Lhasa, and all counties, and 77 percent of the
villages.
</P>
<P>
The Sichuan-Tibet highway and the Qinghai-Tibet highway have
played an important role in economic and social progress in Tibet,
according to Liu Jichen, director of the autonomous region's
highway bureau. Lhasa now has regular bus service to prefectures
and neighboring provinces that help Buddhists who come to Lhasa on
pilgrimages.
</P>
<P>
And most stores, whether they are on Bargor Street in the
commercial heart of Lhasa or in a small village in the valley,
have a variety of goods from other parts of China or from India
and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of shops in Lhasa selling fashionable goods are owned
by people from elsewhere who often bring the latest fashions from
coastal cities like Guangzhou, and they can be quite profitable
because transportation is so much more convenient than before, one
shop owner says.
</P>
<P>
However, transportation is still a problem and hampers the
smooth growth of Tibet's economy and social progress, according to
one senior official, so the local government plans to put more
than one billion yuan (120 million US dollars) into the autonomous
region's highway system in the next three years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Air Force Commander Holds Talks With Chief of U.S.Air Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The friendship and cooperation
between Chinese and U.S. Air Forces should be based on mutual
trust, Commander of the Air Force of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA), lieutenant general Liu Shunyao, said in
talks here today with visiting Air Force Chief of Staff of the
United States, general Michael Ryan.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that in recent years, Sino-American relations have
developed well and there have been frequent exchanges of
high-level visits between the two countries and armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The PLA Air Force takes an active attitude toward developing
relations with its U.S. counterpart, he said, adding that
high-level visits are common occurences between the two air forces
and professional and technical exchanges are also on the rise.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two air forces should not confine their
contact only to high-ranking officers. It is equally important for
officers of various levels, especially middle-ranking officers of
the two air forces to keep contact because they are the future of
the air forces, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Liu expressed his hope that Ryan's visit to China will bring
substantial progress for the relations of the two air forces so
that a long-term and stable relationship between them can be
established.
</P>
<P>
Ryan agreed with Liu and said that it is important that the
friendly cooperation between the two air forces should be based on
mutual trust and reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
The two generals conducted an in-depth discussion on the future
exchanges and cooperation between the two air forces.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Chief of Staff of PLA Air Force Xu Qiliang
briefed the guests on Chinese Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Ryan arrived here on Monday as Liu's guest.

<HEADLINE> Map Records of Japanese Migration to Manchuria Open to Public (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A Japan-published map detailing
Japanese migration to northeast China, formerly known as
Manchuria, has recently been shown to the public in Harbin,
capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The map, so far the sole first-hand evidence found of Japanese
invasion and migration to China, has just been rated as a
class-one state cultural relic.
</P>
<P>
Sun Fenglai, a collector of antiques, accidentally found the
map -- 74 centimeters long and 54 centimeters wide -- at a salvage
station in December of 1995. He bought the map and donated it to
the Northeast China Martyrs' Museum.
</P>
<P>
Printed with red, black and pale green offset plates and still
completely intact, the map clearly shows 125 migration areas,
scattered primarily in northeast China's Heilongjiang and Jilin
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Most of those migration areas are located in fertile and
rich-resource areas, the map shows.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the original land owners were driven out of their
homes by force, which is in sharp contrast to Japanese claims that
Japanese civilians were opening up wasteland in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The Mirong Village, now called Mengjiagang Village of Yilan
County, could be spotted on the map. The bloody Tulongshan Riot
took place here when Chinese peasants resisted Japanese migrants
who crossed the straits to grab their land. Unarmed peasants were
killed in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
Japanese migrants grabbed a total of 1.52 million hectares of
fertile land from native Chinese and left countless Chinese
civilians homeless to become refugees or subjected to laboring for
the Japanese.

<HEADLINE> Map Records of Japanese Migration to Manchuria Open to Public (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Experts here say that during the period from the Sino-Japanese
War of 1894-1895 to September 18, 1931 when Japan invaded
northeast China, Japan's governments never ceased to organize
migrations to northeast China in an effort to achieve its goal of
long-term occupation of China. However, it officially began to
adopt migration as a state policy only after September 18, 1931.
</P>
<P>
At that time the Japanese government planned to send one
million households into China within 20 years. The whole
operation, scheduled to be carried out in four phases, focused
primarily on the immigration of farmers, in addition to migrants
dealing with fisheries, mineral resources and forestry.
</P>
<P>
The left bottom corner of the map shows clearly: printed by
Japanese migration department in 1939, the year when Japanese
migration to northeast China climbed to its peak.
</P>
<P>
In the right bottom corner of the map, notes indicate that
different signs represented different migration areas, including
Youth Volunteers, Special Training Stations, Patroling Police
Villagers and so on, which is also contradictory to Japanese
claims that the migrants were all unarmed civilians.
</P>
<P>
Experts here indicate that those migrants were fully armed. In
addition to conducting production activities, the migrants also
conducted military training.
</P>
<P>
In the later periods of the War of Resistance Against Japan
(1937-1945), those migration areas had become major
soldier-suppliers, and by the time when the war ended there were
hardly any Japanese adults left in those migration areas.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Increases Control over Medicine Production, Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has initiated a
three-to-five-year program to improve the quality of medicines in
the urban and rural markets, according to an official of the
Municipal Bureau of Health.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to supervise the development, production,
usage, marketing, advertising and pricing of medicines.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that more than 90 percent of Beijing-made
medicine is up to national standards.
</P>
<P>
The health official said a comprehensive supervision system
will be in place by 2000, and more quality supervisors will be
employed.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 16 percent of the medicines sold in the capital is
made in Beijing. Related departments will offer preferential
policies to the city's pharmaceutical enterprises to increase the
varieties of medicine to 1,500 and develop new products, said the
official.

<HEADLINE> Private Enterprise to Offer Railway Cargo Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A special freight train run for the
first time by a private enterprise has gone into operation,
running between Guangzhou and Shenyang via Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The contractor, Liaoning Haicheng Fukui Group and Shenyang
Dingfeng Commerce and Trade Company, takes charge of cargo
organization, loading and unloading, and escorting the 22-car
train.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement with the Ministry of Railways, the
two companies will contract the train for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The private freight operation is expected to sharpen the
competitive edge of railway transportation in the market by
diversifying managers and encouraging competition, instead of
depending on governmental operation alone, transit experts said.
</P>
<P>
Railway transportation has been challenged by express highways
and air cargo flights in recent years. Statistics show that the
share of railways had decreased from 60.5 percent to 38.8 percent
in transportation volume in the 1980-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
A key to transportation system reform is to build a
market-oriented structure covering different management patterns,
according to Fu Zhihuan, newly appointed Railway Minister.
</P>
<P>
Another source said that three farmers in Liangshan County,
Shandong Province, built China's first private railway line early
this year. The 630-meter line serves a nearby oil depot.
</P>
<P>
"It's OK for whether the State, local government, or
individuals to build or operate railways, so long as the activity
is in accordance with officially approved procedures," said Sima
Ke, an official with the Transport Bureau of the Ministry of
Railways.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Autonomous Region Developing Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- An official from Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region in northwest China said that tourism will be
given more emphasis this year.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhenyuan, director of the region's tourism bureau, said
that Ningxia attracted more than 4,000 overseas tourists in 1997,
with tourism revenue of 1.3 million U.S. dollars, up 8.3 percent
and 17 percent, respectively, from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia also attracted 1.57 million domestic tourists, with
revenue exceeding 260 million yuan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
As the only Hui autonomous region in China, Ningxia is
distinguished by its combination of deserts and lakes. Tourists
are also attracted by its ancient Yellow River culture, relics and
ethnic tradition.
</P>
<P>
Travel experts say the region has great tourism
potentialities. The region has invested more than 3 million yuan
to build the mausoleum of Emperor Xixia, an ancient emperor in the
Ningxia area. Ningxia will also prepare several tourism routes
like the ancient Xixia empire, desert scenery, and exploration of
the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
By year 2000 Ningxia is expected to draw 10,000 overseas
tourists annually, with 2 million U.S. dollars of tourism
revenue. It will receive two million domestic tourists, with
tourism revenue exceeding 500 million yuan. By 2002, the whole
region will get more than one billion yuan in annual tourism
revenue, covering 3 percent of the region's gross domestic
product, experts predict.

<HEADLINE> Northeastern Chinese Provinces Trying To Help Unemployed People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Governor Zhang Guoguang of
northeast China's Liaoning Province recently signed letters of
responsibility with the mayors of 14 local cities and assigned
them goals of helping unemployed people find jobs.
</P>
<P>
The mayors' goal is to help 1.2 million people who has lost
their jobs at state-owned or collectively-owned enterprises find
jobs within three years, local sources say.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is China's oldest industrial base and has a tenth of
the country's state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. Many
people lost their jobs when companies started laying off workers
to improve efficiency, and there are now more than two million of
them, accounting for a sixth of China's unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Local governments at the provincial or lower levels have
established an employment service network that provides
registration, job training and placement, and social
security. Since 1994, It has helped more than a million laid-off
workers find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Cities have tried other ways to help workers with special
difficulties through other forms of security, pensions, and
welfare, and more effective old age, medical care, and accident
coverage.
</P>
<P>
In Changchun, the capital of Jilin Province, which is close to
Liaoning, the city government department has assigned 118 workers
to form eight employment service groups to be responsible for job
placement, information, funds, and job training.

<HEADLINE> China to Have 1,000,000-KW Wind-Driven Power Facilities by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China has planned to install
wind-driven power generators with a combined capacity of one
million kilowatts (kw) by 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the China State Power
Corp., the country now has 15 large wind-power generation fields
with a combined capacity of more than 30,000 kw and 10 million
small wind-power generators with a total capacity of 20,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
China now can produce 30,000 wind-driven power generators
annually.
</P>
<P>
The official said China will continue to carry out its policy
of manufacturing small wind-driven power generators for household
usage in border areas and remote regions who are not connected to
national power grids.
</P>
<P>
The country is phasing out a plan to develop wind power in
provinces which are rich in wind resources but lack in power
supplies.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China is abundant in wind resources, and
about two-thirds of the country's land area is windy with total
wind-energy resources estimated at 253 million kw.

<HEADLINE> China To Hold International Conference on Iron, Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese metallurgical officials will
announce China's investment and development plans for 2010
concerning major steel products, especially the sheet steel
production, at an international conference on the iron and steel
industry.
</P>
<P>
The China Iron and Steel Conference 1998 will be held June
10-11. It will focus on flat rolled steel products, according to
Lu Xiaoming, editor in chief of China Metals, an authoritative
newsletter for the industry.
</P>
<P>
Officials in charge of development planning with the State
Administration of Metallurgical Industry "will unveil the most
interesting findings of their recent market surveys on priority
steel products," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the administration of the recently defunct Ministry
of Metallurgical Industry conducted a series of studies on market
demand, production capacities, product quality, and imports and
exports of sheet products for auto manufacturing, ship building,
household electrical appliances, pipelines and other uses.
</P>
<P>
Future policies and planning will be based on the survey
results, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being co-sponsored by the recently founded
administration and China Metals.
</P>
<P>
According to an official in charge of organizing the
conference, major officials of the administration will attend the
event along with representatives from major iron and steel
businesses of such countries as China, Germany, Japan, Britain and
the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Participants will also discuss the latest global developments
in plate steel production, and China's technology introduction and
upgrades in this area.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, of the 12 million tons of China's annual
steel imports, two-thirds are flat steel products.
</P>
<P>
This category accounts for 80 percent of the products in short
supply. And, currently, technology-intensive and high value-added
flat products merely control half of the domestic market on
average.

<HEADLINE> Elected Village leaders Work in Democratic Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 5 (Xinhua) -- "Recently the villagers' congress
passed a bill to repair the roads, and all the villagers have
tried their best to support the project," said Zheng Songqian,
Head of Ximingyi Village in Yanling County, in central China's
Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
"It is much easier for the village leaders who have been
elected by the villagers themselves to work with the help and
participation of village representatives," he said. "In the past,
villagers often got angry with their leaders who managed village
affairs in the old, administrative way."
</P>
<P>
Democracy also helps in supervising the leaders, he said. Two
years ago, a village leader was ousted by the villagers' congress
because of his incompetence.
</P>
<P>
Zheng was elected village head in 1994 after he defeated 11
other candidates in three rounds of voting by 980 adult voters.
</P>
<P>
The village, with more than 370 households, has more than 30
congress delegates, namely one from every 10 families. The
congress meets five-to-six times a year. The congressmen look over
all the work of the village administration.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1970s, when China began its reforms first in
rural areas and then in cities, farmers have gained their own
decision-making rights, instead of the former practice of letting
the people's communes decide everything.
</P>
<P>
In November of 1987, China issued the law on organization of
village committees. Henan Province began to experiment with the
democratic election of village leaders in 1988. By the end of
1994, all 48,000 villages in the province had held democratic
elections in line with the law.
</P>
<P>
"Democratic administration is new to all of us, and we have
much to learn," local village leaders agreed. Many of them have
taken training of various kinds. Some have a college diploma.
</P>
<P>
Local governments at all levels have encouraged experimental
democracy in local villages. Village leaders have been asked to
open up their administrative activities to the villagers.

MANILA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' inflation rate
climbed to 7.9 percent in April from 7.3 percent last month on a
year-on-year base, the National Statistics Office (NSO) said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The NSO said in a press release that the increase was mainly
due to higher prices of food, beverages and tobacco, housing and
repairs, and clothing as a result of the financial turmoil in
Southeast Asia, including the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
However, the NSO said that fuel, light, water and services
recorded lower prices than expected.
</P>
<P>
By region, the inflation rate for Metro Manila rose to 8.8
percent from 7.6 percent last month, the highest in the country.
</P>

The average inflation rate during the first four months of the
year was 7.3 percent, 2.2 percentage points higher than last

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen One of World's Leading Toy Producers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Statistics show that the Shenzhen
Special Economic Zone has become one of the world's leading toy
producers.
</P>
<P>
The variety of toys produced in the world is estimated at
150,000. Shenzhen now turns out about 100,000 varieties.
</P>
<P>
According to authorized figures, the United States last year
imported 10 billion U.S. dollars in toys, with China accounting
for 5.4 billion U.S. dollars. Of China's total, 2.2 billion
U.S. dollars was from Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Most of the toy makers in Shenzhen are receiving funds from
neighboring Hong Kong. At present, there are 840 Hong Kong-funded
toy factories employing 600,000 workers in Shenzhen, making up
one-sixth of China's toy makers.
</P>
<P>
The toy makers in Shenzhen have been constantly improving their
product quality in recent years, officials said. At present, 20
toy factories in Shenzhen have been awarded ISO9000 certification
by the International Standardization Organization.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,000 "creditable enterprises" chosen by Shenzhen
Customs each year, toy factories make up a large proportion. As
high as 98.3 percent of the exported toys from Shenzhen stand up
to qualification standards.
</P>
<P>
The success of the toy industry in Shenzhen is attributable to
timely information provided by Hong Kong investors about world toy
trends and the development of high-tech products, market analysts
said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Mahathir Calls for Mobilization of Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Tuesday called for the full mobilization of the
people's own wealth to help the country recover from the current
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The wealth of Malaysians has not been fully mobilized, he said
at the launch of "Asnita", Malaysia's first trust fund for women.
</P>
<P>
"We should try to mobilize this wealth, assets and properties
that we have because we need the capital," he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's wealth has been eroded by half since the Asian
financial turmoil hit the economy last July and it was time for
people to mobilize their wealth, he said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the 52 percent decline in the value of the local
currency -- the ringgit to "rogue speculators."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said these currency traders had gained a lot by
selling currencies without thinking about the sufferings of the
people in countries whose currencies they had targeted.

KUNMING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's Yunnan Province is hoping to
have 36 million tourists annually by the year 2002, with 1.3
million coming from overseas.
</P>
<P>
That means an increase of 60 percent from now. Total earnings
from tourism will exceed 20 billion yuan a year. The province had
20 million tourists in 1997, more than 800,000 of them from
overseas, and did 260 million U.S. dollars worth of overseas
tourism, putting it in seventh place in China in terms of overseas
tourists and related earnings.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is China's window on Southeast Asia, with a 4,000-km
border with Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. In recent years, one third
of its overseas tourists have come from Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The governor of the province, Li Jiating, said recently that
they need to target tourist sources in Europe, North America and
Japan to meet this goal, while keeping the tourist market in
Southeast Asia and expanding border tourism.
</P>
<P>
He says that they will start new tourist agencies in the United
States, Japan, Thailand and Hong Kong, and get agencies from
Europe, North America, Japan and Thailand to open joint ventures
in Yunnan, and encourage international hotel groups to join with
local hotels.

<HEADLINE> Black Students Denied Service in U.S. Restaurant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Black sixth-graders on a field
trip to Disney World were denied service at a Denny's restaurant
in Florida, the United States, school officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
That is the latest in a series of complaints against the chain
that settled a 46 million dollar discrimination lawsuit in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The students from Baltimore's Ashburton Elementary-Middle
School and their chaperones entered the Denny's restaurant in
Ocoee, Florida, Thursday night and were not greeted or seated,
said school officials.
</P>
<P>
After seating themselves, the students waited 20 minutes before
some received menus and left an hour later without being served.
Meanwhile, white customers who entered later were served, said
school officials, who said they planned to file a complaint with
the company.
</P>
<P>
"The way we were greeted shows, actually entering the
restaurant, we were not welcomed," the Associated Press quoted
chaperone Peggy Brown as saying.
</P>
<P>
The incident will be investigated, said Ray Hood-Phillips,
chief diversity officer for Denny's, a post created following the
1994 settlement.
</P>
<P>
"If we find that discrimination has occurred, it doesn't matter
if it's a company store or a franchise unit, we take swift
action," Hood-Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
"Employees are fired if they're found to discriminate, and if
it's a franchise, we take the franchise away."
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit settled in 1994 was brought by black Secret Service
agents who said they were denied service.
</P>
<P>
In January, several Florida corrections officers filed a
discrimination complaint against Denny's, saying they were turned
away twice from one restaurant.
</P>
<P>
As part of an agreement with the Justice Department, the
restaurant chain agreed to retrain employees, feature minorities
in its ads and hire an outside lawyer to monitor compliance.
</P>
<P>
The South Carolina-based chain has 891 company-owned and 716
franchised restaurants nationwide.

<P>
BANGKOK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The British Airports Authority (BAA)
has asked for approval from Thailand's Transport and Communication
Ministry to manage the operation of Phuket airport in the south,
the Bangkok Post said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Transport and Communication Minister Suthep Thueksuban said BAA
representatives had presented a detailed plan to run Phuket
airport so that it would attract more international airlines.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been worked out over the past 18 months and
focuses on the improvement of the shuttle service between the
airport and other areas of Phuket island.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, an airport privatization study was
conducted by the ministry, which suggested that the three regional
airports in Phuket, Chiang mai in the north and Hat Yai in the
south, be privatized as single package.
</P>
<P>
BAA said it was flexible over the size of its stake in the Thai
airport, but stressed it wanted sole management authority.
</P>
<P>
However, BAA was told that it had to bid for the right to run a
Thai airport since several foreign parties from Europe and America
had also expressed an interest.
</P>
<P>
The Transport and Communication Ministry has yet to propose its
airport privatization plan to the cabinet for approval and will
set up a bidding contest to select a private contractor
afterwards, the minister said.

<P>
DHAKA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has reaped 1.75 million
tons of wheat this year, 100,000 tons more than the planned target
for the year, an English daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Observer attributed the better production of
wheat to a long cold spell in the months of December and January
and a larger wheat sowing acreage with a total of 800,000 hectares
of farmland, as well as improved irrigation this year.

The government is planning to bring one million hectares of
land under wheat cultivation which would yield approximately two
million tons of wheat next year, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Drug Abuse By Youngsters Rampant in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Drug abuse among youngsters in
Thailand shows no sign of abating as the number of drug cases
makes up the highest percentage in criminal cases concerning
youth, The Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Vicha Mahakhun, deputy chief justice of the
Central Juvenile and Family Court (CJFC), 43.5 percent of the drug
cases tried by the court last year were committed by youth.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the court, most children
addicted to drugs came from broken families and they lived with
friends.
</P>
<P>
Most of the child addicts' fathers were addicted to alcohol or
had drug-addicted siblings, the survey revealed.
</P>
<P>
Most of the young addicts said they took to drugs initially out
of novelty. The second most popular reason for drug addiction was
the need to endure longer hours of work, while the third most
cited reason was persuasion by friends and problems with parents.
</P>
<P>
Most young addicts were laborers, and the rest included the
unemployed, the survey showed.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb President Refutes Accusation by American Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 4 (Xinhua)-- Bosnian Serb President Biljana
Plavsic Monday rejected as completely groundless an accusation by
an American military envoy that the army of the Republic of Srpska
has been threatening the peace process in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Dzejms Pardj, American military envoy to the
Balkan region, Plavsic demanded that he clarify whether he was
making the statement on behalf of the U.S. government or he was
just expressing his personal views, the Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Pardj had asserted that the threat could be eliminated only if
Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Milorad Dodik reorganized the army
whereby all officers participating in Bosnia's civil war under
General Manojl Milovanovic would be removed, Plavsic said.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb president said the government of Srpska and
its army had been highly cooperative and had fully implemented the
Dayton Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The president said Pardj did not mention how the Bosnian Serb
army threatened the peace process in Bosnia. It is actually the
U.S. envoy's statement that has posed a threat to the peace
atmosphere in the region, she said.
</P>
<P>
She warned at the end of the letter that the current paramount
threat to the peace process in Bosnia-Herzegovina was the
discriminative attitudes toward the various parties in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Millions of American Children Still Live in Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The percentage of Southern
children living in poverty in the United States is about the same
as it was in 1969, regardless of robust economies in most southern
states, the Children's Defense Fund said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Equally disturbing is the fact that the rest of the nation is
catching up with the South," The Associated Press quoted Marian
Wright Edelman, president of the Washington-based nonprofit child
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the western U.S. states matched the southern states in
the percentage of poor children -- 22.9 percent -- the first time
another region equaled the south in child poverty, said a report
issued by the group at a two-day meeting in Memphis, Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
The defense fund placed the poverty line at 12,516 dollars for
a family of three and 16,036 dollars for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
The organization said that in 1996, 5.5 million children living
in the 16-state southern area, including Washington, D.C., were
poor, and that 2.6 million lived in extreme poverty, with incomes
of about 120 U.S. dollars a week for a family of three.
</P>
<P>
In 1969, 22.3 percent of children in families living in the
south were poor. In 1996, 22.9 percent of all Southern children --
including those in foster care, living on their own, or with a
non-related adult -- were living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
The midwest had the lowest percentage of impoverished children
among the four regions, 11.5 percent, followed by the northeast
with 19.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, 20.5 percent of children, or almost 14.5 million,
were classified as poor in 1996. That's up from 14 percent in
1969, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The defense fund and other child advocacy groups are gearing up
for a new push for more federal and state help to reduce child
poverty. They want a commitment from Congress for 20 billion
dollars in the next five years for early childhood education,
child care and other programs.
</P>
<P>
The defense fund found that 84 of the 100 counties with the
highest percentage of children living in poverty were in the
South.

<HEADLINE> Armenia Decides to Return Art Treasures to Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Armenian President Robert Kocharyan
signed a decree on Monday to return all the cultural and art
treasures Armenia took from Germany after World War II.
</P>
<P>
A presidential spokesman told the Itar-Tass news agency that
Kocharyan made the decision in accordance with a bilateral
cultural agreement between Armenia and Germany and an Armenian law
regulating the flow of cultural treasures.
</P>
<P>
He said the presidential decree represents an honorable
execution of relevant resolutions of the U.N. General Assembly,
which require the return of illegally obtained cultural treasures.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the return of cultural and art treasures has been
plaguing relations between Germany and some countries of the
former Soviet Union, especially Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree not long ago to
return many of the cultural and art treasures Russia took from
Germany. But the decree was vetoed by both the State Duma (the
lower house of parliament) and the Constitutional Court.

<HEADLINE> Thailand May Fail to Reach Export Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is unlikely to achieve this
year's export target of 62.6 billion U.S. dollars, or a 7.1
percent increase from last year, if the decline shown in the first
quarter continues, the Bangkok Post said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted government house spokesman Akapol
Sorasuchart as saying that a worrisome decline in first quarter
exports has underlined the need to resolve the tight liquidity in
the domestic market and ensure the continued stability of the
baht.
</P>
<P>
Exports in U.S. dollar term for the first quarter of this year
fell by 2.8 percent to 13.65 billion dollars compared to the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the decline is believed to be importers'
demand for dollar price cuts after the baht's devaluation, Akapol
said.
</P>
<P>
There had also been a sharp drop in imports of capital goods,
raw materials and semi-finished products -- essential items for
producing goods for export, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
This suggested that manufacturers do not have the funds to
purchase the goods they need, he added.
</P>
<P>
First quarter imports in terms of U.S. dollar fell by 38.6
percent from the same period last year as a result of the
liquidity crunch, high interest rates and the baht's instability.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures from the Business Economics Department
showed that imports of capital goods in the first two months of
this year fell by 34.2 percent, while imports of raw materials
dropped by 42.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Akapol said if imports of these essential goods continued to
decline, it would hurt exports in the future.
</P>
<P>
He said government agencies had been trying to solve problems
such as refunds on value-added tax and raw material import tax,
and registration of goods for export.
</P>
<P>
However, liquidity and the exchange rate volatility are the
most urgent issues to be tackled, he said.

MEXICO CITY, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Latin America and the Caribbean
received a record high amount of foreign investment in 1997
despite the effects of financial crises in Mexico and one in Asia,
a U.N. organization said in a report on Monday.

Ricardo Zapata, chief of ECLAC's international trade unit, said
in a press release here that countries in Latin America and the
Caribbean are making significant progress towards economic
integration, offsetting the negative impact of domestic problems

BANGKOK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Residents, especially children in
two districts of Thailand's southernmost province of Narathiwat
have been seriously affected by the haze from a fire at the
adjacent Phru Toh Daeng Peat swamp forest, a press report said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fire has spread from the edge of the forest to the heart of
the swamp which is sensitive ecologically because the area
contains a number of endangered tree species unique only to the
locality.

<P>
Forestry officials estimated that as much as 25,000 rai (4,000
hectares) of forest had been burnt.
</P>

Decha Kasemsap, the manager of a school near the swamp area,
was quoted as saying that many of his students had been absent
from school since last Thursday because of the haze. Some
developed respiratory problems.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chile Keen to Develop Relations with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Minister Jose
Miguel Insulza said Monday his country holds its political and
economic relations with China in high esteem.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua before his official visit to China
on May 6-9, Insulza described relations between Chile and China as
"very good," adding that he hopes his visit will add greater
strength to the relationship.
</P>
<P>
In November 1995, Insulza accompanied Chilean President Eduardo
Frei on a visit to China.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister commended the policy of reform and opening
to the outside world adopted by the Chinese government since 1978,
saying that the policy has enabled China to achieve rapid economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Commenting that Chile was the first Latin American country to
recognize the Chinese government as the solely legitimate
representative of the Chinese people, Insulza stressed that his
country will always support the one-China policy and the peaceful
reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
China will play a stabilizing role in both regional and global
political affairs in the next century, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for economic cooperation, Insulza said that China is Chile's
second largest trade partner in Asia. Bilateral trade has
constantly increased, while large investments have also been made
between the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We entrust China with our greatest hope for developing
relations with Asia, and we believe that our trade policy with
China has great dynamism," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Public Fund System Being Tried In Chinese City's Industrial Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, May 5 (Xinhua) -- After a year of experiment, a
Sino-Singaporean public fund program being tried in an industrial
park in the city of Suzhou has shown itself to be practical,
according to Wu Wai Mun, the deputy director of Singapore's
Central Public Fund (CPF) Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's CPF is a successful social welfare system that
calls for employee welfare like housing, medicare, retirement
pensions, and unemployment benefits in institutions and
corporations to be independent of government pensions. Employers
pay into a fund based on 66 percent of the employees' monthly
salary that is transferred to a bank account every month.
</P>
<P>
It is being used in 107 companies in the park, with 5,600
employees and has accumulated 67 million yuan, 4.7 million yuan of
which is used for medical, unemployment and housing expenses, Wu
explains.
</P>
<P>
The majority of overseas investors in the park believe the
system helps keep labor costs down because the fund covers
everything with one lump sum and means that their companies are no
longer burdened with a range of welfare expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Alan J. Ridley, chairman of the U.K.'s Visuvius Co., says,
"This comprehensive social welfare undertaking is common in my
home country. We are glad to see the park has implemented the same
practice."
</P>
<P>
The public fund is also attractive to employees because it
provides a long-term solution to all their fundamental social
welfare problems.
</P>
<P>
The CPF system is known as one of the most successful practices
in Singapore's fast-moving economy and has helped 80 percent of
its people purchase their own houses.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou Industrial Park has been borrowing from Singapore's
experience in other ways as well, such as construction,
environmental protection, and development plans, since it was set
up in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Price Hikes Expected to Fuel Inflation </HEADLINE>

JAKARTA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A rise in the prices of fuel oil and
electricity in Indonesia will push up inflation in May and June by
10 percent respectively, bringing this year's accumulative
inflation rate to more than 50 percent, an economist predicted.
</P>
<P>
The government said on Monday the prices of seven kinds of fuel
oil would increase by 25 to 71 percent starting Tuesday and that
of electricity by 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mari Elka Pangestu, executive director of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said the oil price
hikes would be followed by an increase in transportation fares and
prices of basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
She said the price increases were a bitter pill the government
has to take, but it should be followed by increased efficiency and
transparency in all policies.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's inflation rate in the first three months of this
year was more than 25 percent, according to the Central Statistics

interfere in Kosovo, he said. But stronger pressure on the
authority in Yugoslav should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
The refugees problem in the Yugoslav region was very
complicated and could not be settled in a short term without
financial support from international communities, the deputy
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Tension heightened since the end of February when Serb police
clashed with the ethic Albanians who make up 90 percent of the 1.9
million population in kosovo. The ethnic Albanians were seeking
independence from Serbia.

<P>
The Croatian deputy minister, who arrived here Monday for a
short working visit, also attended the opening ceremony of the

<HEADLINE> China Vital in Regional, Global Stability: Austrian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- With its ever growing importance in
the world, China is playing a more vital role in maintaining
regional and global stability, Austrian Defense Minister Werner
Fasslabend told a visiting high-ranking Chinese military official
Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here with the Chief of the General Staff for the
Chinese People's Liberation Army Fu Quanyou, Fasslabend called for
joint efforts by the two countries to work for peace and stability
in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said Fu's visit, his first to Austria, is highly significant
and described it as "a new milestone" in military relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian defense minister said his country, which is
scheduled to serve as the rotating presidency of the European
Union in two months, is closely watching developments in China.
</P>
<P>
He said there exists no fundamental conflicts of interest and
there are wide-ranging areas available for cooperation between
Austria and China, and between Europe and China.
</P>
<P>
Fu, also a member of China's Central Military Commission, said
relations between the armed forces of the two countries are being
strengthened through the sound and smooth progress of bilateral
ties and increased high-level dialogues.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit is intended to further mutual understanding
and confidence and to promote friendship and cooperation between
the two nations.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to develop multi-level cooperation with Austria in
different fields and to join efforts with Austria to build a
long-term and stable friendly relation oriented towards the 21st
century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Briefing his host on the Chinese government's policy on Taiwan,
Fu stressed adherence to President Jiang Zemin's eight-point
proposals on developing relations between the two sides across the
Taiwan Straits and pushing for the peaceful reunification of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
He said that China does not renounce the use of force, which is
not directed at compatriots in Taiwan, but at foreign interference
with China's reunification, and outside attempts to seek
"independence" for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Fasslabend praised China for its independent foreign policy of
peace, and for its efforts to promote good-neighborly friendship,
peace, stability and development in neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> German Leader Promises New Drive for Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 4 (Xinhua) -- German Social Democrat leader Gerhard
Schroeder said here Monday he would initiate a radical shift in
employment policy while keeping the current foreign policy if he
becomes Germany's chancellor after September elections.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a press conference after meeting with
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
"There won't be changes of principle in German foreign policy,
even with a new government" said Schroeder, but on employment his
party would take a different line from present Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, European policy in this sector should not
substitute national policies, but complement them," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier meeting, Italian Left Democrats leader Massimo
D'Alema and Schroeder agreed that unemployment should now be the
main priority for the 11 countries in the euro area.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said that if he wins the elections his first concern
will be to push forward joint strategies to boost jobs and promote
a socially-sensitive Europe.
</P>
<P>
The problem of youth unemployment had been a key factor in
recent regional elections in Germany, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that if his Social democrat party wins the election, it
will be largely thanks to Kohl's failure in labor policies.

<HEADLINE> New Thai Central Bank Governor Nominated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda Monday nominated Chatumongol Sonakul, former
permanent secretary of the finance ministry, as the central bank
governor to replace outgoing Chaiyawat Wibulsawasdi.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said Chatumongol's nomination would be presented to the
cabinet meeting on Wednesday and that he was confident the
nomination would win approval, the Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said he had consulted Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai in
choosing Chatumongol and was confident his decision would increase
public confidence in the central bank.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Chaiyawat tendered his resignation with the finance
minister. His resignation becomes effective Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Two deputy governors, Jaroong Nookhwun and Siri Garnjaroendee,
also tendered their resignations.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat and Siri were identified by an investigation
commission led by former central bank governor Nukul Prachuabmoh
as among the seven people responsible for Bank of Thailand (BOT)'s
failed attempt to defend the baht against speculative attacks last
year.
</P>
<P>
The abortive attempt almost depleted the country's foreign
currency reserves which plunged from 36.6 billion U.S. dollars to
2.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The other five people on the "black list" of the commission are
former prime minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, former finance
minister Amnuay Viravan, former central bank governor Rerngchai
Marakanond, Bandhit Nijthavorn, director of BOT's Banking
Department and Paibul Kittisrikangwan, then head of BOT's analysis
and monetary market section.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chatumongol declared himself ready for the job.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post quoted him as saying that his priority would
be restructuring the central bank, particularly in terms of its
role in supervision and examination.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper described Chatumongol as a career civil servant
known for his direct manner.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol, born in 1942, received a BA degree from Cambridge
University of Britain and an MA degree from Harvard University of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
He worked in various departments of the finance ministry,
including the Fiscal Policy Department, the Revenue Department and
the Exercise Department.
</P>
<P>
He quit as permanent secretary of the finance ministry after
being transferred by the Chavalit administration to the prime
minister's office in July last year.

<HEADLINE> Mother's Day Stresses Support for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- "Repaying mother's love and
assisting the poor" will be the theme for this year's Mother's Day
in China which falls on Sunday, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, Mother's Day has been designated by the
organizing committee of the nationwide "Happiness Program" as a
national day for promoting activities to help impoverished
mothers. The program is a charity project to help lift
impoverished mothers out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Data from the program organizing committee suggest there are
more than 10 million poverty-stricken mothers in the country, at
least 80 percent of them illiterate and in poor health.
</P>
<P>
The State Family Planning Commission has released a circular
calling on family planning commissions in each locality to support
the charity activity.
</P>
<P>
A publicity campaign and collections of donations will be
organized this week to inform more people of the charity project
and the living conditions of poor mothers.
</P>
<P>
The program was initiated in 1995 by the China Population Welfare
Foundation, the China National Family Planning Association and
Chinese Population News.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, it had received donations of over 48
million yuan (5.7 million US dollars) from communities and
individuals from all the social sectors.
</P>
<P>
A total of 32,000 poor mothers in 111 counties across the
country have been helped by the program in recent years. Some
6,000 have been lifted out of poverty and about 3,000 have become
better off, according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Chile Keen to Develop Relations with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Minister Jose
Miguel Insulza said Monday his country holds its political and
economic relations with China in high esteem.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua before his official visit to China
on April 6-9, Insulza described relations between Chile and China
as "very good," adding that he hopes his visit will add greater
strength to the relationship.
</P>
<P>
In November 1995, Insulza accompanied Chilean President Eduardo
Frei on a visit to China.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister commended the policy of reform and opening
to the outside world adopted by the Chinese government since 1978,
saying that the policy has enabled China to achieve rapid economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Commenting that Chile was the first Latin American country to
recognize the Chinese government as the solely legitimate
representative of the Chinese people, Insulza stressed that his
country will always support the one-China policy and the peaceful
reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
China will play a stabilizing role in both regional and global
political affairs in the next century, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for economic cooperation, Insulza said that China is Chile's
second largest trade partner in Asia. Bilateral trade has
constantly increased, while large investments have also been made
between the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We entrust China with our greatest hope for developing
relations with Asia, and we believe that our trade policy with
China has great dynamism," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Province Grants Health Certificates to Cows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May (Xinhua) -- Cow owners in northeast China's
Liaoning Province have to obtain a health license for their cows
before they sell fresh milk on the market.
</P>
<P>
This move has been taken by the Liaoning Provincial Animal
Husbandry Bureau to protect the people from the danger of drinking
milk infected with brucellosis and tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
The province launched a one-by-one health check of the 70,000
cows in Liaoning province last November and the last 20 cows found
infescted by brucellosis and tuberculosis have recently been
slaughtered and buried deep.
</P>
<P>
"Both the diseases can be easily caught by the people, and
infected cows can be a vehicle of such diseases," said Song
Shucai, deputy director of the Liaoning Provincial Animal
Husbandry Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He said that all the infected cows have been killed, while the
local government has provided subsidies to their owners since most
cows are privately owned.

MANILA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin

week's elections, saying military intervention and any form of
cheating would be opposed with "people power," the Philippine Star

It quoted the influential Roman Catholic archbishop as saying
that the Filipinos must accept the judgment of the electorate once
it is clear, "even if this judgment may differ from our personal
judgment."

Sin did not specify who he thought would try to steal the May
11 ballot, but spoke of a possible intervention by the armed
forces whose commander-in-chief is President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' preferred candidate, House Speaker Jose de Venecia, is
trailing the opposition candidate, Vice President Joseph Estrada,
in all popularity surveys.
</P>
<P>
"Intervention in the electoral process to gain victory for any
candidate by fraudulent means is a grave sin," he said, adding
that collusion by the military in any such intervention will be
opposed with "people power."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, former Philippine president Corazon Aquino also issued
the same warning.
</P>
<P>
"People power" is the synonym for the 1986 popular revolt in
which former president Ferdinand Marcos was toppled. Marcos was
accused of having stolen a snap presidential election against
Corazon Aquino.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Become Taxi Drivers in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Some Tibetan farmers who used to ride
yaks as a means of transportation have never imagined that they
would be driving a taxi in the city of Lhasa, capital of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Because taxis are now in vogue in Lhasa, not only city
dwellers, but also farmers, are looking at this new way to make a
living.
</P>
<P>
Cedan, a farmer from the Lhasa suburbs, says, "Driving taxis is
really a good job. Farmers can make more money by driving taxis in
the city, and learn more at the same time."
</P>
<P>
Since the first taxi company was set up in Lhasa in 1994, the
number of taxis has increased from 10 to 970.
</P>
<P>
Farmers from the suburbs now account for half the taxi drivers
in Lhasa, where they make from 1,000 yuan to 3,000 yuan (360 US
dollars) a month, according to Losang Doje, director of the Lhasa
Taxi Administrative Office.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan passengers have begun choosing the taxi they want to
ride in, and Santana, a fairly spacious car, has become their
favorite, says Bai Ling, a taxi company manager.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Muslim Rebels Say Won't Disrupt Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippines' Muslim rebels said they
will not disrupt next week's national elections and most of them
will vote for candidates of their choice, the Manila Standard
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said Ghazali Jaafar, chief peace negotiator for the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), disputed press reports that
the MILF plans to disrupt the May 11 polls.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 1,000 armed men who claimed to be
MILF members surrounded a campaign rally last Saturday in
Mindanao, the southern Philippines, warning there will be
bloodshed if the elections were held as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar denied the men were MILF guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
"There is no truth that we have warned (the government) to
postpone the elections," he was quoted as saying. "In fact, with
the exception of the commanders, MILF guerrillas are free to
participate, campaign and vote."
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which has been holding peace talks with the
government since last year, is now the biggest rebel group still
fighting the government after the Moro National Liberation Front
signed a final peace agreement in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that more violence will take place during
the May 11 elections. At least 17 people have been killed in
election-related violence.
</P>
<P>
During the 1992 presidential elections, more than 100 people
were killed in election-related violence.

STOCKHOLM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Finance Minister Erik
Asbrink clarified on Monday that there is no fixed timetable for
Sweden to join European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
The minister said this after comments he made over the weekend
were interpreted as meaning that Sweden could join the EMU before
the introduction of euro.
</P>
<P>
Asbrink said there was no debate in Sweden about linking the
Swedish currency crown to European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM).
</P>
<P>
"But exactly how this criteria will be interpreted remains to
be seen," he said.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister added that he was "rather confident" that
the Swedish crown would continue to do well, even outside the
EMU.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Jilin province in northeast China
is using various means to get foreign investment to promote its
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, Jilin had used 5.1 billion US dollars worth
of foreign investment. Vice-Governor Wei Minxue says that this
meant an increase in the per-project investment from 656,000 US
dollars in 1992 to 1.23 million US dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment is used for infrastructural and industrial
projects and major projects are strongly supported by foreign
investment. About 40 percent of the funds for the 10 key projects
in the province during the 1991-95 period came from foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment was also used for state-owned enterprise
reforms. By last November, the province had approved 1,505 such
projects, involving 1.49 billion US dollars worth of foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies paid two billion yuan in taxes, or 13 percent
of the total tax revenues in Jilin in 1997, up 50 percent from
1996.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-backed companies have about 170,000 employees,
accounting for 1.4 percent of the total number of workers in
Jilin.

<P>
PARIS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Colin McRae survived a big
scare in the Corsican Rally on Monday when he was disqualified
after his tyres were declared illegal but then reinstated on
appeal.
</P>
<P>
The British driver had taken an impressive lead in his Subaru
after the six stages on the first day.
</P>
<P>
But the rally stewards decided the treads on his car's tyres
were unusually worn and ruled they were thinner than the
regulations permitted.
</P>
<P>
Subaru appealed and the rally jury accepted the team's
explanations.
</P>
<P>
Subaru claimed that McRae's front right tyre had punctured at
the start of the second stage, putting more strain on the left
tyre.
</P>
<P>
The stewards accepted the Scot back into the rally because
of the "unusual circumstances".
</P>
<P>
As a result, McRae was reinstated at the top of the standings.
Frenchman Francois Delecour came second slower by 20.7 seconds
with McRae's Subaru teammate Piero Latti of Italy third, almost
three seconds further back.

<P>
SHANGHAI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- While northeast China is still
dealing with a serious drought, the city of Shanghai and
neighboring provinces are calling for help in flood control
activities.
</P>
<P>
The society has been urged to get ready early. The Minhang
District is setting aside 6.2 million yuan to repair a breach in
the 36-km Huangpu River Dike. The amount of funds from Fengxian
County for dikes and dams now amounts to 6.7 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists say that, based on recent abnormal weather
conditions like windstorms, heavy late spring rains, and record
high water levels in the Yangtze River in the dry season, Shanghai
should prepare for serious flooding.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu Qihua, head of the Shanghai water resources
bureau, Shanghai's facilities are not really ready for the fight
and that the city's 208-km bulwark for the urban area is only half
done.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that the city's fast growing economy cannot afford a
disaster.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Panel to Hold Hearing on Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A subcommittee of the U.S. Senate
is set to hold a hearing next month on a suspected increase in
abusive child labor in the United States, Senator Tom Harkin said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Labor and Human Resources subcommittee on employment
scheduled a hearing on June 11, said Harkin, a senior Democrat on
the full committee.
</P>
<P>
"Child labor abuses are not confined to developing nations,"
Harkin said. "Most Americans would be shocked to see that some
children in this country are spending more time in factories and
fields than schools and playgrounds."
</P>
<P>
More than 290,000 children -- two-thirds of them 15 or younger
-- were employed illegally in the United States at some point in
1996, according to an Associated Press series published this
winter.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Labor Department found 36 working illegally in
Texas for nine companies. Some were as young as six years old,
Harkin's office said.
</P>
<P>
"It disturbs me that tens of thousands of American children are
being exploited by being forced to work illegally, and in some
cases in hazardous conditions," said Harkin, who requested the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
The senator said he planned to introduce legislation that would
increase minimum and maximum penalties for violators of child
labor laws.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Disbursement of 989 Million US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) announced here Monday the approval of the release of the
next disbursement of about 989.4 million U.S. dollars equivalent
to Indonesia to help the country carry out reform program.
</P>
<P>
The payment, the second installment of a 10 billion dollar loan
approved last November, had been delayed from March while the two
sides renegotiated a new reform package under which Indonesia
introduced some reform measures.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Fischer, the Acting Managing Director of the
institution, issued a statement confirming the IMF Executive
Directors' approval of the payment.
</P>
<P>
Executive Directors noted that the revised program benefited
from a number of important prior actions by the Indonesian
authorities, including a strengthened monetary framework, the
statement said. Directors stressed the importance of sustained
implementation of the program for restoring confidence in the
Indonesian economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF approval would open the door to funding from bilateral
donors and other multilateral institutions. The IMF loan
constitutes part of a 40 billion dollar international rescue deal
for the trouble-ridden country.
</P>
<P>
The IMF three-year stand-by credit equivalent to 9.84 billion
dollars was approved on November 5, last year. Today's approval of
payment will bring total disbursements under the credit to about
3.96 billion dollars for Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Blacks, Latinos Poorly Presented in Silicon Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Blacks and Latinos are largely
missing out on the Silicon Valley technology boom -- California's
most powerful economic engine, San Francisco Chronicle reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two minority groups, who make up 8 percent and 14 percent
of the San Francisco Bay Area labor force respectively, are the
fastest-growing segment of the state's population. But employment
records for 33 of the leading Silicon Valley firms show that their
Bay Area staffs are about 4 percent black and 7 percent Latino.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in these companies they work far more likely than
whites to hold factory, service and support jobs, and less likely
than whites to hold managerial and professional jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper's research, education, laws and
discrimination are among the reasons for the lack of blacks and
Latinos in high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
In education, not enough blacks and Latinos are earning the
math and science degrees that prepare them for high-tech careers.
In addition, many Silicon Valley firms fail to seek out blacks and
Latinos at minority job fairs and college campuses with large
black and Latino populations. There are also virtually no
top-ranking blacks and Latinos in Silicon Valley to inspire and
mentor younger employees. Blacks and Latinos say racism exists in
high technology, as it does in other industries.
</P>
<P>
Under California's Affirmative Action laws, government
contractors -- including most large high-tech firms -- are
required to show they are making a good faith effort to recruit
minorities. But violators rarely pay fines.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the other side of the argument, the companies say it
is not the industry's fault that there are so few blacks and
Latinos qualified for professional high-tech jobs. Silicon Valley
considers itself a meritocracy, they say, where the color of a
person's skin doesn't matter as long as he can do the job.
</P>
<P>
They say that it is unfair to make corporations responsible for
education. In Silicon Valley, an engineering or computer science
degree is a ticket to full employment. But the supply is
shrinking. The number of math, computer science and engineering
bachelor's degrees earned by all U.S. students has slipped by
nearly one-fifth in the past decades and these degrees awarded to
blacks to Latinos were less than 11 percent of the total in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Chronicle argued that the lack of a math and science background
cannot be the only reason why there aren't more blacks and Latinos
working in Silicon Valley. The majority of jobs, such as many
professional positions in human resources, accounting, finance and
marketing, do not require a technical degree.

<HEADLINE> Second Albright-Netanyahu Meeting Ends in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Second meeting between U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu ended here Monday evening without any
indication that a new Middle East peace deal is under way.
</P>
<P>
Shai Bazak, Israeli government spokesman, declined to give any
details of the meeting but announced that Prime Minister Netanyahu
will have a third round of meeting with Albright Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Albright, who was locked in heated talks
with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders, was due to have a
second of meeting with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said early Monday
that the United States was not optimistic that they could bridge
the significant gaps between the Palestinians and the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
"Our optimism is not high based on the evidence that we've seen
so far, but we are going to continue to work at it and we very
much want these meetings to be decisive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Albright, whose government is striving to revive the deadlocked
Middle East peace process, early Monday held separate talks with
both Netanyahu and Arafat but failed to broker any breakthrough
between them.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Plans to Test Staff for Illegal Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Speaker Newt Gingrich of the
House of Representatives plans to begin testing his staff for
illegal drug use, his spokeswoman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Details are under discussion, said the spokeswoman, Christina
Martin.
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress are free to test their own staffs, but
Republican Representatives Joe Barton of Texas and Dan Burton of
Indiana are the only ones who say they do so.
</P>
<P>
Barton and retiring Republican Representative Gerald Solomon is
co-sponsoring a measure, to be introduced soon, that would require
drug testing for all House members and their staffs.
</P>
<P>
"The key will be when members start testing themselves," Barton
said through a spokeswoman. "We need to test members of Congress.
That's what the American people are waiting to see."
</P>
<P>
Gingrich's plan was first reported by the Capitol Hill
newspaper, Roll Call.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich has stepped up his criticism of the Clinton
administration for alleged failures to address the illegal
drug-use problem. At a Republican rally last week, he outlined a
broad legislative agenda against drugs.
</P>
<P>
The House has plans to vote in the next few months on a range
of anti-drug bills.
