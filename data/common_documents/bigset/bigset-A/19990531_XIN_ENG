<HEADLINE> An Expanded Arab Summit Likely: Egyptian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The holding of an expanded Arab
summit is likely under the current circumstances, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that President Hosni Mubarak has
expressed Egypt's interest in and desire for holding an Arab
summit on that scale.
</P>
<P>
But high-level contacts need to be conducted at the right time
"to ensure the concurrence of Arab parties and thus provide the
propitious climate," Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Arabs are currently at the stage of coordination
and consultation among the five sides, namely Egypt, Jordan,
Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians, directly involved in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has called for a meeting among leaders of Egypt,
Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians to forge a unified
stance on the peace process in light of the victory of Ehud Barak,
moderate leader of the Israeli opposition Labor party, in the May
17 elections.
</P>
<P>
Discussions are under way among the five parties for the
possible convocation of the summit, which might lead to an
expanded Arab summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
Coordination between Egypt and Syria constitutes an integral
part of the discussions among the Arab countries concerned, Moussa
said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister flew to Damascus on Saturday and
held talks with his Syrian counterpart Farouq al-Sharaa and
President Hafez al-Assad in a bid to persuade Syria to take part
in the proposed summit.
</P>
<P>
Syria has showed little interest in the meeting as it is still
keeping distance from the Palestinians due to the Palestinians'
signing of interim peace accords separately with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Moussa reiterated that Egypt is ready to give a momentum to the
peace efforts and only accepts a balanced peace based on the
land-for-peace principle.

<HEADLINE> Iran Needs 2 Billion Dollars Investment in Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran needs 2 billion U.S. dollars
investment to boost its energy to meet the country's growing
electricity consumption, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
on Sunday quoted Energy Minister Habibollah Bitaraf as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bitaraf told IRNA Saturday in Vienna at the end of his
three-day official visit to Austria that Iran's electricity
consumption growth rate stands at 7 percent or 2,000 megawatts
annually.
</P>
<P>
He said that investment in the transfer and distribution
sectors would be made totally in rials while in production
sector, 40 percent of the investment would be made in foreign
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Iranian Energy Ministry needs 600 million
dollars investment in foreign exchanges and 1.4 billion dollars
in rials every year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's electricity output has reached 102 billion
kilowatts-hour in the past Iranian year which ended on March 20,
Iranian Deputy Energy Minister for Electricity Affairs Mohammad
Mallaki said last month.
</P>
<P>
Mallaki said the country's electricity output would increase
to 108 billion kilowatts-hour in the current Iranian year.

CAIRO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
began talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Sunday evening
on the latest developments in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah arrived in Cairo earlier in the day for a two-day
visit and went straight into the talks, also attended by senior
officials of both countries and top aides of the two
leaders, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to cover Mubarak's call for a summit
among Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians, the news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will review the coordination and consultations
among the Arab parties on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Following the victory of Ehud Barak, moderate leader of
Israel's opposition Labor party, in the May 17 elections, Mubarak
called for the five-way summit in a bid to forge a unified Arab
stance on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak has pledged to push the peace talks with the Palestinians
forward and resume negotiations with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first stop of the Jordanian king's ongoing tour,
which will also take him to Algeria, Tunisia and France.

<HEADLINE> AL Warns Against Israeli Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid on Sunday warned against Israel's provocative
measures on settlement expansion in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing Israeli Likud government led by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to add 10 square kilometers to the
settlement of Maale Adumim, east of Jerusalem, where 25,000 Jewish
settlers are living.
</P>
<P>
With the expansion, Maale Adumim will border on Jerusalem and
further cut off the eastern sector of the city, which the
Palestinians want as a future capital, from its West Bank
hinterland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Hungary's new
ambassador to Egypt, Abdel-Meguid said the Israeli move "will only
complicate the situation and do not serve confidence-building
trends" between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The step will only place more obstacles to the Mideast peace
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
An enlarged Maale Adumim will also make it more difficult for
Israel and the Palestinians to reach a creative solution to the
future of Jerusalem, the most sticky issue in their peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Little progress has been made in the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations since 1996 when Netanyahu came to power due to, among
other things, Israel's intransigent policy on settlement
activities.
</P>
<P>
Hope seems to have been brought back to the peace process after
Ehud Barak, moderate leader of the Israel opposition Labor party,
was elected the country's next prime minister. The Palestinians
have called on him to speak out against the outgoing government's
decision.

<P>
BRUSSELS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the 15-nation
European Union (EU) are to meet here in Brussels on Monday to
discuss Balkan issue during their monthly General Affairs Council.
</P>
<P>
The 15 ministers will debate the measures in regard to a
Stabilization and Association process for the countries of
south-eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, EU's executive body, had proposed a
series of bilateral Stabilization and Association Agreements
between the EU and the countries most affected by the crisis in
Kosovo as its contribution to a Stability Pact for the Balkan.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is the brainchild of the current German Presidency of
the European Union, and it was discussed at a meeting of the
countries concerned on May 27 in Bonn," the EU executive said.
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner Hans van den Broek said that this type of
agreement would give Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
and Albania a "political signal with regard to the possibility of
one day being integrated into the structures of the European Union
as part of a long-term effort".

DAR ES SALAAM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda,
members of the East African Cooperation (EAC), have agreed to

common regional banking laws.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has been reached by Tanzanian Finance Minister

<HEADLINE> Shas Party Leader Tries to Overturn Graft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Aryeh Deri, leader of Israel's
powerful religious Shas party, submitted his appeal to the
Supreme Court on Sunday in a bid to overturn his conviction by the
Jerusalem District Court on charges of graft.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that Deri presented a 75-page appeal to
Supreme Court President Aharon Barak on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The appeal reportedly challenged nearly every decision and
sentence against Deri by the district court.
</P>
<P>
Deri claimed that the court drew most of its conclusions based
on circumstantialities, rather than evidence.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court is going to determine whether the appeal will
be heard by a regular panel of three judges or by a wider
panel. And it will also set a date for the hearing of the case in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
Deri was convicted of bribe-taking, fraud and breach of public
trust by the Jerusalem District Court last month, and was
sentenced to four years in prison later.
</P>
<P>
At Deri's request, the court delayed the implementation of the
sentence until Deri had exhausted his right to appeal the decision
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The Shas party won 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset
(parliament) in the May 17 elections, an amazing growth from 10
seats in the last Knesset.
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak was hesitant at bringing
Shas into his new coalition government as many left-wing political
figures refused to accept Shas with convicted Deri as its head.
</P>
<P>
If Deri could be acquitted by the Supreme Court, it would be
easier for Shas to join the new government.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Sets up Voluntary AIDS Testing Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Voluntary Counselling and
Testing Centers for AIDS tests are being established in most urban
centers to offer AIDS tests at a subsidized fee.
</P>
<P>
National AIDS Council Program Director Everisto Marowa told the
Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana Sunday that the testing centers would
also provide information to the community.
</P>
<P>
He said Bulawayo, the country's second largest city, was the
first to have a test center two years back, but the rest are in
Harare, the capital. There will be more centers opening up in
other regions in the country.
</P>
<P>
The cost of these tests was being subsidized by a number of
donors as a contribution to the control of the spread of the
deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
He hoped this new development would persuade more people to
seek tests for the virus.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that testing was not the solution to
everything, but counselling and the injection of vital information
on HIV/Aids would be helpful.
</P>
<P>
AIDS continued to have a devastating impact on Zimbabwe's
population of 12.5 million, with about 25 percent of the adults
population infected.
</P>
<P>
Projections for the year 2005 estimated that 1.2 million
Zimbabweans would have died from the disease and more nearly one
million children would lose one or both parents.

<HEADLINE> Barak Urged to Halt Settlements Immediately </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Sunday sent a strong-worded message to Israeli
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak, urging him to break his silence
and stop the intensified Jewish settlement activities in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Barak is called upon to lift his silence and take steps to
stop measures taken by Netanyahu which will destroy the peace
process," said Tayeb Abdul Rahim, Secretary of PNA Chairman
Yasser Arafat, referring to outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Conference to Confront Settlements held
in Ramallah, Abdul Rahim also called for physical confrontation
against Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
"We are called upon to translate our anger into confrontation
to stop the settlement construction," he told hundreds of
representatives of various Palestinian political factions.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held after the Israeli government decided last
week to expand Maale Adumin, the biggest Jewish settlement in the
West Bank, to link it to the Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The expansion decision was among a series of settlement
activities taking place before and after the Israeli general
elections on May 17, including grabbing of hilltops in the
West Bank and the construction of Jewish houses in Har Homa
and the Ras El-Amoud neighborhood, both in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
These stepped-up activities were widely seen as attempts by
Jewish settlers as well as the outgoing government to create
facts on the ground before the new government begins final
status talks with the Palestinians, in which the fate of
settlements will be discussed.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Maale Adumin, its extension to the borders of
Jerusalem would form a band of Israeli-held land that cuts the
West Bank in half, thus destroying the continuity of
Palestinian-controlled areas, which the Palestinians desperately
need when they establish an independent state in the future.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who has pledged to revive the peace talks with the
Palestinians, has stated that he would keep large blocs of
settlements under Israeli control, implying that small and
isolated ones will be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
But he has kept silent on the increasing settlement activities
since he defeated Netanyahu in the prime ministerial race. His
aides said it's inappropriate for him to speak out since he is
still conducting coalition talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are concerned that he might have his hands
tied if he finally forms a coalition including right-wing parties
such as the Likud and the National Religious Party, which
favor expanding Jewish settlements activities.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council,
warned that the Palestinians would not go into any new
negotiations if the new government under Barak does not take firm
measures to stop the settlements.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, the top Palestine Liberation Organization
official in East Jerusalem, called the situation "very critical."
</P>
<P>
"If there are no confrontations on grounds all over the
area, neither Barak's promises, nor certain principles can end
settlements," he said.
</P>
<P>
The conference called on Palestinians in the West Bank and
Gaza to stage large-scale protest against Jewish settlements on
Thursday, "a day of anger" as described by Palestinian
officials.

<P>
BAGHDAD, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on
Sunday met with visiting Indian Minister of Petroleum
K. Ramamurthy, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Indian minister conveyed a letter from Indian caretaker
Prime Minister Bihari Vajpayee to Saddam, which deals with means
of enhancing the relations between the two countries, especially
in the oil, health and agricultural fields.
</P>
<P>
Ramamurthy who arrived here on Friday evening, thanked the
Iraqi government for its clear position toward the situation in
the South Asian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
Saddam said that both India and Iraq are Asian countries, and
the evils in the world have vital interests in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Colonial countries do not believe in dialog and negotiation
to arrive at balanced relations," said Saddam, adding that "we
know these evil octopuses" will confront Iraq because Iraq and
India have common features.
</P>
<P>
On the Indian-Pakistani relations, Saddam said the U.S. wants
to push the two countries to military conflicts in order to tell
other countries that it is their nuclear potentialities that
have brought them the calamities.
</P>
<P>
The Indian minister said that India is fully aware that
military escalation with Pakistan will lead to the
U.S. intervention and deterioration of the situation in this
region.
</P>
<P>
Disputes between India and Pakistan over Kashmir have
escalated into military conflicts since Wednesday as Indian
warplanes began bombing targets in the Indian-controlled part of
Kashmir on account of Pakistan's infiltration attempts.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S.-led NATO aggression on Yugoslavia, the Iraqi
president said the U.S. covers the aggression on Yugoslavia with
a vain pretext that they are defending Muslims in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that during the Indian oil minister's
visit, Iraq and India will sign an agreement on oil
cooperation.

ISLAMABAD -- The Pakistani military Sunday dismissed India's
claim as "rubbish and malicious" that an Indian pilot was killed
by Pakistani troops after he was captured in Kargil sector.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian claim is false, malicious, concocted and a move to
cover up its brutalities and mislead the world opinion," a
military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that any prisoner of war, especially a pilot
is an important asset and no man of conscience could even think to
kill him.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Air Force Sunday condemned what it called the "cold-
blooded murder" of one of its pilots after he bailed out of his
crippled jet and was allegedly captured by the Pakistani army.
</P>
<P>
The body of the pilot, Squadron Leader Ajay Ahuja, which was
handed over to the Indian army by Pakistan late Friday, bore three
bullet wounds, Indian sources told journalists in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Ahuja ejected out of his Mig 21 fighter jet after it was hit by
a surface-to-air missile during airstrikes against what New Delhi
calls "infiltrators" holed up in the high reaches of the Kargil
sector in Kashmir on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is holding as a prisoner of war another Indian air
force pilot, Flight Lieutenant K. Nachiketa, who was captured
alive after ejecting from a second Mig shot down the same day. (

JERUSALEM -- Two days after the remains of a lost Israeli
submarine were found, a senior Israeli official said on Sunday
that the submarine's sinking seemed not to be caused by an enemy
action.
</P>

Gedo Raz, head of the Israeli team searching for the submarine,
was quoted by Israel Radio as saying that initial findings showed
that the submarine might not be sank by a torpedo.
</P>
<P>
Raz added that the probable cause of sinking appeared to be a
technical malfunction or a collision with another vessel on the
water.

The submarine, named as Dakar, mysteriously disappeared with 69
sailors on board in 1968 while on its maiden voyage from Britain

<P>
HARARE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Higher Education and
 Technology of Zimbabwe has applied for a supplementary budget of
600 million Zimbabwean dollars (15 million U.S. dollars) from
treasury to meet some of its outstanding projects for the 1999
financial year.
</P>
<P>
Minister of the ministry Ignatius Chombo told the Zimbabwe News
Agency Sunday that insufficient funds had forced his ministry to
cut expenditure on some capital projects.
</P>
<P>
"We have put in a bid as we have run out, and our budget has a
shortfall of 600 million Zimbabwean dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the bulk of the supplementary budget was
needed to cover vocational training loans, capital projects and
equipment for vocational training centers.
</P>
<P>
So far 12 vocational training centers have been established,
but more are needed to cover nationwide needs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chombo hoped parliament would approve the supplementary budget
when it resumed seating in July.
</P>
<P>
Almost all government ministries have applied for supplementary
budgets barely halfway through the current financial year, the
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar and the subsequent
inflation have been blamed for the seemingly financial
irresponsibility the ministries have found themselves in.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Abubakar Military Govt Widely Praised in Nigeria By Wang Jinyu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The former Head of State General
Abudulsalami Abubakar was widely praised in Nigeria for keeping
his promises by handing over power to democratically-elected
government on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Former Minister of Agriculture Shetima Mustapha commended
General Abubakar for ensuring the success of the transition
program, and for the maintenance of peace, unity and stability in
the country during his 11- month in power, the New Nigerians
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated the out-going head of state for the successful
handing- over of power to President Olusegun Obasanjo, and called
on Nigerians to cooperate with the new government with a view to
ensuring the success of the civilian government.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Mamuda Yantumaki, gubernatorial candidate of the All
People's Party (APP) for Katsina State, expressed appreciation
to the out-going head of state for fulfilling his promise and
handing over to a civilian on May 29 as earlier scheduled.
</P>
<P>
He called on President Obasanjo to be just and fair so that
every section of the country would have a sense of belonging, and
to initiate measures that will strengthen the value of the
country's currency.
</P>
<P>
Former Minister of State on Petroleum Alhaji Umaru Baba told
the media that General Abubakar had proven to Nigerians that he is
sincere and was truly committed to the return of civil rule to
the country.
</P>
<P>
Mussafir Hotel, general manager of a Total filling station,
also commended the Abubakar administration for moving the nation
forward democratically after past regimes had wasted billions of
the country's hard earned resources in executing transition to
civil rule programs.
</P>
<P>
"But the Abubakar administration during its short span of
reign, executed the shortest transition program ever in the
history of the country, he deserves commendation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Yazid Ibrahim, a foremost member of the People's Democratic
Party (PDP) in Kaduna, said the Nigerian governments had spent
time and resources tackling political problems with total neglect
of the economy.
</P>
<P>
According to him, key macro-economic policies of government
must as a matter of urgency focus on employment creation and
protection of a process to ensure appreciation of local currency
Naira exchange rate and eradication of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Isah, secretary of Kaduna Chapter of the Keffi Old
Boys Association, said that for the first time in the history of
the country, a military man had kept faith it promises,
attributing the success of the transition to democratic rule to
the steadfastness of General Abubakar.

<HEADLINE> 9 Killed as Taxi Crashes Into Bridge in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Nine people, including a
four-year-old boy, were killed and 11 others were injured when a
minibus taxi crashed into a bridge in southern KwaZulu-Natal
Saturday afternoon, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The taxi, carrying 19 passengers back to Wartburg from a
monthly shopping trip, crashed into the Umgeni bridge when a tire
burst.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesman Colin Govender,
 who was at the scene of the accident, as saying that eight people
were flung out the taxi into the Umgeni River 20 meters below.
</P>
<P>
Five were believed to have drowned, including the four-year-old
boy, whose body was found with his head submerged between rocks,
Govender said.
</P>
<P>
Four people died from the impact of the collision and had to be
cut out of the mangled taxi.
</P>
<P>
Govender said one man's leg was amputated in the accident and,
bleeding profusely, he and the other injured victims were taken to
Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg.
</P>
<P>
The driver, in his late 40s, was unable to speak because his
mouth was cut open.
</P>
<P>
He could face charges of culpable homicide, Govender said.

<HEADLINE> 686 Girls Rescued From Pre-Arranged Early Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The scheduled marriages of 686
underage girls have reportedly been cancelled in southern zone of
the Tigray regional state, the Ethiopian News Agency reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A report dispatched from Mekelle, capital of the Tigray
regional state, quoted the local women's association as saying
that the teens were rescued from settling in an early marriage, a
long time customary practice, after agreements reached among
involved parties and concerned bodies.
</P>
<P>
"The girls who were to be wed in a traditional, family-brokered
 matrimony had already cut off their schooling, awaiting their
ill-desired union," the association said.
</P>
<P>
The association had firmly stood against the marriages from
taking place with a view to preventing them from physical and
psychological health complications such connubiality would entail,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Early marriage has for long been an accepted tradition in most
rural areas in Ethiopia and is said to have been the major factor
inhibiting women's involvement in schools.
</P>
<P>
The Tigray state council had last year endorsed a family law
limiting the marriageable age at 18 and 22 respectively for girls
and men.
</P>
<P>
The number of early marriages that took place in the southern
zone of the Tigray state this year was less by 70 percent than
last year, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Still Working on Release of Jailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
 Mandela is still hopeful that two Australian aid workers jailed
by a Yugoslav military court would ultimately be released, the
president's office said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Mandela was asked by former Australian
Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to intercede on the Australians'
behalf.
</P>
<P>
Mandela then phoned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in an attempt to secure their
release.
</P>
<P>
The president's office Sunday declined to comment on the men's
conviction.
</P>
<P>
"The matter is still being handled. It is at a very sensitive
stage. The president is still working on it," presidential aide
Parks Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was "very much in touch" with Yeltsin and Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the president was hopeful that the Australians would
be released, Mankahlana said: "The president would not be involved
in the matter if he did not believe that."
</P>
<P>
The two men, Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace, were sentenced to
12 years and four years in prison respectively while their
Yugoslav co-worker Branko Jelen received a six-year term.
</P>
<P>
The two men were cleared of the original charge of doing
espionage for NATO, but were convicted of a new charge of passing
on information after a secret trial.
</P>
<P>
Their lawyers said an appeal would be lodged against their
conviction.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Major Achievements in S.Africa's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africans will cast
their votes in the second all-race elections in the country's
history. It is believed that the ruling party of the African
National Congress (ANC) will win most of the votes in the
election.
</P>
<P>
The first all-race elections held in 1994 has put an end to the
 apartheid system which had dominated the country for 340 years,
and has started political and social transitions.
</P>
<P>
The ANC's overwhelming victory five years ago has brought the
country its first democratic constitution and the return of the
isolated nation to the world community.
</P>
<P>
All the South Africans, especially the blacks, has begun to
enjoy for the first time legal equality, citizenship and human
rights.
</P>
<P>
The national reconciliation sponsored by the ruling party has
eased the conflicts and killings between the black and the white
and also between the black dominated parties, specially between
the ruling ANC and the opposition Inkatha Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
Most people in the country have benefited from the arrival of
the democratic government and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Through its Growth, Employment and Redistribution (Gear) Plan,
the five- year-old ANC government has considerably improved the
living standard of the black people which account about 80 percent
of the country's total population.
</P>
<P>
The government's housing subsidy has made houses affordable to
some one million poor people; medical aid to underdeveloped
regions has benefited some five million people in remote and rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Political and social transformation have peacefully resolved
all the differences over how to deal with the violent activities
in the apartheid era and successfully avoided Nuremberg-style
trial of those who committed such crimes.
</P>
<P>
Most of the South Africans and the international community have
 contributed the achievements to former ANC chief and outgoing
President Nelson Mandela, who has appointed Thabo Mbeki as his
successor.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's strong will of abandoning apartheid, sustained
efforts for democracy and his unique personality have won
popularity in home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
As a new member of the international community, South Africa
has become chairman state of the U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development, the Southern African Development Community and the
Non-Aligned Movement. It has begun to play a more and more
important role in regional and world affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to a public survey issued recently, the ANC remains
to be the most welcome party in the country. However, the
popularity of the party is by no means indicating that the future
ANC government will have plain sailing.
</P>
<P>
Violent crimes, high rate of unemployment, housing shortage
corruption and poor efficiency of the administration are the major
pressing issues facing the new government.
</P>
<P>
It is generally expected that following the June 2 elections,
Mbeki and his ANC government will in their next five-year term
contribute more to improving relations between different races and
parties.

<HEADLINE> Pak Denies Indian Allegation of Killing Its Pilot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani Foreign Ministry on
Monday categorically rejected the Indian allegation of killing its
pilot.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing here, Foreign Office spokesman
Tariq Altaf said India's accusation that its pilot, Squadron
leader Ajay Ahuja, was killed in Pakistan's custody, was
"irresponsible, offensive and motivated."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has categorically rejected the Indian allegation, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan claimed to have shot down two Indian MiG jet fighters
on May 27 which were alleged to violate the airspace in
Pakistan-administered Kashmir. One pilot was killed while the
other was captured.
</P>
<P>
The Indian side has accused Pakistan of killing the pilot, Ajay
Ahuja, in the custody. However, the spokesman categorically denied
the Indian allegation, saying that "he (the pilot) died before we
found him."
</P>
<P>
The dead body of the Indian pilot has been returned to the
Indian side.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has demonstrated full respect for and adherence to
international norms and principles applicable in such situations,"
said Altaf.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has nothing to gain from such an act as is obvious
from the fact that the other Indian Air Force pilot, Lt. K.
Nachiketa, is safe and sound and he is being treated in accordance
with established norms," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani troops had found the dead body of Ahuja on the
Pakistani side of the Line of Control and it was returned to the
Indian authorities without delay, said Altaf.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial on International Children's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- An editorial appears in tomorrow's
People's Daily entitled "Protecting Children and Creating a Bright
Future" for the 50th anniversary of International Children's Day.
</P>
<P>
It sends warm regards to children from all of China's ethnic
groups and to teachers and others who work for the children's
cause.
</P>
<P>
Fifty years ago, the Women's International Democratic
Federation chose June 1 as a day for children all over the world
and in December of that year, the Chinese government also
recognized it as children's day.
</P>
<P>
There are 367 million children below the age of 17 in China,
more than in any other country on earth, and the Chinese Communist
Party and government place great importance on their health and
the children's cause has made progress, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
China prepared an Outline of the Chinese Children Development
Program in the 1990s and enacted the Law Protecting Chinese
Children, and children's survival, protection and development have
improved since the reforms and opening-up started in 1978.
</P>
<P>
But better conditions for children's survival, protection and
development are needed, the editorial says, because they are
closely related to the nation's prosperity and revitalization and
the happiness of people.
</P>
<P>
Those illegal actions that harm children need to be severely
dealt with, the editorial says, and a better education provided
for children, especially those in poor rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia, South Korea Seek Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagbandy and his visiting South Korean counterpart Kim Dae-jung
Monday expressed satisfaction over the development of bilateral
ties and pledged to achieve a new stage of growth in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Bagbandy said Kim's visit was a historic event that laid the
groundwork for the two countries to develop a relationship of
complementary cooperation oriented toward the 21st century. He
said Mongolia would make full-scale efforts to expand and develop
its relationship with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries' mutually beneficial cooperation will
benefit both countries and also contribute to the stability,
development and security in northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who arrived here Sunday on a three-day visit, said that
South Korea supports Mongolia's policy for democracy and for
developing a market economy, and will adhere to the decision to
expand and develop trade with Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
It will also support investment in Mongolia and the development
of cooperation between the two countries' businesses. It will
also provide, to the best of its ability, financial aid to
Mongolia. Kim has been the first South Korean president to visit
Mongolia since the two countries established diplomatic ties nine
years ago.
</P>
<P>
South Korea plans to provide 3.1 million U.S. dollars in free
aid to Mongolia and 19 million dollars in loans on favorable terms
from 2000 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents agreed that both countries shared the same
stand on issues relating to security in northeast Asia and the
Asia-Pacific region. They contend that a multilateral cooperative
mechanism should be established between northeast Asian countries
to guarantee security in the region in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Bagbandy expressed his understanding and support for South
Korea's efforts which are aimed at maintaining peace and stability
in the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the South Korean president also met Mongolian
Prime Minister Janlaviin Narantsatsralt and Chairman of the State
Great Hural of Mongolia Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj.
</P>
<P>
Officials from both countries signed pacts on mutual judicial
assistance in and on the extradition of suspects as well as
agreements on educational and sports cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, South Korea has provided 14 million dollars to
Mongolia in loans on favorable terms and provides it with 200,000-
300,000 dollars in free aid annually. South Korea has become
Mongolia's fifth largest trading partner with the trade volume
hitting 74.8 million dollars in 1998. South Korean businesses
have had an investment of 14 million dollars in Mongolia so far.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Fertility Rate Rising in Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A new study, conducted by Olof
Akre of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and his colleagues,
indicates that fertility rates are actually rising, the Washington
Post said Monday.
</P>
<P>
For years some scientists have become concerned that pollution
may be causing the sperm count in men around the world to drop,
possibly threatening the fertility of the human race.
</P>
<P>
Akre and his colleagues examined birth records in Sweden
between 1983 and 1993 and found that the fertility rate had risen
over that decade.
</P>
<P>
"Much attention recently has been drawn to male reproductive
health, in part because of allegations of deteriorating sperm
quality in several populations," the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
"A decrease in male fertility cannot be ruled out on the bias
of the these results," they said. "But if present, it is minor and
totally outweighed by other favorable developments."

<HEADLINE> Scientists Say Better Quality Food Needed for China's Children  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese nutritionists told a
symposium here today that the country needs to make a greater
effort at developing food for children to ensure a healthy next
generation.
</P>
<P>
China has 350 million children below the age of 16, or 18.5
percent of the total number of people in the same age group in the
world and, even though things have improved, many children still
have nutrition problems.
</P>
<P>
A recent national study found that there is widespread lack of
calcium, iron, and other trace elements in children's food and
that their protein intake is insufficient. A quarter of the
children below the age of three are believed to be suffering from
rickets and 30 percent of the children below the age of five have
retarded growth.
</P>
<P>
These problems are more acute among rural children than among
urban children and this has a lot to do with food structure and
quality, according to Wang Wei, of the China Food Industry
Association.
</P>
<P>
Each year, about 20 million more children are born in China and
the annual demand for powdered milk is estimated at more than 200,
000 tons, but total output is only 60,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Quality is also a problem. One study of baby formulas found
that 52.9 percent of the domestic and 70 percent of the imported
brands were up to the standard.
</P>
<P>
Choices are also quite limited for other forms of food and many
are not very scientific, Wang says.

enterprises need to put more emphasis on developing infant formula,
milk and nutritional lunches for primary and middle school
students, and nutrition-enhanced food.
</P>
<P>
They said that there is great potential for infant food and
supplements because in spite of the fact that quite a few Chinese
industries have overproduction problems, the children's food
industry is not in that shape.
</P>
<P>
Chinese food for children is lacking both in quantity and
quality and companies need to take advantage of this opportunity.
</P>
<P>
The also asked enterprises to pay attention to the price of
children's, suggesting that reasonable is the best policy for
profits.

<P>
The World Bank Vice President for African Region, Jean-Louis

Bank would assist the new government in actualizing its economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
We know the economic situation is quite difficult in this
country. We hope to be able to help the new team that is
beginning to put the house back in order, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the much-desired relief of debts, which has amounted to 28
billion U. S. dollars, the vice president said the World Bank
would be more willing to forgive the debt of those countries that
manage their economy well, adding that, "we hope that is going to
be the case here."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman of Nigeria Labor Congress(NLC) promised
Sunday his organization will honor its promise of not launching
new strikes to assist the new government to achieve political
stability.
</P>
<P>
The NLC has successfully concluded earlier this month its
nationwide strike for 3500-Naira (about 37 U.S. dollar) minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
Among other good news for the new administration are the rising
of Naira' s value to U.S. dollar and U.S. government's promised
expanding of this year's development aid to 20 million U.S.

LAGOS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Ijaw and Itsekiri youths in Nigeria's
oil rich Delta region resumed their hostilities with about 50
people killed and many others injured, reported a Nigerian daily
paper.
</P>
<P>
About 88 buildings have been burnt down when the warring youths
using "sophisticated weapons" attacked the Itsekiri Village of
Aroton in Warri South West local government area of Delta State,
reported Daily Times, one of Nigeria's leading daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The youths started their assault early in the morning after
disarming security personnel in a nearby camp.
</P>
<P>
The trouble was triggered off when tax collectors from the two
council areas, which are in a hot debate over the ownership of the
area, are on their revenue drives one week ago.
</P>
<P>
Warri area is traditionally a headache for the federal
government where locals are constantly warring for land ownership

<HEADLINE> WHO Chief's Message Marks World No-Tobacco Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- In a message delivered to mark the "
World No-Tobacco Day" on May 31, the head of the World Health
Organization (WHO), Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, advised people to
give up smoking as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that there are real health gains to be made
from stopping at any age," Brundtland said. "Those who give up in
their early 30s enjoy a life expectancy similar to people who
never smoked. I therefore invite all smokers to take a giant step
towards better health and 'leave the pack behind'."
</P>
<P>
A recent survey in a large developing country revealed that two-
thirds of smokers mistakenly believe that smoking does little or
no harm; few are interested in quitting and fewer still have
successfully quit.
</P>
<P>
"Giving up smoking is not easy. We know that nicotine is
powerfully addictive. All of us know people who have tried to
give up smoking only to find themselves drawn back to it a few
months later," Brundtland said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a challenge for us all, and we have to rise to it
because we know that getting more smokers to quit is the key to
reducing the projected tobacco-related death toll over the next
two decades," she said.
</P>
<P>
While admitting the successful and cost-effective treatments of
nicotine replacement medicines such as nicotine gum, patches,
nasal spray and inhalers as well as non-nicotine medicines such as
bupropion, the WHO head called on manufacturers to reduce the cost
in order to bring them within the reach of smokers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO statistics, there were 1.1 billion smokers in
the world at the beginning of the 1990s, 300 million in developed
countries and 800 million in developing countries. About one-
third of the world's adults were smokers at the beginning of the
this decade, and there is little sign that this proportion has
changed substantially since.
</P>
<P>
From 1950 to 2000, WHO said, tobacco will have killed more than
60 million people in developed countries alone, more than died in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
"If current trends continue, tobacco will kill more than 100
million people in the first two decades of the 21st century,"
warned WHO. "If the current trend continues, 500 million people
alive today will be killed by tobacco."

<HEADLINE> More Girls Attending School in Northern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- More girls are attending
school in the northern Chinese province of Hebei thanks to two
assistance projects.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show 99.8 percent of school age girls in the
province attending school, a figure that has caught up with male
children.
</P>
<P>
"Project Hope" and the "Chunlei Program" are the two projects
that have helped make this possible, a provincial official said
today.
</P>
<P>
So far, over 300 Hope schools have been built in the province
with money from the projects and 100,000 children have been able
to return to school as a result.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, about 99.1 percent of school age girls in the province
went to school, or 0.3 percentage points fewer than boys, and
figure became 99.8 percent by the end of last year, when girls
accounted for 48.9 percent of all students in the province.

WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Fossil hunters have discovered
an unusually intact pelvis bone dating back 200,000 year that is
providing new insights into how early human ancestors were shaped,
according to the Washington Post Monday.

<P>
Juan-Luis Arsuaga of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and
colleagues unearthed the pelvis at an archaeological site in
Atapuerca, Spain.
</P>
<P>
The nearly complete male pelvis is very broad, they said. this
suggests the females had even large brains.

This would mean that the percentage of adult brain size at birth
would be higher than in modern humans, they concluded.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cyprus Makes New Efforts for EU Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has closed its negotiations
with the European Union (EU) on 10 of the total 31 chapters under
EU considerations in its EU accession process, but it still has
long way to go before it becomes a EU member.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus concluded its recent negotiations for the European
Union (EU) membership on three more chapters, namely, consumer and
health protection, external trade relations and customs union.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government on Thursday also approved the negotiating
positions on another four chapters in the accession talks, which
cover free movement of capital, European Monetary Union, energy,
social policy which includes the thorny issue of liberalization of
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
But some people warned that although Cyprus' economy was well
ahead of other applicant countries, it is still hard for the
mediterranean nation to meet EU membership standards.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990. Along with Slovenia,
Hungary, Poland, Estonia and the Czech Republic, Cyprus started
substantive accession negotiations with the EU in November
1998. It hopes to be admitted as an EU member by January 2003.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides for months has been holding
consultations with political party leaders in a bid to gain their
support for a package of economic reforms, in the hope that some
urgent steps can be approved by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' fiscal deficit is expected to reach 6 percent of the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) this year, double the 3 percent
ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty. If not checked promptly,
this could endanger the future stability of the Cyprus economy and
jeopardize the accession talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' public debts had risen to 59.3 percent of the GDP,
dangerously approaching the 60 percent limit set by the EU.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Finance Minister Takis Clerides is planning to
present concrete proposals on measures to curb public spending,
tax rises to improve public revenue.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the value-added tax rate could be
raised to 10 percent or 11 percent from the present 8 percent this
autumn in an effort to bring it gradually up to the EU level of 15
percent by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
This would bring an additional 500 million U.S. dollars into
the state coffers, but would mean an extra 2,000 dollars to be
paid by each family as taxes.
</P>
<P>
On the semi-governmental organizations, such as the
Telecommunications, the Cyprus Airways and the Postal Service
sectors, the Cypriot government has committed itself to their
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus had initially asked for a one-year transitional period
for telecommunications after joining in the 15-nation EU, but
backed down after the EU said its request was unjustified.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' decision to withdraw the request was welcomed by the
EU, which also asked for a specific timetable from Cyprus as to
how the liberalization drive will proceed.
</P>
<P>
Clerides has also indicated that he would like to see the
parliament pass the bill removing the 9 percent ceiling on
interest rates before the summer recess. Some political figures
say the liberalization should come in 2000, others argue that it
should wait until Cyprus joins the EU.
</P>
<P>
The government enjoys no majority in the parliament and the
consent of some opposition parties is essential if any concrete
steps are to be adopted.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has also rejected the view, which is
time and again raised by some EU countries, that it is not in a
position to guarantee future fulfillment of the chapters of the
acquisition of communications in the whole island.
</P>
<P>
The government insists that there has been no link between the
accession process and the island's political issue. It believes
that the accession will be the catalyst to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus had been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with
Athens.

<HEADLINE> More Civilian Deaths and Injuries as NATO Intensifies Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS,May 31 (Xinhua) -- NATO continues to intensify its
air strikes against Yugoslavia amid new diplomatic efforts, while
more Serbian civilians were reportedly killed during NATO's 68th
day of raids.
</P>
<P>
A NATO spokesman said here on Monday that over 770 bomber
sorties were flown during the last 24 hours. It was the second
heaviest strike during the nine-week old air raids, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Yugoslav media, more than 20 civilians were
killed on Sunday in two separate attacks on a bridge and a
sanitarium. NATO confirmed that it struck a bridge in Varvarin,
central Serbia, in which at least 11 people were reportedly killed
and many others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, about 160 kilometers south of Belgrade, was
reportedly crowded with vehicles and people. Sources said the
bridge was struck twice with three missiles shortly after 1:00 p.m.
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, NATO warplanes bombed a sanitarium for the
elderly in Surdulica, southeastern Serbia, reportedly killing
about 10 civilians.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, two local people, a bus driver and an
interpreter were killed and three foreign journalists were wounded
by NATO bombs while traveling by bus. The journalists were from
Britain, France and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Britain on Monday asked the Red Cross to visit London Times
newspaper journalist Ere-Ann Prentice, who was injured during the
NATO air raid in Kosovo.

BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, the chief of General
Staff of China's People's Liberation Army, in a meeting here today
with Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces
Valiedin Korapierinykof, said that ties between the Chinese and
Russian armed forces have gone smoothly along with the Sino-
Russian strategic cooperative partnership.
</P>
<P>
Hegemony and power politics have made new developments in spite
of the fact that the global situation is changing toward
relaxation, Fu said, adding that the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia,
which has gone on for more than 60 days, has put into practice the
strategic new concept put forward by NATO during its 50th
anniversary conference.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attempt to establish a single-pole world that it
dominates will surely result in strong objections from all peace-
loving people in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Korapierinykof said that the strategic cooperative partnership
mapped out by top Chinese and Russian leaders has laid a solid
foundation for the development of friendship and cooperation
between the two countries and their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. tries every way to obstruct the multi-polarization
process because it sets the U.S. ambition to dominate the world
back, he said, but Russia will work with China in contributing to
bilateral ties and to safeguarding world peace and stability.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Oil Minister on Sixth Phase of Oil-for-Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has struck 24 contracts worth
of 2 billion U.S. dollars to export oil under the sixth phase of
the U.N. oil-for-food program, said Iraqi Oil Minister Amir
Mohammed Rashid on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rashid told a press conference that three Iraqi oil vessels
Monday arrived in the Turkish Jihan harbor and a fourth one will
arrive in the southern Iraqi harbor of Baker on Tuesday to
transport oil under the sixth phase of the program.
</P>
<P>
The sixth phase of the oil-for-food deal, which took effect on
May 26, allows Iraq to export 5.2 billion dollars worth of oil in
six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies
for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had demanded 600 million dollars to purchase spare parts
for the oil sector, said the minister, adding that Iraq wants to
increase its production capacity of the southern oil installations
to meet the needs of the sixth phase.
</P>
<P>
Under the fourth and fifth phases of the program, Iraq was
allowed to purchase 300 million dollars worth of oil spare parts
in each phase for its dilapidated oil facilities.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq has long accused the U.S. and British
representatives in the U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking the
approval of its contracts concluded for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said that only 14 million dollars worth of contracted
oil spare parts under the fourth phase have arrived in Iraq and
none under the fifth phase has reached the country.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was reluctant to agree to renew the oil-for-food deal,
worrying that the U.S. and Britain are trying to make the
deal an alternative to the lifting of sanctions imposed on the
country in 1990 following its invasion of Kuwait.

1.9 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. The proportion of HK
dollar deposits to total deposits increased from 57 percent at end-
March to 57.2 percent at end-April.
</P>
<P>
The rise in HK dollar deposits reflected the respective gains
of 5.1 percent and 1 percent in savings and time deposits during
the month.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, demand deposits dropped by 0.4 percent,
probably due to the high base of comparison in March in connection
with increased treasury deposits for tax rebates.
</P>
<P>
Foreign currency deposits rose by 1.3 percent in April, with
both U.S. dollar deposits and non-U.S. dollar foreign currency
deposits increasing at the same rate.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures also show that total loans and advances
shrank for the sixth consecutive month, by 1.1 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
In line with the slowdown of economic activity in the region,
loans for use outside Hong Kong declined by 0.8 percent, while
domestic loans fell by 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The HK dollar loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 96.7 percent
at the end of April, as against 99.2 percent at the end of March.

<HEADLINE> Security Measures in Place for S. African Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
has made sufficient security arrangements to ensure a free and
fair election, Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi, who chairs an inter-ministerial election security
committee, said about 100,000 police officers and soldiers would
be deployed on June 2, the election day, supported by 100 aircraft
and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that there would be no call for the use of
this personnel, except in exceptional circumstances," Mufamadi
said.
</P>
<P>
He said unregistered voters would not be allowed to enter
voting stations Wednesday in order to preempt disruptions at
voting points, as it had all along been made clear that one had to
be registered to take part in the election.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready and sufficiently organized to ensure that nobody
is going to interfere with the voting process," Mufamadi said,
adding that extra security staff would be deployed at trouble
spots.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey indicated that between three and four million
unregistered citizens intended to turn up at voting stations to
try to cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said the country was experiencing a normal, peaceful
political process in the past weeks despite some incidents of
violence. About 775 political gatherings, rallies and marches had
so far been successfully secured, he said.
</P>
<P>
Two people were shot and wounded and a third was stabbed with a
knife Sunday when supporters of the African National Congress
(ANC) and the United Democratic Movement (UDM) clashed at a UDM
rally at Khayelitsha outside Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The UDM claimed that Saturday ANC supporters shot dead a UDM
member and wounded others in Esikhawini township in northern
KwaZulu-Natal. But the ANC denied it.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said the incidents were under investigation.
</P>
<P>
He said his committee undertook numerous visits to provinces in
the past week, and met at least twice a week to coordinate
security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"Intelligence and operational information have been and are
being updated on a daily basis. On the whole we don't see serious
problems facing the voters on election day," Mufamadi said.

<HEADLINE> S. African New MPs to Be Sworn in Under New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The swearing-in of parliament
members (MPs) elected in Wednesday's general election would, for
the first time, be done in terms of South Africa's new
constitution, National Assembly Speaker Frene Ginwala said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Constitutional Court President Judge Arthur Chaskalson would
preside at the ceremony, to be held in the National Assembly
chamber on the morning of June 14, South African Press Association
quoted Ginwala as saying.
</P>
<P>
MPs would be inducted in batches of 10, and take the oath in
their language of choice, she told a media briefing at parliament.
</P>
<P>
They would then elect a new speaker, who would in turn preside
over the election of a deputy speaker.
</P>
<P>
Ginwala smiled when asked whether she would be available for
re-election as speaker, saying it was up to the African National
Congress' national executive committee as to who the party's
candidate would be.
</P>
<P>
She said President Nelson Mandela, who remains in office until
a new president is inaugurated in Pretoria on June 16, would be at
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The assembly would then adjourn for lunch, after which it would
re- convene and elect, again under Chaskalson's supervision, a new
president -- by all indications set to be ANC leader and current
Deputy President of the country, Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of all parties would make short speeches, and the new
president would also address the House.
</P>
<P>
MPs would return to Parliament on June 20 for training and
orientation programs.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the new National Council of Provinces (NCOP) would
be sworn in on June 24.
</P>
<P>
The nine provincial legislatures are to meet on June 15 to
elect premiers and permanent delegates to the NCOP, presided over
by judges assigned by the province's judge-presidents.
</P>
<P>
Ginwala said suggestions were that the new premiers be
inaugurated on June 18.
</P>
<P>
Parliament -- consisting of the National Assembly and the NCOP
-- would meet for the first time on June 25, when the new
president would deliver a state-of-the-nation address.
</P>
<P>
This would be debated by the National Assembly on June 28 and
29, with the president set to reply on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Parliament would then adjourn until sometime in August, Ginwala
said.
</P>
<P>
The length of this session would have to be determined by the
new Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ginwala said a gap had been discovered in the new constitution
-- no provision was made for when the term of Parliament's
presiding officers should end, whereas it stated cabinet ministers
remain in office until the new cabinet is constituted.
</P>
<P>
Parliament would then in effect be run by the secretary to
parliament, Sindiso Mfenyana.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, Mfenyana said it was anticipated that
about a third of the newly-elected MPs would be newcomers to
Parliament.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Chief Executive on Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Environment is not a cost for
doing business, but a real opportunity to improve business, Tung
Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the Private Sector Committee on the
Environment Annual Business and Environment Conference, Tung said
improving the environment is being put at the center of the
government's policies from 1999 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that it stays that way for every year
of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
"I will do that because I am convinced that there is tremendous
opportunity for Hong Kong in improving our environment," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that individual companies have found that
opportunity in reducing their costs by greater efficiency in the
use of power and materials, cutting down on waste and emissions
and increasing productivity.
</P>
<P>
For Hong Kong as a whole, he said the opportunities come
through improving the quality of the living environment for every
citizen.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the progress that Hong Kong has made in
improving the environment, Tung said much more remains to be done.
</P>
<P>
It needs to improve Hong Kong's waste management system,
develop its sewage system further and tackle problems with urban
air pollution, he said.
</P>
<P>
The primary responsibility for the government is to lead that
process of change.
</P>
<P>
"One of our most important tasks for the next decade is going
to be building up institutions and programs with our neighbors in
Guangdong for regional cooperation to tackle common problems of
pollution and environmental pressure," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said it also needs to increase public
understanding and build more effective partnerships as a community
to respond to these pressures successfully.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that street level air pollution is the most pressing
environmental issue that Hong Kong faces today.
</P>
<P>
For the present, the task is to achieve much greater
cooperation and coordination between transport operators, oil
companies, the motor vehicle trade and the government, so that
best available technologies and practices are introduced rapidly,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Gemstone Exports Exceed $8mln </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's change in policies
has greatly driven up exports of gemstones, the Deputy Minister of
Energy and Minerals, Manju Msambya, has said.
</P>
<P>
The country earned 8.127 million U.S. dollars from exports of
gemstones in 1998, compared with 200,000 U.S. dollars 11 years ago
when large quantities were smuggled out of the country, media
reports on Monday quoted Msambya as saying.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister made the remarks Sunday at the seventh
Tanzania Mineral Dealers Development Association (TAMIDA) show in
the northern town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the country started to issue licences to dealers
allowing them to engage in the gemstone business, thus ending the
state-monopoly era when all minerals were marketed through a
single enterprise, he said.
</P>
<P>
Exports of gemstones have climbed up steadily thanks to the
liberalization of the trade. In 1990, exports of gemstones reached
1.584 million U.S. dollars while in 1995 the figure further rose
to 6.46 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The figures demonstrate the role of the private mineral
dealers in supporting our policies and commitments," the deputy
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Msambya said Tanzania is endowed with vast mineral resources
including gemstones found nearly all over the country.
</P>
<P>
There is increasing evidence that the potential is much bigger
than the government has anticipated as new finds are being made
time and again.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is taking measures including devising
special incentives to develop gemstone, gold and other mineral
resources in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the show, to be closed Monday, is aimed at giving
dealers an opportunity to buy gemstones directly from the source
and not through smugglers in neighboring countries.

consultation service, the first of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the Hunan Provincial Institute of Health
Education showed that the province has more than 20 million
smokers, or nearly 30 percent of its population.
</P>
<P>
Although some 80 percent of the smokers say they'd like to quit
smoking, but fewer than three percent are able to succeed, so the
consultation line was set up to give scientific advice to those
who want to give up smoking.

Despite loss of life of its soldiers, Mugabe said Zimbabwe

"Yes it means suffering but sacrifices must be made," said the

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's second
democratic election is to be held Wednesday, June 2. Following is
a brief introduction to this event:
</P>
<P>
The election is generally believed to be a foregone conclusion,
with the ruling African National Congress (ANC) expected to retain
its power. At stake, however, is whether the ANC would win a
two-thirds majority as it has been craving for, and which party
would be the new official opposition.
</P>
<P>
Elections for the National Assembly and provincial legislatures
would be held on the same day. That is to say, a voter has to cast
two ballots, one for the national legislature, the other for the
provincial legislature in his/her province.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly will have 400 seats and a provincial
legislature will have between 30 and 80 seats depending on the
population of the province.
</P>
<P>
Of the 400 seats in the National Assembly, 200 will be filled
by candidates on the national lists of political parties and the
remaining 200 will be taken by candidates on
provincial-to-national lists in order to ensure provincial
representation.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, if a political party contests the election on both
national and provincial levels, it should have three separate
lists of candidates: the national list, the provincial-to-national
list and the provincial list(s). The provincial lists of
candidates are for provincial legislatures only.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen political parties are going to take part in the
national election, while 10 others will contest on the provincial
level.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is using an electoral system called proportional
representation. Under the system, the representation a party
receives in a legislature is in proportion to the percentage of
votes it receives in the election. For instance, if a party wins
70 percent of the vote, it will have 70 percent of seats in the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Another major electoral system is the constituency-based
"first-past-the- post" system. Under such a system, each
constituency has a seat in parliament and the candidate who
receives the most votes in the constituency gets the seat in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has a population of 40.6 million, with about 22.8
million of them as eligible voters. More than 18 million of the
voters have registered for the election.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a total of 15,000 polling stations manned by
250,000 electoral officials will be open from 7 a.m. (0500 GMT)
until 9 p.m. (1900 GMT) across the country. The voting process
will also be watched by political party agents and international
observers.
</P>
<P>
Some 90,000 security personnel including defense force soldiers
will be deployed across the country and certain "high-risk" areas
will be heavily guarded.
</P>
<P>
Provisional results of the poll will be available Thursday and
the final results will be announced by the Independent Electoral
Commission within a week of the election.
</P>
<P>
The new National Assembly will have its first session on June
14 and the new president will be elected by members of parliament
on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The new president will be sworn in on June 16 in Pretoria at a
ceremony attended by thousands of dignitaries, including quite a
number of heads of state.
</P>
<P>
Since the ANC is set to win the election, its president, Thabo
Mbeki, currently state deputy president, will be the successor to
the revered outgoing president Nelson Mandela.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Customs Has New Way to Promote Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Customs office
explained 10 new measures today which it hopes will help increase
exports in the region.
</P>
<P>
These include using a universal customs declaration this year
and keeping a record of enterprises' histories so that the more
law-abiding ones will have their papers processed faster.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials say the move will make things more convenient
for export-oriented enterprises and improve the management of
customs.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this year, Shanghai's exports were
worth 5 billion U.S. dollars, up 17.4 percent from the same period
of last year.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militia to withdraw from Jezzine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army
(SLA) Monday announced it would formally start withdrawal from the
town of Jezzine in south Lebanon on Tuesday and will complete it
within 10 to 15 days.
</P>
<P>
The plan was announced by the militia's commander Antoine Lahd
in a news conference held in Marjayoun inside the Israeli-occupied
border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Jezzine, the largest Christian town in south Lebanon, is
outside the border zone but has been under SLA control since 1985.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-member SLA was trained and paid by Israeli forces to
help them patrol the security zone which the Jewish state set up
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Due to rising casualties resulting from Lebanese guerrillas'
bombings, the militia last week decided to withdraw the 170-man
garrison from Jezzine into the Israeli occupied enclave.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, a Shiite Muslim group, is leading a
guerrilla war to oust Israeli occupation troops and SLA out of the
country. It gets financial and political support from both Syria
and Iran.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier statement, Lahd expressed hope that the Labanese
authorities take over Jezzine after the SLA departure.
</P>
<P>
There are fears among the Christian population that Hezbollah
guerrillas will enter the town and seek revenge on suspected
collaborators with Israel, a claim that has been denied by the
group's leader Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah at a mass rally on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses from Jezzine said SLA militiamen had knocked down
earth mounds and dynamited fortified positions after packing arms
and ammunition onto waiting trucks from Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Truck convoys were also seen streaming out of the town,
carrying artillery and mortar guns, equipment, ammunition and
household furniture to Marjayoun, the SLA's headquarters inside
the border enclave.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that among the militiamen in Jezzine, around
70 have decided to stay in the town to place their fate in the
hands of the authorities.
</P>
<P>
A parliament member from Jezzine has urged the Lebanese
government to pass an amnesty on SLA fighters, most of them he
said are forced to join the group for financial reasons.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Military Chief Meets Romanian Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of General Staff
of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in talks here today with
his Romanian counterpart Constin Degeratu, thanked Romania for its
sincere help in evacuating some Chinese citizens from Yugoslavia
during the Kosovo crisis and after the NATO attack on the Chinese
embassy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the traditional friendship of the two countries
has withstood the test of time during the new historical period
and that military relations have become closer, with exchanges of
visits by military leaders becoming more frequent and cooperation
at various levels and in various fields increasing.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to increase these friendly ties based on mutual
respect, equality, and mutual benefits, he said.
</P>
<P>
Degeratu expressed sympathy for the embassy attack and said
that the use of force will not help settle problems but only make
things more complicated. As China is playing an increasingly large
role in the world, he said, Romania hopes to develop the bilateral
friendship and increase bilateral consultations and cooperation in
international organizations like the UN.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Says Cox Report Is Like Hollywood Movie Script </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
suggested that the U.S.'s Cox Report should have been made into a
movie in Hollywood with a disclaimer at the beginning, saying "
this is pure fiction."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here this afternoon, Zhao Qizheng,
director of the Information Office of the State Council, commented
on the May 25 report, saying that China has never stolen secrets
from the U.S. nuclear weapons lab, as it claims. Zhao showed
Chinese and foreign journalists pictures and technological
instructions on W79, W87, W88, and the F-117A Nighthawk that were
from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"An ordinary Chinese or American without much knowledge about
the military might find all this data on warheads surprising,"
Zhao, once a senior engineer, told Xinhua, "but, in fact the
information is open to the public in the United States and anyone
who has access to the Internet can get it."
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that the Cox Report is a fabrication for people who
are not insiders about someone who just sneaked into some Taiwan-
based connection of the Central Intelligence Agency's, opened a
safe, and took the classified documents about W87 or W88.
</P>
<P>
"This is like something out of the James Bond series," he said.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, an engineer from the China Internet Information
Center showed the journalists how to get at these so-called
secrets on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Kurdish Rebel Leader Begins in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Ankara State Security
Court No. 2 on Monday started trial of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan
on Imrali Island in Marmara Sea near Turkey's western province of
Bursa.
</P>
<P>
The court rejected a request of Ocalan's lawyers to postpone
the case before the trial started.
</P>
<P>
Intervenors and spectators were permitted to enter the court
hall, and only correspondents of Turkey's State Radio and
Television Corporation and Anatolian News Agency got the privilege
to take pictures in the hall.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was brought to the court hall from the prison and was
taken into a bullet-proof glass case in the hall.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan pleaded for his life in the court, saying "I would like
to state my determination to work for peace and brotherhood within
the democratic republic" if he could avoid the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to point out that I will live for peace and
brotherhood and be in the service of the Republic of Turkey for
the materialization of this purpose," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I promise that I will work to stop this bloodshed and for
peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has beefed up security measures in the
court hall and the whole Imrali Island.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan faces the death penalty in the case filed in the Ankara
State Security Court that accused him of being responsible for the
14-year-long Kurdish struggle for independence which claimed over
37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested by special Turkish agents in Kenya in
mid-February when he left the Greek Embassy in Nairobi, where he
had taken refuge for 12 days after an undisclosed odyssey seeking
asylum in vain.

<HEADLINE> Kuerten Sails to Quarters in French Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Eighth seed Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil
booked his quarterfinal ticket at the French Open here on Monday
by defeating Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic in straight
sets.
</P>
<P>
After losing the opening three games, Kuerten who the title in
1997, recovered to win the competition 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 in just one
hour 38 minutes against the 40th-ranked Ulihrach whom Kuerten also
beat on his way to the title in Monte Carlo last month.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten took the first set in 32 minutes and nine minutes more
for the second set before surging ahead 4-1 in the third set after
Ulihrach, who has equalled his best Grand Slam showing by reaching
the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian is hoping to earn the top spot in the world
rankings as well as recapture the title he won two years ago, and
said he thought he was currently playing some of the best tennis
of his life.
</P>
<P>
"I've learned a lot on the Tour, particularly how to relax on
the big points," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Kuerten has been in superb form on European
clay this season, having captured titles at Monte Carlo and Rome,
and has had a relatively easy run to the last 16 without playing
anyone ranked in the top 30.
</P>
<P>
He will now meet either Arnaud Di Pasquale of France or Andrei
Medvedev of Ukraine in Wednesday's quarter-finals.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Tens of thousands of motorcyclists from across the country
turned out on the Mall in Washington to take part in the 12th
annual Rolling Thunder rally. They demand that the nation
remember the 58,000 Americans killed in the Vietnam War and the 2,
200 listed as missing in action.
</P>
<P>
-- A district firefighter died and three others were seriously
burned, one over 90 percent of his body, when the living room area
of a Northeast town house in Washington area exploded around them
during an early-morning fire on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO warplanes twice bombed a major bridge in southern
Serbia, killing at least nine people and wounding at least 28.
Reports from the scene said civilians had gathered at the bridge
between the attacks to help the wounded. NATO officials said that
pilots saw no civilians and that they could not confirm any
casualties.
</P>
<P>
-- Just as the school shooting in Colorado last month spurred
Congress to the verge of approving measures like background checks
for gun buyers and safety devices for firearms, many state
legislatures have been passing gun-control laws, in some cases
taking up measures that had long been considered unlikely to pass.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Says Smoking Controls Still Difficult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing talked
today about the government's role in controlling tobacco use and
called for stronger measures to curb smoking.
</P>
<P>
Smoking control is a tough task because smoking among young
people and women is on the rise, Li said in a written speech for a
national seminar for World No-Tobacco Day.
</P>
<P>
Even though there has been some success in this over the past
20 years, he said, governments at all levels should make smoking
control their responsibility.
</P>
<P>
China's 320 million smokers make it the world's largest
cigarette consumer and it probably has the largest number of
victims.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Health show that the number of
smokers in China increased 3.74 percentage points in the 1984-1996
period and the mortality rate of lung cancer, which is believed to
be a result of smoking, rose 4.5 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health Zhang Wenkang acknowledges that China faces
a problem with smoking among teenagers and women, adding that
there is a particular challenge from tobacco companies in certain
developed countries, who have been condemned in their own
countries, but attempt to promote their products in developing
countries like China by luring young people.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry is considering more legislation and
education to stop smoking among young people. Schools need to be a
smoke-free environment for some 200 million students, he says, and
government and medical personnel and teachers should be models in
saying 'No' to tobacco.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry and the Chinese Association on Smoking and Health,
the country's leading anti-smoking organization, have encouraged
85 cities to put a ban on smoking in public places. Advertising of
tobacco products is being phased out in major cities.
</P>
<P>
World No-Tobacco Day is designed to increase awareness of the
impact of smoking on people's health, according to Dr. Edward
Hoekstra, who is in charge of the World Health Organization's
China office.
</P>
<P>
This year, it deals not only with the need for preventive
measures and emphasizes the importance of programs to stop smoking,
he says, adding that its theme "Leave the pack behind" speaks for
itself.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Speaker Calls for Enacting Laws Banning Smoking in Public Places </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Parliament Speaker
Humayun Rasheed Chowdhury Monday underscored the need for
enactment of laws banning smoking in public places along with
resisting pro-smoking campaigns in the mass media.
</P>
<P>
"Smoking is a potential public health threat and a large number
of smokers pollute the environment every day," he said while
speaking at a discussion here, which was organized by MANOSH, an
anti-drug association, on the occasion of "World No Tobacco Day".
</P>
<P>
The speaker, who gave up smoking about 30 years ago, called
upon the young generation not to be habituated with smoking.
</P>
<P>
"Smoking is neither courageous nor any thing fashionable, it is
absolutely a bad habit," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He called upon all concerned including mass media, opinion
leaders and cinema artists to come forward with anti-smoking
campaigns to reduce the number of smokers.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80,000 people die of tobacco-related diseases every year
in Bangladesh, and at the present, there are about 18 million
smokers in Bangladesh spending 10 million taka (about 206,00 U.S.
dollars) a day buying cigarettes, estimated ADHUNIK, a national
anti-tobacco organization of Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Urges Further SOE Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang visited the municipal reemployment center in Wuhan and
urged laid off workers to alter their concepts of employment and
never give up on establishing new careers.
</P>
<P>
He praised three people who found new jobs and set excellent
examples for other laid off workers.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also visited the Wuhan Research Institute of Post and
Telecommunications, a national base for optical fiber
communications technology which has commercialized more than 90
percent of its technological findings. He urged the institute to
continue its efforts to combine research and development with
production and marketing.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the fact that reform has reinvigorated many SOEs,
but noted that other SOEs continue to face operational and
production difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"We must maintain our determined to resolve related problems,"
said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader said SOEs must continue to introduce
technological advances and enhance management in order to improve
their competitiveness, innovation capacity and ability to resist
risks.
</P>
<P>
"Persistency will enable us to open a new era in the
development of state-owned enterprises," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also inspected the Longwangmiao Section of the water
conservancy system along the Yangtze River, an are he visited
during the height of last summer's record flooding.
</P>
<P>
"Last year's battle against flooding fully demonstrated the
great power of Chinese people. Their power is an important part of
national power," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He also visited a unit of the People's Liberation Army (PLA)
which participated in last year's battle against flooding in Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang met with PLA officers above the division level stationed
in Hubei Province and said that people will never forget their
contributions to the successful battle against flooding. He
pointed out that to continue to increase the nation's economic
power provides the foundation for resolving all types of social
issues, including the modernization of defense and the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
China must simultaneously increase its economic power and
continuously increase defense capability, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president repeatedly emphasized the importance of
correctly handling the relationships between reform, development
and stability.

KUALA LUMPUR, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Security in the Asia Pacific
region should encompass all aspects of the fundamental needs, core
values and vital interests of the society and the state, and not
confined to security in military terms, said Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, there was a need to shift the narrow
preoccupation with military security to a wider concern for
comprehensive security.
</P>
<P>
"When we begin to see our security in such comprehensive terms,
the logic of cooperating for mutual security in an interdependent
world will become even more persuasive and compelling," he said in
his keynote address at the 13th Asia-Pacific Roundtable here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The three-day roundtable themed "Confidence Building and
Conflict Reduction" was attended by some 100 participants and
observers from 19 countries. It is jointly organized by the
Malaysian Institute of Strategic and International Studies (Isis)
and the ASEAN-Isis.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Malaysia believed that the peaceful pursuit of
security and the pacific settlement of disputes in the region
would be greatly enhanced if states regard security as a mutual,
common and an indivisible matter.
</P>
<P>
He also said that differences and conflicts of interests do not
have to degenerate into violent confrontations and be resolved, if
at all, by force.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also noted that without mutual cooperation, the
integrating forces of technology, information, trade, investment,
finance and tourism among the states would not be possible.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the economic turmoil that hit many nations in the
region, including Malaysia, Abdullah said that although the
measures taken to overcome the crisis seemed to be working well,
Malaysia was fully committed to completing the agenda it had set
for itself in its national economic recovery plan.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Good Summer Grain Harvest Despite Drought (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
North China's Hebei Province has established a good foundation
for increased wheat output by introducing new varieties of high
quality wheat. Local farmers are busy harvesting wheat on some 2.7
million hectares.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture recently
noted a slight decrease in the area sown to summer grain has
decreased slightly on last year to an estimated 112 million
hectares, However, he said, the output of summer grain, mainly
wheat, is expected to rise slightly on last year.
</P>
<P>
Wu Hongyao, an agricultural expert, attributed this year's
increased output of summer grain to the alleviation of drought
conditions during the winter, as well as intensified management
over wheat fields and expanded efforts to fight drought,
preventing and alleviating plant diseases and insect pests, the
application of practical agro-techniques for larger areas of
farmland and successful adjustments to growing summer grain.
</P>
<P>
The total area sown to summer grain has decreased, but the
coverage of high quality wheat has increased significantly and is
considered to be an important factor leading to the increased
wheat output. Related efforts have further demonstrated the
initial success of using science and technology to promote
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
China has earmarked five million yuan this year to finance
activities related to using science and technology to advance
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China has launched a large-scale campaign to
build farmland irrigation facilities in recent years along with
the introduction various other measures, including policies to
increase the income of farmers, have played important role in
raising the wheat output.
</P>
<P>
China harvested 113.1 billion kg of summer grain in 1998, down
11 percent on 1997. The former figure yet accounted for some 25
percent of the country's total 1998 grain output of 490 million
tons.

<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Information from China's major
summer grain production bases show that the country has overcome
the combination of record summer flooding in 1998 and one of the
worst droughts in history and will achieve a good summer grain
harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
China not only suffered from scarce rainfall between last
autumn and this spring, but also withstood the warmest winter in
50 years. A dozen provinces and autonomous regions in the Yellow
and Huaihe river valleys, and in both north and west China were
hit by a drought spell which adversely affected close to a third
of winter crops.
</P>
<P>
Record summer flooding in 1998 continues to affect cultivation
in some areas. The floods not only killed 3,004 people, but also
inundated 21 million ha of farmland, destroyed nearly five million
homes and caused economic losses of some 166.6 billion yuan (about
20.8 billion U.S. dollars) in their wake.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, one of the country's leading agricultural provinces,
suffered through the worst drought in 80 years. "Shandong has
stabilized cultivated areas and anticipates a good wheat harvest
which is expected to remain at last year's level of some 20
billion kilograms," according to Deputy Governor Chen Yanming who
is in charge of agricultural and rural work.
</P>
<P>
East China's Anhui Province expects to harvest eight billion kg
of summer grain, up 30 percent on last year's level.
</P>
<P>
An agricultural official from Henan, now China's most populous
province, said the province witnessed the worst drought since
meteorological records have been kept, but nonetheless planted 4.9
million hectares of wheat and allocated over 500 million yuan for
related protection efforts.
</P>
<P>
The official predicted that this year's total wheat output will
exceed last year's level.
</P>
<P>
Li Maozheng, a farmer from Xiejiying Township in Henan, said: "
Our village has about 206 ha of farmland and 108 wells. The
drought had little effect on farmland and I expect a good wheat
harvest."

<HEADLINE> ITU to Set Mobile Telephone Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Major differences between operators
and manufacturers may prevent the establishment of a unified
worldwide cellular telephone system in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Bargaining covering the harmonization of the major
technological families in the third or latest generation of mobile
telecommunications entered one of the most challenging stages at
today's opening session of the International Telecommunications
Union (ITU) in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The 17th meeting of the ITU's Task Force 8/1 will feature
discussions and decisions related to detailed standards for the
code-division multiple-access (CDMA) mobile telephone system.
</P>
<P>
However, economic interests rather than technological
terminology will be the top concern of the 200-plus participants
from 25 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
CDMA technologies used in the United States is different
significantly from those used in Japan and Europe.
Telecommunications manufacturers and operators from related sides
are trying to persuade ITU to incorporate more of their
technologies in the global standard.
</P>
<P>
A Motorola official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said it will save manufacturers substantial costs related to
patent fees.
</P>
<P>
Eiji Kito from Japan-based Nippon Electric Corp. (NEC) said
that the harmonization of CDMA technological standards will
greatly enhance the position of his company's products in
international market.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunication operators, on the other hand, insist the
existing cellular telephone network should be valid under the new
global standards due to their heavy investments in related
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Satellite mobile telecommunications companies such as ICO,
Globalstar and Iridium are also closely following the evolution of
CDMA technology.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, ITU TG8/1 Chairman Michael
Callendar said that the ITU may decide the unification of CDMA
technological standards in two phases.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources noted that the first phase will include the
establishment of regional technological blocs, such as the Europe-
based 3GPP and the U.S.-based 3GPP2.
</P>
<P>
The second phase will center on the harmonization of the
technological standards in several regions.
</P>
<P>
Japan is pressing hard for unified global standards on CDMA
technology and will begin the full-scale commercial application of
CDMA in 2001.
</P>
<P>
China is also supporting the harmonization of CDMA technology
and has submitted a candidate CDMA standard to the ITU. Sources
say that China and Europe are discussing the possibility of
combing the technological standards of both sides in the near
future. Chinese CDMA equipment will gain wider access to the
international market if the proposal meets with success.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing meeting of the ITU will conclude on June 11.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Records Trade Surplus of 1.63b U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia recorded a trade
surplus of 6.2 billion ringgit (about 1.63 billion U.S. Dollars)
in April this year compared with 3.4 billion ringgit (about 0.9
billion dollars) in the same month last year, the Statistics
Department announced here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was the 18th consecutive month since November 1997 that
Malaysia chalked up a surplus, thanks to higher exports versus
imports, the department said in its preliminary release of the
Malaysian External Trade Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Exports grew by 16.4 percent or 3.7 billion ringgit (0.97
billion dollars) to 25.975 billion ringgit (6.8 billion dollars)
while imports increased by only 4.4 percent or 900 million ringgit
(236.8 million dollars) to 19.729 billion ringgit (5.19 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of 1999, the trade surplus was higher
at 22 billion ringgit (5.8 billion dollars) from a surplus of 12.5
billion ringgit (3.28 billion dollars) in the same period a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
The department said that full details of the trade figures
would be published sometime in the first week of June 1999.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Meets Senior Argentine Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian said here today that the Chinese people cannot be bullied
and any attempt to threaten or blackmail the nation is doomed to
failure.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who also serves concurrently as vice-chairman of the
Central Military Commission and state councilor, made the remarks
during a meeting Carlos Maria Zabala, the Joint Chief of Staff of
Argentina's Armed Forces and the Chief of Staff of the Navy of
Argentina.
</P>

interest of the people in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the Argentine government for cooperating with China
in the realm of international affairs and expressed gratitude for
its support for China's reunification effort and adherence to the
"one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Chi pointed to the fact that China was invaded and robbed
throughout modern history and noted that the Chinese people highly
value independence and freedom acquired through the devotion and
sacrifice of previous generations.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China has worked to build the new
international political and economic order since the end of the
Cold War, and noted the recent resurgence of hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
Chi addressed the U.S.-led NATO strikes against Yugoslavia, a
sovereign state, and the May 8th bombing of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade. He stressed that "the Chinese people will not accept"

<HEADLINE> Missing Israeli Navy Submarine Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli navy submarine, which
disappeared with its 69-member crew over 30 years ago, has been
located by two Cypriot vessels working for the Israeli navy, the
Cyprus News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The submarine Dakar was found 3,000 meters deep under the water
in an area between Greece's Crete island, Cyprus and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"We went out there, and we found it," said captain Duncan
Mckenzy of the ship "Flying Enterprise."
</P>
<P>
The search covered a water area 2,500-3,000 meters deep and it
was marked to facilitate the task, the captain said.
</P>
<P>
"The submarine itself showed up very well on the sonar and the
technicians were delighted about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The recent search for the Dakar started 25 days ago and now it
is up to the Israeli navy to decide whether to evacuate it or not.
</P>
<P>
Dakar disappeared in January 1968 on a journey from England to
the Israeli northern port city of Haifa, where the then Israeli
Prime Minister Golda Meyer was preparing to welcome the vessel to
the country.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the search for Dakar has continued but yielded no
results until last Friday.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Enjoys Rebounding Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The declining influx of overseas
investment in north China's Tianjin Municipality bottomed out
during the first four months of the year and indicated the growing
investment confidence of overseas companies in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Municipal Foreign Trade and Economic
Commission showed that 180 overseas-funded enterprises were
approved during the period, with some 42 related ventures
reporting new investments. Total contracted investments hit 1.04
billion U.S. dollars, with actual overseas investment reaching 565
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Multinational companies continued to be enthusiastic investors,
with projects by five companies alone involving a combined
contracted investment of 114 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Investments from European and American countries continued to
rise. Investment by American businesses rose by 12.2 percent in
the first four months on the annual basis and that by German,
French, British and Japanese businesses went up by 100 to 200
percent in the period. Investments from Southeast Asia are also
rebounding as countries in the region are gradually overcoming the
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Existing overseas-funded enterprises have pledged to increase
investments, with investments for the first four months of the
year hitting 4.06 million U.S. dollars, up 90 percent on the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, real estate development and infrastructure
projects have emerged as the focal points for overseas investment,
along with continuing investment in the new and high technology
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, one of the Chinese cities with the largest volume of
overseas investment, has approved a total of 12,593 overseas-
funded projects involving contracted investments of 24.16 billion
U.S. dollars. The city has thus far used overseas direct
investments totaling 11.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Overseas-funded enterprises have emerged as a pillar of
Tianjin's economy, and the municipal government will continue to
work hard to improve the investment climate to ensure the
profitability of more overseas-funded enterprises," according to
Vice Mayor Li Shenglin.

<HEADLINE> India Agrees to Visit by Pakistan Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- India has accepted Pakistan's
offer to send its foreign minister Sartaj Aziz to New Delhi to
defuse what caretaker Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
described as a war-like situation in the disputed Jammu and
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for the External Affairs Ministry said
Monday that the date for Aziz's visit had not been decided and
would be worked out through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister (Vajpayee) has considered and accepted the
offer of Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to send Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz to India," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But he said the Indian armed forces would continue their
operation until they achieve their objective of putting an end to
what India described as armed intrusion in the entire Kargil
sector and restoring the status quo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vajpayee accused Pakistan Monday of trying to alter
the line of control in Jammu and Kashmir and asked Islamabad to
call back the infiltrators even as he accepted Pakistan's offer.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering of traders at his residence here,
Vajpayee said, "This is a kind of aggression," adding that "it is
an attempt to alter the frontiers and a move to grab part of our
land."
</P>
<P>
Defense Ministry sources said Monday that the Indian Air Force
continued its air strikes in Kargil sector of Kashmir for the
sixth day Monday.
</P>
<P>
India claimed to have killed some 400 intruders backed by
Pakistan in the past few days while Indian casualties stood at 33
killed, 130 wounded and 12 missing.

CAIRO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Bank of Israel will keep the interest rate
unchanged at 12 percent in June, a spokesman for the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
This decision was taken in order to continue policies to
achieve an annual inflation rate of 4 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that budget steps must be taken as soon
as possible to keep the budget deficit within 2 percent of the
Gross Domestic Product in 1999 as required by Israeli laws.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's gasoline imports rose sharply in the
first four months of 1999 compared to the same period last year,
according to a report released by the National Infrastructure
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The biggest increase was recorded in the civilian sector, which
had a 340 percent increase, or 109,530 tons.
</P>
<P>
Energy experts said the sharp increase was directly attributed
to the purchase of the energy company Granit Hacarmel by the
international trading company Glencore last fall.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's imports of almost all durable consuming
products, including cars, refrigerators, videos, furniture,
washing machines and dishwashers, declined in April, compared with
last month this year or the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the declines were attributed to the slow pace of new
housing sales in April.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Industrial investments in the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states increased by 180 per cent over the past 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Arab daily "Al Hayat" quoted the Secretary General of
the Gulf Industrial Investment Organisation Abdul Rahman Al
Jaafari as sayig that investments have increased from 28 billion
U.S. dollars in 1988 to over 80 billion dollars in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Employees to Hold Shares, Key Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Employees of the Philippine Airlines
(PAL) are now part-owners of the flag carrier as PAL chairman
Lucio Tan has raised the needed 200 million U.S. dollars for its
rehabilitation, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the PAL employees were given 60,000 shares in the
airline, along with a seat in the board of directors and one seat
in the PAL advisors committee.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that this will rehabilitate PAL," he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said Tan and his investor-partners assured him Sunday
that they have raised the 200 million U.S. dollars needed to keep
the PAL in business.
</P>
<P>
He said that once Tan and his group complete the infusion of
the required capital into the airline, there would be no need to
scout for other foreign investors to save the PAL.
</P>
<P>
However, other investors can come in once the 200 million U.S.
dollars turns out to be insufficient to rehabilitate the airline,
he added.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, stockholders of the PAL ratified a resolution of the
airline's board of directors that formally approved the airline's
amended rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
The stockholders also ratified a board resolution which reduced
the par value of existing shares from five pesos (0.13 U.S. cent)
to one peso (0.02 U.S. cent) per share and increased the number of
shares from 4 billion to 20 billion.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Seeks Peaceful Way to Solve Border Issues: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia will seek peaceful way
to solve the border and immigration issues with Vietnam, Cambodian
National Assembly President Prince Norodom Ranariddh said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh returned home Monday after ending a week-long
official visit to Vietnam at the invitation of Vietnamese National
Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh told the reporters at the Pochentong airport that all
the leaders of Vietnam expressed their eagerness to resolve the
border and immigration issues between the two countries before the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
The aim, he said, was to allow the two countries "to
concentrate our energy on building new friendship and cooperative
relations in various fields, especially in the fields of economy
and trade."
</P>
<P>
He said, "as to the issue of the Vietnamese residents in
Cambodia, the king and I also insisted that it is resolved in a
peaceful way and in accordance with the law."
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Ranariddh met with his Vietnamese counterpart
National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh, President Tran Duc
Luong, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai and Communist Party General
Secretary Le Kha Phieu.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed a memorandum on cooperation between the
parliaments of the two countries. They also agreed to solve the
long-standing border disputes by the year 2000 and boost trade
ties. Meanwhile, Hanoi also expressed the hope that Cambodia will
ease tense living conditions for Vietnamese residents in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
It was announced here that Vietnamese Communist Party General
Secretary Le Kha Phieu will pay a state visit to Cambodia next
week at the invitation of King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen
Monineath.
</P>
<P>
Phieu is also expected to discuss the sensitive border and
immigration issues.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Prince Ranariddh leads the National
Assembly delegation to pay an official visit abroad since he
became President of National Assembly last November. The prince
last visited Vietnam in 1995 when he was co-prime minister of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The visit also comes less than one month after Cambodia
formally became the member of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations at a special ceremony held in Hanoi on April 30.

<P>
PHNOM PEHN, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Cigarette advertisements were
banned here Monday by the Cambodian government to observe the
World No Smoking Day.
</P>
<P>
No tobacco commercial advertisements would be seen or heard
today, the Ministry of Information said, adding it was just a
trial which will eventually lead to a nationwide ban on tobacco
advertising in print and broadcast media.
</P>
<P>
The World No Smoking Day, which falls on May 31 and was
sponsored by the World Health Organization, aimed to draw
attention to the serious impact of tobacco on health.
</P>
<P>
A survey found that cigarette advertisements have increased 400
percent from 1993 to 1997 in Cambodia, the Cambodia Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 86 percent of male population in the
rural areas smoke regularly and about 62 percent in urban areas.
Female smokers account for only five percent of the women
population in the country.
</P>
<P>
An apparent increase in the country's smoking population and
its potential to increase instances of lung cancer and heart
attack have already caused the concern of the Health Ministry.

<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences (
CAS), China's top scientific research body, plans to sponsor an
international symposium between October 12-16 to celebrate the 70
th anniversary of the discovery of Peking Man fossils.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the paleoanthropological symposium will discuss
topics related to the origin of human beings and the living
conditions of ancient humans, according to Dr. Dong Junshe of the
Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology under
the CAS.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists discovered the remnants of remote ape-like
humans in Yuanmou, Yunnan Province, as well as Wushan in Sichuan
Province and Fanchang in Anhui Province in recent years, according
to Dong.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts place great importance to the date 70 years ago
when Pei Wenzhong, a leading Chinese archeologist at the time,
discovered the first broken skull of Peking Man who lived some 500,
000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Jia Lanpo, a senior CAS academician, stunned the world in 1936
with the discovery of three fossilized skulls of Peking Man and
other cultural treasures near Zhoukoudian in the southwestern
suburbs of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) listed the Zhoukoudian site as a World
Heritage in 1987.
</P>
<P>
However, the six invaluable intact skullcaps disappeared
without a trace during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen prominent Chinese scientist published a global appeal
last year seeking assistance in locating parts of the skulls of
Peking Man.

<HEADLINE> Emblem of 2002 FIFA World Cup Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A launching ceremony for the emblem
of the 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan was held here Monday
afternoon with participation of more than 300 delegates.
</P>
<P>
The official emblem of the 2002 FIFA World Cup consists of two
key elements: the symbol and the logotype.
</P>
<P>
The symbol is the most important visual element, whereas the
logotype is the lettering used to convey the image of the World
Cup in a consistent manner.
</P>
<P>
Following is an introduction of the emblem.
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the emblem, there is a stylized representation
of the FIFA World Cup Trophy which symbolizes the unique image of
the FIFA World Cup as the element of the emblem. The trophy is one
of the two distinguishing figures supporting the globe.
</P>
<P>
The overall appearance of the emblem is one of a circle. It was
chosen for its highly symbolic nature: the circle has been part of
the Asian cultures for many centuries and also stands for the
universe, the sun, the world and even life. Thus the theme of a
circle and a sphere is used to consitute both the outer shape and
the World Cup Trophy at the center.
</P>
<P>
The symbol is brightly coloured to embody the vibrant colours
of the many different countries participating in the tournament.
Moreover, the yellow colour in the middle of emblem symblizes "
center" in Aisa and the white colour surrounding the trophy
symbolizes "purity".
</P>
<P>
The circle is left open at the left top of the emblem to
indicate openness of the World Cup Trophy to anyone in the world.
In other words, each and every participant has a chance of winning
the trophy.
</P>
<P>
The logotype consists of three parts: the year 2002, the FIFA
World Cup logo and the names of the host nations Korea and Japan.
Each has been designed to reflect the characteristics of the World
Cup from various perspectives.
</P>
<P>
The two zeros of the year 2002 are represented by a horizontal
"S", symbolizing "infinity" and embodying the spirit of eternal
unity and the harmonious link between Korea and Japan as well as
among the World Cup participants.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA WORLD CUP lettering is reserved for FIFA to use in
every tournament. And the 2002 FIFA WORLD CUP appears in golden
colour to represent dignity.
</P>
<P>
The lettering of the co-hosts' names combines a traditional
Asian style with a touch of modern sense. The names are in the
colour of their national flags.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Children Exhibit Greater Willingness to Share </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey revealed that
contemporary Chinese children are exhibiting less selfishness and
instead are displaying a greater willingness to share.
</P>
<P>
The obvious trend was revealed during a recent survey of
conducted in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing. The
survey covered 5,000 children between the ages of three and seven.
</P>
<P>
Most children born after the 1980s belong to one-child families
and have received kindergarten education enhancing their awareness
of the need to share.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed more than 55 percent of respondents voiced a
willingness to share, or loan toys and books to other children.
Only 3.1 percent of the respondents voiced dissatisfaction with
sharing joy and resisted sharing as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The tendency to share was even greater with older children.
Some 70 percent of respondents above the age of six years voiced
their willingness to share.
</P>
<P>
Education provided by society and families is extremely
important for guiding the behavior of children, a conclusion
clearly indicated by the fact that 26.5 percent of the respondents
noted their willingness to share or loan personal items.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that the Chinese children are basically
unable to take proper care of themselves. This in turn results in
weak character, heavy dependence and lack of awareness of the need
for personal improvement.
</P>
<P>
Some 35-40 percent of respondents lacked the desire to dress
themselves, with more than 90 percent noting they would seek help
when facing difficulties.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister of Uzbekistan
Abdulaziz Kamilov arrived here Monday on a two-day visit for talks
on the long-running Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
Kamilov will hold official talks with his Pakistani counterpart
Sartaj Aziz on bilateral issues, focusing on the Afghan turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Kamilov is also expected to have a meeting with Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, sources from the Foreign Office said.
</P>
<P>
The Uzbek foreign minister Tuesday will travel to Kandahar, the
headquarters of the Afghan Taliban militia, to hold talks with
Taliban supreme leader Mulla M. Omar and other senior Taliban
leaders on the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming deputy foreign minister-level conference of the
"Six Plus Two" group (Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors plus
Russia and the United States) in Tashkent, the Uzbek capital, will
prominently figure in Omar-Kamilov talks.
</P>
<P>
The warring Afghan factions would also attend the "Six Plys
Two" conference under a decision taken in the group's recent
meeting in New York. The group comprises Pakistan, Iran,
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, China plus Russia and the
Untied States.
</P>
<P>
Kamilov will be the second foreign minister from a Central
Asian republic to visit the Taliban's stronghold in three months.
Turkmenistan's Foreign Minister Sheikh Boris Muradov visited
Kandahar twice before and after the peace talks between the
Taliban and the opposition Northern Alliance in Ashgabat in March
this year.
</P>
<P>
Being members of the "Six Plus Two" group, Pakistan and
Uzbekistan have been deeply involved in the peaceful settlement of
the Afghan problem. There had been frequent ministerial-level
visits in the recent past.

<HEADLINE> PAL Stockholders Approve Rehabilitation Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Stockholders of Philippine Airlines
(PAL) ratified here Monday a resolution of the airline's board of
directors that formally approved the national flag carrier's
amended rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting presided over by PAL Chairman Lucio Tan,
the stockholders ratified the board's decision on May 14 to accept
the plan as submitted, as well as any adjustments that may arise
from the company's acceptance of the terms and conditions of the
investment from prospective investors.
</P>
<P>
The stockholders also ratified a board resolution which reduced
the par value of existing shares from five pesos (0.13 U.S. cent)
to one peso (0.02 U.S. cent) per share and increased the number of
shares from 4 billion to 20 billion.
</P>
<P>
Such revaluation is deemed imperative in order to attract
investors to infuse the required 200 million U.S. dollars in new
equity, as called for in the rehabilitation plan, PAL said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Since its submission to the Stock Exchange Commission (SEC) on
March 15, the amended rehabilitation plan, which incorporated key
changes to the original plan, has been conditionally accepted by
the majority of PAL's creditors.
</P>
<P>
Based on the majority support, the SEC approved the plan on May
17 subject to the equity infusion of 200 million dollars not later
than June 4.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, President Joseph Estrada said that his
government will save PAL, whose debts has amounted to 2.2 billion
dollars, and keep it flying at all costs.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In a signed article published in Liberation, American writer
Norman Mailer said that NATO's war against Yugoslavia has turned
into obscenity with its strategy of restricting military action to
bombing so that the blood of NATO troops will not be shed. Mailer
also warned that NATO's manipulation of national and international
public opinion and emotion could well lead to catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
-- The war of clans in the Kremlin has come to the surface as
the newly appointed prime minister Sergei Stepashin is having
great difficulty forming his cabinet. The World Bank is also
hesitating to send its new mission to Moscow because of a lack of
clarity around the economic posts of the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO killed at least 11 civilians last weekend when it
bombed a bridge with missiles in Varvarin, 160 kilometers south of
Belgrade. Meanwhile, the Western military alliance said it was
waiting for ``concrete'' action by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic who, while accepting the principles of the Group of
Eight on ending the Kosovo conflict, seems to exclude NATO from a
future security force.
</P>
<P>
-- Algeria's new president Abdelaziz Bouteflika has extended
his hand toward the country's Islamists, calling on them to
reintegrate into the society. In his first address to the nation
last Saturday, Bouteflika also said that the government will
punish Islamic extremists in accordance with the law for their
barbaric crimes.

<P>
It was reported that 36 fighter jets will be deployed at the

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cities Face Uphill Battle Against Air Pollution (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Members of the National People's
Congress, China's highest legislative body, said today that major
cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Xi'an continue to face
grim air pollution in spite of the recent improvement in the
general situation.
</P>
<P>
The legislators made the comment during a meeting culminating
fact-finding tours to five cities, including Lanzhou in the
northwest and Shenyang in northeast. They also discussed
implementation of the law on preventing air pollution.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing continues to rank as the most contaminated capital
city in the world and one of the worst in China in terms of air
quality," said Qu Geping, chairman of the NPC Environment and
Resources Committee who participated in the tour of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The latest air pollution index for May 7-13 showed that
Beijing's index was 40 percent higher than Shanghai, 33 percent
greater than Tianjin and 37 percent above Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
The most prevalent pollutants in Beijing resulted from burning
of coal, auto emissions, dust storms and heavy industries, said Qu,
noting that coal consumption accounted for 70 percent of energy
used in the capital, with motor vehicles contributing some 63
percent of carbon monoxide and 50 percent of nitrogen oxide.
</P>
<P>
Central authorities have paid great attention to the situation
in recent months, with Beijing responding by adopting 46 emergency
measures to tackle the problem, including banning the use of coal
in certain areas, removing substandard cabs from the road and
planting more trees.

The ratios for sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide in the air
are decreasing when compared to last year and the rising level of
nitrogen oxide has been curbed. However, the volume of floating
particles continues to climb.
</P>

Shanghai, the nation's largest economic and financial city,

introducing environment-friendly cars and planting more trees.
Nonetheless, acid rain has emerged as an increasing problem in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang, one of China's largest bases for heavy industry, has
also witnessed some improvement in air quality in spite of
increased coal consumption and ongoing economic development.
</P>
<P>
Zou Jiahua, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee,
stressed that "Chinese cities will continue to face an uphill
battle against air pollution and much more needs to be done to
meet the demands of the general public."
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers tables a number of proposals during the meeting,
including the designation of high population density areas in

<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank (CCB)
announced today that it will provide 3.6 billion yuan in this
year's first round of buyer's credits to support the
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
A CCB spokesman said that buyer's credits for purchasing
telecommunications equipment have been listed as the key for the
bank's credit business during the year.
</P>
<P>
He said the CCB will not only continue to support domestic
telecommunications equipment manufacturers, but will also expand
its buyer's credit service to cover some sino-overseas joint
ventures, including Shanghai Bell Alcatel, Beijing Nokia and
Suzhou Nokia.
</P>
<P>
Buyer's credits will enable telecommunications service
providers to purchase domestically manufactured telecommunications
equipment. The CCB initiated the business service in May 1998 and
granted buyer's credits totaling 4.8 billion yuan by the end of
that same year.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the CCB has recently adopted buyer's credit
operating procedures to further standardize the service and ensure
the quality of related loans.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Concocted "Cox Report" A Farce to Instigate Anti-China Feelings, Undermine Sino-U.S. Relations: Zhao Qizheng (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cox Report not only slanders China "stealing" U.S. nuclear
weapon and missile technology, but also charges that China has
applied the advanced U.S. technologies in the areas of high-
performance computer, civil aviation and precision machinery for
military purposes, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
And, based on this, it suggests the United States intensify
control over the export of dual-purpose commodities and technology
to China. It even unreasonably demands China should establish a so-
called open and transparent system which enables American
nationals designated by the United States to examine on the spot
the end-users without advance notice, he said.
</P>
<P>
This is a hegemonic act that disregards China's sovereignty and
violates the basic norms governing international relations. China
by no means agrees with this, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
A short time ago, the U.S.-led NATO used missiles to attack the
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, which has been strongly condemned
by the Chinese Government and people and the international
community, he said.
</P>
<P>
It seems totally intentional that the Cox Report was published
under current circumstances. It is another adverse current against
China among the series of anti-China incidents created by some
people in the United States over recent years. Their purpose is to
divert public attention, fan anti-China feelings, defame China's

</P>

The Independent:
</P>

BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of the
Central Military Commission (CMC), said here today that China and
Russia, permanent members of the UN Security Council and
influential countries, bear historic responsibilities for
upholding justice and maintaining peace.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that the Chinese government hopes to further
enhance consultations with Russia in a joint effort to promote the
development of worldwide multi-polarization and establish a new
international political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
Zhang made the remarks during a meeting with visiting Deputy

partnership has grown comprehensively since 1996.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-led NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia over two months has
failed to achieve its goals, said Korapierinykof, adding that the
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade not only caused serious
casualties and property losses, but also constituted a gross
provocation against Chinese people and a wanton trampling on the
norms governing international relations.
</P>
<P>
He added that Russia will enhance coordination and cooperation
with China in order to promote friendly and cooperative military
relations within the framework of the cooperative Russia-China
strategic partnership and contribute to maintaining peace in the

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Jordan Resume Summit Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
resumed talks with Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein Monday
morning amid intensified efforts to forge a unified Arab stance
on negotiations with a new Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The talks dealt with the latest developments in the Middle East
peace process following the Israeli elections and means of
boosting bilateral relations, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Hopes to revive the peace process increased after Ehud Barak,
leader of Israel's Labor Party, defeated hardline Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
Barak has pledged to push the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks
forward and reactivate the negotiations with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan have been consulting with the three Arab
parties directly related to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah hosted Lebanese President Emile Lahoud on Saturday,
two days after he visited Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the
Gaza Strip. Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa met with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad on Saturday in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king arrived in Cairo Sunday evening for a
two-day visit and discussed with Mubarak the prospects for a
five-way summit to be attended by leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Syria,
Lebanon and the Palestinians, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
But Moussa said Sunday after the talks that an Arab five-way
summit will not be held before Barak forms his government and
announces its programs.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called for the five-way summit after a meeting in Cairo
with Mubarak on May 23, out of concern that Israel would try to
divide Arab ranks by cutting separate peace deals with Syria and
Lebanon without finding a settlement to the Palestinian issue -
the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
But so far, Syria has shown little interest in Arafat's
proposal. Damascus is still keeping distance with the Palestinians
due to the Palestinians' signing of interim peace accords
separately with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Moussa disclosed that the presidents of Egypt and Syria will
meet in the Egyptian capital in June, an apparent effort to
persuade al-Assad to attend the summit.

<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- China's April grain purchase prices
for state-owned grain enterprises fell one percent on March, with
prices on grain wholesale markets sliding marginally.
</P>

Despite the marginal drop, market prices for various varieties
of grain were seven to 15 yuan higher than purchase prices, a
range which essentially enabled grain businesses to cover costs.

Prices for polished long-grained nonglutinous rice and polished
round-grained nonglutinous rice rose by between 5-15 percentage
points compared with last year's same period, while prices for
maize and soybeans fell 9.2 percent and 23.1 percent, respectively.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Concocted "Cox Report" A Farce to Instigate Anti-China Feelings, Undermine Sino-U.S. Relations: Zhao Qizheng (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-concocted "Cox Report" is
a farce to instigate anti-China feelings and undermine Sino-U.S.
relations, said Zhao Qizheng, director of the Information Office
of the State Council, here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference given this afternoon in Beijing, Zhao
delivered a statement on the "Cox Report" made by the U.S.
Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said that a number of American anti-China politicians,
represented by Christopher Cox, dished out a tedious so-called
investigation report on May 25, after more than half a year of
careful scheming.
</P>
<P>
The report alleges that sophisticated national defense
technology and major scientific and technological achievements
related to national economic progress developed independently by
China through self-reliance are "stolen" or illegally "acquired"
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government and people are strongly indignant over
this groundless attack that is based on fabrications and confuses
black and white."
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report claims that "the People's Republic of China (PRC)
employs all types of people, organizations, and collection
operations to acquire sensitive technology. Threats to national
security can come from PRC scientists, students, business people
or bureaucrats, in addition to professional civilian and military
intelligence operations."
</P>
<P>
Zhao said, "This is a great slander against the Chinese nation
and is typical racial prejudice."
</P>
<P>
"China is a large country with a long history of civilization.
The Chinese nation is an industrious and ingenious nation," he
said, "China has always relied on its own efforts to handle its
own affairs. Never did China in the past, nor does it at present,
nor will it in the future, base its development of the
sophisticated national defense technology related to national
security and interests on the 'theft' of technology from other
countries."
</P>
<P>
"China relies on its own strength to independently develop its
national defense technology," Zhao said, "This is a basic
principle China has persisted in."

ANKARA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- The Turkish government has taken strict security measures
on Imrali Island in Marmara Sea near Turkey's western province of
Bursa where the trial is expected to open on Monday for Abdullah
Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), on
charges of treason.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- The United States said that President Bill Clinton will
invite Turkish newly-elected Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit to pay
an official visit to Washington to discuss the issues on Kosovo,
northern Iraq, Turkey's economic reforms, Cyprus and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's invitation will be conveyed to Ecevit in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel approved the cabinet list
submitted by prime minister-elect and central-left Democratic Left
Party (DSP) leader Bulent Ecevit for the 57th government.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the DSP, right-wing Nationalist Movement Party
(MHP) and the central-right Motherland Party (ANAP) signed the
protocol for the formation of the new coalition government.

<HEADLINE> U.S.- Concocted "Cox Report" A Farce to Instigate Anti-China Feelings, Undermine Sino-U.S. Relations: Zhao Qizheng (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said that as everybody knows, during the years when the
United States imposed an all-round blockade and used nuclear
blackmail against China, China relied on its own efforts to
develop atom bombs, missiles, satellites and other sophisticated
national defense technology.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years before China and the United States established
diplomatic relations, on June 29, 1964, China successfully
launched the first domestically developed surface-to-surface
missile, and on October 16 the same year, China successfully
exploded its first atom bomb, he said. Twelve years before the
establishment of Sino-U.S. diplomatic relations, on June 17, 1967,
China exploded its first H-bomb. Nine years before the
establishment of Sino-U.S.diplomatic relations, on April 24, 1970,
China successfully launched its own man-made earth satellite, he
said.
</P>
<P>
These facts indicate that China has a full capacity to
independently develop any sophisticated national defense
technology, Zhao said. Cox and other anti-China politicians in the
United States, turning a blind eye to these facts, have tried
their best to belittle and deny the Chinese people's innovative
capacity in developing sophisticated national defense technology.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report attacks China for extensively "stealing" various
military technologies of the United States over a long period, he
said. But, terms of conjecture such as "seemingly", "presumably",
"if", "perhaps", "probably" and "perhaps in the future", can be
found throughout the report while offering no substantive evidence,
he said. Without any solid, concrete facts, they even claim China
"stole" U.S. sensitive technology in an organized and extensive
way that threatens the national security of the United states.
</P>
<P>
This is utterly absurd, he said. This sensational conclusion
does not hold water.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report also brands such normal academic activities as
investigating and studying open materials and international
academic exchanges as "stealing" U.S. technological secrets, he
said. This is extremely ridiculous. It uses the method of first
maintaining that China displays the behavioral pattern of "
stealing", and then fabricating facts subjectively by scraping
together deliberately concocted information.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said, "By the way, I'd like to tell you a fact that the
concept Simulated Nuclear Explosion by Laser used in the Cox
Report was developed on the basis of "ICF" (Inertial Confinement
Fusion by Laser), which was originally advance by Mr. Wang
Ganchang of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1964. China has never
said that the use of this theory by other counties is a theft of
technology."

<TEXT>
<P>
China has been relying on its own efforts to manufacture and
develop its nuclear weapons, Zhao said. China has never, as the
Cox Report claims, "stolen" secrets from the U.S. nuclear weapons
laboratory. Performance data on the seven types of nuclear
warheads -- W56, W62, W70, W76, W78, W87 and W88 -- have long been
openly published in the United States, he said. They are no longer
secrets, so there is nothing to "steal".
</P>
<P>
For instance, the U.S. Nuclear Forces and Capability, the first
volume of the Nuclear Weapons Databook, written by Thomas B.
Cochran and other in 1984, and U.S. Nuclear Weapons: The Secret
History, written by Chuck Hansen in 1988, all make a detailed
introduction to the aforementioned nuclear warheads' power, weight,
length, diameter, materials, circular error probability and other
relevant data, as well as development units, supporting carrier
system and the armed services to be equipped, he said.
</P>
<P>
The writers specifically pointed out that all the materials
they quoted came from the records of the hearing of the U.S.
Congress, the three major nuclear laboratories of the U.S.
Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of Defense, in order
to emphasize the authority and reliability of the books, he said.
Moreover, in recent years, performance data about various types of
nuclear warheads, ranging from the early MK-1 to the latest W88,
can easily be found on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report says the United States has conducted about 1,030
nuclear tests, while China has only carried out 45 such tests. But,
China has developed advanced thermal nuclear warheads
technologically similar to those of the United States, Zhao said.
Here, the report, humming and hawing, drops a hint that China has
achieved this by "stealing" U.S. nuclear technology, otherwise,
the achievement would be impossible.
</P>
<P>
This kind of logic is quite ridiculous, Zhao noted. According
to it, any scientific and technological achievements attained by
other countries, particularly those developed faster than in the
United States, come from technology "stolen" from the United
States, he said. This is wildly arrogant, he said.
</P>
<P>
It only took China two years and eight months to go from the
explosion of the first atom bomb to that of the first H-bomb, he
said. China achieved this under the condition of severe U.S.
blockade. This fact, perhaps, cannot be denied by certain anti-
China politicians in the United States, stressed Zhao.

<P>
The Cox Report also offers a large number of distortions about
China's space undertakings,Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
China began developing its own space program during the period
of embargo and blockade by Western countries. China's space sector
has developed by totally relying on its own strength. Without any
foreign assistance, China has independently developed intermediate
and short-range missiles, long-range rockets, submarine-launched
solid-propellant rockets, recoverable satellites, the technology
to launch multiple satellites atop a single rocket, and
geostationary communication satellites.
</P>
<P>
When China announced it would enter into the international
commercial satellite launching market in 1985, the country already
had the experience of 20 successful launches, giving it the
ability to launch all kinds of satellites in high, medium and low
orbits.
</P>
<P>
China launched the first international commercial satellite in
1990. Launched by the Long March-III carrier rocket, the "Asiasat
I" satellite made by the Hughes Corp. achieved the most accurate
orbit insertion precision among the 31 satellites in the same
category launched by the company to that date.
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned facts all demonstrate that the space
technology of China has already ranked among the world's top level,
Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Commercial satellite launching represents the peaceful use of
space technologies and is a normal commercial activity based on
mutual benefit. The Cox Report slanders China by saying it had "
acquired" US missile guidance technology through commercial
launches to promote the development of its own missiles.
</P>
<P>
"This is a totally deceptive statement that substitutes one
thing for another," Zhao said. Although China already had the high-
precision missile guidance technology, people with even slight
scientific knowledge will know that commercial satellite launches
require only an economical and rational guidance system with
moderate precision, instead of the high-precision guidance system
needed for ballistic missiles.

<HEADLINE> Oil Producers Fail to Learn From Past Lessons, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A major economist of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) has said that Arab oil producing countries
failed to learn from past lessons in dealing with the latest drop
in oil prices, the Gulf News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Oil producing countries had gone through many crises like the
latest one of the drop of oil prices. However, they dealt with
these in an ad hoc manner and did not make use of the lessons of
the past," Dr. Fatimah Al Shamsi, vice-dean of Economics and
Administration Faculty at the UAE National University has said.
</P>
<P>
"None of these countries had specific strategies and policies
to react toward such crises which had been taking place all
along," she said while addressing a symposium on the effects of
the drop in oil prices on the economies of Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
In December 1985, the oil price was 27.5 U.S. dollars per
barrel, but it dropped to 8.5 dollars in December 1998, the
economist added.
</P>
<P>
She urged oil producing and exporting countries to take
initiatives in dealing with oil prices, saying these countries
have to be more active in coordination.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices should be fixed by producing and exporting
countries, instead of being controlled and determined by importing
countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
With the oil demand declining in South Asia and other markets,
it has become compulsory for oil producing countries to reduce
their production through a clear understanding between themselves,
she noted.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Concocted "Cox Report" A Farce to Instigate Anti-China Feelings, Undermine Sino-U.S. Relations: Zhao Qizheng (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is understandable if it is a non-professional who is saying
that the precision of the missile guidance system can be improved
through commercial launches, Zhao said. But it is very surprising
that such a statement comes from the so-called investigation
report of the Special Committee of the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report uses many pages to exaggerate China's failures
in commercial satellite launches in 1995 and 1996, he said. It
alleges that because the reasons for the failures were all
determined under the guidance of American experts, China could
improve its carrier-rocket technology and then apply it to its
missiles.
</P>
<P>
"It is sheer nonsense," Zhao said. The rocket has been
developed by China itself, and the various flight data are kept by
the Chinese. The Chinese have been independently developing
rockets for more than 30 years, during which time they have
experienced numerous successes and failures.
</P>
<P>
"Do they still need others' guidance for clearing up any errors?
" Zhao said. "Moreover, the Chinese cannot easily give out the
details of their own rocket design. How can the Americans who
don't know the ins and outs of the thing give any guidance?"
</P>
<P>
Since China has the ability to independently develop the
carrier rocket, it certainly has the ability to solve the problems
related to its flight technology, Zhao said. China has never, and
has no such need to "acquire" the sensitive technology of the
Untied States through the investigation of errors.
</P>
<P>
China launches the U.S. satellites strictly in accordance with
the agreement between the governments of the two countries, he
said. The security of U.S.-made satellites was under the strict 24-
hour control of the U.S. side, he said. However, the Cox Report
claims, "It would be surprising if the PRC has not exploited
security lapses while U.S.-built satellites and associated
equipment and documents were in the PRC."
</P>
<P>
This is really surprising to wantonly make such a subjective
assumption, especially when it is unable to prove that China "has
stolen" sensitive U.S. technology through commercial launches,
Zhao said.

<HEADLINE> Archeologists Discover Earliest Imperial Garden in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
recently discovered a 3,600-year-old imperial garden in central
China's Henan Province, which is believed to be the origin of all
Chinese gardens, including Beijing's Summer Palace.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists said this is the earliest imperial garden they
have ever found in China. In the center of the garden is a 130
meter by 20 meter pond connecting with a dyke and a moat, from
which archeologists have discovered fishing tackle made of jade
and pottery, and a number of shells.
</P>
<P>
The garden is in Yanshi city, some 700 kilometers from Beijing,
where archeologists discovered in the 1980s the capital site of
the Shang Dynasty (16 to 11 B.C.). The garden is still being
excavated in the ancient palace area of the city.
</P>
<P>
Near the pond was an ancient well, from which the archeologists
unearthed a special pot. They are hopeful that the ruins of
pavilions and other potential sight-seeing buildings will also be
found.
</P>
<P>
"The pond is the oldest and the most complete water facility in
China, which was used during carnivals for the emperors. It also
improved the ecology," said Du Jinpeng, an archeologists from the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Almost every Chinese emperor built big gardens in their palace
areas, featuring man-made rivers, ponds, rockeries and plantings.
The most famous was the Yuanming Yuan (the Round Bright Garden) a
few miles to the northwest of Beijing, which was destroyed by
British and French troops in 1860.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists hold that the discovery will benefit the
study of the evolution of Chinese cities and of the history of
Chinese gardens and water facilities.

<HEADLINE> ABC Strengthens Control on Infrastructure Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China (ABC)
today issued a circular about strengthening the management of
loans for infrastructure and fixed asset construction projects.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ABC said that the circular aims to step up
related credit management, minimize credit risks and promote the
healthy development of credit businesses.
</P>
<P>
In the circular, the ABC clearly spells out the key areas of
infrastructure and fixed assets that are appropriate for using
such loans, and demands that all of its branches stop lending to
repetitive projects and strictly control loans to manufacturing
projects.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure loans should support projects that can yield
good profits and are capable of repaying the principal and
interests, including rural power networks, energy and
communications, telecommunications and urban water and energy
supply, as well as medical infrastructure construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Fixed asset loans are earmarked for supporting new and high-
tech enterprises, as well as real estate and residential housing
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The circular also standardizes credit appraisal procedures and
relevant rights and responsibilities, and stipulates the need for
risk control of the bank's loans.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- New national science awards are to
be made annually by China's State Council to the two best
discoveries in the field of frontier scientific research.
</P>
<P>
The discoveries, which must be unique both at home and abroad,
must be of important scientific value and recognized by
international natural science circles.
</P>
<P>
The awards could also be made to scientists who help boost the
country's coffers as a result of technical innovation programs or
the industrialization of such high-tech discoveries.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Council it will also establish a state
award for natural science achievements while the existing state
technical innovation award, scientific and technological
advancement award and international scientific and technical
cooperation award will continue to be made every year.
</P>
<P>
Xu Guanhua, Vice Minister of Science and Technology said this
is aimed at further encouraging Chinese scientists who make
outstanding achievements in scientific research and make major
contributions to the country's rapid scientific development.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the country intends to reduce the number of
science awards at various levels although it will give increased
cash awards.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the state-level science awards selection
procedures will gradually adopt international appraisal standards
and pay more attention to the number of papers published in
international science journals and the number of citations
worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Notaries Public Granted Certificates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Justice issued
certificates today to 38 Hong Kong notaries public who will
continue to serve as appointed attesting officers.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held in Shenzhen, Vice-Minister of Justice Duan
Zhengkun said the system to appoint Hong Kong attesting officers "
settles the question of using legal documents in both inland areas
and Hong Kong which have different legal systems and thereby
safeguards the legitimate rights and interests of parties
concerned."
</P>
<P>
He urged the new attesting officers to be faithful to law and
responsibilities to society and clients when discharging their
duties in order to contribute more to exchanges and ensuring the
common prosperity of inland areas and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Attesting officers applying for new terms upon expiration of
their terms will be examined and assessed, with qualified
individuals appointed in succession.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice introduced the system to appoint
attesting officers in Hong Kong in 1981. Over 200 Hong Kong
lawyers appointed to positions as attesting officers have handled
some 500,000 inland legal cases involving Hong Kong residents,
according to the ministry.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Peacekeeper Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A member of the United Nations
peacekeeping forces in south Lebanon was killed and another one
wounded in conflicts between Lebanese guerrillas and Israeli
forces Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Orient radio quoted security sources as saying both
peacekeepers were from the Irish contingent of the U.N. Interim
Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
</P>
<P>
The fatality occurred during the armed conflicts between
guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and
Israeli forces in the western sector of its occupied border zone
in south Lebanon, the source said, adding a Lebanese woman was
also wounded in the clash.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and its ally
South Lebanon Army out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-strong U.N. forces were deployed in the border zone in
1978 following the Israeli first invasion of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The forces, charged with overseeing the withdrawal of Israeli
troops, were made up of soldiers from Ireland, Ghana, Nepal, Fiji,
Norway, Finland, Poland, France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 of the UNIFIL have been killed in various incidents,
especially during conflicts between Lebanese guerillas and Israeli
forces.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Sources to Fund Half of Dhaka's Annual Development Programs: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Around 50 percent of the budget for
Bangladesh's annual development programs (ADPs) of the coming
1999-2000 fiscal year will be funded from internal sources, a
report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed size of the annual development budget would be 155
billion taka (3.23 billion U.S. dollars), and the local
mobilization of fund for the ADPs would amount to 78.03 billion
taka (1.63 billion dollars), or 50.3 percent of the total, The New
Nation daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The percentage shows a sharp rise from that of the current
1998-99 fiscal year ending on June 30. The revised ADPs in the
current fiscal year got only 41.5 percent funding from internal
sources, according to the latest available estimation.
</P>
<P>
The revised ADPs budget this year would be slashed to 140
billion taka (2.92 billion dollars) from its original size of 150
billion taka (3.13 billion dollars), sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, government policy makers earlier had
a plan to make the size of the revenue budget at about 176 billion
taka (3.67 billion dollars) for the coming fiscal, but later
decided to slim the size in order to divert more fund from the
revenue budget to the development budget, so that the major
portion of fund for the implementation of development programs
could be met from internal sources and without increasing extra
tax loads on the people, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the government was also planning to
procure funds from Bangladeshi expatriates abroad for meeting part
of the development budget, in order to reduce dependence on donor
funding.
</P>
<P>
The funding of ADPs from internal sources would depend largely
on the skill and efficiency in mobilizing local resources and
fiscal measure, and the government was likely to give more
importance to the process of revenue collection and resource
mobilization than to raising tax rates, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh may not be able to complete all the development
activities under the country's ADP for the current fiscal year, as
only 44 percent of the ADP development activities were completed
during the first eight months, as against the target of 66.66
percent, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Planning Ministry said that only about 43
percent of the total fund allocated for the ADP had been spent in
the eight-month period, and it was a great challenge to spend the
rest 57 percent to successfully implement the activities in the
remaining months.

<HEADLINE> China Targets 300 Million Tons of Onshore Oil and Gas By 2010 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- China is set to develop six oil and
gas fields at home and abroad with a production capacity of 50
million tons each by 2010 in a bid to meet the joint target of
producing 300 million tons of onshore oil and gas by that time.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the China National Petroleum Corp. (
CNPC), the six large oil and gas fields include four domestic ones
and two in foreign countries which will be cooperative projects
with foreign oil companies.
</P>
<P>
The domestic fields are located in four major areas including
the Songliao Basin in northeast China, the Bohai Bay Basin and the
western part of China, as well as gas fields in Sichuan, Shaanxi-
Gansu-Ningxia areas and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region whose
combined gas production capacity will reach 50 billion cubic
meters (equivalent to 50 million tons of oil).
</P>
<P>
From overseas oil and gas fields China will on the one hand
import 50 million tons of oil and on the other some 50 billion
cubic meters of natural gas from neighboring countries (equivalent
to 50 million tons of oil).
</P>
<P>
Thus by 2010, CNPC will be able to bring to the market a total
of 200 million tons of crude oil and 100 billion cubic meters of
natural gas (equivalent to 100 million tons of oil).

<HEADLINE> German Parties Slam Government Policy on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Several political parties in Germany
on Monday strongly criticized NATO and the German government for
their Kosovo policies.
</P>
<P>
Angelika Beer, a member of the Green Party, one of the ruling
parties in Germany, in a speech published in Monday's Focus
magazine, slashed out at "NATO's ridiculous strategy" on the
Kosovo issue and described it as "a total failure."
</P>
<P>
NATO has been bombing Yugoslavia wantonly in a bid to press
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept its demands of
complete withdrawal of Yugoslav military forces and deployment of
a NATO-led international forces in Kosovo, a Yugoslav province
mostly populated by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Beer, an official in charge of defense policies, slammed Vice-
Chancellor and Minister of Foreign Affairs Joschka Fischer (a
Green Party member) as too obedient with the United States, asking
him to explain to the Green Party parliamentary group where the
Kosovo conflict is leading to.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking through the radio of the Heessen state, she urged
the German parliament to reevaluate the current situation in
Kosovo. As a member of NATO, Germany has taken part in the
alliance's air operations in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Gunda Roestel, a member of the Green Party Presidium, in a
speech carried on the same day in the Der Spiegel magazine,
expressed strong opposition to any deployment of ground troops in
Kosovo without a mandate of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to more and more signs that NATO would soon send
ground forces to the troubled Yugoslav province, Roestel dismissed
it as "extremely ridiculous to believe that ground operations
would bring a quick end to the Kosovo conflict. (If ground troops
are resorted to,) such craziness would last for months, if not
years."
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the Christian
Democratic Union (CDU), the biggest opposition party, criticized
the German government for making a serious mistake on the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Another major political party, the Free Democratic Party,
echoed the Greens and CDU at the end of its congress in Bremen on
Monday by calling for an immediate end to NATO's bombing of
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> China Moves to Tap Overseas Oil Markets (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- China is actively exploring
international oil markets, alongside its consistent efforts to tap
huge oil and gas resources domestically by inviting foreign
partners.
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, China is expected to develop transitional
oil production focusing on the Middle East, Russia, and Central
Asia, according to Qin Anmin, president of the China Petroleum
Engineering Construction Enterprise Group (CPECEG).
</P>
<P>
Qin said that China plans to turn out 10 million tons of crude
oil through its overseas production by the turn of the century.
And by the year 2010, China will try to develop an annual overseas
oil production capacity of 50 million tons, in addition to an
annual gas supply of 50 billion cubic meters from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Presently, China is making headway in oil exploration and
development overseas. The China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC)
and its subsidiary China Petroleum Engineering Construction
Enterprise Group (CPECEG) have successfully obtained the share-
holding, operational and leasing rights of oilfields in Peru,
Canada, Thailand, Kuwait and some other countries, and has turned
out a certain amount of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China is enjoying great prospects in its oil and gas
production in Sudan and Russia. A cooperative gas project in
Central Asia area will hopefully provide China with 25 billion
cubic meters of gas a year.

<P>
In line with a Sino-Russian cooperative gas project, China will
introduce 25 billion cu m of natural gas from eastern Siberia
yearly.
</P>
<P>
According to Qin, China has made marked progress in undertaking
oil projects overseas. The CPECEG has so far signed overseas oil
construction contracts totaling nearly 2 billion US dollars. It
has been listed among the world's top 225 contractors for five
consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that China is rich in oil resources,
producing over 150 million tons of crude oil annually and having
so far verified total oil deposits of 17 billion tons, ranking the
5th and 9th, respectively, in the world.
</P>
<P>
He explained that China's petroleum development strategy is to
rely mainly on domestic resources, speed up Sino-foreign
cooperation in exploring its offshore and western onshore oil and
gas resources, and step up efforts to tap international oil
markets.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Beat Pacers 93-90 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Reggie Miller had the shot he
wanted from the spot he wanted, but this 3-pointer wouldn't be a
Knicks killer.
</P>
<P>
Miller missed a 3-point shot from his favorite spot with 15
seconds left, and the New York Knicks defeated the Indiana Pacers
93-90 Sunday in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
As they did in the first round against Miami and the second
round against Atlanta, the Knicks wrested homecourt advantage away
from their opponents in the first game of the series. Game 2 is
Tuesday night at Market Square Arena.
</P>
<P>
In a physical, back-and-forth game, Miller had a chance to put
the Pacers ahead when he freed himself along the baseline and got
open at the elbow of the 3-point line with 15 seconds left. His
shot was short, the Knicks rebounded and went ahead 92-88 on two
free throws by Chris Childs with 12.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
Indiana had one more chance to tie after Childs made only one
of two from the line with 6.5 seconds left, but Mark Jackson shot
an airball from the corner just before the final buzzer.
</P>
<P>
It was the team-record sixth straight playoff win for the
Knicks, who got 19 points from Allen Houston, 16 each from Patrick
Ewing and Latrell Sprewell and 15 from Larry Johnson. New York
also posted its fourth straight postseason road win.
</P>
<P>
Miller had 19 points to lead the Pacers, who trailed for much
of the game as Rik Smits (4-for-12), Jakson (1-for-8) and Jalen
Rose(4-for-12) had trouble getting untracked offensively.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers finished 3-for-9 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks tied their season-low by committing just eight
turnovers and went 9-for-10 from the foul line over the final 93
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Indiana trailed throughout the fourth quarter until Smits hit a
jump hook with 4:42 left, just his second basket of the game, to
tie it 78-all. Miller hit a 3-pointer 40 seconds later after the
Knicks had gone back up by one.
</P>
<P>
Both coaches employed some interesting defensive matchups. Van
Gundy started Kurt Thomas on Smits, while Indiana's Larry Bird
used Miller to guard Marcus Camby.

<HEADLINE> Green Sweeps Sprint Double in Track Classic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- World 100-meter champion Maurice
Greene of the United States swept the sprint double Sunday in the
Prefontaine Classic Athletics Meet in Eugene, Oregon of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
World women's fastest sprinter Marion Jones and American
Olympic 400-meter champion Michael Johnson also won their
specialties.
</P>
<P>
Greene won the 100 meters in 9.84 seconds, a time that equaled
Canadian Donovan Bailey's world record but was negated by a wind
of 7.83 mph, well over the allowable of 4.473 for record standard.
</P>
<P>
Forty minutes later, Greene won the 200 in 20.06, a time that
would have broken the meet record of 20.15 by Johnson in 1995, if
not for the wind.
</P>
<P>
Green will face Johnson in a 200 showdown at the USA
Championships next month, the qualifying meet for the World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
Jones, track and field's woman athlete of the year in the past
two years, won the 200 in the fastest time in the world this year
at 21.81.
</P>
<P>
"I want to go through the season undefeated because I've yet to
do that," said Jones, who lost only once last year in her final
competition with the long jump.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, ranked No.1 in the world in the 400 eight times, beat
world No. 2 Mark Richardson of Britain by about 10 meters at 44.51.
</P>
<P>
"The wind was blowing hard down the backstretch, so running a
good time today was pretty much impossible," said Johnson, who
thought he was in shape to break 44 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Larry Wade of the United States ran a year's fastest time of 13.
12 in the men's 110 meters hurdles, his countryman Reggie Torian
finished 13.17 in second.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Helps Tibet Monitor Grasslands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Local experts are working on a
project to issue forecasts on the growth of grass for herdsmen in
the northern part of the Tibet Autonomous Region according to U.S.
meteorological satellite data.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time that Tibet uses the satellite-based
remote sensing technology for husbandry, says Yang Zhigang, head
of the Remote Sensing Application Research Center under the
regional meteorological bureau.
</P>
<P>
The center, which is responsible for the project, has set up
three monitoring stations in northern Tibet and the stations will
send accurate data on the height and coverage of grass to the
bureau in Lhasa, the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
The northern Tibet husbandry area, the largest of its kind in
the country, is so vulnerable to natural calamities like drought,
snowstorm, windstorm and low temperature that its output of grass
and livestock are much lower than grasslands in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities hope to renovate the grass production,
control the amount of animals and upgrade the husbandry industry
with the satellite-based remote sensing technology.

<HEADLINE> Southern Island Becomes China's Biggest High-Quality Banana Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 31 (Xinhua) -- China's southern island province
Hainan has an annual output of nearly one million tons of bananas,
making it the country's largest banana producer.
</P>
<P>
This year, the province increased the acreage of banana
plantation by 100,000 mu (about 6666 hectare) to 400,000 mu and it
is expecting to get about one million tons of high-quality of
bananas.
</P>
<P>
The island province's tropical climate makes it an ideal place
for bananas and at Dongfang, Ledong, and Sanya they grow all year
round.
</P>
<P>
The province began to grow bananas on a large scale in 1991 and
the increasing returns have attracted more investors. Last October,
one Hong Kong businessman signed an agreement with the city of
Dongfang to spend a billion yuan (about 120 million U.S. dollars)
on a banana plantation in the city. The project is expected to
produce 250,000 tons of high-quality bananas when it is completed
in 2001.

<P>
NANJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Nanjing, the capital of China's
Jiangsu Province, collected 727 million yuan in taxes from local
overseas-funded businesses during the January-April period of this
year, a 38 percent rise on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
The increase is a result of local efforts to improve the

<P>
During the first four months, the city added 101 overseas-
funded enterprises, bringing the number to some 3,210. The number
of companies each paying more than 5 million yuan in taxes
annually is now 11.

STOCKHOLM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Steffen Iversen's scored four
minutes into the game to give Norway a 1-0 victory over Georgia in
a European championship qualifier at Oslo on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The victory promoted Norway to 13 points from 6 games, five
more than second-placed Latvia who have a game in hand.
</P>
<P>
Iversen, a Tottenham Hotspur player, headed home a cross from
the left wing by Tore Andre Flo of Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
Georgia rarely posed threat on Norwegian goalkeeper Frode Olsen
in a game dominated by midfield duels. But Norway's forwards
squandered almost all their chances.
</P>
<P>
Georgian Temur Ketsbaya of Newcastle United almost equalised
early in the second half with a shot blasted from 20 meters that
was tipped over the bar by Olsen.
</P>
<P>
Norway were missing some key players in the match, including
Manchester United defender Ronny Johnson and striker Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer, who both have knee injuries. First choice goalkeeper
Thomas Myhre of Everton broke his ankle in training last week.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economy to Expand 5 Pct Next Year: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
forecast over the weekend that the country's GNP will expand by
"more than five percent" next year, sustaining its strong recovery
seen in the first three months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Post quoted the bank's governor Gabriel Singson
as saying that higher-than-expected growth of gross national
product (GNP) of two percent by March will fuel more robust growth
in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
The figures for the first quarter of this year released by the
National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) increase the
likelihood of GNP growth of over five percent next year, Singson
said.
</P>
<P>
"This is very encouraging and very good for the economy,"
Singson said.
</P>
<P>
NEDA's report showed that the country's GNP for the first
quarter of 1999 expanded by 2 percent while gross domestic product
(GDP) grew by 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the government may seek higher growth targets from
the International Monetary Fund, if the uptrend continues in the
next quarter.

<HEADLINE> Sofia Worried at NATO Raids on Yugoslav Towns Near Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria is concerned over NATO's
overnight airstrikes on two Yugoslav towns near Bulgaria's western
border, a spokesman for the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, NATO fired missiles on several parts of
Pirot, a town about 60 kilometers from the Bulgarian capital city
of Sofia, destroying apartment buildings, a factory and a TV
transmitter. NATO war planes also bombed the TV transmitter in
Dimitrovgrad, outside Pirot, on the border with Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
"We have expressed to NATO once again our concerns over the
interests of the ethnic Bulgarians living in Yugoslavia," said the
spokesman, Radko Vlaikov, urging NATO to avoid risking hitting
civilian and non-military facilities.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Children's Picture Storybooks Popular Among Collectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Picture storybooks for children,
once indispensable for Chinese children, have become a popular
item for collectors.
</P>
<P>
Storybook collections are being exhibited in the city of
Tianjin, with more than 3,000 storybooks on display. The
exhibition was sponsored by the municipal history museum and a
collectors organization. It had exhibits from different periods
like the Republic of China (1912 -- 1949) and before and during
the so-called Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Also on show were picture storybooks on special topics, books
that have received awards, manuscripts, and research materials.
</P>
<P>
Picture storybooks became a collector's item only after the mid-
1980s, when many publishing houses stopped producing such books as
tastes changed among Chinese children.

<HEADLINE> McCann Pulls out of Scot Squad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Rangers winger Neil McCann has
pulled out of Craig Brown's Scotland squad for the Euro 2000
qualifiers against the Faroe Islands and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
McCann limped out of Saturday's Cup final victory over Celtic
at Hampden Park with a recurrence of the knee injury which has
plagued his season.
</P>
<P>
And the SFA confirmed that the former Hearts man misses the
away qualifiers against the Faroes on Saturday and the Czech
Republic four days later -- a double header that will shape the
Scots' qualification dream.
</P>
<P>
Brown, who was already without Colin Hendry, has not yet called
up a replacement for McCann.
</P>
<P>
Hendry was ruled out with a groin problem that will require
surgery later this week.
</P>
<P>
The squad meets up on Monday morning and Brown may announce a
replacement for McCann then.

LONDON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Aston Villa chairman Doug Ellis
expects goalkeeper Mark Bosnich to succeed Peter Schmeichel at
Treble winners Manchester United, according to local reports here
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bosnich, who began his career at Old Trafford 10 years ago, can
join the Red Devils on a free transfer under the Bosman Ruling.
</P>
<P>
United had this weekend been linked with Monaco's World Cup
winning France goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, but Ellis said: "Bosnich
has decided to go and play for Manchester United rather than Villa
and it is something that we have known about for some time."
</P>
<P>
He added: "There is nothing that we can do about it, but it
hurts us to lose him all the same."

<HEADLINE> Vurbanov Elected President of Bulgarian Volleyball Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sofia, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture Minister Ventsislav
Vurbanov was elected President of the Bulgarian Volleyball
Federation at a general meeting that lasted nearly five hours
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the delegates voted for him.
</P>
<P>
"I will not work alone. I will build a team of professionals
to rely on. I will make the work of the federation transparent
and will insist for the introduction of normal transfer rules,"
said Vurbanov, adding that he would do his best to help Bulgaria
get back to the World League matches.
</P>
<P>
Former present Valentin Zayakov, who has been holding this
position since 1992, left the general meeting not long after its
beginning protesting the election of chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
The general meeting was convoked six months after a serious
rift emerged in Bulgarian volleyball, creating two separate
federations: one of Zayakov and the other one of Dimiter Zlatanov,
who was elected President of the Federation in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Over the conflicts between the officials of the two Federations,
the International Volleyball Federation barred Bulgaria from
international tournaments and championships untill May 31, the
deadline for holding a general meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We can say now that Bulgaria is again in the family of world
volleyball," said Ralf Andersen, President of the European
Volleyball Federation and Vice President of the International
Voleyball Federation. Andersen had been sent to the general
meeting by the International Federation to monitor the procedure
for the election of a new federation president.
</P>
<P>
The International Volleyball Federation is expected to cancel
Bulgaria's punishment on Monday.

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombing Stops Only If Yugoslavia Meets NATO's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said on Sunday NATO bombing was weakening Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's resolve but would only stop if he met
alliance demands in full.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made after Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency
reported on Friday that Belgrade accepted the "general principles"
set out by the Group of Eight as a basis for bringing peace to
Serbia's Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
"The mere fact (Milosevic) is making such an offer does
demonstrate that the pressure is telling on him. We must make sure
we keep up the pressure until we get a settlement that meets our
full objectives," Cook told reporters Sunday afternoon after
meeting Kosovo Liberation Army leader Hashim Thaqi in London.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he denied the reports that Britain was planning to
send an extra 50,000 troops to the Balkans as part of a Kosovo
invasion force.
</P>
<P>
"Any decision of the kind that there has been speculation about
would be a decision for the full alliance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports on British newspapers on Sunday claimed that NATO had
secretly planned a 150,000-strong ground invasion of Kosovo, for
which Britain would contribute 50,000 troops.

<HEADLINE> Provisional Results of S. African Poll Expected by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The provisional results of the
South African general election would probably be announced by June
3, the next day after the votes were cast, chief electoral officer
Mandala Mchunu said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) would then deal with
any disputes, for the final results to be announced within seven
days after election day.
</P>
<P>
"We should be able to issue a provisional result by June 3,"
Mchunu said in a television interview in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The IEC' high-tech information system would enable political
parties to verify election results as they became available.
</P>
<P>
About 600 computer working stations had been set up at the
IEC's election result center at the Pretoria show grounds.
</P>
<P>
"Quite a number of these have been assigned to political
parties so that they can verify the results as they come in," said
the electoral officer.
</P>
<P>
Incoming results would be counted by computer.
</P>
<P>
Vote counting would take place in full view of political party
agents and observers. Vehicles transporting ballot boxes to
counting points would all be escorted by security staff.
</P>
<P>
Mchunu said 445 satellite dishes deployed throughout the
country would be used to transmit results by computer, including
from remote areas.
</P>
<P>
Presiding electoral officers would first convey results to the
election center by telephone and fax machines.
</P>
<P>
The figures transmitted by computer would serve as a
verification of those already received.
</P>
<P>
Mchunu said the 600 computers at the Pretoria election center
cost about six million rand (about one million U.S. dollars).
Sponsorships from the private sector, including three million rand
from United States computer tycoon Bill Gates, helped to cover the
expense.
</P>
<P>
The computers would be sold by tender to public institutions
and other buyers after June 2.
</P>
<P>
Mchunu expressed confidence that sufficient measures had been
taken to ensure a peaceful election. Security staff from a
contingent of about 90, 000 police and soldiers would be deployed
at voting stations as from Monday.
</P>
<P>
They would especially maintain a strong presence in high-risk
areas.
</P>
<P>
"I have not received any earth-shattering news about points
where voting will not be possible," Mchunu said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted a high turnout of voters.
</P>
<P>
"By 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) on election day people will start
realizing that voting is not a painful process, and the numbers
will start rising."
</P>
<P>
Voting stations will be operational from 7 a.m. (0500 GMT)) to
9 p.m. (1900 GMT) on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers to Review Enlargement Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) foreign
ministers will exchange views on Monday about whether their
current concept of enlargement strategy is still valid and for how
long.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges will set the stage for a more formal review at
the European Council in Cologne, Germany, later in the week.
European Report, a EU publication, said that what the 15 ministers
will look at is the continuing absence of an overall plan for EU
relations with the countries on its Eastern borders.
</P>
<P>
Until the Kosovo crisis jolted EU complacency, the general
belief among the EU member states was that the enlargement to ten
countries of Central and Eastern Europe was a respectable, and for
the time being, largely sufficient strategy.
</P>
<P>
During an one year period from March 1998, the pre-accession
process was running as smoothly as could have been hoped, and the
front-runner candidates were making the sort of progress that had
been expected, the EU report said.
</P>
<P>
A comfortable sense of gradual evolution was settling over the
EU with accession dates for the leading applicants settling in a
reassuringly medium-term perspective from some time beyond 2003,
stretching perhaps another ten years into the distance for the
slowest of the ten, the European Report said.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, believed that
the emergence of the Kosovo conflict exposed the inadequacies of
the approach to South-East Europe, and also revealed weaknesses in
the EU's general planning.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive pointed out that the void between the EU and
Russia was made very evident by the split over the merits of the
NATO's airstrike against Yugoslavia. And the need to offer
immediate support to countries like Macedonia and Albania as they
bore the brunt of the refugee crisis ran the risk of leaving
formal EU candidates in the region feeling neglected, it added.
</P>
<P>
A commission spokesman said here Friday that "the situation in
South-East Europe provides reasons for moving as fast as possible
towards the enlargement in Central and Eastern Europe".
</P>
<P>
The Berlin summit two months ago went a long way to resolving
the financial difficulties, so the EU should now concentrate on
this. "It should not give a signal that South-East Europe is
depriving the candidates in Central and Eastern Europe of
attention," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers To Decide Options On Banana Regime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) foreign
ministers are going to choose an option to solve the dispute with
the United States over EU's banana regime during their discussions
about the preparation of three bilateral summits at their monthly
General Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The three summits are the EU-Canada on June 17, EU-Japan on
June 20 and EU-US on June 21. The EU-US summit will be accorded
the lion's share of the ministers' time, EU sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon Brittan, European Commissioner for External Trade, is
expected to present a report on the EU's efforts to comply with
the banana regime following the recent ruling against the EU by
the World Trade Organization. Sir Leon will also highlight a
number of points concerning the EU ban on hormone-free and
hormone-treated beef from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, EU's executive body, unveiled three
options on May 26 for reforming its controversial banana regime
and ending a bitter trade dispute with the United States on the
issue. The options include an end to the quotas on banana imports,
retaining the quotas but removing the limits of bananas from
African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) nations, and setting a new
quota which would be shared by ACP and Latin American exporters.
</P>
<P>
The options are designed to meet the demands of the world Trade
Organization which condemned the regime in April.
</P>
<P>
The commission also hopes one of the options will be agreed
swiftly to limit the damage from 186 million worth of U.S.
sanctions on the EU, which were also agreed by the WTO.
