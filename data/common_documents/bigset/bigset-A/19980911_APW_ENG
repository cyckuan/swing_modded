	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Ruling party supporters fired guns,
threw rocks and swung clubs at vastly outnumbered opposition
protesters Friday as strongman Hun Sen shifted tactics to crush
growing calls for his ouster. At least one person was killed and
several wounded.
	   The deployment of plainclothes supporters instead of riot police
to attack the opposition came a day after King Norodom Sihanouk
appealed to the army and police to stop shooting and beating
peaceful protesters and Buddhist monks.
	   The week-long violence, the worst since Hun Sen deposed Prince
Norodom Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody coup last year,
stems from disputes over Hun Sen's official victory in July 26
parliamentary elections. The opposition rejects the results,
alleging massive fraud.
	   Some 2,000 backers of Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party,
some who appeared to be soldiers in plainclothes and many coming
from pro-Hun Sen areas around Phnom Penh, gathered near the
Angkor-style Independence Monument.
	   ``We are looking for the losers,'' said one Hun Sen supporter,
Chan Lay, 42, who reeked of alcohol. He carried a club and a pistol
protruded from his shirt. ``They are the trouble-makers for us and
for the CPP.
	   Hun Sen supporters set out with bamboo clubs and firearms toward
the gathering point of 300 rival opposition protesters about six
blocks away near the U.S. Embassy and Ranariddh's home. The
opposition, warned of the advance of their rivals, started to move
from the area.
	   Turning onto a side street, they were confronted by six security
guards from a nearby hotel who opened fire with pistols. At least
three men were taken to a clinic with gunshot wounds to their legs.
	   Opposition backers holed up overnight at a school meanwhile
pelted the pro-Hun Sen marchers with rocks as they passed.
	   The two groups finally clashed on a side street. Gunfire erupted
from the Hun Sen crowd.
	   Human-rights workers confirmed that one protester trying to flee
was chased down, beaten, shot in the back and killed by Hun Sen's
crowd. The victim was pronounced dead at a hospital. A pool of
blood and his hat remained at the site.
	   A young boy shot in the leg refused to get into an ambulance to
take him to the capital's main Calmette hospital, seen as a bastion
of Hun Sen support. None of the other wounded were taken to
Calmette, either.
	   Belief is widespread that the body of a Buddhist monk reported
to have been slain in a brutal police charge Wednesday and taken by
the ambulance never arrived at the hospital. Rumors that many monks
have been killed have intensified anger at Hun Sen.
	   The vastly outnumbered opposition group _ whose leaders had
taken away a club from one member earlier to keep a planned march
to the U.N. Center for Human Rights non-violent _ tried to flee on
motorbikes and on foot down the narrow, pot-holed streets.
	   Riot police, who have acted as Hun Sen's shock troops since he
launched a crackdown against weeks of peaceful protest against his
rule Monday, deployed only after the blood-letting and made no move
to keep the two sides apart.
	   The members of Hun Sen's formerly communist CPP were highly
organized. Members wore rubber bands on their wrists to distinguish
themselves from the opposition in a melee. They carried printed
signs on bamboo staves _ which were quickly turned into clubs.
	   They hunted down opposition supporters in the city's central
market, where shops were closed. Sullen onlookers made no move to
join the pro-Hun Sen crowd, a marked contrast to thousands who
spontaneously joined a peaceful opposition march Thursday.
	   CPP organizers directed their men with walkie-talkies and mobile
phones. Bullhorns blared slogans: ``Long live Hun Sen! Down with
the losers of the July 26 elections!''
	   The pro-Hun Sen crowd gathered later in a park outside the Royal
Palace, drinking water and eating bread brought by cars. Riot
police stood nearby and showed no sign of dispersing them.

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Nine passengers were injured when a
Chinese jetliner taking off from Shanghai for Beijing made an
emergency landing after its landing gear jammed, an airport
official said Friday.
	   The China Eastern Airlines plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11, had
137 passengers aboard when it returned to Hongqiao International
Airport shortly after 11 p.m. on Thursday, said the official.
	   None of the passengers was seriously injured, according to the
official, who would not give his name.
	   The incident is under investigation, according to an official of
the Civil Aviation Administration of China in Beijing who gave his
name as Mr. Liu. He would not say whether any foreigners were
involved and would not give any other information.
	   China Eastern declined comment.
	   City leaders including Mayor Xu Kuangdi and Huang Ju, Shanghai
secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, went to the airport to
comfort the passengers, the Wen Hui Bao newspaper reported.

Sampras-Rafter match should be showcase of tame U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Philippoussis defeating Johansson; SHOULD STAND. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Pete Sampras stands on the cusp of history in
the U.S. Open. Patrick Rafter, the defending champion, stands in
his way.
	   In what promises to be the showcase match of a tame tournament
that so far has provided few surprises or dramatic battles, Sampras
and Rafter meet in a men's semifinal that will have the feel of a
final.
	   The last 11 days have seemed little more than a setup for
Saturday's match, which features two of the best
serve-and-volleyers of their generation. It pits the hottest
players in men's tennis against each other.
	   And it could provide revenge for Sampras _ not only against an
opponent who defeated him a month ago in Cincinnati, but also
against critics who had written him off as an over-the-hill
champion.
	   ``It's time, this is the U.S. Open, this is the big moment of
the year for me,'' Sampras said. ``This is what the year boils down
to for me.''
	   Mark Philippoussis won a thrilling tiebreaker in the fifth set
to defeat Thomas Johansson late Thursday night in a match featuring
50 aces, setting up an encounter with Carlos Moya in the other
semifinal.
	   Philippoussis slammed 30 aces, including 11 in the final set, in
his 4-6, 6-3, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 7-6 (12-10) win over Johansson, who
had 20 aces and 15 double faults. Philippoussis hit one serve at
132 mph, only to be outdone by his opponent _ whose 136 mph serve
was the fastest of the tournament.
	   ``I got the first serves in when I needed it, I kept the
pressure on and it finally paid off,'' Philippoussis said at the
end of the 3 hour, 26 minute match.
	   The other quarterfinal lasted just 90 minutes.
	   No. 10 Moya, who won this year's French Open and was a finalist
at the Australian Open, made just 15 unforced errors in a 6-4, 6-3,
6-3 win over Magnus Larsson. Moya faced only one break point in the
match, and never lost his serve.
	   Until this year, Moya was known mostly as a clay-court player.
His results at the Australian and U.S. Opens show how he has
developed into a top player on all surfaces.
	   ``I grew up on clay, so I think I'm always going to have the
game on clay,'' Moya said. ``If you ask me right now, I prefer
hard. If you ask me two weeks ago, I prefer clay.''
	   The women's semifinals are set for Friday, with top-seeded
Martina Hingis facing No. 3 Jana Novotna and an all-American match
between No. 2 Lindsay Davenport and No. 5 Venus Williams.
	   When Sampras lost in the second round of the French Open in late
May, the whispers about the end of his reign atop men's tennis
became louder. His stretch as No. 1 briefly had been broken earlier
in the year by Marcelo Rios, and Sampras appeared vulnerable for
the first time in years.
	   But he won a record-tying fifth Wimbledon title in July, and is
within two victories of two more records _ Jimmy Connors' mark of
five U.S. Open titles and Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam
singles titles.
	   Sampras, who will remain No. 1 in the world no matter what
happens the rest of this tournament, has not lost in a Grand Slam
semifinal since 1996 at Wimbledon.
	   Rafter had lost eight straight times to Sampras before beating
him in the final of an ATP Tour event in Cincinnati in mid-August,
a match that ended with a disputed call. Rafter's serve was called
out, but the umpire overruled the call to give Rafter the ace and
the match.
	   Sampras stood at the baseline for several seconds, making the
victorious Rafter wait at the net, and then refused to shake the
umpire's hand.
	   Rafter said that win will change his attitude heading into
Saturday's semifinal.
	   ``I won't go on the court feeling as intimidated as I had
before,'' he said. ``But Pete is a different kettle of fish
altogether. I had a great win last year. He's done it for the last
six years.''
	   Rafter, whose speed will be pitted against Sampras' power, had
to rally from a two-set deficit in the first round against Hicham
Arazi. Since then, he has dropped just one set in four matches.
	   Rafter is trying to become the sixth man of the Open Era to
successfully defend a U.S. Open singles title. That's an
accomplishment that would impress even Sampras.
	   ``That's really a true sign for me on how I look at a player, is
winning a major if you can come back and do it again,'' Sampras
said. ``That is the toughest thing to do in sports.''

	   TONALA, Mexico (AP) _ Officially, 45 people have died in
southern Mexico's flooding, but not even the officials believe that
number. With a 100-mile (160-kilometer) stretch of coastline cut
off from the outside world, everyone is bracing for the worst when
rescuers reach the hardest-hit areas.
	   The reports have been trickling out in rare telephone calls or
from short-wave radio operators in towns along southern Chiapas
state's Pacific coast: five dead in one town, two in another, a
body floating by in the muddy, swollen river in a third.
	   In one radio communication Thursday, a recording of which was
obtained by The Associated Press, a government radio operator in
Acapetagua said villagers were trying to reach more than 100 bodies
floating in a lagoon just outside of town.
	   ``There are more than 100,'' the operator told military radio
technicians. ``The sea has them.''
	   She said villagers were able to pull only two bodies from the
waters because of the swift current, and appealed for military
helicopters to help.
	   The government has confirmed 45 deaths _ 31 in Chiapas and the
rest in other states _ after a week of steady rain _ nearly two
feet in some areas _ caused the worst flooding in half a century.
Sixty people are reported missing in Chiapas.
	   Among the hardest towns was Pijijiapan, 50 miles (80 kilometers)
north of Tapachula, where at least 18 people died, including a
police officer who drowned during a rescue mission. It is one of
the few towns in the zone where telephone service occasionally
works.
	   A broad, muddy torrent rages across what until this week was
Chiapas' coastal highway just south of this town, making it
impossible for anyone to head toward the Guatemalan border. One
hundred miles away, a similar river has cut the highway near
Huixtla, only 40 miles from Guatemala.
	   Little is known about the area in between.
	   ``This is a tragedy of enormous proportions,'' President Ernesto
Zedillo said after a helicopter tour of the area on Thursday.
	   He said bad weather and damaged roads were making it
``particularly difficult to reach those places we'd like to be _
the communities where the people are beginning to have, or already
have, a shortage of drinking water.''
	   He said more than 20 helicopters were to arrive in Chiapas by
Friday to help relief teams reach isolated areas.
	   Margarito Ordonez Pineda, coordinator at the Tonala office of
the health ministry, said 98 percent of the people in the region
live in the slice of land between the highway and the coast.
	   ``Everyone working here has relatives there. We're very
worried,'' he said. ``I'm 52 and I've never seen anything like
this. I've talked to older people and they haven't either.''
	   At a Tonala shelter set up in the San Francisco church, children
prayed at the altar as they waited for food and water to arrive.
	   Aman Santizo had been at the shelter for two days; he was
returning to his village of Mapastepec from a trip when the water
cut him off and was worried about his wife and 1-year-old son.
	   ``I'm upset because I don't know anything about my family,'' he
said.
	   Shelters also were full in Tapachula, with 250,000 people the
largest city in the region, close to the Guatemalan border. At the
Tapachula Country Club, 250 people sought shelter.
	   ``Children are crying because they haven't brought anything to
eat,'' one man angrily told a military officer.
	   Most of Mexico was being pounded by storms off the Pacific and
Gulf coasts, and severe flooding was reported in many areas.
Forecasters predicted more rain for southern and eastern Mexico.
	   Seventeen ports along Mexico's two coasts were closed to small
craft and authorities suspended all fishing and ocean recreational
activities.
	   The Red Cross appealed for donations and relief teams collected
bundles of supplies in Mexico City.

Japanese stock prices plunge, U.S. dollar falls

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices continued to drop in early
afternoon trading Friday, losing almost across the board following
a steep overnight decline on Wall Street. The U.S. dollar fell
against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average plunged 771.77 points, or
5.26 percent, to 13,894.26 in early afternoon trading. On Thursday,
the index had fallen 89.51 points, or 0.61 percent.
	   Stocks fell as the overnight rout in New York renewed concerns
over the global economy and the condition of the U.S. economy,
traders said.
	   In New York Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled
249.48 points to 7,615.54, its sixth-worst point loss, amid
earnings worries and fears that U.S. President Bill Clinton may be
forced to resign or be impeached.
	   Tokyo investors were also concerned by the plunge in stock
prices across Latin America, traders said. The Brazilian market
Thursday posted its steepest fall in one session since 1990, with
the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange's Bovespa Index losing 15.8 percent.
	   ``The Tokyo market is being affected by the fall in stock
markets around the world,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at
Nikko Securities Co.
	   Japan's central bank said in its monthly report, released
Friday, that Japan's economic conditions continue to deteriorate.
The report said the weak consumption and demand are keeping
wholesale prices in a downtrend.
	   Some selling early in the session may been related to Friday's
settlement of September futures and options, traders said. Stock
prices can swing wildly as large investors adjust or eliminate
their futures and options positions.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 41.61 points, or 3.75 percent, to 1,068.30.
The TOPIX closed down 6.10 points, or 0.55 percent, the previous
day.
	   In foreign exchange trading, concerns over the U.S. economy and
Clinton's escalating problems weighed heavily on the dollar,
traders said.
	   The dollar bought 134.41 yen in midday trading, down 1.29 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of
134.23 yen overnight.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond dropped to a new record low of 0.780 percent from Thursday's
finish of 0.840 percent, the previous record-low level. Its price
rose to 114.72 yen from Thursday's 114.27 yen.

Indonesian legislators mull demands that ex-president explain his
</HEADLINE>
actions

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Legislators are considering whether to
order ex-President Suharto to explain publicly why economic and
social order all but collapsed in the weeks leading to his
resignation in May, news reports said Friday.
	   Suharto quit after 32 years in power following a wave of student
protests and riots, making way for new President B.J. Habibie,
himself now the target of similar protests as the economic crisis
grinds on and prices for food soar.
	   About 1,200 people were killed in May's riots and thousands of
stores and homes burned and ransacked _ many of them belonging to
the ethnic Chinese minority, blamed as scapegoats for the worst
economic crisis in 30 years.
	   The Jakarta Post newspaper quoted a senior legislator Poedjono
Pranyoto as saying there were growing calls for Suharto to explain
himself to a special session of the People's Consultative Assembly,
which is to convene in November to debate sweeping democratic
reforms proposed by Habibie.
	   The reforms are to open the way for parliamentary elections,
probably in May next year.
	   After the poll, the assembly, Indonesia's highest legislative
body, is scheduled to choose a president by the end of 1999.
Habibie has said he plans to stand for office again.
	   Since he quit, Suharto, 77, has remained at his home in Jakarta
guarded by the military.
	   He has denied accusations that he improperly amassed a fortune
overseas for himself and his family during his presidency.
	   This week Suharto's legal consultant called on the government to
take action against people who he said had slandered the former
leader.

Kopeck gets her finger back but Welsh sickness halts brave
</HEADLINE>
comeback &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Three days after losing the top of
her finger in a warmup game, Lauralee Kopeck was itching to get
back into action at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Then eight of her opponents fell sick with gastroenteritis and
the game was called off.
	   ``This kid hasn't winced, hasn't whined, hasn't complained,''
said Canada's team leader, Margie Schuett. ``She has her finger
taken off and goes right back out there and competes again.''
	   Well, she would have done.
	   Hours later, the Welsh team announced that four of its hockey
players were in hospital and four others were receiving treatment
for gastroenteritis.
	   It's the latest hiccup to hit the Commonwealth Games.
	   ``The first player was affected on Sunday and others have gone
down with it since,'' said Wales manager Margaret Edwards. ``The
rest of the team are fine.''
	   Welsh press officer Malcolm Stanners said the source of the
illness was yet to be discovered.
	   ``There's no evidence yet that it's food poisoning but the
authorities are investigating whether that is the case,'' Stanners
said.
	   The eight hope to be back in action Monday when the game is
rescheduled. They will face up to Kopeck and her reconstructed
finger.
	   Kopeck, whose nickname is Jumbo, warmed up with the Canadian
team before its 3-0 win over Namibia on Wednesday.
	   ``She was defending a short corner and an opponent smashed the
ball, it hit her little finger and sheared off the end of it,''
said team doctor Peter Fowler.
	   ``The doctor at the game saw the bone exposed and sent her to
our clinic at the village in an ambulance. After the game, they
found her finger on the field, brought it around and we sewed it
back on.''
	   The women's hockey games have been among several events being
staged before Friday's opening ceremony at the 100,000-capacity
Bukat Jalil National Stadium just outside downtown Kuala Lumpur.
	   Organizers hoped that went according to plan after a series of
unexpected changes to the sports events.
	   The rugby schedule had to be redrawn Thursday when Gambia and
Zimbabwe pulled out of the 7-a-side event, changing the structure
from five pools of four teams to six pools of three.
	   Organizers also had to consult the rule book when rain disrupted
two cricket matches for up to three hours.
	   The rain came with Northern Ireland struggling at 89 for five
against powerhouse South Africa. Because of the delay caused by the
downpour, organizers got out the calculators and set the South
Africans to make 131 which they did for the loss of six wickets
despite being 23 for four and 57 for five.
	   The rain also affected the Bangladesh-Barbados match and the
West Indians were set 160 to win, which they also achieved with
four wickets left.
	   World No. 1 squash player Peter Nicol of Scotland had no such
delays.
	   He brushed aside Guyana's Regan Pollard 9-0, 9-0, 9-1 in only 13
minutes.

Philippines' Estrada says no capital controls eyed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Backing the Philippine Central Bank's
opposition to currency controls as a means of stabilizing the peso,
President Joseph Estrada said there is no reason to follow
Malaysia's lead in imposing exchange-rate restrictions.
	   ``I don't believe we have to follow the footsteps of (Malaysian)
Prime Minister Mahathir because we are more economically stable
than Malaysia,'' Estrada said late Thursday.
	   Since Malaysia imposed restrictions on the convertibility of its
currency, the ringgit, on Sept. 1, the Philippine Central Bank has
reiterated its opposition to currency controls, which it views as
unworkable and open to corruption.
	   Estrada's comments are the first he has made on the highly
sensitive issue.
	   Indonesia earlier this week also voiced its opposition to
imposing currency controls on the rupiah.
	   Estrada said his economic managers are using other means to
combat the currency crisis, such as a government austerity program
and budgetary controls.
	   For its part, the independent Central Bank is using
interest-rate adjustments as its first line of defense against
speculative attacks on the peso. The peso has fallen some 40
percent against the dollar since the currency crisis was triggered
by the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997.
	   Estrada echoed comments by Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson
that currency controls would create a black market in peso-dollar
trading.
	   The Philippines maintained exchange-rate controls for some four
decades before they were abandoned by former President Fidel Ramos
in 1992. Over this period, the official peso-dollar rate was
stable, but bore little resemblance to the exchange rates quoted in
street trading.

	   TONALA, Mexico (AP) _ Officially, 45 people have died in
southern Mexico's flooding, but not even the officials believe that
number. With a 100-mile (160-kilometer) stretch of coastline cut
off from the outside world, everyone is bracing for the worst when
rescuers reach the hardest-hit areas.
	   The reports have been trickling out in rare telephone calls or
from short-wave radio operators in towns along southern Chiapas
state's Pacific coast: five dead in one town, two in another, a
body floating by in the muddy, swollen river in a third.
	   In one radio communication Thursday, a recording of which was
obtained by The Associated Press, a government radio operator in
Acapetagua said villagers were trying to reach more than 100 bodies
floating in a lagoon just outside of town.
	   ``There are more than 100,'' the operator told military radio
technicians. ``The sea has them.''
	   She said villagers were able to pull only two bodies from the
waters because of the swift current, and appealed for military
helicopters to help.
	   The government has confirmed 45 deaths _ 31 in Chiapas and the
rest in other states _ after a week of steady rain _ nearly two
feet in some areas _ caused the worst flooding in half a century.
Sixty people are reported missing in Chiapas.
	   Among the hardest towns was Pijijiapan, 50 miles (80 kilometers)
north of Tapachula, where at least 18 people died, including a
police officer who drowned during a rescue mission. It is one of
the few towns in the zone where telephone service occasionally
works.
	   A broad, muddy torrent rages across what until this week was
Chiapas' coastal highway just south of this town, making it
impossible for anyone to head toward the Guatemalan border. One
hundred miles away, a similar river has cut the highway near
Huixtla, only 40 miles from Guatemala.
	   Little is known about the area in between.
	   ``This is a tragedy of enormous proportions,'' President Ernesto
Zedillo said after a helicopter tour of the area on Thursday.
	   The anchor of Mexico's most-watched television news program,
Guillermo Ortega, said from Chiapas on the Thursday night newscast
that the disaster was the worst he had seen since the 1985 Mexico
City earthquake, which killed thousands of people.
	   Zedillo said bad weather and damaged roads were making it
``particularly difficult to reach those places we'd like to be _
the communities where the people are beginning to have, or already
have, a shortage of drinking water.''
	   He said more than 20 helicopters were to arrive in Chiapas by
Friday to help relief teams reach isolated areas.
	   Margarito Ordonez Pineda, coordinator at the Tonala office of
the health ministry, said 98 percent of the people in the region
live in the slice of land between the highway and the coast.
	   ``Everyone working here has relatives there. We're very
worried,'' he said. ``I'm 52 and I've never seen anything like
this. I've talked to older people and they haven't either.''

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Ruling party supporters fired guns,
threw rocks and swung clubs at vastly outnumbered opposition
protesters Friday as strongman Hun Sen shifted tactics to crush
growing calls for his ouster. At least one person was killed and
several wounded.
	   The deployment of plainclothes supporters instead of riot police
to attack the opposition came a day after King Norodom Sihanouk
appealed to the army and police to stop shooting and beating
peaceful protesters and Buddhist monks.
	   The week-long violence, the worst since Hun Sen deposed Prince
Norodom Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody coup last year,
stems from disputes over Hun Sen's official victory in July 26
parliamentary elections. The oppostion rejects the results,
alleging massive fraud.
	   About 2,000 backers of Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's
Party, some carrying bamboo canes of the same type wielded by riot
police and carrying guns, gathered near the Angkor-style
Independence Monument.
	   ``We are looking for the losers,'' said one, Chan Lay, 42, who
reeked of alcohol. He carried a club and a pistol protruded from
his shirt. ``They are the trouble-makers for us and for the CPP.''
	   They set out toward the gathering point of 300 rival opposition
protesters about six blocks away near the U.S. Embassy and
Ranariddh's home. The opposition, warned of the advance of their
rivals, started to move from the area.
	   Turning onto a side street, they were confronted by six security
guards from a seedy hotel who opened fire with pistols. At least
three men were taken to a clinic with gunshot wounds to their legs.
	   Opposition backers holed up overnight at a school pelted the
pro-Hun Sen marchers with rocks as they passed.
	   The two groups finally clashed on a side street, which erupted
into a battleground of rock-throwing. Gunfire erupted from the Hun
Sen crowd. The opposition supporters tried to flee on motorbikes
and on foot down the narrow, pot-holed streets.
	   Human-rights workers confirmed that one opposition supporter
trying to flee was chased down, beaten, shot in the back and
killed. The victim was pronounced dead at a hospital. A pool of
blood and his hat remained at the site.
	   A young boy shot in the leg refused to get into an ambulance to
take him to the capital's main Calmette hospital, seen as a bastion
of Hun Sen support. None of the other wounded were taken to
Calmette, either.
	   It is widely believed that the body of a Buddhist monk
reportedly slain in a brutal police charge Wednesday and taken by
the ambulance never arrived at the hospital.
	   Many monks, who are generally respected by Cambodians, have been
beaten and wounded by gunfire in the protests. Rumors that several
have been killed have intensified anger at Hun Sen.
	   Riot police who have acted as Hun Sen's shock troops since he
launched a crackdown against weeks of peaceful protest against his
rule Monday deployed only after the blood-letting and made no move
to keep the two sides apart.
	   ``Police have been ordered not to intervene, just to protect
certain places,'' said government spokesman Khieu Kanharith. ``We
have only ordered the ambulances to be ready.''
	   The pro-Hun Sen group carried signs _ on bamboo staves quickly
turned into clubs _ praising his formerly communist Cambodian
People's Party. Members wore rubber bands on their wrists to
distinguish themselves from the oppostion in a melee.
	   They hunted down opposition supporters up through the central
market, where shops were closed. Sullen onlookers made no move to
join the pro-Hun Sen crowd, a marked contrast to thousands who
spontaneously joined a peaceful opposition march Thursday.
	   CPP organizers directed their men with police-style
walkie-talkies and mobile phones. Bullhorns blared slogans: ``Long
live Hun Sen! Down with the losers of the July 26 elections!''
	   The pro-Hun Sen crowd gathered later in a park outside the Royal
Palace. There were given bread and water by police, who stood
nearby and showed no sign of dispersing them.
	   Ranariddh, leader of the opposition along with ally Sam Rainsy,
issued a statement denouncing the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations for refusing to condemn the human-rights violations. ASEAN
has endorsed the July elections and urged both sides to accept the
results.

First meeting of Antarctic Treaty ministers will be on ice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The first meeting of ministers
from the 27-nation Antarctic Treaty will be convened in Antactica
in January, New Zealand organizers said Friday.
	   The treaty was signed in 1959 and came into force in 1961, but
this is the first time the annual meeting will be attended by
government ministers.
	   The ministers' meeting on the frozen continent is the result of
an offer by then New Zealand prime minister Jim Bolger in 1997, and
will take place from Jan. 24-28, 1999.
	   New Zealand's junior Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Upton, who
will host the meeting, said the Treaty faced new pressures, in
particular increasing scientific and tourism activity in
Antarctica.
	   Officials were going to need political direction and
encouragement if the treaty system is to cope with the demands of
the new millennium, he said.
	   One example of the challenges facing the continent is pressure
to develop tourism infrastructure such as an airstrip on the Ross
Shelf to ``fly planeloads of visitors down to stay in hotels,''
said Stuart Prior, the head of New Zealand's Antarctic policy unit.
	   At the meeting, ministers would be allowed only one official to
accompany them. All participants would be based at New Zealand's
Scott Base or the U.S. station, McMurdo, Upton said.
	   Transport on the ice would be provided by the New Zealand and
U.S. Antarctic programs, with help from the Italian program.
	   Ministers would be shown various aspects of the Antarctic
environment, including scientific presentations and examples of
international collaboration.
	   Consultative parties to the treaty are Argentina, Australia,
Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Ecuador, Finland, France,
Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Peru, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, United
Kingdom, United States and Uruguay.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Japan has granted the Philippines 13
loans totaling 120.7 billion yen (dlrs 898 million) for development
projects, the Philippine Department of Finance said Friday.
	   The package of loans is the Philippines' 22nd from Japan, and
brings the total amount of official development assistance loans
from that country to 1.57 trillion yen (dlrs 11.7 billion). The
Philippines received 124.3 billion yen (dlrs 925 million) in its
previous loan package.
	   The new loans, which come from Japan's Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund, cover projects in areas such as transportation,
environment, agriculture, food supply, poverty alleviation and
human resources development.
	   A Philippine economic mission is in Japan to seek more
investment and explain the economic policies of the administration
of President Joseph Estrada.
	   The economic mission is headed by Foreign Affairs Secretary
Domingo Siazon and includes Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu,
Trade Secretary Jose Pardo and central bank Governor Gabriel
Singson.

Mitsubishi group firms to link up in investment-trust market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, details; ADDS background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and the three other
leading finance companies of the Mitsubishi group will jointly form
an investment trust company, officials said Friday.
	   Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Japan's largest lender, will link up with
Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp., Meiji Life Insurance Co. and
Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co.
	   The alliance is intended to strengthen the four companies ahead
of increased competition as Japan's ``Big Bang'' deregulation
measures lower the barriers dividing banking, insurance and
securities brokerage.
	   It will also step up the pressure on competitors to restructure
and pursue similar deals.
	   Company executives announcing the alliance stressed that all
four members are already the leading companies in their sectors.
	   ``We can survive by ourselves,'' said Kokei Higuchi, president
of Tokio Marine &AMP; Fire. ``But this alliance is aimed at helping
each other.''
	   The group plans to set up the jointly owned investment-trust
company in December, and also cooperate in pension and investment
banking businesses.
	   But bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi President Satoru Kishi said that
the companies will continue to compete with each other in asset
management, derivatives and insurance.
	   The four said they will also consider tie-ups with domestic
financial companies outside the Mitsubishi group, as well as
foreign institutions, though nothing specific has been decided.
	   Earlier this year, U.S. financial giant Travelers Group Inc.
replaced Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi as the largest shareholder of
Nikko Securities, but Kishi said Travelers is not a possible
partner for a tie-up with the four Mitsubishi financial services
companies.
	   The alliance can be regarded as a step forward for the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, as it will reinforce the bank's investment trust
and pension businesses, said Katsuhito Sasajima, a Nikko Research
Center analyst.
	   A full entry into investment banking operations, including stock
brokering, should be the bank's next step, he said.

Singapore Airlines prepared for zero growth if necessary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo planned

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The national carrier, Singapore Airlines, is
prepared for zero growth over the next two or three years to get
through the economic crisis, a company official said Friday.
	   The airline is deferring deliveries of at least 11 new aircraft
during the next two years, deputy chairman Cheong Choong Kong, said
in a speech introducing new products and services for the company's
Megatop 747, Celestar A340 and Jubilee 777 aircraft.
	   ``We are redeploying our aircraft from the troubled Asian arena
to the less tumultuous European and Australasian routes,'' Cheong
said.
	   While the government-controlled airline's profits ``will be
eroded considerably, it is highly unlikely, as of now, that it will
end the financial year with a loss,'' he said.
	   The launch of the new products and services, developed at a cost
of 500 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 288 million), is part of the
long-term strategy to get through economic turbulence that ``may
last two or three years or even longer,'' he said.
	   Another part of the strategy is ``accepting a much lower growth
rate than is characteristic of Singapore Airlines, and being
prepared even to bring the rate down to zero if necessary.''
	   He said a large number of employees have voluntarily foregone
raises this year, but gave no specifics.
	   The commitment to the product launch was made more than two
years ago, before the economic crisis hit, and had to be completed
so that Singapore Airlines can continue to compete with American
and European companies, which keep improving their products, Cheong
said.
	   The new services and products involve improvements in all three
of its classes, new food on the menus, and a new luxurious first
class check-in area at Changi Airport.
	   ``Our strategies ... are directed at the long term, and this
won't change,'' Cheong said. ``We aim to become a global group of
airlines and airline-related companies.''
	   If it confines itself to Singapore, with its shortage of
resources and rising cost of doing business, Singapore Airlines
would suffer a steady decline in rate of return on investment, he
said.
	   Singapore Airlines is interested in opportunities in places such
as Thailand and South Africa, after entering into alliances with
Ansett, Air New Zealand and Lufthansa during the past year. Last
month, Singapore Airlines signed an agreement to form a strategic
alliance with China Airlines.

Nine injured in emergency jetliner landing in Shanghai

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Nine passengers were injured when a
Chinese jetliner taking off from Shanghai for Beijing made an
emergency landing without its front landing gear, an airport
official and state media said Friday.
	   The China Eastern Airlines plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11, had
137 passengers aboard when it returned to Hongqiao International
Airport shortly after 11 p.m. on Thursday, the official said.
	   Film footage of the incident broadcast Friday on the national
television news showed the aircraft, with its front landing gear
retracted, sliding along the runway in a shower of sparks.
	   None of the passengers was seriously injured, according to the
official, who would not give his name.
	   The incident is under investigation, according to an official of
the Civil Aviation Administration of China in Beijing who gave his
name as Mr. Liu. He would not say whether any foreigners were
involved and would not give any other information.
	   China Eastern declined comment.
	   The report by China Central Television showed passengers sliding
down emergency chutes and airport firefighters pumping foam on the
airplane. Airport employees handed out bandages to passengers who
suffered scrapes and friction burns leaving the plane.
	   ``The crew did their best and we all were calm,'' an
unidentified woman who had been aboard the plane told CCTV.
	   City leaders including Mayor Xu Kuangdi and Huang Ju, Shanghai
secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, went to the airport to
comfort the passengers, the Wen Hui Bao newspaper reported.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Supreme Court has upheld a
death penalty given to an ethnic Shan heroin smuggler from
neighboring Myanmar, the Bangkok Post reported Friday.
	   Le Hin, also known as Lao Loe Promchaivut, was arrested along
with three other drug dealers in the northern city of Chaing Rai in
1992 for smuggling 18 kilograms (39.6 pounds) of heroin.
	   Chiang Rai is close to the border of Shan State in Myanmar, also
known as Burma. Myanmar is the world's second largest producer of
opium, the raw material for heroin.
	   The Shans are an ethnic group closely related to the Thais.
Along with the ethnic Wa, they are the prime producers of opium and
heroin in Myanmar.

Democracy activists try to register opposition party in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Democracy activists trying to register an
opposition political party in a Chinese province said Friday that
officials gave them reason to hope they might succeed.
	   Dissidents have been trying to register the China Democracy
Party with the government since U.S. President Bill Clinton visited
China in June. Police in eastern Zhejiang province rounded up 12
democracy campaigners connected to the group in July.
	   But Xie Wanjun and Liu Lianjun said in a statement that
officials of the Civil Affairs Ministry in Shandong province have
been more encouraging, according to accounts from human rights
groups. On Thursday the officials told the dissidents their
application would be granted if it met all national laws.
	   The Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China reported that one official showed the
Shandong dissidents a memo saying the government was considering
their application.
	   If approved, it would be the first time that the ruling
Communist Party has allowed an opposition party to be formed since
coming to power 49 years ago.
	   ``We cautiously appreciate the positive gesture made by the
Chinese government towards the long expected relaxation of the
taboo on free association in the People's Republic of China,'' the
Washington-based Free China Movement Network said in a statement.
	   Instead of summarily dismissing the application, the government
officials told the activists what additional information was
needed, including a statement about the necessity of organizing
such a group, the Free China Movement Network said.
	   In their initial application, the Shandong activists stated the
China Democracy Party did not intend to challenge the leadership
position of the Communist Party.
	   Beijing has long allowed a small number of minor parties, but
they have no power and play a minor supportive role.

Thai police arrest 32 teenagers at disco after drug tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police have arrested 32 teenagers
and the owner of a popular discotheque after administering urine
tests in a drug raid, local papers reported Friday.
	   A team of 120 anti-narcotics police swooped down on the Sparks
discotheque where more than 400 people were partying on Thursday
night, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   The 32 teenagers were being held after testing positive for
various drugs, while the disco owner was being held for operating
after hours, the paper said.
	   Discotheque and night club raids by Bangkok police have become
common, particularly since the emergence of amphetamines and
ecstasy as popular drugs.
	   The police force patrons to take urine tests during the raids.
Occasionally, well-known actresses and socialites have been among
those arrested for testing positive for drug use.
	   Thai police have never been known, however, to arrest the
leaders of the gangs who distribute the drugs, some of whom,
academics and law enforcement officials have said, are prominent
businessmen and members of parliament.

Prince says ASEAN ignoring human-rights violations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Cambodia

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh blasted neighboring countries Friday for failing to
denounce strongman Hun Sen's use of riot police and mobs to kill
and beat protesters and monks in a bid to retain power.
	   Ranariddh expressed disappointment that the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations portrayed the violence in Phnom Penh's
streets as a contest between equals. The organization urged both
sides Wednesday to ``exercise restraint, avoid violence, including
extremist acts.''
	   In a press statement, Ranariddh noted that opposition
demonstrators who have contested Hun Sen's official victory in July
26 parliamentary elections had done so peacefully and that Hun Sen
unleashed riot police against them this week.
	   ``Most of the violence has come from the Phnom Penh authorities,
which after negotiating a continuation of the peaceful
demonstrations decided to crack down, killing and wounding Buddhist
monks, students and other people,'' Ranariddh said.
	   As the statement was issued, a crowd of highly organized
plainclothes supporters of Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's
Party attacked a far smaller crowd of opposition backers with
clubs, guns and rocks. At least one person was killed and several
wounded.
	   ASEAN had been a prime mover behind the recent elections, which
the opposition claims Hun Sen won by fraud. The vote was seen as
necessary to restore international legitimacy and aid lost after
Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody coup
last year.
	   ASEAN postponed Cambodia's membership after the coup and is keen
to bring in the country as its 10th member to promote regional
stability.
	   The organization had noted that international observers had
ruled the elections sufficiently free and fair. But critics have
said that the observers did not take into account pre-election
intimidation and gave rosy reports well before the long counting
process ended.
	   ASEAN encouraged all Cambodians to accept the election results.
	   ``The international community may well recognize the elections
as free and fair, but the majority of the people of Cambodia do
not,'' the prince responded.
	   ``This has been largely demonstrated in the increasing number of
our compatriots who have risked their lives to protest against this
mockery of democracy which the international community continues to
encourage in Cambodia,'' the prince said.
	   Ranariddh noted that Hun Sen had barred opposition leaders,
including himself, from leaving the country. The prince's chief
ally, Sam Rainsy, is threatened with arrest and has taken refuge in
the local U.N. offices.
	   ``I am truly disappointed that ASEAN's statement did not contain
a single word about the human rights of the people of Cambodia,
which are being grossly violated on a daily basis by the Hun Sen
regime,'' Ranariddh said.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party accused Hun Sen of paying armed thugs to
carry out ``a reign of terror'' Friday in the streets of Phnom Penh
and said the crisis ``is the creation and responsibility of the
regime alone.''

Toyota ups stake in major insurance company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Toyota Motor Corp. announced Friday it will raise
its stake in Chiyoda Fire and Marine Insurance Co. in an effort to
provide cheaper insurance to customers buying Toyota cars.
	   Toyota will boost its stake in Chiyoda Fire and Marine to around
47 percent from 37.1 percent through a third-party new share issue
of about 10 billion yen (dlrs 746 million).
	   In announcing the increase, Toyota said in a statement that by
strengthening the ties it hopes to build a global system to provide
integrated auto financing and insurance services.
	   The move is also seen strengthening the financial condition of
Chiyoda Fire and Marine as deregulation is intensifying competition
in the insurance sector.

China's export growth continues slowdown in August
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's export growth continued to slow in
August, although it registered a trade surplus of dlrs 31.3 billion
in the first eight months of the year, according to customs figures
released on state television Friday.
	   A worsening in the Asian economic situation caused exports to
drop 1.4 percent from July, while imports fell 0.3 percent from
July, the broadcast said, without providing specific figures.
	   In the first eight months of the year, China's exports rose 5.5
percent to dlrs 118.65 billion, while imports inched up 0.4 percent
to dlrs 87.26 billion, the report said.
	   Total trade volume grew 3.3 percent to dlrs 205.91 billion.
	   China's export growth has slowed significantly from a record
growth of 21 percent in 1997. Exports to Japan, South Korea and
Southeast Asian countries all have dropped.
	   No further details were provided in the brief report.
	   According to forecasts from the State Information Center, a
government research group, China's exports are expected to continue
to slow throughout this year, rising 3.1 percent in the third
quarter. Meanwhile imports are predicted to grow 2.5 percent in the
same period, the center said.

Ousted deputy heads to controversial locales
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister on Friday made the first of his visits to risky locales to
launch his nationwide reform campaign.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, sacked as deputy and finance minister last week
on charges of sexual misconduct, attended afternoon prayers at a
mosque in Kampong Baru. The Malay enclave was the flashpoint of
deadly racial riots in 1969, one of the worst scars on Malaysian
history.
	   He was scheduled Saturday to visit several villages in northern
Malaysia, the same villages where Anwar led demonstrations for poor
farmers during his radical student days. One of those protests led
to Anwar's arrest under the Internal Security Act in 1974 and 22
months in jail.
	   A close aide to Anwar, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Friday his strategy was to reach out to conservative Muslims
frustrated by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's ``secularized
Islam,'' and attacks against conservative Muslims.
	   Malaysia, which is predominantly Muslim, has maintained a degree
of separation between mosque and state. Though 60 percent of the
population are indigenous Malays, the other 40 percent are ethnic
Chinese and Indians, most of whom are Buddhists, Christians and
Hindus.
	   Mahathir sacked Anwar last week, saying that he had conducted
his own investigation and determined that his handpicked successor
was immoral and unfit to lead.
	   Mahathir Thursday said the police were still investigating the
charges laid out in a book, entitled, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar
Shouldn't be PM.''
	   ``I'm quite sure when they have sufficient evidence, they will
charge him in court,'' the prime minister said.
	   Malaysia's top police chief said Thursday the probe into eight
sexual misconduct charges against Anwar had reached its final
stages and criminal charges could soon be filed.
	   Anwar has vehemently denied the charges, saying they were
trumped up to sap his growing challenge to Mahathir's 17-year rule.
Thousands of supporters have gathered at his house each night to
listen to his charismatic claims of innocence and demands for
political reforms.
	   Mashar, a student at a local university who has virtually camped
out at Anwar's residence, said many were prepared to face arrest on
his behalf.
	   ``While there's no justice, we'll fight on,'' said Mashar, who
asked that his full name not be used. ``If Anwar is arrested under
ISA, we have planned for it. If he goes to prison, we will go with
him. We need to be brave.''

Reports: Nearly 100 arrested for thefts at Chinese book fair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Nearly 100 Chinese and foreign book lovers who
took their passion too far have been charged with shoplifting at a
book fair, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The literary crime wave took place over five days at the 7th
International Publishing Exhibition, which opened Aug. 28 in
Beijing, the Xinmin Evening News said.
	   Suspects include 16-year-old high school students, a Pole in his
60s and a Chinese government researcher charged with taking an art
book worth more than 1,000 yuan (dlrs 120), the newspaper said. The
most expensive book stolen cost nearly 3,000 yuan (dlrs 360).
	   The exhibition included publishers from China, Hong Kong and
foreign countries.

Families of missing US scuba divers hint they will sue tour
</HEADLINE>
operator &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ The families of two Americans who are
missing and presumed drowned after being left behind on a scuba
diving trip off Australia's east coast may sue the tour operator,
their lawyer said Friday.
	   ``It is very much in the forefront of my mind, and they will be
guided by me,'' said Rob Davis, the lawyer representing the
families at a coroner's inquest.
	   Thomas Lonergan, 33, and his wife Eileen, 28, from Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, were last seen on Jan. 25 when they went diving off the
boat Outer Edge at St. Crispin Reef, 45 miles (72 km) northeast of
Port Douglas in Queensland state.
	   Coroner Noel Nunan is investigating the Lonergans' fate. In a
preliminary finding in April, the coroner found the couple did not
fake their deaths or die in a murder-suicide, but were left behind
and drowned after the boat returned to shore.
	   Nunan Friday dismissed numerous reported sightings of the
Lonergans as flimsy evidence for claims that they may have faked
their own disappearance.
	   Geoffrey Houston, lawyer for one of Outer Edge's managers, asked
that witnesses who claimed to have seen the Loneragans after Jan.
25 be called to give evidence to the inquest.
	   More than 25 sightings of the couple have been reported, from
the tiny township of Noonamah in the Northern Territory to South
Australia state, the inquest heard.
	   But Nunan apparently agreed with Davis' suggestion that the
sightings were improbable.
	   ``In my opinion the suggestions (the Lonergans) faked their
disappearance is really far fetched,'' Nunan said, dismissing
Houston's application.
	   Outside the inquest, Thomas Lonergan's sister Nancy Lonergan
Weir, her husband Jim, and Eileen Lonergan's parents Johnnie and
Kathy Hains thanked everybody who was involved in the case,
including the coroner, police and reporters.
	   Jim Weir said the family would respect Nunan's findings when
they are made. But the families would comment directly on the
possibility of future civil legal action.
	   Lawyers for Outer Edge staff Friday sought to protect them from
possible future prosecution by claiming legal privilege that
released them from having to testify to the inquest.
	   The inquest was adjourned until Oct. 1, when it is scheduled to
reconvene on board the Outer Edge and travel to St Crispin's Reef.

Indonesian military withdraws more troops from troubled province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The military has pulled out hundreds
troops who had put down a recent riot in Indonesia's northernmost
province of Aceh, an armed forces spokesman said Friday.
	   In all, six companies, or about 600 soldiers were dispatched to
North Aceh province on Sumatra island, when rioting broke out there
last month, said Capt. Situmorang, a spokesman of the Bukit Barisan
Military Command.
	   They included 300 elite soldiers from the Jakarta-based army
strategic command.
	   The withdrawal leaves two battalions, or about 1,400 troops,
based the province, Situmorang said.
	   The military decided last month to withdraw combat troops from
the region, about 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of
Jakarta. The first batch was pulled out on Aug. 20.
	   Rioting broke out on Aug. 31 and Sept. 1 when other troops were
withdrawn. The 600 reinforcements were sent in to quell the
violence, in which two people were killed.
	   Aceh has been wracked by civil unrest and human rights abuses
since the late 1980s when thousands of combat troops were
dispatched to put down a separatist rebellion by Islamic activists.
	   Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission estimates that the
eight-year military operation claimed at least 781 lives.
	   Recently the commission unearth dozens of skeletons from mass
graves that local people say contain the remains of civilians
killed by troops.
	   Aceh is one of three Indonesian provinces where separatist
rebels are fighting for independence. The other two are former
Portuguese colony of East Timor and Irian Jaya, the western half of
New Guinea.

Estrada says government, Marcos family still far from settlement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government and the
family of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos are still far from an
agreement on the sharing of dlrs 540 million from Marcos' Swiss
bank accounts, President Joseph Estrada says.
	   Estrada also said victims of human rights abuses under Marcos
should receive more than 30 percent of the bank deposits as
compensation.
	   Administration officials say they favor an out-of-court
settlement with the Marcoses because years of legal battles to
recover their alleged ill-gotten wealth have yielded little.
	   Marcos' eldest daughter, Imee Marcos-Manotoc, who is now a
member of the House of Representatives, has also expressed
eagerness for her family to negotiate and ``cooperate in any way
just to settle the whole issue.''
	   But Estrada told the Manila Overseas Press Club late Thursday
that the two sides ``are not that close yet'' to an agreement.
	   He said an offer by Marcos' widow, Imelda, to pay dlrs 150
million to the human rights victims was too small.
	   Mrs. Marcos said she was making the offer ``out of compassion,
not guilt.''
	   The Swiss deposits, frozen since 1986, have recently been
transferred to an escrow account in a Philippine bank.
	   The government says the money is part of billions of dollars of
ill-gotten wealth Marcos allegedly amassed during his 20-year
administration.
	   The money from the Swiss accounts is also being claimed by 9,539
Filipinos who won a class action suit in a Hawaii court against the
Marcos estate for torture, summary executions and disappearances of
political dissidents during his strongman rule.
	   The Swiss Federal Supreme Court has ruled that the money can be
released to the Philippine government if it wins a conviction
against Mrs. Marcos in connection with the funds and if the Marcos
victims are compensated. An out-of-court settlement with the
Marcoses could also free the funds.
	   Marcos was toppled in a popular revolt in February 1986. He fled
into exile in Hawaii where he died three years later.
	   He has denied any wrongdoing during his 20-year administration.

Report:Sailor shoots eight crew members on Russian submarine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A sailor on a Russian navy submarine shot and
killed at least five crewmen and wounded several others before
barricading himself in the vessel, the Interfax news agency
reported Friday.
	   The incident happened overnight on an unidentified submarine in
the navy base at Severomorsk near the northern city of Murmansk,
the report said. Five sailors were killed and three wounded in the
attack, it said.
	   Navy officials in Moscow said they could not confirm the report.
	   The sailor was on guard duty when he took a machine gun and
attacked other members of the crew, the report said. Senior navy
officers were heading talks with the sailor, who had barricaded
himself inside the submarine, it said.
	   There has been a rash of mass killings in the Russian armed
forces, which are plagued by brutal living conditions. The military
is chronically short of money because of the country's economic
problems and hazing of servicemen is a major problem.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Two top Hamas fugitives were killed
before dawn Friday in a confrontation with Israeli soldiers and
Israel clamped a closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip to prevent
possible revenge attacks by the Islamic militant group.
	   The dead men were identified as brothers Imad and Adel
Awadallah, leading figures in the Hamas military wing, Izzedine al
Qassam, Israeli radio reports said.

Clinton crisis leaves some Asians worried about the future
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Like many other Asians, Japanese housewife Ayako
Sugi doesn't really understand the Clinton scandal. Given the
problems her own country faces, she hasn't had time to follow it.
	   But she does know one thing: she is worried about what could
happen to the world, and its ballooning economic crisis, if the
leader of its only superpower is impeached.
	   ``It's a personal matter. So long as he can do the job right,
that's OK,'' Mrs. Sugi, 47, said at first, when asked about the
accusations that U.S. President Bill Clinton now faces. ``I don't
know if he should resign. Things are going well in the America.''
	   But after glancing over at the friend she was shopping with in
downtown Tokyo on Friday, Mrs. Sugi said:
	   ``I don't want a world recession. And that could happen if he
does get impeached, given how bad things are already.''
	   From Singapore to Australia, the latest developments in the
Clinton crisis produced headlines Friday such as ``U.S. President
Desperate,'' ``Weakened U.S.,'' and ``Presidency in Crisis.''
	   Like news accounts in Europe and the Middle East, there was a
sense of disbelief that Clinton's sexual relations with Monica
Lewinsky, and attempts to cover them up, should have so weakened
what many regard as a politically successful president.
	   ``There is no doubt that a weakened presidency, its energy to
deal with global issues sapped, is bad news for the world,'' said
an editorial in Singapore's Straits Times newspaper.
	   It said the many problems the world faces include increased
terrorist attacks against the United States, North Korea's recent
firing of a ballistic missile over Japan, Iraq's lack of
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors, and Iran's mobilization
of troops along the Afghanistan border.
	   The Straits Times also carried a front-page story about how U.S.
stocks had fallen sharply as fresh fears over Clinton's future
rocked an already jittery world market.
	   In Australia, Clinton's troubles knocked that country's national
election campaign right off the front pages of newspapers, and were
the lead item of television and radio bulletins.
	   ``Two dark vans that drove (Kenneth Starr's report) to the
Capitol were akin to hearses arriving to take away the corpse of
the Clinton presidency,'' said a news analysis in The Sydney
Morning Herald written by its Washington correspondent.
	   In Taiwan, newspapers included front-page stories about the
scandal and photographs of the tons of Starr investigation
documents being transferred to the U.S. Congress on Thursday.
	   In fact, such coverage pushed stories about the heated debate
between President Lee Teng-hui and Taiwan's lawmakers over land
rezoning to the back pages of newspapers.
	   However, in other countries where Asia's year-old economic
crisis has set off political, social and business upheaval the
media all but ignored Washington's turbulence.
	   In Malaysia, papers focused on the government's own sex scandal
involving its sacked deputy prime minister, and frantic
preparations for the opening ceremonies of the 16th Commonwealth
Games in Kuala Lumpur on Friday night.
	   In South Korea media gave more attention to bickering between
rival politicians at home.
	   And in Indonesia, many people questioned in downtown Jakarta
said they were unaware of the Washington scandal, which their
newspapers mostly ignored on Friday.
	   Instead, people said they are preoccupied with soaring food
prices and violence being caused by Indonesia's worst economic
crisis in 30 years.
	   Riots sparked by the crisis forced longtime Indonesian President
Suharto out of office in May, and new protests are now threatening
his successor, President B.J. Habibie.

Philippine stocks fall to nearly seven-year low; index down 1.6

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks plunged again
Friday, with the main index dropping 1.6 percent to a nearly
seven-year low as Wall Street's steep overnight fall dragged down
Asian markets, traders said.
	   The Philippine market now joins the ranks of Asia's worst
performing bourses, said Edgar Bancod, senior analyst for Paribas
Asia Equity Securities Philippines Inc.
	   ``We have underperformed everybody else in Asia, except
Indonesia, China and Pakistan,'' he said.
	   Preliminary data showed the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index fell 17.99 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,082.18, its lowest
closing level in nearly seven years. The last time the index
finished below that level was on Nov. 7, 1991, at 1,056.91.
	   On Thursday the index lost 57.26 points, or 4.9 percent.
	   Blue-chip stocks once again dominated Friday's selldown. Traders
said the departure of foreign investors triggered a heavy sell-off
suffered by index heavyweight stocks.
	   ``We're now touching the core holdings of foreign funds,'' said
Francisco Liboro, research head of PCCI Securities Brokers Corp.
	   ``The threshold for the PSE Index is 1,000 points. The trend is
still downward,'' he said.
	   Bancod said foreign fund managers are no longer as upbeat about
the country's economic prospects, convinced that the Philippines
will join the rest of the region in a recession.
	   ``If you look at the numbers, it's true we're headed for a
recession _ but we're still a whole lot better than anywhere else''
in the region, he said.
	   Traders said investors were too preoccupied with unloading
holdings to pay much attention to market rumors of corporate
takeovers that could have sparked buying in some blue chips.
	   ``Those investors still in the market are just playing musical
chairs by transferring funds from one stock to another,'' said Ian
Kane, trader for Anscor-Hagedorn Securities.
	   In currency trading, the peso strengthened against the dollar,
buoyed by slight gains in the yen and weak demand for the U.S.
currency, traders said.
	   At midday the dollar averaged 43.776 pesos, down from Thursday's
average of 43.935 pesos.
	   Traders said most banks and commercial clients were staying in
the sidelines and holding off substantial dollar purchases until
the peso-dollar rate stabilizes.
	   The Central Bank held its overnight borrowing and lending rates
at 16 percent and 18 percent respectively.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Acting on an urgent request from Iran, the
Security Council condemned the slayings of nine Iranian diplomats
in Afghanistan and called for a speedy investigation to bring the
perpetrators to justice.
	   The United Nations, along with Iran and Pakistan, is considering
a fact-finding mission into the deaths _ a move welcomed by the
council, council president Hans Dahlgren of Sweden said after an
emergency briefing on the matter.
	   Iran had asked the council to convene an urgent meeting on what
it said was a war crime committed by Afghanistan's Taliban leaders.
	   The slayings display ``contempt by Taliban not only for the
recognized norms and principles of international law but also for
the very basic rules of human decency,'' Iran's ambassador, Hadi
Nejad-Hosseinian, said in a letter to the Security Council
president.
	   Eleven Iranian diplomats vanished from the northern Afghan city
of Mazar-e-Sharif after the Taliban religious militia seized the
city from rival forces on Aug. 8.
	   After denying any involvement in the disappearances for a month,
the Taliban claimed responsibility for the deaths of nine of the 11
in a letter Thursday from the supreme leader, Mullah Omar, to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The Taliban, ``while expressing sadness, announces that the nine
Iranian workers who entered Mazar-e-Sharif during the war, either
intentionally or unintentionally, have been killed by unidentified
soldiers,'' of the Taliban, the letter from Mullah Omar said. He
stressed that the soldiers acted on their own.
	   There was no word on the fate of two other diplomats.
	   Though the Taliban has no representation at the United Nations,
Mullah Omar called for the world body to resolve the issue, saying
Iran was interfering in Afghanistan's internal matters by backing
the opposition. He warned that the Taliban wouldn't be responsible
for the consequences if it failed to do so.
	   Iran has recently stepped up military activities on the Afghan
border in what United States and other experts have said could be a
prelude to a military retaliation.
	   Last week, Iran conducted a massive exercise, with 70,000
troops, warplanes and tanks, on the border. Earlier Thursday,
Iran's army chief said new maneuvers would be held on the border.
He did not say when the new exercises would start.
	   The Taliban militia has vowed to respond to any Iranian military
strike.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament prepared to resolve one crisis
Friday by confirming a compromise figure _ Yevgeny Primakov _ as
prime minister, clearing the way for the government to tackle its
second crisis, the ruined economy.
	   Primakov, the long-time foreign minister, was expected to win
swift and resounding approval Friday from the lower house of
parliament, the State Duma, even though he has little economic
experience. He met Friday morning with leaders of the Duma parties
and called on all political factions to work together to fix the
country's economic problems.
	   ``I am for consolidation of all political forces and
mobilization of all efforts in order to come out of the crisis and
preserve Russia as a strong state,'' he was quoted as saying by the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Primakov said that Communist deputy Yuri Maslyukov, a Soviet-era
economic official, would be first deputy prime minister for
economic affairs, Duma deputies said. Maslyukov is a technocrat who
until recently was trade and industry minister.

Disputed island off Haiti claimed by U.S. for bird droppings
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Mountains of bird droppings
glistening on the rocks caught Captain Peter Duncan's eye.
Inspired, he claimed the stony outcrop off Haiti for the United
States.
	   That was 141 years ago, when ``guano,'' as the droppings are
politely called, was a popular fertilizer. Guano mining has
stopped, but a low-level dispute has simmered ever since.
	   Now, the quest for biodiversity has made the uninhabited island
of Navassa, declared by U.S. scientists to be ``a marvel of
biological treasures,'' fashionable again.
	   An expedition, organized by the Center for Marine Conservation
in Washington, last month announced the discovery of unique animal
and plant species on the two-square-mile (5-square-kilometer)
island.
	   That sparked a response from Haiti, which has claimed the ``Isle
de Navase,'' 40 miles (65 kilometers) off its southwestern
peninsula, since its independence from France in 1804.
	   Prominent Haitian scientists immediately formed the Navassa
Island Defense Group. ``Navassa island belongs to Haiti. It is only
fair that Haitian scientists be included in discovery
expeditions,'' said oceanographer Ernst Wilson, a group member.
	   The scientists plan an expedition this month to the island.
Haiti's Ministry of Environment also announced an expedition.
	   Haitian sensibilities were further injured by reports that
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt had warned that the U.S. Coast
Guard would shoot at any boats approaching the island.
	   Babbitt actually said that as a joke during a news conference in
Washington, where the discoveries were announced. His lighthearted
threat was aimed at possible U.S. ecotourists or divers eager to
explore Navassa's flourishing Coral Reefs.
	   Christopher Columbus discovered the island in 1504. But interest
came after phosphate- and nitrate-rich bird droppings were prized
as fertilizer and used to make gunpowder in the 19th century.
	   In 1856, Congress passed the U.S. Guano Act, which allowed any
uninhabited, guano-rich island to be claimed as a U.S. territory.
Captain Duncan did just that a year later, during the reign of
Emperor Faustin Soulouque.
	   He sent an expedition to Navassa in 1858 to inform the
guano-mining company that he objected to the U.S. claim. Haiti sent
an official protest to Washington, which supported the U.S.
company.
	   In 1956, a resolution proposing that Haiti's claim to Navassa be
respected was presented to the U.S. Congress.
	   That went nowhere, but Haiti was undeterred. In 1989, the former
military government dispatched radio amateurs there in an army
helicopter. They planted a Haitian flag in the ground and erected a
pillar asserting Haitian sovereignty. Then, for a couple of hours,
they broadcast messages from ``Radio Free Navassa.''
	   On Sept. 8, the Navassa Island Defense Group wrote to U.S.
Ambassador Timothy Michel Carney, inquiring on what grounds the
United States claimed Navassa.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. scientists plan more visits to the disputed
island. Their two-week expedition last month, the first by
scientists in three decades, yielded the discovery of 250 animal
and plants species.
	   They found 15 endemic species, including two lizards, Cyclura
nigerrima and Leicocephlus erimitus, previously thought to be
extinct.
	   ``We never dreamed that on a single visit the team would so
greatly increase our knowledge of the number of species,'' said
Roger McManus, president of the center. ``Uninhabited islands like
Navassa are the very best chance we have to understand and protect
the diversity of life in the Caribbean.''

Two Hamas fugitives killed in confrontation with Israeli troops

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Two Palestinians killed in a shootout
with Israeli troops were identified Friday as top Hamas fugitives
and Israel sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip to prevent
possible revenge attacks.
	   Palestinian sources and Israeli radio reports said the slain
Palestinians were brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, leading figures
in the Hamas military wing, Izzedine al Qassam.
	   The army confirmed the deaths, but would not give the names.
	   There was concern that Hamas would avenge the deaths. In 1996,
when a Hamas bombmaker was killed in an operation widely attributed
to Israel, Hamas responded with a series of suicide bombings.
	   The army clamped a strict closure on the West Bank and Gaza,
barring more than 2.4 million Palestinians from entering Israel.
	   The new tensions came as U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was in
the region, trying to close the gaps between Israel and the
Palestinians on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   The Awadallah brothers were killed Thursday afternoon in a house
near the village of Taibeh, west of the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   A Palestinian witness said that at about 4 p.m. Thursady, a
truck and four vans carrying dozens of people in civilian clothes
drove up to the house. The witness, Shokali Fetaftah, said that
after about 10 minutes he heard shots and Israeli army jeeps and
ambulances arrived.
	   The army said a confrontation broke out between Israeli forces
and the two men after shots and an explosion were heard in the
house. The army said it found weapons in the hideout.
	   Israel radio said the Awadallah brothers were believed to be
preparing an attack in Israel when they were killed.
	   Imad Awadallah escaped from a Palestinian jail last month. He
had been held on suspicion that he killed a fellow Hamas fugitive,
Mohiyedine Sharif, in a fight over power and money.

Britain: Suu Kyi not citizen as Myanmar renews deportation threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The British embassy in Yangon denied
allegations in Myanmar's state-run press that opposition leader
Aung San Suu Kyi is a British citizen, while military-run
newspapers on Friday renewed threats to deport the Nobel laureate.
	   Since Sunday, the military has arrested more than 300 of members
of Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for Democracy, to
prevent it from convening the parliament elected in 1990.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in that assembly. Nearly 200
elected lawmakers are among those who have been arrested.
	   Despite promising before the polls to hand over power to the
winners, the military refused to honor the result after its rule
was overwhelmingly rejected by Myanmar citizens.
	   Leading generals have also recently stepped up their verbal
attacks against the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, who is married
to a British academic, calling her a traitor for her attempts to
bring democracy to the country.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military
since 1962.
	   Earlier in the week, a commentary in the state-run New Light of
Myanmar signed ``Supreme Court Justice'' said that Suu Kyi is a
British citizen and so the government should deport her.
	   Suu Kyi is the daughter of Myanmar's late independence hero,
Gen. Aung San. A 1982 law makes dual citizenship in Myanmar
illegal.
	   On Friday, commentaries in the military-controlled press urged
Suu Kyi to go back to Britain before the government takes legal
action and deports her.
	   ``In response to recent media speculation, the British
government would like to make clear that Aung San Suu Kyi is not,
and never has been, a British citizen,'' a statement from the
embassy said on Friday.
	   Earlier this week, the U.S. government issued a statement
condemning the threat to deport Suu Kyi and the arrest of her party
members.
	   The governments of Britain, France, West Germany and Japan have
also condemned the arrests, as have human rights groups Amnesty
International and Human Rights Watch Asia.
	   On Friday, groups representing three of Myanmar's ethnic groups
added their condemnations for the arrests and their support for the
convening of parliament.
	   The Wa National Organization, the Palaung State Liberation Front
and the Lahu Democratic Front said the arrest were an ``insulting
act of shameless, barbaric arrogance against the people of Burma.''
	   The NLD has said that representatives of the Chin, Rakhine and
Mon ethnic groups were among those arrested in the latest
crackdown, while the All Burma Students Democratic Front said more
than 900 democracy activists have been arrested since May.
	   Discontent with the regime is widespread because of its handling
of the economy. Military bungling has turned resource-rich Myanmar
into one of the world's poorest nations.
	   Defense spending accounts for more than half the government
budget, while inflation is running at more than 60 percent, rice is
in short supply, foreign investment has dried up and power
blackouts are a daily occurrence in Yangon.

Doubles partners Hingis and Novotna set for Open semis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Already in one U.S. Open final together, Martina
Hingis and Jana Novotna bid for berths in another today, this time
against each other.
	   Hingis, the Open's defending champion and No. 1 seed, faced her
doubles partner in a singles semifinal after teaming with Novotna
to defeat Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs 6-2, 6-2 in the semifinals
of the women's doubles.
	   No. 2 seed Lindsay Davenport faced No. 5 Venus Williams in the
other semifinal, an intriguing matchup of two of the biggest
hitters on the women's tour.
	   Just as intriguing was the pairing of Novotna and Hingis,
partners one day, rivals the next.
	   Novotna was not surprised.
	   ``I think when we got together, that's what you have to
expect,'' she said. ``If player No. 1 and No. 2 in the world get
together in doubles, you have to expect that you will have to meet
at maybe every single tournament, play against each other.
	   ``So that's something you have to learn how to separate. I think
that you have to learn how to deal with the pressure when you are
playing singles and then just to be able to go out there and play
doubles and enjoy it.''
	   The last time they played against each other was at Wimbledon,
when Novotna defeated Hingis in semifinals on the way to her first
Grand Slam title. That championship changed perceptions about
Novotna, so often a tough-luck loser in previous Slams.
	   ``It gives you confidence,'' she said, ``not only for the next
couple of weeks, but it gives you confidence for life.''
	   Conversely, that loss and another suffered against Monica Seles
in the semifinals of the French Open, left Hingis shaken.
	   She won three of ther four Grand Slam tournaments a year ago,
but struggled this season and arrived at the Open with fresh
resolve.
	   ``I have the feeling I'm getting better again, so that gives me
a lot of confidence,'' she said after defeating Seles in the
quarterfinals. Now she has some getting even to do with Novotna.
	   ``Against Jana, I feel pretty good,'' she said. ``I want that
revenge back.''
	   The Davenport-Williams match could be held in a basketball
court. Both are over 6 feet and rely on power tennis.
	   Amanda Coetzer, beaten by Davenport in the quarterfinals, was
suitably impressed.
	   ``I mean, not so much the size, but the way she hits the ball is
intimidating,'' Coetzer said. ``She hits it really hard and deep.
Points are over pretty quickly. You often feel like you don't
really have a say in what's going to happen at the end of the
point. She's gained a lot of confidence.''
	   So has Williams.
	   She made it to the final here a year ago before losing to Hingis
and has demonstrated a more rounded game this year, often
abandoning the baseline to come to the net for important points.
	   ``I think that I'm more wiser,'' she said. ``I think I make more
intelligent decisions. I'm able to really fight out there.
	   ``A different player.''
	   Davenport had a 4-1 lifetime edge on Williams and arrived at the
Open as the hottest player on the women's tour. After reaching the
semifinals at the French Open and quarterfinals at Wimbledon, she
won three hardcourt warmups in California, beating Hingis and
Williams in two of the finals. She had a string of 14 straight
victories before losing in the semifinals at New Haven to Steffi
Graf.
	   ``I feel I've done everything I can up to this point to try and
win this tournament,'' said Davenport, who has never reached the
final of a Grand Slam event. ``I'm going to give it my best shot.''
	   And she knew going in that she would be playing on Sunday, no
matter what happened today. That's because, like Hingis and
Novotna, she made it to the women's doubles final with partner
Natasha Zvereva, 6-2, 6-4 over Virginia Ruano Pascual and Paola
Suarez.

Campese going for gold, Canadian going for Lomu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ David Campese is doing it for gold
and the Fijian rugby players feel a special duty to their
medal-starved nation. But Canada's Frederick Asselin is like
Captain Ahab: he's only concentrating on the ``whale.''
	   The whale is Jonah Lomu, who picked up the nickname from his New
Zealand teammates after shooting to prominence at the 1995 World
Cup when he steamrolled England en route to four tries in their
semifinal.
	   Lomu has endured a lean season as the All Blacks slumped to five
consecutive losses in tests, their worst run in history. He was in
and out of the starting lineup and has yet to return to the form he
had before a long period sidelined with a kidney illness.
	   But Lomu, teammate Christian Cullen, Australia's Campese and
Fiji's Waisale Serevi are the undoubted stars as rugby sevens makes
its games debut Saturday.
	   Asselin is on another level. Canada is ranked 23rd in the world
for rugby sevens and 12th going into the tournament. Under the
draw, altered to six groups of three following the late withdrawals
of Zimbabwe and Gambia, Canada is not certain to face New Zealand.
	   But that's what Asselin, 1.85 meters and 83 kg to Lomu's 1.98
and 118 kg, is hoping for.
	   ``I'd definitely be pretty nervous about playing New Zealand,''
Asselin said. ``But if we get to play them I'll either be one of
the few rugby players in the world who got run over by Lomu or
brought him down. I want the chance.''
	   New Zealand has an easy first-round draw in a group with Sri
Lanka and Malaysia, but Asselin might get his chance when the draw
is reseeded for Sunday's competiton, and maybe in the finals
Sunday.
	   Lomu and Asselin are wingers, and the master of their trade is
Campese. He holds the world record for test tries and has been
undergoing a drawn-out exit from international rugby, playing his
last tests in 1996.
	   Campese, who is going for a stint as Singapore coach after the
games, says this will be his last appearance in national colors and
he wants a medal to match his gold jersey.
	   ``This is my last time playing for Australia, so I want these
other guys in the team to really take it on,'' Campese said of his
inexperienced team.
	   ``They're the future and they have to have the confidence and
ability to go forward.''
	   Australia's test players were not allowed to play in the sevens
competition here because they face World Cup qualifying games later
this month.
	   One of their qualifying opponents is Fiji, but that country is
the sevens world champion and has never let the concerns of the
15-a-side game get in the way of sevens success.
	   Fiji has only two gold medals in its Commonwealth Games history,
and Serevi, as famous as golfer Vijay Singh at home only a lot more
popular, knows the pressure on his team.
	   ``The team has a duty to take back the gold,'' said Serevi. ``We
are treating this event as something special.''

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Two Palestinians killed in a shootout
with Israeli troops were identified Friday as top Hamas fugitives
and Israel sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip to prevent
possible revenge attacks.
	   Palestinian sources and Israeli radio reports said the slain
Palestinians were brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, leading figures
in the Hamas military wing, Izzedine al Qassam.
	   The army confirmed the deaths, but would not give the names.
	   There was concern that Hamas would avenge the deaths. In 1996,
when a Hamas bombmaker was killed in an operation widely attributed
to Israel, Hamas responded with a series of suicide bombings.
	   The army closed the West Bank and Gaza, barring more than 2.4
million Palestinians from entering Israel.
	   The new tensions came as U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was in
the region, trying to close the gaps between Israel and the
Palestinians on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   The Awadallah brothers were killed Thursday afternoon in a house
near the village of Taibeh, west of the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   A Palestinian witness said that at about 4 p.m. Thursday, a
truck and four vans carrying dozens of people in civilian clothes
drove up to the house. The witness, Shokali Fetaftah, said that
after about 10 minutes he heard shots and Israeli army jeeps and
ambulances arrived.
	   The army said a confrontation broke out between Israeli forces
and the two men after shots and an explosion were heard in the
house. The army said it found weapons in the hideout.
	   Israel radio said the Awadallah brothers were believed to be
preparing an attack in Israel when they were killed.
	   Imad Awadallah escaped from a Palestinian jail last month. He
had been held on suspicion that he killed a fellow Hamas fugitive,
Mohiyedine Sharif, in a fight over power and money.

Japan's economy shrinks for third straight quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Battered by declining consumer spending at home and
a worsening financial crisis abroad, Japan's economy shrank for a
third straight quarter, the Economic Planning Agency said Friday.
	   Japan's gross domestic product _ the measure of all goods and
services produced in the country _ declined by 0.8 percent between
April and June from the previous quarter, the EPA said.
	   It was the first time since 1955 that the Japanese economy had
marked three consecutive quarters of decline.
	   Friday's figures showed the economy contracting at an annual
rate of 3.3 percent, the EPA said. The economy contracted by 1.3
percent in the January-March quarter.
	   If the trend persists, this would become Japan's second
consecutive year of negative growth. Last year, the economy shrank
0.7 percent, its first annual decline since 1974.
	   The numbers confirmed that Asia's economic powerhouse remains
mired in a stubborn recession from which the EPA held out little
hope for a quick recovery.
	   While the GDP figures came out after the close of trading,
mounting pessimism about the outlook for the economy helped drive
Tokyo stocks down sharply.
	   Japan's economy is still struggling to shake off the effects of
a plunge in land prices in the early 1990s, which buried the
country's banks under a mountain of failed or risky loans.
	   As banks set aside money to cover their losses, they've cut back
on new lending. The resulting cash crunch has sparked a wave of
bankruptcies and forced businesses to curtail spending on research
and new factories.
	   But the biggest drag on the economy has been a sharp fall in
individual consumption, say economists.
	   The first blow came with an ill-timed increase in the national
sales tax last year, just as the economy was showing signs of
recovering. Then, the Asia crisis and a series of high-profile
corporate failures further dampened consumer sentiment.
	   A monthly report by Japan's central bank released earlier in the
day Friday said income tax cuts this summer have failed to boost
consumer spending, and consumers remain gloomy about the prospects
for the future.
	   ``Japan's economic conditions continue to deteriorate,'' the
report said.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of troops and police were
stationed around central Jakarta Friday as the military chief
promised to crackdown on student protests against Indonesian
President B.J. Habibie and his handling of the country's worst
economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Also on Friday police broke up 70 protesters outside the U.S.
Embassy and the Defense Ministry who demanded independence for the
Indonesian-controlled western half of New Guinea.
	   Officers were armed with sticks, but there was no violence.
	   Nearby, squads of soldiers and several armored vehicles were
positioned inside the grounds of the state palace following days of
protests against soaring food prices.
	   Dozens of troops were also stationed in an adjacent park where a
noisy demonstration took place Thursday.
	   Soldiers stood guard in its center, the site of Indonesia's
National Monument tower. Others relaxed under shade trees.
	   Several strategic buildings, including the Parliament, were also
guarded.
	   Armed Forces commander Gen. Wiranto said the military ``will not
hesitate to take stern action against actions that clearly lead to
unrest across this nation,'' he was quoted as saying by the
official Antara news agency.
	   He said the military would not allow the interests of 202
million Indonesians to be endangered by a minority of protesters.
	   Wiranto said he had been told by journalists that some
protesters have been paid to disrupt government efforts to fix the
ailing economy.
	   Discontent with Habibie's crisis-bound presidency has been
mounting. Looting and riots fueled by climbing food prices have hit
several areas in recent weeks.
	   On Monday, students marched on Parliament and tore down the
gates of the Parliament after they demanded that Habibie lower
prices or quit.
	   Troops and police used sticks, shields and tear gas to evict
them from its grounds on Tuesday.
	   On Wednesday a visit by Habibie to Indonesia's second-largest
city, Surabaya, was marred when 4,000 students and opposition
supporters protested and clashed with security forces.
	   Habibie, has reportedly made light of the Surabaya protest, the
biggest since he took office.
	   ``The people massing there wanted to shake hands with me. They
did not want to demonstrate, but wanted to shake hands,'' the
newspaper Kompas quoted him as saying.
	   Habibie has repeatedly called on Indonesians hurt by the crisis
to exercise patience while he implements reforms mandated under an
	   International Monetary Fund economic rescue plan.
	   Friday's protest was the latest in a series by people from the
province of Irian Jaya, formerly Dutch New Guinea, which was
annexed by Indonesia in 1963.
	   Calls for self-determination for the province and other troubled
parts of Indonesia, including the former Portuguese colony of East
Timor, have mounted since the resignation in May of former
autocratic President Suharto.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Two Palestinians killed in a shootout
with Israeli troops were identified Friday as top Hamas fugitives
and Israel sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip to prevent
possible revenge attacks.
	   Palestinian sources and Israeli radio reports said the slain
Palestinians were brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, leading figures
in the Hamas military wing, Izzedine al Qassam.
	   The army confirmed the deaths, but would not give the names.
	   Hamas officials said they would avenge their deaths.
	   ``We can be certain that Israel will pay a high price for this
crime,'' Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar told The Associated Press,
``The mood in the Palestinian street supports revenge especially
after the continuation of Israeli policy against our people.''
	   In 1996, when a Hamas bomb maker was killed in an operation
widely attributed to Israel, Hamas responded with a series of
suicide bombings.
	   The army clamped a strict closure on the West Bank and Gaza,
barring more than 2.4 million Palestinians from entering Israel.
	   The new tensions came as U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was in
the region, trying to close the gaps between Israel and the
Palestinians on a West Bank troop withdrawal.

near the village of Taibeh, west of the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   A Palestinian witness said that at about 4 p.m. Thursday, a

Japanese stock prices close sharply lower, U.S. dollar falls

prices

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices took their biggest plunge of
the year Friday, shedding more than five percent amid concerns over
Wall Street's steep decline and Japan's domestic economic woes. The
U.S. dollar tumbled against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average plummeted 749.05 points, or
5.12 percent, closing at 13,916.98. It was the largest single-day
point fall this year, and the close was just above the Nikkei's
12-year closing low of 13,915.63 set on Aug. 28.
	   Friday's fall in the main index, which had declined 89.51
points, or 0.61 percent, on Thursday, was sparked by the overnight
rout in New York which renewed concerns over the global economy,
traders said.
	   In New York Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled
249.48 points to 7,615.54, its sixth-worst point loss, amid
earnings worries and fears that U.S. President Bill Clinton may be
forced to resign or be impeached.
	   Tokyo investors were also concerned by the plunge in stock
prices across Latin America, traders said. The Brazilian market
Thursday posted its steepest fall in one session since 1990, with
the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange's Bovespa Index losing 15.8 percent.
	   ``The Tokyo market is being affected by the fall in stock
markets around the world,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at
Nikko Securities Co.
	   Adding to the nation's economic malaise, Japan's central bank
said in its monthly report, released Friday, that economic
conditions continue to deteriorate. The report said that weak
consumption is pushing down wholesale prices.
	   Some selling early in the session was related to Friday's
settlement of September futures and options, traders said. Stock
prices can swing wildly as large investors adjust or eliminate
their futures and options positions.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 38.43 points, or 3.46 percent, to 1,071.48.
The TOPIX closed down 6.10 points, or 0.55 percent, the previous
day.
	   In foreign exchange trading, concerns over the U.S. economy and
Clinton's escalating problems weighed heavily on the dollar,
traders said.
	   The dollar bought 131.22 yen in mid-afternoon trading, down 4.48
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo also below its late New York level
of 134.23 yen overnight.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.805 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.840 percent,
driving its price up to 114.53 yen from 114.27 yen.

Doubles partners Hingis and Novotna set for Open semis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS to correct day
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Already in one U.S. Open final together, Martina
Hingis and Jana Novotna bid for berths in another on Thursday, this
time against each other.
	   Hingis, the Open's defending champion and No. 1 seed, faced her
doubles partner in a singles semifinal after teaming with Novotna
to defeat Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs 6-2, 6-2 in the semifinals
of the women's doubles.
	   No. 2 seed Lindsay Davenport faced No. 5 Venus Williams in the
other semifinal, an intriguing matchup of two of the biggest
hitters on the women's tour.
	   Just as intriguing was the pairing of Novotna and Hingis,
partners one day, rivals the next.
	   Novotna was not surprised.
	   ``I think when we got together, that's what you have to
expect,'' she said. ``If player No. 1 and No. 2 in the world get
together in doubles, you have to expect that you will have to meet
at maybe every single tournament, play against each other.
	   ``So that's something you have to learn how to separate. I think
that you have to learn how to deal with the pressure when you are
playing singles and then just to be able to go out there and play
doubles and enjoy it.''
	   The last time they played against each other was at Wimbledon,
when Novotna defeated Hingis in semifinals on the way to her first
Grand Slam title. That championship changed perceptions about
Novotna, so often a tough-luck loser in previous Slams.
	   ``It gives you confidence,'' she said, ``not only for the next
couple of weeks, but it gives you confidence for life.''
	   Conversely, that loss and another suffered against Monica Seles
in the semifinals of the French Open, left Hingis shaken.
	   She won three of ther four Grand Slam tournaments a year ago,
but struggled this season and arrived at the Open with fresh
resolve.
	   ``I have the feeling I'm getting better again, so that gives me
a lot of confidence,'' she said after defeating Seles in the
quarterfinals. Now she has some getting even to do with Novotna.
	   ``Against Jana, I feel pretty good,'' she said. ``I want that
revenge back.''
	   The Davenport-Williams match could be held in a basketball
court. Both are over 6 feet and rely on power tennis.
	   Amanda Coetzer, beaten by Davenport in the quarterfinals, was
suitably impressed.
	   ``I mean, not so much the size, but the way she hits the ball is
intimidating,'' Coetzer said. ``She hits it really hard and deep.
Points are over pretty quickly. You often feel like you don't
really have a say in what's going to happen at the end of the
point. She's gained a lot of confidence.''
	   So has Williams.
	   She made it to the final here a year ago before losing to Hingis
and has demonstrated a more rounded game this year, often
abandoning the baseline to come to the net for important points.
	   ``I think that I'm more wiser,'' she said. ``I think I make more
intelligent decisions. I'm able to really fight out there.
	   ``A different player.''
	   Davenport had a 4-1 lifetime edge on Williams and arrived at the
Open as the hottest player on the women's tour. After reaching the
semifinals at the French Open and quarterfinals at Wimbledon, she
won three hardcourt warmups in California, beating Hingis and
Williams in two of the finals. She had a string of 14 straight
victories before losing in the semifinals at New Haven to Steffi
Graf.
	   ``I feel I've done everything I can up to this point to try and
win this tournament,'' said Davenport, who has never reached the
final of a Grand Slam event. ``I'm going to give it my best shot.''
	   And she knew going in that she would be playing on Sunday, no
matter what happened Thursday. That's because, like Hingis and
Novotna, she made it to the women's doubles final with partner
Natasha Zvereva, 6-2, 6-4 over Virginia Ruano Pascual and Paola
Suarez.

Mirnyi can thank father for success
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Max Mirnyi can thank his father for a pair of
Grand Slam mixed-doubles titles.
	   The senior Mirnyi was matchmaker for his son and Serena
Williams. Together, they won the U.S. Open on Thursday, beating
1996 champions Lisa Raymond and Patrick Galbraith 6-2, 6-2.
	   Williams and Mirnyi also won the Wimbledon title together.
	   If it wasn't for dad, however, Mirnyi would still be searching
for a title.
	   ``I'm too shy a guy to come up and speak to Serena,'' Max said.
``He did that part for me at Wimbledon. Before the deadline
sign-in, he came up to Serena and asked if she wants to play. I was
definitely ready for that so it was a matter of her saying yes.''
	   The victory completed a sister slam for the Williams family.
Older sister Venus Williams and Justin Gimelstob won the Australian
and French Opens' mixed-doubles crowns, beating Serena and Luis
Lobo in Paris.
	   ``It was very exciting for the Williams family,'' Serena said.
``Even though she beat me in the finals of the French, that's OK.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SWEEP THE OTHER WAY: &LR;  Natasha Zvereva and Lindsay Davenport are
on the verge of a unique Grand Slam they don't want to have _
losing in the doubles finals at all four of the major tournaments.
	   Zvereva and Davenport made the final of the U.S. Open, beating
Virginia Ruano-Pascal and Poala Surez on Thursday.
	   In Sunday's championship match, they meet Martina Hingis and
Jana Novotna, who beat them at the French Open and Wimbledon
finals.
	   Hingis is seeking her own doubles slam, She won the Australian
Open doubles with Mirjana Lucic over Zvereva and Davenport.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; PRACTICE PARTNERS: &LR;  Justin Gimelstob will get some experienced
help in preparation for his Davis Cup debut. He will go to Jim
Courier's house in Orlando, Fla., and practice with him before
heading to Milwaukee for the semifinal against Italy.
	   ``We've been friends ever since we've been on the tour,''
Gimelstob said. ``This will be pretty intense one-on-one practice.
We'll practice for about a week, a week and a half before we go to
Milwaukee.''
	   Gimelstob, Courier, Todd Martin and Jan-Michael Gambill were
named to the Davis Cup team by Tom Gullikson. It will be the first
Davis Cup for Gambill as well, with two rookies pressed into
service when Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi and Michael Chang begged
off.
	   ``In terms of Jan-Michael and I, obviously we wouldn't be the
picks if the other guys were available _ Sampras, Agassi and
Chang,'' Gimelstob said. ``But they think _ hopefully _ we've shown
talent and we have the ability to lead the next group of kids. I
think we deserve the chance.''

Report: Sailor shoots eight crew members on Russian submarine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with type of submarine, new details throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A sailor on a Russian nuclear submarine shot and
killed at least five crewmen and wounded several others before
barricading himself in the vessel, officials said Friday.
	   The incident happened overnight in the navy base at Severomorsk
near the northern city of Murmansk. Five sailors were killed and
three wounded in the attack, according to Russian news reports.
	   Navy officials in Moscow said the submarine was of the Bars
class, a nuclear-powered fleet submarine normally armed with
nuclear cruise missiles and torpedoes. There were no missiles on
the submarine because it was in port, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   The commander of the Russian navy, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, flew
to the port to handle the situation, officials said.
	   There were conflicting reports on how the incident started. The
sailor was in detention on disciplinary charges when he seized a
machine gun from a guard and attacked other members of the crew,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   There has been a rash of mass killings in the Russian armed
forces, which are plagued by brutal living conditions. The military
is chronically short of money because of the country's economic
problems and hazing of servicemen is a major problem.

Korean President to make emotional state visit to Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Kim Dae-jung will visit
Japan next month to forge a ``new, future-oriented'' partnership
with his country's former colonial ruler, his office announced
Friday.
	   The Oct. 7-10 visit ``will provide a precious opportunity to lay
the foundation for a new, future-oriented friendly partnership with
Japan,'' chief presidential spokesman Park Jie-won said.
	   Kim and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi will adopt a ``joint
declaration for a new partnership between South Korea and Japan
toward the 21st century,'' a document outlining the common goals
the two countries will pursue, Park said.
	   The foreign ministers of the two countries will adopt a separate
action plan to implement the declaration, he said.
	   A Foreign Ministry official, speaking only on condition of
anonymity, said the joint declaration would also contain a Japanese
apology for mistreatment of Koreans during 35 years of colonial
rule.
	   Kim also will pay a courtesy call on Emperor Akihito, address
the Japanese parliament and appeal to business leaders for their
investment and cooperation to help South Korea overcome its
economic difficulty, the spokesman said.
	   The visit comes amid mounting concern over North Korea's recent
firing of what was believed to be a ballistic missile over Japan.
North Korea claims that the Aug. 31 firing was the launch of a
scientific satellite.
	   South Korean government officials said privately that the
North's perceived new security threat would likely be discussed in
the Kim-Obuchi meeting and other lower-level consultations.
	   Relations between Japan and South Korea flourish in almost all
areas but many South Koreans still hold bitter memories of
atrocities committed by Japan during its colonial rule of 1910-45.
	   During the colonial period, Koreans were barred from speaking
their own language and forced to use Japanese names. During World
War II, hundreds of thousands of Koreans were forced into labor or
sexual slavery for the Japanese military.
	   Japan has apologized several times in the past, but many South
Koreans feel that all fell short of displaying true remorse.
	   South Korea displayed a subtle but meaningful change in attitude
toward Japan in announcing Kim's trip, using, for the first time,
the title of emperor in referring to to Akihito.
	   Although South Korea uses the title in its official documents,
its politicians, officials and civic leaders have uniformly avoided
it as a reminder of the past.

England, Malaysia stay unbeaten in men's team badminton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ England, a long-time Commonwealth
Games badminton power, stayed unbeaten Friday in preliminary rounds
of men's team competition, yelding only seven points in winning
five matches against Fiji.
	   In four other 5-0 victories, Scotland overpowered the Maldives,
India beat Sri Lanka, New Zealand downed Brunei and Mauritius
defeated Ghana.
	   In the day's only close contest, Australia edged to a 3-2
victory over Wales when Peter Blackburn and David Bamford defeated
Richard Vaughn and John Leung 15-5, 15-7 in the final doubles.
	   Host Malaysia, England's traditional Commonwealth badminton
rival, did not play Friday. It meets Canada Saturday to decide
which of the two will advance to the four-team medal round from
Group A.
	   England edged Malaysia for the team gold medal in the last games
in 1994, but that was under the old format with men and women on
the same team. This time, men's and women's teams are playing
separately.
	   England still must beat Australia to advance from Group C but,
unlike the Australians, the English had no trouble in their contest
with Wales, winning 5-0.
	   The other likely showdowns to advance will be between India and
Scotland in Group B and between New Zealand and South Africa in
Group D.
	   The medal round starts Sunday.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with pro-Hun Sen crowd drinking, reportedly paid.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Ruling party supporters fired guns,
threw rocks and swung clubs at vastly outnumbered opposition
protesters Friday as strongman Hun Sen turned to plainclothes mobs
to crush growing calls for his ouster. At least one person was
killed and several wounded.
	   The use of a crowds in street clothes _ many of whom appeared to
be police and soldiers _ instead of uniformed police signaled a
change in tactics by Hun Sen, and came a day after King Norodom
Sihanouk appealed to the army and police to stop shooting and
beating peaceful protesters and Buddhist monks.
	   The week-long violence, the worst since Hun Sen deposed Prince
Norodom Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody coup last year,
stems from disputes over Hun Sen's official victory in July 26
parliamentary elections. The oppostion rejects the results,
alleging massive fraud.
	   Some 2,000 backers of Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party,
carrying bamboo canes of the type wielded by riot police and
carrying guns, gathered near the Independence Monument.
	   ``We are looking for the losers. They are trouble-makers,'' said
Chan Lay, 42, who reeked of alcohol. He carried a club, and a
pistol protruded from his shirt.
	   The crowd headed toward a gathering of 300 opposition protesters
about six blocks away near the U.S. Embassy and Ranariddh's home.
Warned of the advance, the opposition started to move from the
area.
	   Turning onto a side street, the opposition protesters were
confronted by six security guards from a seedy hotel who opened
fire with pistols. At least three men were taken to a clinic with
gunshot wounds to their legs.
	   The two groups finally clashed on a side street, which erupted
into a rock-throwing battleground. Gunfire crackled from the Hun
Sen crowd. Opposition supporters fled on motorbikes and foot down
narrow, pot-holed streets.
	   Human-rights workers reported that one opposition supporter was
chased down, beaten, shot in the back and killed, bringing the
total of comfirmed deaths since Monday to four. A pool of blood and
his hat remained at the site.
	   Riot police who have acted as Hun Sen's shock troops since he
launched a crackdown Monday against weeks of peaceful protest
deployed on Friday only after the blood-letting. They gave the
pro-Hun Sen crowd _ some of whom were reportedly paid _ bread and
water.
	   ``Police have been ordered not to intervene, just to protect
certain places,'' said government spokesman Khieu Kanharith. ``We
have only ordered the ambulances to be ready.''
	   A boy shot in the leg refused to enter an ambulance to take him
to the capital's Calmette hospital, seen as a bastion of Hun Sen
support. No other wounded were taken to Calmette.
	   Belief is widespread that a Buddhist monk reportedly slain in a
police charge Wednesday and taken by the ambulance never reached
the hospital. Many monks have been beaten and wounded by gunfire in
the protests. Rumors that several have died has intensified public
anger.
	   The pro-Hun Sen group carried signs _ on bamboo staves quickly
turned into clubs _ praising his formerly communist Cambodian
People's Party. They wore rubber bands on their wrists to
distinguish themselves in a melee.
	   They hunted down opposition supporters through the central
market, where shops were closed. Sullen onlookers made no move to
join the pro-Hun Sen crowd, a contrast to thousands who joined a
peaceful opposition march Thursday.
	   CPP organizers directed their men with police-style
walkie-talkies and mobile phones. Bullhorns blared: ``Long live Hun
Sen! Down with the losers of the July 26 elections!''
	   Mok Ban, 40, held up a club as thick as his arm and said he
supported the opposition's right to protest, but not to create
tension.
	   ``That's why we have come to suppress them, to stop them from
disrupting people's businesses,'' Mok Ban said. ``Our patience is
running short.''
	   The opposition parties led by Ranariddh and his ally, Sam
Rainsy, accused Hun Sen of launching a ``reign of terror'' and
urged the international community to stop cooperating with him.

Bomb kills mayor of war-torn Sri Lankan town, 19 others
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A bomb explosion on Friday killed the
mayor of Sri Lanka's main Tamil city of Jaffna, and 19 others, in
an attack just four months after his predecessor was assassinated.
	   The military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
19 others were killed along with Mayor Ponnuthurai Sivapalan in the
attack. The dead including Brig. Susantha Mendis, who was in charge
of military operations in Jaffna, and the city's senior police
official, Superintendent Chandra Perera. Few other details were
immediately available.
	   Jaffna, in northwestern Sri Lanka, is the bombed out capital of
the Jaffna peninsula. The city has been controlled since 1990 by
the Tamil Tigers rebel group who for 15 years have fought the
government to establish their own nation on the peninsula.
	   Officials did not immediately say who they believed was behind
the attack.
	   Sivapalan had taken up the mayor's post after his predecessor
Sarojini Yogeswaran was shot and killed by two gunmen at her Jaffna
home on May 15. The previously unknown Sangilian Force claimed
responsibility for Yogeswaran's death, but the military says it is
a front group of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the main
rebel group in Sri Lanka's ethnic war.
	   Yogeswaran had been elected in the first vote in 15 years in
Jaffna, a once bustling cultural center transformed into a
bombed-out shell by the war.
	   Tamil Tiger rebels had seized the city in 1990 and proclaimed a
government for the more than 1 million people who live in northern
Sri Lanka, where Tamils predominate. Sri Lanka's army retook the
city in 1995 after a bitter 50-day offensive and had ruled there
until local elections were held in a bid to restore normalcy.
	   Rebels continue to attack Jaffna from surrounding jungles.
	   The rebels say Sri Lanka's Tamil minority can only prosper in an
independent own homeland in the north and east, separate from the
areas where the Sinhalese majority predominates. Many Tamils accuse
the Sinhalese of discrimination, though few support the extreme
solution proposed by the rebels.

Olympics minister promises clean water for 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney's water contamination problem
will be fixed well before the Sydney 2000 Games, Olympics Minister
Michael Knight said Friday.
	   ``It (water) needs to be right long before 2000,'' Knight said.
``It doesn't need to be fixed for the Olympics, it needs to be
fixed for the people who live here.''
	   More than three million people in Sydney have been forced to
boil their drinking water after three contaminated water alerts in
six weeks. There are some reports which suggest it may take up to
six months for the problem to clear up.
	   Latest test results showed Sydney's water was still contaminated
with the parasites Giardia and Cryptosporidium, despite new
measures to improve the quality of water at a filtration plant.
	   Knight said the good news for the IOC was that the problem had
occurred long before the Olympics and would be fixed well before
the event.
	   ``I think the IOC will understand in politics, you always back
self interest,'' he said.
	   ``It's certainly in the best interests of the (state) government
to fix this problem well before the next election (in 1999).''
	   In Kuala Lumpur at the Commonwealth Games, IOC president
Juan-Antonio Samaranch said he had been assured by Knight and
organizing committee chief executive Sandy Hollway that the water
problem would not affect the Games.
	   ``I am speaking with Mr. Knight and Mr. Hollway very regularly
and the last time we spoke was 10 days ago and . . . he told me
this problem would be solved in a very short time,'' Samaranch
said.
	   ``We are trusting 100 per cent the Sydney organizers and I am
sure that this problem would have been fixed before the Games.''
	   Samaranch said expected the water quality issue to be discussed
at the next IOC executive board meeting. (djp)

Thousands flood to mosque in support of ousted deputy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout with Anwar at mosque; CHANGES overline to

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Thousands of Muslims flooded a
mosque Friday shouting support for ousted deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim, who shouted back: ``If one Anwar falls, one thousand
others will rise up!''
	   Anwar, sacked as deputy and finance minister last week on
allegations of sexual misconduct, took another step in what he vows
will be a nationwide political reform campaign by attending prayers
at the mosque in Kampong Baru.
	   Some 10,000 people flooded the working-class Malay enclave _ the
flashpoint of deadly racial riots in 1969 _ to demonstrate support
for the banished minister.
	   When Anwar exited the mosque, the crowd erupted in chants of
``Allah Akbar!'' _ the Muslim rally cry meaning ``God is Great!'' _
punching their fists to the sky. Many had laid prayer mats on the
ground outside the tightly packed mosque.
	   Despite official warnings to keep politics out of the mosque,
supporters distributed anti-government pamphlets entitled,
``Justice For Anwar'' and vendors sold cassettes of Anwar's latest
speeches, in which he asserts his innocence and calls for political
reform.
	   ``Do I fear?'' Anwar shouted at the mob. ``No! I will fight on.
Use the police, use the judges, use the courts. I will never
surrender -- I will never surrender.''
	   The crowd shouted back: ``We will never surrender!''
	   Anwar, dressed in a prayer cap and blue prayer garment with a
sarong tied around his waist, yelled from the top of the mosque
steps as dozens of police quietly looked on.
	   Anwar was scheduled Saturday to visit several villages in
northern Malaysia, the same villages where he led demonstrations
for poor farmers during his radical student days.
	   One of those protests led to Anwar's arrest in 1974 and 22
months detained under the Internal Security Act, which allows for
arrest without trial if suspects are deemed a threat to national
security.
	   A close aide to Anwar, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Friday his strategy was to reach out to conservative Muslims
frustrated by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's ``secularized
Islam.''
	   Malaysia, which is predominantly Muslim, has maintained a degree
of separation between mosque and state. Though 60 percent of the
population are indigenous Malays, the other 40 percent are ethnic
Chinese and Indians, most of whom are Buddhists, Christians and
Hindus.
	   Mahathir sacked Anwar last week, saying that he had conducted
his own investigation and determined that his handpicked successor
was immoral and unfit to lead.
	   Mahathir on Thursday said the police were still investigating
the charges laid out in a book, entitled, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar
Shouldn't be PM.''
	   ``I'm quite sure when they have sufficient evidence, they will
charge him in court,'' the prime minister said.
	   Malaysia's top police chief said Thursday the probe into eight
sexual misconduct charges against Anwar had reached its final
stages and criminal charges could soon be filed.
	   Anwar has vehemently denied the charges, saying they were
trumped up to sap his growing challenge to Mahathir's 17-year rule.
Thousands of supporters have gathered at his house each night to
listen to his claims of innocence and demands for political
reforms.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is trimming its army by 100,000 soldiers
this year, or about 20 percent of the planned downsizing of a
half-million troops, the People's Daily reported Friday.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin pledged in September to reduce the
ranks of the People's Liberation Army by 500,000 people in three
years to about 2.5 million. The savings are to go to upgrading
weaponry and other defense systems.
	   Some soldiers took early retirement from the military early this
month, and others will retire by the end of the year, the report
said. Local governments are responsible for helping them find new
jobs, it added.
	   Earlier reports in the official press said some troops cut from
the PLA would be sent to a paramilitary force, the People's Armed
Police, confirming suspicions by Western defense analysts that the
overall strength of China's security forces will be little changed.
	   President Jiang Zemin, who is also chairman of the Central
Military Commission, has ordered the military to divest its vast
business interests and to crack down on army-sponsored smuggling.
	   The Supreme People's Court also is working on getting rid of its
businesses, People's Daily said in a separate report.
	   Court chief Xiao Yang was quoted as saying the court should
implement the central government's order to stop engaging in
business and shut down all court-related companies by the end of
the year.
	   An investigation of the court's business interests was recently
completed, the report said, without providing any details.
	   The Communist Party's newspaper said the process of closing down
businesses must be controlled so that property is not illegally
sold or transferred.

Taylor hopes for speedy resolution to bribes issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian captain Mark Taylor said he
will not judge Pakistani cricketers implicated in a match-fixing
scandal but wants the matter dealt with as quickly as possible.
	   An interim report by the Pakistan Cricket Board leaked to the
press on Wednesday found star players Wasim Akram, Salim Malik and
Ijaz Ahmed responsible for match-fixing.
	   It recommended they be banned from tests until further
investigations were concluded.
	   Taylor said Friday he felt they were isolated incidents but ones
the International Cricket Council (ICC) should ultimately deal
with.
	   The report also said betting on matches was widespread and
called for an intensive new inquiry, which may be run by a
different judge.
	   Australia tours Pakistan later this month, four years since
spinners Tim May and Shane Warne first alleged Malik tried to bribe
them to bowl poorly in the first test at Karachi.
	   Taylor might find himself lining up against the trio in the
first test at Rawalpindi on Oct. 1.
	   ``I don't really know, it's not up to me to pass judgment on the
cricketers or anyone involved,'' he said.
	   ``We have to make sure we're not too quick to judge people too
early. Don't forget Pakistan has had some of the greatest
cricketers in modern times.
	   ``I just hope that if something is going to be done it gets done
very quickly so that when we get over there we can get on with
playing the game.''
	   An earlier Pakistan inquiry in 1995 cleared Malik, saying the
Australians had concocted the allegation for reasons best known
only to them.
	   ``I didn't even know there was another hearing going on. I was
surprised to see it back in the headlines, and disappointed,''
Taylor said.
	   ``It means it's drumming up old business, old business that we'd
very much like to see not talked about and not go on in the game of
cricket.'' (djp)

Japan's economy shrinks for third straight quarter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with capital investment figure in 10th graf, consumer
spending in 14th graf; ADDS comments by EPA chief in 7th-8th grafs,
economist in 18th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Battered by declining consumer spending at home and
a worsening financial crisis abroad, Japan's economy shrank for a
third straight quarter, the Economic Planning Agency said Friday.
	   Japan's gross domestic product _ the measure of all goods and
services produced in the country _ declined by 0.8 percent between
April and June from the previous quarter, the EPA said.
	   It was the first time since 1955 that the Japanese economy has
marked three consecutive quarters of decline.
	   Friday's figures showed the economy contracting at an annual
rate of 3.3 percent, the EPA said. The economy contracted by 1.3
percent in the January-March quarter.
	   Last year, the economy shrank 0.7 percent, its first annual
decline since 1974.
	   The numbers confirmed that Asia's economic powerhouse remains
mired in a stubborn recession from which EPA head Taichi Sakaiya
held out little hope for a quick recovery.
	   ``The GDP reflects a very severe economic situation,'' Sakaiya
told a press conference.
	   Sakaiya said he didn't know when the economy would recover and
expects the GDP to remain weak in the July-September quarter.
	   While the GDP figures came out after the close of trading,
mounting pessimism about the outlook for the economy helped drive
the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average to its biggest plunge of the
year, down 749.05 points or 5.12 percent.
	   Friday's GDP figures showed a steep 5.5 percent drop in spending
by companies on new factories and equipment from the previous
quarter.
	   One reason, say economists, was a sharp drop in demand from
Japan's largest export market, Asia, which remains in the grips of
a lingering financial crisis.
	   Japanese companies have also had difficulty raising money to
finance new investments. The country's banks are still struggling
to shake off the effects of a plunge in land prices in the early
1990s that left them holding an estimated 76 trillion yen (dlrs 570
billion) in failed or risky loans.
	   As banks set aside money to cover their losses, they've cut back
on new lending.
	   Friday's figures also showed a 0.8 percent drop in personal
consumption, the single largest component of the economy.
	   Consumer spending has been on the skids since an ill-timed
increase in the national sales tax last year, just as the economy
was showing signs of recovery.
	   Making matters worse, the central bank has slashed interest
rates to all-time lows in an effort to revive growth. While the
move has failed to lift the economy, it has produced miserable
returns on pension funds and savings accounts.
	   That's caused mounting anxiety about how to provide for
retirement, leading many Japanese to squirrel away more of their
income and spend less.
	   ``In a world of uncertainty, individuals will save more than
they need to so not to be caught short,'' said Chris Calderwood,
chief economist in Tokyo for Jardine Fleming Securities (Asia) Ltd.
	   A belated income tax cut offered by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
in August has failed to spur consumption as pessimism about the
future is driving most Japanese to simply put the extra money in
the bank, the Bank of Japan found in a monthly report also released
Friday.
	   ``Japan's economic conditions continue to deteriorate,'' the
report said.

Democracy activists try to register opposition party in China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with dissidents also seeking to
register the China Democracy Party in Hubei.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Democracy activists trying to register an
opposition political party in a Chinese province said Friday that
officials gave them reason to hope they might succeed.
	   Dissidents have been trying to register the China Democracy
Party with the government since U.S. President Bill Clinton visited
China in June. Police in eastern Zhejiang province rounded up 12
democracy campaigners connected to the group in July.
	   But Xie Wanjun and Liu Lianjun said in a statement that
officials of the Civil Affairs Ministry in Shandong province on
Thursday were more encouraging, according to accounts from human
rights groups. Other activists tried to register the same party in
Hubei province on Friday and reported they were received in the
same courteous manner.
	   Officials in Shandong told the dissidents their application
would be granted if it met all national laws.
	   The Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China reported that one official showed the
Shandong dissidents a memo saying the government was considering
their application.
	   If approved, it would be the first time that the ruling
Communist Party has allowed an opposition party to be formed since
coming to power 49 years ago.
	   The Hong Kong rights group said officials in Hubei, just like
their counterparts in Shandong, met with the dissidents and
explained what conditions they needed to meet in order to qualify
for registration.
	   ``We cautiously appreciate the positive gesture made by the
Chinese government towards the long expected relaxation of the
taboo on free association in the People's Republic of China,'' the
Washington-based Free China Movement Network said in a statement.
	   Instead of summarily dismissing the application, the government
officials told the activists what additional information was
needed, including a statement about the necessity of organizing
such a group, the Free China Movement Network said.
	   In their initial application, the Shandong activists stated the
China Democracy Party did not intend to challenge the leadership
position of the Communist Party.
	   Beijing has long allowed a small number of minor parties, but
they have no power and play a minor supportive role.

Libya asks for 1 million Egyptian farmers to work irrigated land
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi wants 1
million Egyptians to farm land irrigated by a project known as the
Great Man-Made River, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said Friday.
	   The project was launched in 1984 to bring water from aquifers in
the Sahara desert in southern Libya through 3,800 kilometers (2,400
miles) of pipes to cities on the Mediterranean coast.
	   The water will be used to reclaim up to 2 million hectares (5
million acres) of desert land, although critics have warned that
the water reserves may be short-lived and that the cost _ as much
as dlrs 25 billion _ could have been better spent elsewhere.
	   The project is scheduled to be completed by 2001.
	   Libya, with a population of just 5 million, has long sought to
recruit Egyptian and Moroccan farmers to help farm the land.
Already 500,000 Egyptians work in oil-rich Libya.

Asian markets follow Wall Street's lead with another slump
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ignoring the good news about Russia, Asia's top
three stock markets fell sharply Friday, following the lead of
U.S., Latin American and European bourses instead.
	   Growing concerns about the future of American President Bill
Clinton also were blamed for the latest slump in the stock markets,
and another weakening of the U.S. dollar.
	   ``Unfortunately, what's good or bad for the U.S. is good or bad
for Asia'' and the rest of the world, said Eugene Chung, Asia
strategist at Warburg Dillon Read (HK) Ltd., in Hong Kong.
	   In Japan, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average plummeted 749.05
points, or 5.12 percent, to close at 13,916.98. It was the largest
one-day point fall this year. The finish also was just above the
Nikkei's 12-year closing low of 13,915.63 set on Aug. 28.
	   In another sign of turbulence, the dollar fell once again,
buying 131.22 yen in mid-afternoon trading, down 4.48 yen from late
Thursday in Tokyo. That figure also was below its late New York
level of 134.23 yen overnight.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index was down 249.11
points, or 3.2 percent, to 7600.85 by midday Friday. Traders said
the stock market was taking a breather from recent gains. However,
they also acknowledged that the sharp falls in the New York and
Tokyo bourses were hurting the sentiment in Hong Kong.
	   In Singapore, where the market has been battered by capital
controls recently imposed by neighboring Malaysia, shares opened
lower and by mid-afternoon the Straits Times Index was down 18.17
points, or 2.1 percent, to 846.83 points.
	   On Thursday, Boris Yeltsin named a compromise candidate for
prime minister, defusing a dangerous power struggle that had
stalled efforts to tackle Russia's economic crisis.
	   The ruble and the Russian stock market quickly rebounded, and
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov was expected to win swift and
resounding approval by parliament. But Asia's markets were far more
influenced Friday by the wave of anxiety that had swept through
Washington and world markets the day before.
	   On Thursday, news reports indicated that independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's referral to the U.S. Congress accuses Clinton of
perjury and obstruction of justice, and contains evidence that
prosecutors contend shows impeachable offenses.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average responded by
finishing the day 249.48 points, or 3.2 percent, lower at 7,615.54.
That was more than 1,700 points, or 18.4 percent, below the July 17
record that the Dow had set at 9,337.97.
	   Combined with Wednesday's 155-point loss, the drop more than
wiped out the record 380 points that the Dow gained on Tuesday amid
hopes the U.S. Federal Reserve may intervene in the battle against
global economic distress by lowering U.S. interest rates.
	   The day's world stock selloff was highlighted by two trading
halts in Brazil, where the main stock index plunged 15 percent.
	   And in Europe, Frankfurt's DAX index fell 5.8 percent, London's
FT-SE 100 dropped 3.3 percent, and the CAC-40 in Paris was down 4.6
percent.

Philippine students, police scuffle outside U.S. Embassy

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Police using tear gas and batons
scuffled outside the American embassy in Manila on Friday with
about 30 leftist students protesting a military agreement with the
United States.
	   Police dragged one of the protesters inside a waiting area at
the seaside embassy, which has been under tight security since the
bombings last month of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Nairobi.
	   The members of the League of Filipino Students were protesting
the Visiting Forces Agreement between the Manila and Washington,
which would allow a resumption of large-scale joint military
exercises in the Philippines.
	   Chanting ``VFA, go away'' and carrying placards saying ``Junk
VFA,'' the protesters occupied a portion of the sidewalk in front
of the embassy.
	   The police used truncheons and riot shields to shove them back
into the street.
	   As they scuffled, some of the protesters tried to hit the U.S.
government seal on the gate of the embassy with plastic bags filled
with red paint. The seal was splattered with red paint during a
similar protest by another student group the previous day.
	   One police officer said the league member who was seized would
be charged with throwing paint.
	   The U.S. military has always been a sensitive issue in this
former American colony.
	   The agreement, which was signed earlier this year by senior
officials but still requires the approval of the Philippine Senate,
would provide certain legal protections to U.S. soldiers while on
duty in the Philippines.
	   Critics say the pact would limit the Philippine government's
right to prosecute American soldiers who commit crimes in the
country, and would also promote prostitution and drag the
Philippines into conflicts between the United States and its
enemies.
	   The United States halted major joint exercises in the
Philippines and visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996,
when the Manila government ended a legal loophole that had shielded
U.S. soldiers from prosecution by the Philippines for crimes
committed here.

Indonesia opens up rice imports to private traders after protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-Protest

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Responding to strident student
protests, Indonesia on Friday announced that rice imports would be
opened up to private traders for the first time in 30 years to help
bring down soaring food prices.
	   In another development, Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib
said people convicted of hoarding rice and other goods could be
punished with death, news reports said.
	   ``Those who deliberately hoard, and those who deliberately
misuse the basic needs of the people will be punished harshly,'' he
was quoted by Republika newspaper as saying.
	   The decsion to liberlize rice imports was included in an
agreement between the government and the International Monetary
Fund, which is overseeing deep and painful reforms of Indonesia's
ailing economy.
	   The government also said it would increase supplies of cheap,
state-subsidized rice for the growing ranks of poor.
	   Value-added tax on rice and other commodities would also be
suspended to help cut costs for consumers struggling to cope as
inflation and unemployment rates skyrocket.
	   Until now rice imports were controlled by the government's food
distributing body, the National Logistics Agency, or Bulog.
	   Rice shortages and rising prices have become a major source of
discontent among Indonesia's 202 million people. Shortages of the
country's No. 1 staple have led to sporadic looting and riots
around the country. In some areas the price of rice has more than
trebled.
	   Ghalib said a 1959 law authorizes the state to use the death
penalty for those who disrupt the supply of food.
	   The problem is shaping up as a key political issue for Habibie
as he attempts to turn around Indonesia's ailing economy and
institute democratic reforms following the resignation of his
autocratic predecessor President Suharto last May.
	   In the agreement with the IMF, released Friday, the government
said its program to supply subsidized rice would be extended to 7.5
million families from 2 million now.
	   The government said domestic market prices for rice are
currently close to international prices.

Police arrest two Russians suspected of murdering five people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Police on Ukraine's Crimean peninsula
arrested two Russian citizens suspected of killing five people in
Russia and Ukraine, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Police said the five murders allegedly committed by the two
Russians, identified only as Igor V., 35, and Igor M., 29, shared a
common pattern, the daily Segodnya said.
	   The two would meet with a landlord in his apartment, which they
allegedly intended to rent, then stifle him with a rope and escape
after taking valuables.
	   Crimean police are also investigating the suspects' possible
involvement in a number of other thefts on the peninsula, Segodnya
reported.

Taliban claims seizure of seven new villages after opposition
</HEADLINE>
defects &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The ruling Taliban army on Friday
claimed it had seized seven villages, as well as arms and
ammunition, in central Afghanistan after an opposition commander
and his troops switched sides in the country's civil war, Kabul
radio reported. The northern-based opposition immediately denied
the claim.
	   According to the Taliban-controlled radio, the religious militia
advanced into villages in the districts of Kohmard and Saighon as
part of a fierce drive to take an opposition stronghold in the
Bamian province, roughly 125 kilometers (80 miles) west Kabul, the
Afghan capital.
	   However, Haji Mohammed Moahqaq, a top leader of the northern
alliance, denied that Taliban had seized the villages, or that his
side's troops had deserted to join the enemy.
	   Bamian is one of four provinces still held by an anti-Taliban
alliance led by ousted Afghan Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Masood.
The radio also said Taliban leader Mullah Omar has ordered his
troops to protect the lives of civilians in their three-pronged
drive to take Bamian, the main city in the province of the same
name.
	   The Taliban and its foes routinely make contradictory claims
that are often impossible to verify.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The United States is being inundated with cheap
steel and is checking on whether Russia, Japan and South Korea are
engaged in dumping, a high-ranking U.S. Commerce Department
official said Friday.
	   United States had feared it would be overwhelmed by cheap Asian
exports because of lower costs and devalued currencies during the
regional economic crisis, U.S. Commerce Under Secretary David L.
Aaron said.
	   But that has not happened _ except in the case of steel.
	   ``The United States is suddenly being inundated by vast
quantities of low-priced steel,'' he told the American Chamber of
Commerce in a speech.
	   Administration officials met last week with the steel industry
and decided to look into it. ``We are going to enforce our trade
laws and we are going to focus on steel,'' Aaron said.
	   Asked later at a news conference which countries were being
looked at as possible steel dumpers, he said Japan, South Korea and
Russia.
	   He said U.S. steelmakers were seeking a monitoring system, that
the issue be raised in talks with offending countries, that
complaints about dumping be dealt with as quickly as possible, and
that a report be made to congress on results by January.
	   Steel producers already have several trade complaints pending
with the Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade
Commission, and are working on making additional charges at the end
of the month. Cases generally take 12-to-18 months to resolve.
	   According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, imports of
steel products from Japan more than doubled in the first half of
the year, compared with the same period a year ago. Korean imports
rose 90 percent and Indonesian imports quadrupled.

Indonesian legislators mull demands that ex-president explain his

actions
 &UR; Eds: ADDS justice minister's comments; Single name for Muladi is
correct

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Legislators are considering ordering
ex-President Suharto to explain publicly why economic and social
order nearly collapsed in the weeks leading to his resignation in
May, news reports said Friday.
	   Suharto quit after 32 years in power following a wave of student
protests and riots, making way for new President B.J. Habibie,
himself now the target of similar protests as the economic crisis
grinds on and food prices soar.
	   About 1,200 people were killed in May's riots and thousands of
stores and homes burned and ransacked _ many of them belonging to
the ethnic Chinese minority, blamed for the worst economic crisis
in 30 years.
	   The Jakarta Post newspaper quoted a senior legislator Poedjono
Pranyoto as saying there were growing calls for Suharto to explain
himself to a special session of the People's Consultative Assembly,
which is to convene in November to debate sweeping democratic
reforms proposed by Habibie.
	   The reforms are to open the way for parliamentary elections,
probably in May next year.
	   After the poll, the assembly, Indonesia's highest legislative
body, is scheduled to choose a president by the end of 1999.
Habibie has said he plans to run.
	   Since he quit, Suharto, 77, has remained at his home in Jakarta
guarded by the military. He has denied accusations that he
improperly amassed a fortune overseas for himself and his family
during his presidency.
	   This week Suharto's legal consultant called on the government to
take action against people who he said had slandered the former
leader.
	   However, Justice Minister Muladi said there was no legal base
for the government to protect Suharto and his families against the
allegations.
	   Muladi was quoted by the newspaper Kompas as describing the
allegations as ``a part of freedom of expression'' and they would
stop only if Suharto and his family proved that they had done no
wrong.

Lawn bowls and tenpin bowling, distant companions at Commonwealth
</HEADLINE>
Games &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In one sport, white-clad bowlers
poise elegantly on an immaculate lawn. In the other, competitors in
a neon-lit hall fling balls that rumble noisily down a wooden lane.
	   Lawn bowls and tenpin bowling are companion sports at the 16th
Commonwealth Games, but they are worlds apart in style and image.
The first is seen as a bastion of English tradition, the latter a
people's game.
	   Tenpin bowling is making its debut at the games this year, its
venue an upscale shopping center with an ancient Egyptian facade _
sphinx and hieroglyphics included _ that rivals the glitter and
gaudiness of Las Vegas.
	   In the bowling alley Friday, teams from Malaysia, Singapore,
Wales and New Zealand walloped the pins during a training session
shortly before the games' opening ceremony.
	   ``It's a modern type of lawn bowling. It's like the next
stage,'' said Shalin Zulkifli, a Malaysian athlete. As the host
country for the games, Malaysia was entitled to introduce a sport
at which it excels.
	   Malaysia came third in the world team championships in tenpin
bowling in 1997 and fourth the previous year.
	   Lawn bowls has been a fixture in the Commonwealth Games ever
since the event started in 1930 as a means to draw together the
family of British colonies on the playing field. Some 70 nations
with 5,000 athletes are competing this year.
	   Both bowling sports are believed to have originated in Egypt
thousands of years ago and variations of the games were popular in
Europe in the Middle Ages. But tenpin bowling, aided by automatic
pin setting and ball return, has surged ahead in popularity.
	   ``It's really for all ages and pretty much a family sport,''
said Grace Young of the Singapore team. As for lawn bowls, she
said: ``I don't think the younger generation is interested in that.
I think they find it a little boring.''
	   Instead of knocking down pins, lawn bowlers swing their ball
toward a smaller white one at the other end of the grass, trying to
get it as close as possible. The thrown ball has two flattened
sides, so players can curve it deftly into position.
	   ``It's a slow game,'' said Aliah Salleh, the Malaysian liaison
officer for the Welsh team. ``It's relaxing, just like golf.''
	   Veteran Scottish lawn bowler Willie Wood has tried tenpin
bowling but finds it ruins his swing back on the lawns. While his
game may suffer an image as a refuge for the elderly, it is likely
to outlast tenpin bowling when Manchester, England, is host for the
next games.
	   ``It's only in the games here because of Malaysia,'' Wood said.
``At the next games, it'll be out.''

Sudanese government bombs civilian displaced camp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Sudanese government warplanes dropped
three bombs on the largest camp for those displaced by fighting in
rebel-held southern Sudan, killing two people, an aid group said
Friday.
	   The attack was the latest in a series on Labone Camp near
Sudan's border with Uganda, said Chaap Paul, of Norwegian People's
Aid, which runs a hospital in the camp.
	   ``We condemn the attack in the strongest possible terms because
it is not a military target at all,'' Paul said at the agency's
headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya.
	   An Antonov dropped three bombs at 9:10 a.m. (0710 GMT) Thursday,
he said. Two displaced Sudanese were killed, and one lightly
wounded. No damage was done to the camp, where 45,000 people have
lived since 1994.
	   ``We knew the attack was coming because the Antonov has been
circling for the past two weeks,'' Chaap said. ``But there's no
where for the displaced to go. If they don't bomb that camp,
they'll bomb another.''
	   The camp is in an area controlled by the Sudan People's
Liberation Army. Animist and Christian rebels in have fought a
15-year war for greater autonomy in the south from the Arab,
Muslim-dominated government in the north.
	   Labone, in Eastern Equatoria, is outside an area covered by a
three-month cease-fire agreed between government and rebel forces
to promote the flow of aid to hundreds of thousands of Sudanese
facing famine.

No fans, no money; it's just not cricket at the Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Room service is out. They've got
to do their own laundry and after a hard day's work they don't even
get paid.
	   Life is unusual these days for cricket's superstars who have
left behind the big bucks, glamor and adoring fans to play in the
Commonwealth Games where cricket is making its debut. But all this
is fair game, say the cricketers.
	   ``The guys make use of what's around. There have been no
complaints,'' said Steve Bernard, the manager of Australia's team,
one of 16 sides competing.
	   The reasons for complaints could be many.
	   Unlike their regular five-star lifestyle, the cricketers must
stay five-to-an-apartment in the Games village, a condominium
complex of sparsely furnished high-rise homes.
	   There are no phones in the rooms and athletes make their own
tea. Buffet food is laid out in a cafeteria, but no special orders,
please. The launderette is on the ground level.
	   The cricketers say they are prepared for all this.
	   ``When we left (India) we knew it was not going to be the
same,'' said Ajay Jadeja, the Indian captain.
	   ``We decided that we are going to the Games to win a medal and
it does not matter that you are not getting room service,'' he told
The Associated Press.
	   Jadeja said his team-mates also are glad to leave the autograph
hunters behind and lose themselves in the anonymity of a crush of
5,000 athletes at the Games village.
	   International cricket is played only by seven of the 70
participating nations.
	   Most sportsmen at the village wouldn't ever have seen a cricket
bat let alone recognize the stars in their midst such as Sachin
Tendulkar of India, Steve Waugh and Mark Waugh from Australia, West
Indian star Curtly Ambrose and Sanath Jayasuriya of Sri Lanka who
have the status of demi-gods back home.
	   At the village, instead of being hunted by fans the cricketers
are seeking out others. The Indians cheered their country's hockey
team in a match against Australia on Wednesday and went out for
dinner with weightlifters on Thursday.
	   ``It feels great to be away (from the limelight),'' said Jadeja
during an interview in coach K. Srikkanth's room where the team was
holding a meeting before Saturday's game against Canada.
	   But the escape from fans can never be total. During the
interview, an official from the Indian contingent thrust into
Jadeja's hands a folder filled with autographs. ``This is something
that will not leave us,'' Jadeja said.
	   Besides the threat of rain ruining the matches, the cricketers'
other problem is the lack of proper pitches and training facilities
in a country where cricket is not such a hot sport.
	   On Friday, Jadeja and his teammates practiced on a makeshift
pitch of astro turf at a military college.
	   Still, for the purists, it's a joy to see cricket played with
the same pristine qualities that characterized it until about two
decades ago.
	   Players discarded the colored clothing of one-day international
matches and have donned the yesteryear uniforms of white flannels,
their shirt sleeves bereft of sponsors' logos.
	   Playing as amateurs they will not be paid.
	   ``It is irrelevant that there is no money. ... We wanted to be a
part of it (the Commonwealth Games) ... for the glory of getting a
gold,'' Bernard said.
	   Until professional sponsorship and television rights boosted the
game in the 1980s, cricketers used to be the poorest sportsmen.
Now, top ones earn millions of dollars every year.
	   Perhaps that was one reason why Pakistan's A team went to play
in the ICC-approved Sahara Cup in Canada, against India. That split
its test team members between playing in Canada and in Malaysia and
only Australia has sent a near-complete regular team to the Games.
	   The biggest blow, however, came from England, the birthplace of
cricket and the creator of the Commonwealth.
	   It did not send a team, citing scheduling problems, although
critics said that money was the real reason.

Political outcast wants back in the mainstream

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's newly acclaimed
political outcast insists he has a future within the ruling party,
that ``the people'' would determine his fate.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, unceremoniously dumped as deputy and finance
minister and expelled from the United Malays National Organization
on sexual misconduct charges last week, told The Associated Press
it was time to risk arrest and take his side of the story to the
people.
	   He says he will fight his way back into the mainstream.
	   ``My focus now is both to appeal to UMNO members to respect my
UMNO position in the spirit of the constitution, and at the same
time appeal directly to the masses,'' said Anwar, sitting barefoot
and cross-legged on the prayer carpet in his living room Thursday.
	   He made good on that challenge, drawing 7,000 supporters for
prayers at a mosque in Kampong Baru, a Muslim enclave on the
outskirts of the city which traditionally has been a center for
religious and reformist debate.
	   Anwar said he intends to visit northern Malaysia on Saturday,
the same villages where he led demonstrations on behalf of poor
farmers in his radical student days. One of those protests led to
22 months of detention under the dreaded Internal Security Act.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad wooed Anwar away from his
conservative Islamic party and into the more moderate UMNO in 1982.
Mahathir pushed him up the political ranks with various Cabinet
posts, until naming him deputy PM in 1993 and grooming him to take
his place.
	   Today, the Southeast Asian country's two most powerful men have
become bitter enemies.
	   Mahathir says he conducted his own investigation and determined
that Anwar was immoral and unfit to lead. He believes Anwar would
face criminal charges once the police concludes its investigation
into sexual improprieties.
	   Anwar believes the Malaysian people know the truth.
	   ``I've been wrongfully expelled without charges against me,''
Anwar said. ``I still thoroughly trust the wisdom and the
resilience of the people.''
	   Thousands of supporters flock to his two-story stucco house in a
well-heeled neighborhood each night to listen to his poetic denials
of misdeeds. They howl over his potshots at the government and roar
at his triple chants of ``reformasi,'' the Islamic opposition
battle cry of neighboring Indonesia.
	   Some sneak in from the nearby government ministries on their
lunch breaks just to touch his hand. On Thursday, several huge
Indian men were reduced to tears when Anwar embraced them and
thanked them for their support.
	   His wife, Dr. Azizah Ismail, stares up at him adoringly during
his hourlong political sermons. His six children, aged 6 to 18, are
positioned behind him and follow his every word. As midnight
approached Wednesday, 13-year-old Ihsan rubbed his fathers
shoulders after breaks in his speech, like a coach in the corner of
a boxing ring.
	   Anwar, 51, believes he was banished because he fought against
corruption and is devoted to Islam.
	   ``They are terrified of me because of my religious and
nationalistic principles,'' Anwar said after prayers Friday.
	   When asked to be more specific about his reform platform, Anwar
adopts an air of boredom, as if he's grown weary of the subject. He
notes his platform is outlined in his 1996 book, ``The Asian
Renaissance.''
	   He says he stands for democracy and freedom of the press,
continued growth and prosperity, and transparency within the
government.
	   When asked about Mahathir, whether he or his family is corrupt,
Anwar becomes vague. Even after his sacking last week, he still
referred to Mahathir, 72, as a ``father'' who had been pushed to a
wall.
	   ``That's the major issue, he feels vulnerable to a challenge,''
he said.
	   Anwar had hoped Mahathir, after 17 years in power, would step
aside during UMNO elections next year and allow Anwar to step down
as vice president and run for the top post. The president of UMNO
is traditionally named prime minister by the UMNO-dominated
Parliament.
	   ``I had wanted a smooth transition,'' Anwar said. ``But he must
accept the fact that the undercurrents are also strong.''

Philippine military asks Muslim leaders to talk with kidnappers of
</HEADLINE>
Italian priest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ The military has asked Muslim
religious leaders to negotiate with kidnappers of an Italian priest
abducted in the southern Philippines four days ago, police said
Friday.
	   Regional police chief Dominador Domingo said the intercession of
the Muslim leaders was sought because of concern that the Rev.
Luciano Benedetti might be injured if soldiers attack the
kidnappers' suspected hideout.
	   The priest is believed to be held in Siraway in Zamboanga del
Norte province, 70 kilometers (45 miles) north of Zamboanga City.
	   Benedetti, 54, of Ravenna, Italy, was kidnapped Tuesday in
Sibuco, south of Siraway, together with 12 Filipinos. The Filipinos
were later abandoned unharmed in a mountainous area.
	   Panfilo Lacson, chief of the presidential anti-crime task force,
said his unit was called in to coordinate the rescue effort for
Benedetti.
	   ``The safety of the Italian priest is our main concern,'' he
said.
	   Italian Embassy spokesman Andreas Ferarese said the embassy
would not pay if the kidnappers demand ransom.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for Benedetti's kidnapping but
police suspect members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front are
involved. The front is the bigger of two Muslim rebel groups
fighting the government.
	   Benedetti, who was assigned to the Philippines in 1977, belongs
to a missionary group called the Pontifical Institute for Foreign
Missions and is one of about 70 Italian priests assigned to the
southern Philippines.
	   The kidnapping occurred amid a high-profile campaign against
crime by President Joseph Estrada. Kidnappings, bank robberies and
other crimes are rampant despite on and off anti-crime drives.
	   Also Tuesday, unidentified men kidnapped three Chinese
businessmen in Sitangkai in Tawi-Tawi island, further south.
	   Police said the three men, who remained unidentified, were
reported to be from Hong Kong. Their kidnappers took them in a boat
to an unknown destination, police said.
	   A day later, another group of kidnappers abducted an 80-year-old
mother of a Taiwanese businessman, his wife, his daughter and their
maid in Guiwan in Zamboanga, police said.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch brewer Heineken NV said
Friday that net profit in the first half of 1998 rose 28 percent to
418 million guilders (dlrs 220 million) thanks to higher beer sales
and sales prices.
	   The results were well above the estimates of analysts who had
predicted net profit of up to 367 million (dlrs 193.2 million).
	   Heineken, the world's second largest beer brewer, said the
increase in earnings was largely attributable to higher beer sales
and a positive change in sales mix.
	   Exchange rate fluctuations had a net positive impact, Heineken
said, adding that drops in the Indonesian rupiah, the Singapore
dollar and the Greek drachma, were offset by the higher U.S.
dollar.
	   Heineken's sales rose from 6.52 billion guilders (dlrs 3.4
billion) in the first half of 1997 to 6.84 billion guilders (dlrs
3.6 billion) in this year's first half.
	   Sales in the United States increased by 14 percent, but the
company noted that the financial crisis in Asia had an ``adverse
effect on sales'' which led to a sales volume equal to the first
half of 1997.
	   Heineken's shares rose in Amsterdam despite the overall negative
sentiment in the market. At 9.36 a.m. (0736 GMT), Heineken traded
at 82.50 guilders (dlrs 43.42), up 2.00 guilders (dlrs 1.05) or 2.5
percent while the AEX benchmark index was down 1.8 percent.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ An explosion ripped through a
liquified petroleum gas filling station in a city west of Seoul on
Friday, injuring at least 15 people, police said.
	   Thousands of people fled their homes as fire, touched off by the
explosion, raged out of control and spread to nearby buildings in
Puchon, 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Seoul.
	   Television footage showed columns of black smoke rising from the
station, which had hundreds of barrel-shaped tanks stored inside.
	   At least 20 fire engines rushed to the scene, but efforts to
extinguish the fire were hampered by the danger of more explosions,
police said.
	   MBC-TV reported 15 people, including four firefighters, were
hospitalized with burns. One was in serious condition, it said.
	   The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.
	   ``I heard a loud bang, and I turned and saw flames from a taxi
filling its gas tank. Soon there were a series of explosions,'' Kim
Sun-jin, a witness, told SBS-TV.
	   Scores of taxis and other cars were damaged in the explosion and
several adjacent buildings were engulfed in flames, police said.
	   Police closed roads and cut off electricity to the region to
prevent more explosions. The area houses scores of small factories.
	   Liquid petroleum gas is widely used at homes and taxicabs in
South Korea.

Australian athletes taking banned drugs doubles in 12 months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The number of elite Australian
athletes using banned substances almost doubled in 12 months, the
Australian Sports Drug Agency said Friday.
	   Agency chief executive Natalie Howson said 15 athletes from
seven sports tested positive to stimulants, anabolic steroids and
cannabis in 1997-98, up from eight the previous year.
	   Howson said they were among a record 4,313 drug tests conducted
by the agency compared with 3,499 tests in 1996-97.
	   Among the athletes testing positive to banned substances were
Newcastle rugby league player Robbie O'Davis and Melbourne Storm's
Rodney Howe, who each received a 22-week suspension.
	   Their drug bans led the National Rugby League to drug test every
league player.
	   Howson said the other athletes testing positive came from
baseball, soccer, cycling, motorcycling, water skiing and ice
hockey.
	   The penalties ranged from the two-year suspension of a cyclist
for using amphetamines to the 22-week penalties handed out in the
NRL.
	   She said no athletes competing at the Commonwealth Games were
among those who tested positive.
	   ``The agency is gearing up for the Sydney 2000 Olympics by
conducting more tests than ever before,'' Howson said in a
statement.
	   Howson said the number of tests would again rise in 1998-99,
including more testing of Australian athletes training and
competing overseas and international athletes training and
competing in Australia. (djp)

Police find four bodies, apparently Serbs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police have found four
bodies _ apparently those of missing Serb civilians _ near a former
rebel stronghold, television footage showed Friday.
	   The heavily decomposing bodies were found Thursday in the
village of Dasinovci, close to the former Kosovo Liberation Army
stronghold of Glodjane in western Kosovo, the WTN pictures from the
village showed.
	   Documents found on the bodies showed they were Serbs. Police
said they expected to unearth more, as the footage showed an ethnic
Albanian prisoner pointing to more locations and digging at them.
	   Serbian police overran Glodjane two days ago. They said a total
of 24 bodies were found in another location near Glodjane. The
police said all were Serb civilians killed by the KLA.
	   Serbs have reported some 170 people missing since the Kosovo
clashes started in late February. They accused the rebel ethnic
Albanians fighting for independence of the province of kidnapping
the Serb civilians.

Thorpe, Klim may nudge world record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ian Thorpe was 6 years old and
three years away from breaking his first swimming record when
Italian Giorgio Lamberti set the oldest men's world record still
standing.
	   Thorpe, a mature and humble kid who acts more like his shoe size
of 16 than his age of 15, says he won't be chasing Lamberti's 1989
mark for the 200-meter freestyle when he dives into the
Commonwealth Games pool Saturday. But with rival Australian Michael
Klim standing beside him, Thorpe may just have to.
	   ``I don't expect to break the world record here or any records
at all,'' Thorpe said. ``I just hope that I can swim as well as I
have in the past, doing my best. Hopefully, I can get some personal
bests up on the boards once again.''
	   His personal best for the 200 meters is one minute, 47.24
seconds. Lamberti's mark, set in 1989, is 1:46.69, and Klim won the
world title earlier this year in 1:47.44.
	   While neither swimmer will predict a record, they are likely to
push each other close to the mark. And the 200 meters could decide
which of the pair returns to Australia as the country's outstanding
swimmer of the meet.
	   Klim's performance at the World Championships, where he claimed
four gold medals, two silver and a bronze, made him a millionaire
at home. He is in demand for television advertisements and
sponsorship launches, a rough schedule of work that could harm his
swimming _ the very thing that made him sought after.
	   Thorpe first made the senior national team 12 months ago for the
Pan Pac Games. He had a history, albeit it a short one, of being a
prodigious winner. In the 1996 national age championships, he won
every event open to 13-year-olds, everything from 50 to 200 in
freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, butterfly and medley. A year
later he repeated the performance.
	   Thorpe went into the World Championships with his temperament
untested at the highest level. In the 400-meter final he was
falling behind world 1,500-meter champion Grant Hackett, but
responded with an incredible surge that gained him the title.
	   ``It showed me what the sport is all about,'' Thorpe said.
``That I can swim because I can enjoy it and that I can come good
when things get tough.''
	   Klim says there is no rivalry between the pair out of the pool,
but it is hard to believe. They are competing for the same
sponsorship dollars, the same supply of hero worship that
translates into lucrative careers.
	   Klim is only 21, but can clearly see the younger order moving
in.
	   ``Since the trials, I've had a very limited amount of business
commitments,'' Klim said. ``The last three months have been solely
based on my training. I'm quite hungry. I'm trying to be positive
and aggressive about all my swims.''
	   The Australian team easily won the meet four years ago in
Victoria, Canada, and should do so again here.
	   The 200-meter freestyle is the feature race in Saturday's
opening session of the swimming competition, but the first gold
will be decided in the women's 100-meter freestyle.
	   England's Sue Rolph is favorite, and sees the event as a chance
to knock the Australian team off balance.
	   ``I am feeling supremely confident of three golds and no one is
going to knock me down. I really don't care what anyone else thinks
about me saying that,'' Rolph said. ``There is a motivation to beat
the Australians above all because every event they think they will
win they shout about it so I think we should shout about those we
will win.''

Islamic clerics denounce Diana commemorative stamps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A group of Islamic clerics in
Bangladesh called Princess Diana an ``adulteress'' Friday,
criticizing their government for releasing three commemorative
stamps to mark her first death anniversary.
	   ``She was an adulteress and immoral woman. The release of the
stamps in her honor has displeased Allah and hurt the sentiments of
Muslims,'' twenty-one Muslim clerics said in a joint press
statement. They urged the government to immediately stop the sale
of the stamps.
	   The multi-colored stamps adorned with the smiling pictures of
the princess _ who was killed last year in a car crash in Paris _
went on sale on Sunday, priced between 8 takas (18 cents) and 22
takas (46 cents).
	   ``Princess Diana will be remembered for her services to the
distressed people, especially the children,'' Post and
Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Nasim said Sunday. The
government did not immediately respond to the clerics' statement.
	   Bangladesh is a predominantly Muslim nation with a secular
government, but Islamic clerics have influence among conservatives.

Killing of Iranian diplomats heightens tensions with Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Already tense relations between
Afghanistan and its powerful neighbor Iran have been strained
further by the Taliban religious militia admitting that its troops
killed a group of missing Iranian diplomats.
	   For weeks, Iran has been pressing the Taliban, which controls 90
percent of Afghanistan, though diplomatic channels and with shows
of military force over the fate of the 11 Iranians. The group
vanished during an Aug. 8 battle in which the Taliban seized the
northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   On Thursday, the Taliban army said the bodies of nine of the
missing Iranians were found this week, and admitted that they had
been killed by the religious army's own troops. The Taliban made
the disclosure in a letter from their supreme leader, Mullah Omar,
to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The U.N. condemned the
killings.
	   Tehran called the killings as ``a shocking and horrifying
atrocity which is contrary to international codes and norms.'' Iran
has also said it plans new, massive military exercises on the
Afghan border in what outside experts fear could be a prelude to
military retaliation.
	   The nine Iranians ``either intentionally or unintentionally,
have been killed by unidentified soldiers'' of the Taliban, Mullah
Omar's letter said. He stressed that the soldiers acted on their
own. There was no word on the fate of the two other missing
Iranians.
	   For weeks, the Taliban has denied any knowledge of the missing
diplomats, suggesting that they fled or were with the troops of a
northern alliance that is fighting the Taliban. Hours before Mullah
Omar admitted the killings, a top Taliban official told The
Associated Press in Islamabad that the envoys had been killed by
opponents wanting to sour relations between Iran and the Taliban.
	   Iran's state-controlled television claimed to have evidence that
Mullah Omar personally ordered the storming of the Iranian
consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif, but did not present proof.
	   However, Mullah Omar has said the battle for Mazar-e-Sharif was
so fierce that the Taliban had no time to consider the Iranian
diplomats.
	   ``It was a big offensive,'' the reclusive leader said in a rare
radio interview broadcast by the BBC on Aug. 31. ``Neither my
military commanders or I paid attention to ... whether the Iranian
diplomats were there ... (or) our reaction to them.''
	   Iran's Foreign Ministry said it ``reserved the right to defend
its people against aggression'' without saying what action it would
take. It demanded the immediate return of the diplomats' bodies and
the release of all Iranians held in Afghanistan. Mullah Omar
promised to cooperate in returning the bodies.
	   Last week, Iran conducted a massive exercise, with 70,000
troops, warplanes and tanks, on the Afghan border, and earlier
Thursday announced plans for more maneuvers on the Afghan border.
No date for the new exercises was announced. The Taliban accuses
Iran of supporting the northern alliances in Afghanistan's civil
war.

India ready to sign nuclear test ban treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India hinted Friday that it was prepared
to sign on to a nuclear test ban, saying its objections have been
met and that it was already adhering to the treaty.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee told reporters in the
northern city of Lucknow that his decision to refrain from
conducting further nuclear tests following a series in May amounted
to ``adherence of the nuclear test ban treaty in spirit.''
	   ``A final decision on signing the CTBT will be taken soon,''
Vajpayee said.
	   India has long objected that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
freezes the advantage Britain, China, France, Russia and the United
States have gained by decades of testing. Now India, too, has been
able to refine its nuclear arsenals, said Brajesh Mishra, the
Indian prime minister's top adviser.
	   ``We have undertaken a test and we now have no need for further
tests,'' Mishra told reporters in New Delhi.
	   India also had argued that the CTBT was not linked to a
disarmament process.
	   ``Now what we are doing is that we are talking about the CTBT
and at the same time pursuing our agenda for the elimination of
nuclear weapons,'' Mishra said.
	   While discussions are on between India and other nuclear power
states led by the United States to pave the way for signing the
CTBT, the latter should grant more ``leeway and concessions'' to
India to hasten the process., said Vajpayee. This was an apparent
reference to India's demand for the lifting of economic sanction
imposed after it tested five nuclear devices in May.
	   Arch-rival Pakistan, with whom India has fought three wars,
responded by carrying out its own nuclear tests.
	   The comments by Vajpayee and Mishra came as the Pakistani
Parliament scheduled a debate on the CTBT, apparently in
preparation for signing it.
	   Mishra said a debate was going on in India as well.
	   ``The debate will ultimately lead to a consensus toward
adherence of the CTBT,'' he said. The Indian Parliament is
scheduled to meet for its winter session in November.
	   He also said the prime ministers of India and Pakistan will meet
in New York later this month on the fringes of the U.N. General
Assembly session where they are expected to ask the officials to
resume the interrupted dialogue over Kashmir and other problems.
	   Two of the three Indo-Pakistani wars have been over Kashmir.
Their nuclear tests have turned the world's attention to Kashmir,
seen as the potential spark for a South Asian nuclear war.

Stock prices in Tokyo plummet, U.S. dollar plunges

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo share prices suffered their biggest plunge of
the year Friday on fears about instability in global financial
markets and Japan's domestic economic woes. The U.S. dollar fell
sharply against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average tumbled 749.05 points, or
5.12 percent, closing at 13,916.98 _ the largest plummet so far
this year in points and percentage.
	   The intraday low was 13,725.62, but bargain hunters scooped up
cheap stocks to buoy prices.
	   The close was just above the Nikkei's 12-year closing low of
13,915.63 set on Aug. 28. The previous largest single-day point
loss this year was Sept. 2, when the index fell 538.76 points.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 130.78 yen, down 4.92 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 134.23 yen overnight. Trades ranged between 128.80 yen and
134.45 yen during the day in Tokyo.
	   Friday's fall in the Nikkei index, which on Thursday had
declined 89.51 points, or 0.61 percent, was sparked by the
overnight rout in New York which renewed concerns over the global
economy, traders said.
	   ``I can't see the bottom for the market,'' said Fumikazu Onishi,
a strategist with Nikko Securities Co.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average lost 249.48 points on Thursday,
its sixth-worst point loss ever amid fears that U.S. President Bill
Clinton may be forced to resign or be impeached.
	   Stock prices also plunged across Latin America on Thursday.
Brazil's benchmark index dropped 15.8 percent, its steepest fall in
one session since 1990.
	   At home, Japan's Economic Planning Agency said the gross
domestic product _ the measure of all goods and services produced
in the country _ declined by 0.8 percent between April and June
from the previous quarter.
	   It was the first time since 1955 that the Japanese economy had
marked three consecutive quarters of contraction.
	   Traders said the biggest sellers were institutional investors
and foreigners. ``There are no buyers,'' said Kunihiro Hatae,
general manager of the stock division at Tokyo Securities.
	   Decliners outnumbered gainers 1,062 to 156, with 84 issues
unchanged.
	   Trading was heavy, with an estimated 1.26 billion shares
changing hands on the first section. Much of the turnover was
related to Friday's settlement of September futures and options.
Volume totaled 364 million shares on Thursday.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 38.43 points, or 3.46 percent, to 1,071.48.
The TOPIX closed down 6.10 points, or 0.55 percent, the previous
day.
	   Traders said the dollar moved wildly in extremely jittery
trading as traders were worried about falls on Wall Street and
other major financial markets elsewhere in the world.
	   In addition, threat of impeachment proceedings against U.S.
President Bill Clinton's also pressured the U.S. currency lower
earlier in the session, traders said. The dollar later recouped
some of its earlier losses on profit-taking, they said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to a record low of 0.780 percent from Thursday's finish
of 0.840 percent, driving its price rose to 114.72 yen from
Thursday's 114.27 yen. Thursday's yield was the previous record
low.

Bangladesh offers special prayers

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh offered special prayers
Friday as the worst floods in the delta nation's history threaten
to swamp new areas.
	   Many devotees offered the prayers on boats as floodwaters
submerged much of the country, including mosques where Muslim
Sabbath congregations are held every Friday.
	   ``The unfolding situation is the most serious disaster the
country has ever faced,'' Michael Elmquist, head of a U.N. Disaster
Assessment and Coordination team, told reporters Friday before
leaving for Geneva to report to foreign donors.
	   Another U.N. official warned that the crunch will come in next
four months and ``both government and international community will
have to keep an eye on the food situation to avert a famine.''
	   ``In both food and health the real crisis is still to come,''
said David Lockerhood, the head of United Nations Development
Program in Dhaka.
	   Government officials have estimated the food loss caused by the
floods at 2.3 million tons. But the deficit could reach 4 million
tons, economists said.
	   On Thursday weather officials reported a slight fall of flood
levels upstream in the Brahmaputra and Jamuna rivers, but it
brought little cheer to areas downstream where water continued to
rise.
	   The two rivers originate in the Himalayas and flow through India
and into Bangladesh. Rains have decreased in those areas, reducing
the water level. But the mouths of the rivers that open into the
sea is narrow and consequently, the water level rose in the central
and southern districts of the country, including Dhaka.
	   An unusual high tide at Meghna estuary at the mouth of Bay of
Bengal is also slowing the recession of waters, weather officials
said.
	   The Buriganga River, a tributary of the Brahmaputra _ which has
been threatening an embankment on the southeastern outskirts of the
capital _ could rise by another 18 centimeters Friday. The river is
already at 117 centimeters above the flood level.
	   Soldiers, civil engineers and thousands of residents continued
to dump sand bags and rocks Friday to shore up the 32-kilometer
(22-mile) Dhaka embankment for the fourth straight day Friday.
	   If the embankment collapses, up to eight feet of water would
cover a nearby area that is home to 600,000 people, said a senior
engineer at Water Development Board speaking on customary condition
of anonymity. But he said it will take at least eight hours to
reach that height, giving people enough time to move to safety.
	   Flood waters have submerged much of Bangladesh, one of the
world's largest delta at the foot of the Himalayas. The deluge has
claimed more than 850 lives and displaced more than a quarter of
the country's 124 million people since July 10.
	   The flooding also increased the spread of waterborne diseases
and destroyed an estimated 2.3 million tons of rice.
	   Bangladesh has asked for dlrs 889 million in foreign aid and has
so far received pledges totaling dlrs 172 million.
	   The government said it has a stock of 700,000 tons of rice and
another 1.3 million tons are in the pipeline from foreign aid and
commercial imports.
	   The United States, which has committed 400,000 tons of wheat, is
sending dry food, medicines and water purification tablets in a
relief plane expected to reach Dhaka Saturday, the U.S. embassy
said.

Hanson's policy: abolition of special welfare benefits for
</HEADLINE>
Aborigines &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos expected &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONGREACH, Australia (AP) _ With her party's popularity
dwindling and her own place in Parliament under threat, maverick
right-wing politician Pauline Hanson on Friday renewed her attack
on Aboriginal welfare and land rights.
	   At a setpiece function designed to reignite her campaign for
national elections, Hanson called for the abolition of the
government's main Aboriginal agency and said her One Nation party
would abolish welfare benefits on the basis of race.
	   ``We must rid ourselves of policies based on skin color,''
Hanson said.
	   ``Under One Nation policy the issue of Aboriginality would no
longer exist, as benefits by virtue of race would no longer
exist.''
	   Aborigines, the world's oldest continuous culture, make up about
1.6 percent of Australia's about 18 million population and are
consistently represented in health and other social statistics as
the nation's most disadvantaged minority. Aborigines have a life
expectancy 20 years shorter than white people.
	   Hanson repeated calls for the dismantling of the Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander Commission and other government agencies
which fund Aboriginal education programs and administer native
title laws.
	   She said Aboriginal agencies should either be abolished outright
or their work absorbed into general government departments.
	   Opinion polls for the Oct. 3 elections show One Nation's support
has fallen to below 10 percent, even among her strongest support
base in rural areas.
	   The release of an Aboriginal affairs policy, which contained no
new announcements, was interpreted by some observers as an attempt
to generate controversy and heighten Hanson's profile.
	   Hanson struck out at angrily at reporters who asked if the
policy's release was an attempt to ``play the race card.''
	   ``Get this clear ... we are all Australians together and don't
try and divide this nation,'' she said.
	   The policy was rejected by both sides of Australian politics.
	   Conservative Prime Minister John Howard said race issues had no
place in any political campaign, while Labor Opposition leader Kim
Beazley said Hanson was exploiting the most vulnerable people in
the community for political gain.
	   Hanson is facing defeat in her own electorate in Queensland
state after a boundary shift by the official Australian Electoral
Commission changed the balance of her support base.

Hamas threatens revenge after top fugitives are killed by Israel
</HEADLINE>

CORRECTS first name of witness to Shukri, sted Shokali &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Islamic militants on Friday threatened
to carry out more bombings in Israel to avenge two top Hamas
fugitives killed by Israeli troops in a raid of their hideout.
	   Bracing for new attacks, Israel indefinitely sealed off the West
Bank and Gaza Strip to keep Palestinians out of Israel. Hamas has
carried out more than a dozen bombings in Israel since 1994.
	   The new tension came as U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross shuttled
between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in hopes of concluding
a deal on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   A new outbreak of violence would make it exceedingly difficult
for Ross to negotiate a breakthrough and end a 17-month stalemate.
	   On the third day of his mission, Ross was to meet later Friday
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The two Hamas fugitives, brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, were
killed Thursday afternoon in a remote house surrounded by vineyards
and orchards west of the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, hinted that the Awadallah
brothers were killed in a carefully planned ambush.
	   ``This is another example of terrorists known for killing
Israelis being pursued wherever they are,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Shukri Fetaftah, an area resident, said a truck and four vans
carrying dozens of people in civilian clothes drove up to the house
at about 4 p.m. Thursday. Fetaftah said he heard shots about 10
minutes later. Afterwards, army jeeps and ambulances arrived.
	   The army would only say that troops raided the home after shots
and an explosion were heard and that the two fugitives were killed
in a gun battle with soldiers.
	   Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said the group would retaliate.
	   ``We can be certain that Israel will pay a high price for this
crime,'' Zahar told The Associated Press. ``Hamas operatives can
attack any Israeli targets.''
	   Zahar suggested Hamas would retaliate with suicide bombings,
just as it did when its chief bombmaker was assassinated in January
1996 in an operation widely attributed to Israel.
	   At the time, Hamas carried out four bombings that killed dozens
of Israelis, disrupted peace talks and brought Israel's hardline
leader, Netanyahu, to power.
	   At the Awadallah brothers' home in the West Bank town of El
Bireh, a wake was hastily arranged. Dozens of mourners came to the
home, with women sitting in a circle in the living room and
slapping their faces in an expression of grief. Verses of the Koran
were played at low volume on a small tape recorder.
	   The family said it had not yet received official word that the
brothers had been killed.
	   Adel Awadallah, commander of the Hamas military wing Izzedine al
Qassam in the West Bank, headed Israel's most wanted list. Israel
believed he masterminded several suicide bombings.
	   Imad Awadallah, also a leading figure in Izzedine al Qassam,
escaped from a Palestinian jail last month. He had been held on
suspicion that he killed a fellow Hamas fugitive, Mohiyedine
Sharif, in a fight over power and money.

Another comeback for Lothar Matthaeus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Another comeback for Lothar Matthaeus.
	   The 37-year-old Bayern Munich veteran will be in Germany's
roster for the upcoming European championship qualification games
against Turkey and Moldova, the German soccer federation (DFB) said
Friday.
	   New German national team chief Erich Ribbeck called Matthaeus
Thursday afternoon and discussed his comeback. Matthaeus
immediately accepted, the DFB said in a statement.
	   Matthaeus, who has played a record 129 games for Germany,
retired after Germany's ouster in the quarterfinals of the World
Cup _ with a little persuasion from then coach Berti Vogts.
	   Vogts was planning to rejuvenate the team and said he was not
counting anymore on Matthaeus and other veterans.
	   But Vogts resigned Monday and Ribbeck, on his first day on the
job Thursday, said he would call up all of Germany's best players,
regardless of their age.
	   Matthaeus was dropped by Vogts before the 1996 European Cham in
England. But Vogts recalled Matthaeus before this summer's World
Cup when injuries took out several players. Matthaeus began on the
bench but soon advanced to a starter at the World Cup.
	   Germany, the defending European champion, begins its qualifying
campaign for Euro 2000 on Oct. 10 in Turkey and Oct. 14 in Moldova.

Sailor kills eight crew members on Russian nuclear submarine

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A 19-year-old sailor on a Russian nuclear
submarine stole a machine gun and shot dead eight crewmen before
barricading himself in the vessel at a northern port, officials
said Friday.
	   Alexander Kuzminykh, a draftee who's been in the navy since last
year, went on a shooting spree overnight on the vessel in
Severomorsk, near the northern city of Murmansk, the Defense
Ministry said in a statement. Eight sailors were dead and the
standoff was continuing, the statement added.
	   The submarine was of the Bars class, a nuclear-powered fleet
submarine normally armed with nuclear cruise missiles and
torpedoes, navy officials said. However, there were no missiles on
the submarine because it was in port, officials said.
	   The shooting rampage began when Kuzminykh seized a machine gun
from a guard, killing him and then fatally shooting seven more crew
members, the Defense Ministry said in a statement.
	   The account gave no word on what might have prompted his
actions. However, the Interfax news agency said Kuzminykh had been
in detention on disciplinary charges when he seized the weapon.
	   After the shootings, Kuzminykh barricaded himself inside one
section of the submarine, officials said.
	   The commander of the Russian navy, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, flew
to the port to handle the situation, officials said.
	   Officials tried to contact the sailor and appealed to him to
surrender, but he was not responding to their calls. Nor has he
made any demands, the Defense Ministry said.
	   There has been a rash of mass killings in the Russian armed
forces, which are plagued by brutal living conditions. The military
is chronically short of money because of the country's economic
problems and hazing of servicemen is a major problem.

Chinese top military official begins U.S. visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Gen. Zhang Wannian, one of China's most
politically powerful military leaders, left Friday for an official
visit to the United States, the state-run Xinhua News Agency
reported.
	   As a member of the Politburo, the supreme seat of power in
China, Zhang is the People's Liberation Army's leading voice in the
ruling Communist Party.
	   Zhang's visit is part of an effort by both countries to improve
military exchanges. While in the United States, Zhang is to meet
with U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen to discuss global and
regional security issues, Xinhua reported.
	   It said Zhang and his entourage would meet senior government and
military officials and legislators and tour U.S. military
facilities.
	   Zhang was accompanied by several other top military figures,
including Lt. Gen. Xiong Guangkai, PLA deputy chief of general
staff; Shi Yunsheng, commander of the navy; Li Xinliang, commander
of the PLA's Beijing garrison; and Qiao Qingchen, deputy commander
of the air force, Xinhua said.
	   Zhang is a key supporter of President Jiang Zemin within the
military and is vice chairman of the Central Military Commission,
which is headed by Jiang.
	   Unlike Jiang, who has not served in the military, the
70-year-old general is a professional soldier and a hero of China's
1979 border war with Vietnam.
	   High-level military exchanges between China and the United
States were frozen after the Chinese military was used to suppress
pro-democracy demonstrations centered on Beijing's Tiananmen Square
in 1989.
	   More recently, tensions flared over Taiwan in 1996 after Beijing
tested missiles and conducted war games near the island, which it
regards as a renegade province. The United States sent aircraft
carriers to the area to warn Beijing against going too far.
	   Antagonisms over Taiwan and other issues eased in the run-up to
U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to China in June. Zhang's U.S.
trip would build on that goodwill, Xinhua said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Battered by declining consumer spending at home and
a worsening financial crisis abroad, Japan's economy shrank for a
third straight quarter, the Economic Planning Agency said Friday.
	   Japan's gross domestic product _ the measure of all goods and
services produced in the country _ declined by 0.8 percent between
April and June from the previous quarter, the EPA said.
	   It was the first time since 1955 that the Japanese economy has
marked three consecutive quarters of decline.
	   Friday's figures showed the economy contracting at an annual
rate of 3.3 percent, the EPA said. The economy contracted by 1.3
percent in the January-March quarter.
	   Last year, the economy shrank 0.7 percent, its first annual
decline since 1974.
	   The numbers confirmed that Asia's economic powerhouse remains
mired in a stubborn recession from which EPA head Taichi Sakaiya
held out little hope for a quick recovery.
	   ``The GDP reflects a very severe economic situation,'' Sakaiya
told a press conference.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and the three other
leading finance companies of the Mitsubishi group will jointly form
an investment trust company, officials said Friday.
	   Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Japan's largest lender, will link up with
Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp., Meiji Life Insurance Co. and
Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co.
	   The alliance is intended to strengthen the four companies ahead
of increased competition as Japan's ``Big Bang'' deregulation
measures lower the barriers dividing banking, insurance and
securities brokerage.
	   It will also step up the pressure on competitors to restructure
and pursue similar deals.
	   Company executives announcing the alliance stressed that all
four members are already the leading companies in their sectors.
	   ``We can survive by ourselves,'' said Kokei Higuchi, president
of Tokio Marine and Fire. ``But this alliance is aimed at helping
each other.''
	   The group plans to set up the jointly owned investment-trust
company in December, and also cooperate in pension and investment
banking businesses.
	   But bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi President Satoru Kishi said that
the companies will continue to compete with each other in asset
management, derivatives and insurance.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's export growth continued to slow in
August, although it registered a trade surplus of dlrs 31.3 billion
in the first eight months of the year, according to customs figures
released on state television Friday.
	   A worsening in the Asian economic situation caused exports to
drop 1.4 percent from July, while imports fell 0.3 percent from
July, the broadcast said, without providing specific figures.
	   In the first eight months of the year, China's exports rose 5.5
percent to dlrs 118.65 billion, while imports inched up 0.4 percent
to dlrs 87.26 billion, the report said.
	   Total trade volume grew 3.3 percent to dlrs 205.91 billion.
	   China's export growth has slowed significantly from a record
growth of 21 percent in 1997. Exports to Japan, South Korea and
Southeast Asian countries all have dropped.
	   No further details were provided in the brief report.
	   According to forecasts from the State Information Center, a
government research group, China's exports are expected to continue
to slow throughout this year, rising 3.1 percent in the third
quarter. Meanwhile imports are predicted to grow 2.5 percent in the
same period, the center said.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Backing the Philippine Central Bank's
opposition to currency controls as a means of stabilizing the peso,
President Joseph Estrada said there is no reason to follow
Malaysia's lead in imposing exchange-rate restrictions.
	   ``I don't believe we have to follow the footsteps of (Malaysian)
Prime Minister Mahathir because we are more economically stable
than Malaysia,'' Estrada said late Thursday.
	   Since Malaysia imposed restrictions on the convertibility of its
currency, the ringgit, on Sept. 1, the Philippine Central Bank has
reiterated its opposition to currency controls, which it views as
unworkable and open to corruption.
	   Estrada's comments are the first he has made on the highly
sensitive issue.
	   Indonesia earlier this week also voiced its opposition to
imposing currency controls on the rupiah.
	   Estrada said his economic managers are using other means to
combat the currency crisis, such as a government austerity program
and budgetary controls.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The United States is being inundated with cheap
steel and is checking on whether Russia, Japan and South Korea are
engaged in dumping, a high-ranking U.S. Commerce Department
official said Friday.
	   United States had feared it would be overwhelmed by cheap Asian
exports because of lower costs and devalued currencies during the
regional economic crisis, U.S. Commerce Under Secretary David L.
Aaron said.
	   But that has not happened _ except in the case of steel.
	   ``The United States is suddenly being inundated by vast
quantities of low-priced steel,'' he told the American Chamber of
Commerce in a speech.
	   Administration officials met last week with the steel industry
and decided to look into it. ``We are going to enforce our trade
laws and we are going to focus on steel,'' Aaron said.
	   Asked later at a news conference which countries were being
looked at as possible steel dumpers, he said Japan, South Korea and
Russia.
	   According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, imports of
steel products from Japan more than doubled in the first half of
the year, compared with the same period a year ago. Korean imports
rose 90 percent and Indonesian imports quadrupled.

Price war to delay Hong Kong economic recovery

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Several major Hong Kong developers have slashed
prices for new apartments, renewing fears of a price war that would
hobble the all-important property sector and delay the territory's
economic recovery.
	   Sluggish sales in the past few months have promoted several
leading developers to cut prices for new condos and apartments this
week, and more developers are expected to join the fray, analysts
say.
	   Prices of used flats are expected to fall as well.
	   Lai Sun Development announced earlier this week it is selling 20
units in a luxurious suburban development at a loss _ 43 percent
lower than when it first went on sale in May. Only 14 of the
84-unit development were sold then.
	   Two other developers also announced late Thursday they were
cutting prices of apartments in two family-oriented developments by
up to 30 percent.
	   ``Due to the absence of cheap liquidity in the banking side,
(developers) are trying to raise cash to cover their capital
expenses,'' said Otto Wong, regional property analyst for Saloman
Smith Barney in Hong Kong.
	   Despite savings for some potential homebuyers, analysts say
these cuts are doing more harm than good.
	   The price war is rattling the already battered confidence of
homebuyers in the market and discouraging them from buying,
analysts say, and this would delay the recovery of the property
sector, and the economy.
	   ``People do have the money to buy flats. But they're not buying
because they have no confidence in the future of the market,'' said
Shih Wing-ching, managing director of Centaline Property Agency,
one of the territory's largest.
	   Saloman's Wong expects prices of both new and used apartments to
drop by 20 percent to 25 percent in the price war.
	   Property prices already have halved since the market peaked last
August, when Hong Kong was still unscathed by the regional
financial contagion.
	   Officials have said they fear the continued free fall in
property prices would damage the relatively healthy banking sector.
	   To stem the price fall, the government has frozen land sales and
lifted anti-speculation regulations. The legislature recently
approved funding for low-interest loans for first-time homebuyers.
	   Property accounts for roughly one in 10 jobs and a third of the
economy, which shrank 5 percent in the second quarter. Job losses
in the property sector are contributing to rising unemployment,
which is at a 15-year high.
	   Many homeowners are suffering as they're stuck with huge
mortgage bills for properties that are worth half as much as a year
ago. Many who gave up their life savings for down payments during
last year's boom have to forfeit the money as careful banks,
already facing a liquidity crunch, refuse to give mortgage loans
during the leaner times.
	   ``The cut-throat price war is cutting the throats of
homeowners,'' the mass-circulation Apple Daily editorialized
Friday.

Indonesia opens up rice imports to private traders after protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS more comment from Indonesia, IMF graf 6, 14 &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-Protest

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Responding to strident student
protests, Indonesia on Friday announced that rice imports would be
opened up to private traders for the first time in 30 years to help
bring down soaring food prices.
	   The government also said it would increase supplies of cheap,
state-subsidized rice for the growing ranks of poor.
	   In another development, Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib
said people convicted of hoarding rice and other goods could be
punished with death, news reports said.
	   ``Those who deliberately hoard, and those who deliberately
misuse the basic needs of the people will be punished harshly,'' he
was quoted by Republika newspaper as saying.
	   The decision to liberalize rice imports was included in an
agreement between the government and the International Monetary
Fund, which is overseeing deep and painful reforms of Indonesia's
ailing economy.
	   Indonesia said its reforms remain on track. However, it and the
IMF acknowleged that immediate steps needed to be taken to fix food
probelms.
	   Value-added tax on rice and other commodities would also be
suspended to help cut costs for consumers struggling to cope as
inflation and unemployment rates skyrocket.
	   Until now rice imports were controlled by the government's food
distributing body, the National Logistics Agency, or Bulog.
	   Rice shortages and rising prices have become a major source of
discontent among Indonesia's 202 million people. Shortages of the
country's No. 1 staple have led to sporadic looting and riots
around the country. In some areas the price of rice has more than
trebled.
	   Ghalib said a 1959 law authorizes the state to use the death
penalty against those who disrupt the supply of food.
	   The problem is shaping up as a key political issue for Habibie
as he attempts to turn around Indonesia's ailing economy and
institute democratic reforms following the resignation of his
autocratic predecessor President Suharto last May.
	   In the agreement with the IMF, released Friday, the government
said its program to supply subsidized rice would be extended to 7.5
million families from 2 million now.
	   The government said domestic market prices for rice are
currently close to international prices.
	   In a statement, the Jakarta office of the IMF said a monthly
review of Indonesia's reforms would be considered by the fund's
Washington-based board later this month when the latest dlrs 1
billion aid installment of a multi-billion rescue package would be
released.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A bomb explosion in northern Jaffna's
city hall on Friday killed the mayor and the area's military and
police commanders and 17 others, military officials in Jaffna said.
	   The attack came just four months after the mayor's predecessor
was assassinated.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but military
officials said the bombing bore the hallmarks of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which is fighting for a homeland for
minority Tamils.
	   Civil administration in the area by moderate Tamils like Mayor
Ponnuthurai Sivapalan undermines the influence the rebels have over
the population.
	   Brigadier Susantha Mendis, the garrison commander of Jaffna,
Superintendent Chandra Perera, the city's police chief, six other
police officers, and an army officer were among the dead, officials
said.
	   Two foreign aid workers were among those killed in the explosion
in the Thinnaveli suburb of the city, said the officials, who asked
not to be named. It was not immediately clear which organizations
they worked for, nor what their nationalities were.
	   The victims were in a morning meeting about traffic arrangements
in Jaffna, a city dotted by sandbagged military checkpoints, when
the explosion occurred. It was not immediately clear if the bomb
had been planted in city hall, or was carried by a suicide bomber.
	   Rescue workers were digging through the rubble of city hall,
unsure whether more people were in the building at the time,
according to military officials reached by telephone in Jaffna.
	   The city's streets were deserted as the war-scarred city's
residents retreated into their homes, fearful of further violence.
	   Mayor Sivapalan, 46, took office in June after his predecessor
Sarojini Yogeswaran was shot and killed by two gunmen at her Jaffna
home on May 17. The previously unknown Sangilian Force claimed
responsibility for Yogeswaran's death, but the military says it is
a front group of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the main
rebel group in Sri Lanka's ethnic war.
	   Yogeswaran had been elected in the first vote in 15 years in
Jaffna, a once bustling cultural center transformed into a
bombed-out shell by the war. Jaffna is 300 kilometers (186 miles)
north of Colombo.
	   Tamil Tiger rebels had seized the city in 1990 and proclaimed a
government for the more than 1 million people who live in northern
Sri Lanka, where Tamils predominate. Sri Lanka's army retook the
city in 1995 after a 50-day offensive and ruled there until local
elections were held in a bid to restore normalcy.
	   Rebels continue to attack Jaffna from surrounding jungles.
	   The rebels say Sri Lanka's Tamil minority can only prosper in an
independent own homeland in the north and east, separate from the
areas where the Sinhalese majority predominates.
	   Many of Sri Lanka's 3.3 million Tamils, who make up 18 percent
of the population, accuse the Sinhalese of discrimination, though
few support the extreme solution proposed by the rebels.

Ukrainian court needs money for trial against accused mass killers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Two men accused of killing 52 people are to
go on trial soon, but a court in central Ukraine says it urgently
needs money to bring in hundreds of witnesses to testify, a
newspaper reported Friday.
	   The regional court in Zhytomyr needs some 100,000 hryvna (dlrs
40,000) to cover travel expenses for 400 people who can offer
evidence against Anatoliy Onuprienko and Serhiy Rogozin, the daily
Segodnya said.
	   Ukraine's Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that the trial
be held in Zhytomyr because most of the murders were committed
there.
	   However, the trial will not start before the end of September
because the Zhytomyr court does not have the money to invite the
witnesses.
	   Onuprienko and Rogozin were arrested in the spring of 1996 after
a manhunt that lasted three-and-a-half months.
	   The two men are accused of a killing spree in Zhytomyr region
and western Lviv region that stunned the country. Entire families
were killed in several instances, and at least 10 of the victims
were children.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Ruling party supporters fired guns,
threw rocks and swung clubs at vastly outnumbered opposition
protesters Friday as strongman Hun Sen turned to plainclothes mobs
to crush growing calls for his ouster. At least one person was
killed and several wounded.
	   Hun Sen used crowds in street clothes _ many of whom appeared to
be police and soldiers _ instead of uniformed police a day after
King Norodom Sihanouk appealed to the army and police to stop
shooting and beating peaceful protesters and Buddhist monks.
	   Human-rights workers reported that an opposition supporter was
chased down, beaten, shot in the back and killed, bringing the
total of connfirmed deaths since Monday to four. A pool of blood
and his hat remained at the site.
	   Despite the violence, anti-Hun Sen demonstrators regrouped later
Friday and staged a protest march from the central market _ where
they were initially dispersed by police firing over their heads _
to the Independence Monument. Their numbers swelled from 150 to
about 1,200.
	   Sihanouk, who treads a fine line as constitutional monarch,
balanced the implicit criticism of Hun Sen by pressuring the
opposition leaders _ his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and Sam
Rainsy _ to drop threats to boycott the National Assembly when it
meets Sept. 24.
	   The opposition accuses Hun Sen of winning parliamentary
elections July 26 by massive fraud and vows to withhold the
two-thirds majority support he needs to form a new government.
	   If they fail to take their seats, Sihanouk warned, they will not
have parliamentary immunity.
	   ``I cannot be helpful to you if you experience any danger or
anything eventually happens to you,'' the king said.
	   Week-long violence, the worst since Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh in
a coup last year, took a bizarre twist when 2,000 backers of Hun
Sen's Cambodian People's Party, carrying clubs and guns, gathered
near the Independence Monument.
	   ``We are looking for the losers. They are trouble-makers,'' said
Chan Lay, 42, who reeked of alcohol. He carried a club and a pistol
protruded from his shirt.
	   They headed toward a gathering of 300 opposition protesters
about six blocks away near the U.S. Embassy and Ranariddh's home.
Warned of the advance, the opposition started to move from the
area.
	   Turning onto a side street, they were confronted by six security
guards from a seedy hotel who opened fire with pistols. At least
three men were taken to a clinic with gunshot wounds to their legs.
	   The two groups finally met on a side street, which erupted into
a rock-throwing battleground. Gunfire crackled from the Hun Sen
crowd. Opposition supporters fled on motorbikes and foot down
narrow, pot-holed streets.
	   Riot police who have acted as Hun Sen's shock troops since he
launched a crackdown Monday against weeks of peaceful protest
calling for his ouster deployed only after the blood-letting. They
gave the pro-Hun Sen crowd _ some of whom were reportedly paid _
bread and water.
	   ``Police have been ordered not to intervene, just to protect
certain places,'' said government spokesman Khieu Kanharith. ``We
have only ordered the ambulances to be ready.''
	   A boy shot in the leg refused to enter an ambulance to take him
to the capital's Calmette hospital, seen as a bastion of Hun Sen
support. No other wounded were taken to Calmette.
	   Belief is widespread that a Buddhist monk reportedly slain in a
police charge Wednesday and taken by the ambulance never reached
the hospital. Many monks have been beaten and wounded in the
protests. Rumors that several have died intensified public anger.
	   The Hun Sen crowd got drunk on bottles of potent rice wine and
carried signs on bamboo staves that quickly turned into clubs.
Organizers gave orders on walkie-talkies. Onlookers did not join
them, a contrast to thousands who swelled an opposition march
Thursday.
	   Mok Ban, 40, held up a club as thick as his arm and said he
supported the opposition's right to protest, but not to create
tension.
	   ``That's why we have come to suppress them, to stop them from
disrupting people's businesses,'' Mok Ban said. ``Our patience is
running short.''

Hong Kong shares tumble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong tumbled Friday, with
the key index losing 3.5 percent on the back of sharp falls on U.S.
and Japanese markets.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 271.48 points to close at 7,578.48. On Thursday, the index had
slumped 283.80 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 5.38 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
689 million), up from Thursday's 4.71 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 603 million).
	   Brokers said share prices opened lower in reaction to overnight
falls on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell
249.48 points to 7,615.54, amid fears that U.S. President Bill
Clinton may be forced to resign or be impeached.
	   Sharp declines on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Friday also pushed
down Hong Kong shares, brokers said .
	   Tokyo's key 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slumped 749.05
points, or 5.12 percent, closing at 13,916.98, in the biggest
single-day point fall this year.
	   Investors are worried about a global selloff because of an
economic crisis that has spread from Asia and Russia to Latin
America.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong fell 1.00 Hong Kong dollar to
33.00, and Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 80 cents to 25.40.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 4.00 dollars to
151.50, and Hang Seng Bank fell 2.30 dollars to 45.40.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa 1.10 dollars to 36.90, and Swire
Pacific ``A'' fell 35 cents to 21.90.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ An explosion ripped through a
liquified petroleum gas filling station in a city west of Seoul on
Friday, injuring at least 30 people, police said.
	   Thousands of people fled their homes as fire, touched off by the
explosion, raged out of control and spread to nearby buildings in
Puchon, 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Seoul.
	   Television footage showed columns of black smoke rising from the
station, which had hundreds of barrel-shaped tanks stored inside.
	   At least 20 fire engines rushed to the scene, but efforts to
extinguish the fire were hampered by the danger of more explosions.
The fire was extinguished in three hours after most of the gas
stored in the station had been consumed by the flames.
	   Police said 30 people, including eight firefighters, were
hospitalized with burns and other injuries.
	   The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.
	   ``I heard a loud bang, and I turned and saw flames from a taxi
filling its gas tank. Soon there were a series of explosions,'' Kim
Sun-jin, a witness, told SBS-TV.
	   Scores of taxis and other cars were scorched in the explosion
and several adjacent buildings were engulfed in flames, police
said. The blast also shattered windowpanes in the neighborhood.
	   Police closed roads and cut off electricity to the region to
prevent more explosions. The area houses scores of small factories.
	   Liquid petroleum gas is widely used at homes and taxicabs in
South Korea.

Hamas threatens revenge after top fugitives are killed by Israel
</HEADLINE>

CORRECTS first name of witness to Shukri, sted Shokali &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Islamic militants on Friday threatened
to carry out more bombings in Israel to avenge two top Hamas
fugitives killed by Israeli troops in a raid of their hideout.
	   Bracing for new attacks, Israel sealed off the West Bank and
Gaza Strip to keep Palestinians out of Israel. Hamas has carried
out more than a dozen bombings in Israel since 1994.
	   The new tension came as U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross shuttled
between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in hopes of concluding
a deal on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   A new outbreak of violence would make it exceedingly difficult
for Ross to negotiate a breakthrough and end a 17-month stalemate.
	   On the third day of his mission, Ross was to meet later Friday
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The two Hamas fugitives, brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, were
killed Thursday afternoon in a remote house surrounded by vineyards
and orchards west of the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, hinted that the Awadallah
brothers were killed in a carefully planned ambush.
	   ``This is another example of terrorists known for killing
Israelis being pursued wherever they are,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Shukri Fetaftah, an area resident, said a truck and four vans
carrying dozens of people in civilian clothes drove up to the house
at about 4 p.m. Thursday. Fetaftah said he heard shots about 10
minutes later. Afterwards, army jeeps and ambulances arrived.
	   The army would only say that troops raided the home after shots
and an explosion were heard and that the two fugitives were killed
in a gun battle with soldiers.
	   Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said the group would retaliate.
	   ``We can be certain that Israel will pay a high price for this
crime,'' Zahar told The Associated Press. ``Hamas operatives can
attack any Israeli targets.''
	   Zahar suggested Hamas would retaliate with suicide bombings,
just as it did when its chief bombmaker was assassinated in January
1996 in an operation widely attributed to Israel.
	   At the time, Hamas carried out four bombings that killed dozens
of Israelis, disrupted peace talks and brought Israel's hardline
leader, Netanyahu, to power.
	   At the Awadallah brothers' home in the West Bank town of El
Bireh, a wake was hastily arranged. Dozens of mourners came to the
home, with women sitting in a circle in the living room and
slapping their faces in an expression of grief. Verses of the Koran
were played at low volume on a small tape recorder.
	   The family said it had not yet received official word that the
brothers had been killed.
	   Adel Awadallah, commander of the Hamas military wing Izzedine al
Qassam in the West Bank, headed Israel's most wanted list. Israel
believed he masterminded several suicide bombings.
	   Imad Awadallah, also a leading figure in Izzedine al Qassam,
escaped from a Palestinian jail last month. He had been held on
suspicion that he killed a fellow Hamas fugitive, Mohiyedine
Sharif, in a fight over power and money.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Already tense relations between
Afghanistan and its powerful neighbor Iran have been strained
further by the Taliban religious militia admitting that its troops
killed a group of missing Iranian diplomats.
	   For weeks, Iran has been pressing the Taliban, which controls 90
percent of Afghanistan, though diplomatic channels and with shows
of military force over the fate of the 11 Iranians. The group
vanished during an Aug. 8 battle in which the Taliban seized the
northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   On Thursday, the Taliban army said the bodies of nine of the
missing Iranians were found this week, and admitted that they had
been killed by the religious army's own troops. The Taliban made
the disclosure in a letter from their supreme leader, Mullah Omar,
to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The U.N. condemned the
killings.
	   Tehran called the killings as ``a shocking and horrifying
atrocity which is contrary to international codes and norms.'' Iran
has also said it plans new, massive military exercises on the
Afghan border in what outside experts fear could be a prelude to
military retaliation.
	   Iran said it also held Pakistan, a Taliban ally, responsible for
the deaths.
	   Pakistan's foreign ministry on Friday responded by saying it
``noted with regret that the government of Iran blamed Pakistan for
this tragic incident.'' The statement also urged Iran and
Afghanistan to show restraint, and solve their disputes peacefully.
	   The nine Iranians ``either intentionally or unintentionally,
have been killed by unidentified soldiers'' of the Taliban, Mullah
Omar's letter said. He stressed that the soldiers acted on their
own. There was no word on the fate of the two other missing
Iranians.
	   For weeks, the Taliban has denied any knowledge of the missing
diplomats, suggesting that they fled or were with the troops of a
northern alliance that is fighting the Taliban. Hours before Mullah
Omar admitted the killings, a top Taliban official told The
Associated Press in Islamabad that the envoys had been killed by
opponents wanting to sour relations between Iran and the Taliban.
	   Iran's state-controlled television claimed to have evidence that
Mullah Omar personally ordered the storming of the Iranian
consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif, but did not present proof.
	   However, Mullah Omar has said the battle for Mazar-e-Sharif was
so fierce that the Taliban had no time to consider the Iranian
diplomats.
	   ``It was a big offensive,'' the reclusive leader said in a rare
radio interview broadcast by the BBC on Aug. 31. ``Neither my
military commanders or I paid attention to ... whether the Iranian
diplomats were there ... (or) our reaction to them.''
	   Iran's Foreign Ministry said it ``reserved the right to defend
its people against aggression'' without saying what action it would
take. It demanded the immediate return of the diplomats' bodies and
the release of all Iranians held in Afghanistan. Mullah Omar
promised to cooperate in returning the bodies.
	   Last week, Iran conducted a massive exercise, with 70,000
troops, warplanes and tanks, on the Afghan border, and earlier
Thursday announced plans for more maneuvers on the Afghan border.
No date for the new exercises was announced. The Taliban accuses
Iran of supporting the northern alliances in Afghanistan's civil
war.

Buddhist temple defends sculptures of Thai politicians

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Buddhist temple in Bangkok is
defending its sculptures of Thai politicians, saying criticism by
sensitive lawmakers is an attack upon freedom of expression.
	   ``It is about freedom of thought, imagination, and expression,''
said Phra Sophon Dhammavongse, the abbot of Wat In Temple. ``Every
artist deserves the right to create their work independently and
their works tell stories.''
	   Buddhist temples in Thailand frequently have limestone statues
of mythical figures, Chinese mandarins and even 17th century
Western soldiers, in their courtyards.
	   Wat In, however, also has small statues of Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai, Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart and former Prime
Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.
	   The statues, created by artist Samruay Am-oj, were carved in
1994 and are somewhat comical in their caricatures of the
politicians.
	   The Nation newspaper said on Friday that they drew little
attention until recently, when Chavalit heard about them and
surreptitiously sent an underling to photograph them, apparently
concerned they were defamatory.
	   On Thursday, Chalerm Yubamrung, the deputy leader of Chavalit's
party, accused the ruling Democrats led by Chuan and Sanan of using
the statues as a black magic weapon against his party.
	   He said it was insulting that Sanan's statues was riding on the
back of Chavalit's.
	   ``This government is relying on superstition to destroy its
opponents,'' Chalerm was quoted in The Nation as saying. ``If the
government is going this far, we won't do business with it.''
	   Temple guard Mali Buaya said, however that the statues are
anything but sinister.
	   ``Western tourists like it,'' he said, adding that the
sculptures elicit laughter from most Thai visitors.

Greenpeace activists arrested for seizing waste shipping facility
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LARYMNA, Greece (AP) _ Authorities on Friday arrested nine
Greenpeace activists for seizing waste shipping facilities owned by
Greece's largest ferronickel producer, the environmental
organization said.
	   Port authorities used divers to arrest the activists, who had
been floating in the sea by the dock at a loading and processing
facility owned by state-controlled Larco in Larymna, 130 kilometers
(81 miles) north of Athens, it added.
	   Greenpeace members have been preventing waste dumping ships from
sailing from the facility since Sunday.
	   The activists are protesting the company's dumping of rust, a
byproduct in nickel manufacture, into the nearby Euboean Gulf,
claiming it causes severe environmental problems to the water and
marine life.
	   Larco says it has a government license to dump the rust, which
it claims is harmless to the environment.
	   The arrests came four days after another 12 Greenpeace members
were arrested for chaining themselves to the facility's loading
docks. All 12 were released the next day without being charged.

Hamas threatens revenge after top fugitives are killed by Israel

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Responding to the killing of two top
Hamas fugitives by Israel, Islamic militants threatened Friday to
detonate suicide bombings in the Jewish state and the Israeli army
sealed the West Bank and Gaza Strip to prevent possible attacks.
	   The new tension came as U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross shuttled
between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in hopes of concluding
a deal on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   A new outbreak of violence would make it exceedingly difficult
for Ross to negotiate a breakthrough and end a 17-month stalemate.
	   On the third day of his mission, Ross was to meet Friday with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The two Hamas fugitives, brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, were
killed Thursday afternoon in a remote house surrounded by vineyards
and orchards west of the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, hinted that the Awadallah
brothers were killed in a carefully planned ambush.
	   ``This is another example of terrorists known for killing
Israelis being pursued wherever they are,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Shukri Fetaftah, an area resident, said a truck and four vans
carrying dozens of people in civilian clothes drove up to the house
at about 4 p.m. Thursday. Fetaftah said he heard shots about 10
minutes later. Afterwards, army jeeps and ambulances arrived.
	   The army would only say that troops raided the home after shots
and an explosion were heard and that the two fugitives were killed
in a gun battle with soldiers.
	   Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin called the leaders of the group
together and announced that Hamas would retaliate. ``We will not
forget the blood of our martyrs,'' said Yassin.
	   Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said that ``Israel will pay a high
price for this crime.'' He suggested Hamas would retaliate with
suicide bombings, just as it did when its chief bombmaker was
assassinated in January 1996 in an operation attributed to Israel.

Six Commonwealth Games later, Scottish lawn bowler still vying for

medals &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Nearly a quarter-century ago,
Scottish lawn bowler Willie Wood flew to New Zealand for his first
Commonwealth Games. Now 60 years old, he's still on the team.
	   Wood, who is bidding for a fifth Commonwealth medal, is a garage
owner who grew up bowling on the green in his tiny village of
Gifford because there was little else to do. Over the decades, it
has evolved into an inseparable part of his life.
	   ``I've really never had a holiday all my married life,'' he said
Friday. ``I just used my holidays to play tournaments.''
	   Luckily, Wood's wife bowls too. But she didn't join him on the
trip to Kuala Lumpur, where he is competing in the sixth
Commonwealth Games of his generation-spanning career.
	   The games, grouping athletes from nations that were former
British colonies, opened Friday. They are held every four years.
	   Wood missed the 1986 edition in Edinburgh, Scotland, because he
had played a couple of professional tournaments and was banned
because only amateurs were allowed.
	   The object of lawn bowls is to roll a ball with flattened sides,
one heavier than the other, as close as possible to a smaller ball
at the other end of the grass. Today's players, Wood said, rely as
much on power as the ability to ``draw,'' or curve the ball in an
arc toward the target.
	   ``It's more a game of skittles now. The young ones just hammer
them up the middle,'' said Wood, whose father was a Scottish lawn
bowls champion. ``It's not a game of drawing skill. It's taken a
bit of that away.''
	   The veteran says conditions in Malaysia are tough because the
tropical humidity and slow greens weigh down the ball.
	   But Wood doesn't mind the slow pace.
	   He wistfully recalls the lawns at his first Commonwealth Games
in Christchurch, New Zealand in 1974, where the ball would drift
leisurely across the grass, taking as long as 23 seconds to roll to
a stop.
	   ``You could throw your ball, stand around, light a cigarette,
and your ball hadn't arrived,'' Wood said.
	   The silver-haired Wood is sprightly and cheerful, but doubts
he'll compete in the 2002 games, to be held in Manchester, England.
	   ``I don't think so,'' he said, chuckling. ``We'll see when the
time comes.''

Havel lobbying for new RFE broadcast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel is trying
to persuade his Cabinet to drop objections to planned Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty broadcasts to Iran and Iraq, a spokesman was
quoted Friday as saying.
	   The U.S. government-funded radio station, which operates out of
Prague, intends to start its broadcasts by the end of September.
But the Cabinet of Milos Zeman expressed its doubts last month
about the program's objectivity and potential terrorist risks for
the Czech Republic.
	   It remains unclear whether the government would move to actively
block the broadcasts.
	   Havel stepped in after receiving a letter Tuesday from U.S. Rep.
Benjamin A. Gilman, the New York Republican who chairs the House
International Relations Committee, urging the president to help.
	   ``My colleagues and I thus very much hope you will work with
Prime Minister Zeman ... to ensure that RFE/RL will be able to
begin its broadcasts to Iran and Iraq this fall,'' said the letter,
published Friday by the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes.
	   Havel spokesman Ladislav Spacek said the president spoke to
Zeman and Foreign Minister Jan Kavan on the issue. Havel was unable
to immediately change the Cabinet's position, but the aide
indicated the government seemed unlikely to block the broadcasts,
according to the daily.
	   Havel's spokesmen could not immediately be reached for comment
Friday.
	   The agreement to start the controversial broadcasts was made
between U.S. authorities and the previous government of Josef
Tosovsky.
	   Zeman expects an official request from the U.S. government
asking for permission to go ahead. He also plans to monitor the
broadcasts for objectivity until the end of the year.

Russian political crisis nears resolution; economy awaits action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Primakov appealing for time, new details
throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Friday
a new government would need time to tackle Russia's economic crisis
and he appealed to all political factions for support.
	   Primakov, whose appointment was expected to be confirmed by
lawmakers later Friday, was keeping quiet about his likely economic
policies. He told political leaders they should give the next
government up to a year before deciding if it was succeeding or
not.
	   ``I am for consolidation of all political forces and
mobilization of all efforts in order to come out of the crisis and
preserve Russia as a strong state,'' he was quoted as saying by the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   President Boris Yeltsin said a major crisis had been avoided by
compromise and that Primakov had strong backing from all sides. He
called for measures to stabilize prices, restore supplies to shops
and prop up the banking system.
	   ``I understand that it's hard for everyone, but one cannot give
in to emotions ... we'll have to draw lessons from the current
crisis and now we'll have to work on overcoming it,'' Yeltsin said
in a television address to the nation.
	   Communist lawmakers said they expected some of their supporters
to be named to posts in the new Cabinet, but Primakov said it was
too early to speak of policies or appointments.
	   Communist deputy Yuri Maslyukov, a Soviet-era economic official,
would likely be first deputy prime minister for economic affairs,
Duma deputies said. Maslyukov is a technocrat who until recently
was trade and industry minister.
	   Meanwhile, opposition and pro-government political leaders
hailed Yeltsin's decision to nominate Primakov for premier.
	   ``Common sense has prevailed in our state,'' Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov said Thursday. Zyuganov spearheaded the opposition
to the previous candidate for premier, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   Primakov, a former KGB spy chief respected across the political
spectrum, will need to quickly assemble a Cabinet to deal with the
most severe economic crisis since the Soviet collapse. The ruble
has plummeted, industrial production is stagnant and the government
is broke.
	   Despite such deep economic problems, Primakov's nomination
raised hopes on Russia's battered markets. The price of the ruble
was between 10 and 12 to the U.S. dollar _ up from 17 last Friday.
	   Primakov, 68, is supported by all but one of parliament's
factions. He is seen as a technocrat, non-ideological and loyal to
Yeltsin.
	   The low-key, publicity shy foreign minister appears more
comfortable handling discreet diplomatic negotiations than enduring
the glare of publicity that his new job will bring.
	   As foreign minister, Primakov won praise at home for his efforts
to restore some of Russia's diminished international clout and
create a ``multipolar'' world designed to counterbalance U.S.
dominance.
	   Primakov has cool but cordial relations with the United States.
There has been periodic friction over his desire to ease sanctions
against Iraq, maintain nuclear cooperation with Iran, and resist
NATO's expansion.
	   Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev picked him as one of his
closest aides during the reform period of the late 1980s.
	   He entered the international spotlight at the end of 1990 when,
shortly before the Gulf War began, he made several high-profile
trips to Iraq and tried unsuccessfully to persuade Saddam Hussein
to withdraw from Kuwait.
	   Primakov was briefly first deputy director of the KGB, the main
Soviet security organization in 1991. After the Soviet breakup, he
served as head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service until
Yeltsin named him foreign minister in 1996.
	   Yeltsin settled on Primakov after parliament twice rejected
Chernomyrdin, with opposition leaders vowing to vote him down again
on a third and final vote.

Fiorio joins Minardi team for 1999, leaving Prost
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONZA, Italy (AP) _ Cesare Fiorio will leave the French team
Prost Peugeot at the end of this year to become sporting director
of Fondmetal Minardi in the 1999 World Formula One Championship.
	   Giancarlo Minardi, owner of the Italian team, announced Fiorio's
transfer to Minardi on Friday, on the eve of the Italian Grand Prix
at Monza.
	   Minardi also said his cars will be again powered by Ford engines
next season. The Italian team will use VJ engines with customized
modifications.
	   Fiorio, a former general director of the Ferrari team, has been
with the French team directed by former F-1 driver Alain Prost
since 1997 after leading Ligier from 1994 through 1996.
	   ``I'm deeply motivated by this challenge ... it also gives me
considerable pleasure coming home to work,'' Fiorio said.

IBM chief: computer networks key to saving China's state firms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BEJ101
 &UR; By ELAINE KURTENBACH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) - China's struggling state-owned industries need
advanced computer systems to sort out their management woes and
compete in world markets, IBM chief executive Louis V. Gerstner
said Friday.
	   Gerstner, who has led IBM's own recent comeback to
competitiveness, said unprofitable state industries need such
systems to manage cost control, personnel, accounting, billing,
plant floors and customer services.
	   ``China has the hardware. Now it is absolutely critical that
China build the software and services needed to go along with the
hardware,'' Gerstner said in a speech to executives at a Beijing
hotel.
	   China is in the midst of an unprecedented effort to turn
unprofitable state-owned companies that have long survived on easy
credit from government-run banks into corporations that can compete
on world markets.
	   In the process, tens of thousands of factories are being closed
down and millions of workers laid off. Larger and stronger
corporations are being pushed to acquire weaker ones as entire
industries are restructured.
	   ``It's not sufficient to just push companies together,''
Gerstner said. ``What's really necessary is a lot of hard work in
fixing systems within organizations, measuring costs, inventories,
customers, supply chains ... all have to be rebuilt within an
enterprise.''
	   Gerstner speaks from experience. Since he became chairman in
1993, IBM's revenue per employee has risen 58 percent. He has been
praised for sharply cutting costs and boosting revenue in areas
other than mainframe computer sales, such as advising other
companies on how to set up computer systems.
	   Gerstner acknowledged that initially, computer systems would
eliminate traditional jobs _ a serious concern in a country like
China, where state firms have long served as virtual welfare
agencies.
	   ``All revolutionary transformations initially destroy jobs, but
then they tend to be a net creator of jobs and those jobs tend to
be higher paying,'' he said.
	   IBM sees vast opportunities for its business in China being
created by the government's sweeping reforms, Gerstner said.
	   Most Chinese firms still rely on old-fashioned bookkeeping and
abacuses to conduct business, although use of computers is
spreading rapidly.
	   IBM has sold information systems to Chinese financial,
metallurgical, petroleum, transportation, manufacturing and
distribution firms.
	   Reflecting Gerstner's own emphasis on developing computer
services, IBM has set up teams of experts in China to specialize in
individual industries or businesses and is developing Chinese
language operating systems and products.
	   IBM employs about 2,000 people in its China operations and 3,000
others send in IBM joint ventures, with a total investment of about
dlrs 200 million.

World Food Program mounts relief effort
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Launching one of its biggest operations, a U.N. food
agency will provide emergency relief for 20 million people left
destitute by the worst flooding in a decade in Bangladesh.
	   The Rome-based World Food Program said Friday it will provide
175 tons of biscuits, 352,400 tons of wheat and 3,500 tons of
blended foods in an operation costing dlrs 76 million.
	   Floods have submerged much of Bangladesh, claiming more than 850
lives, displacing more than a quarter of the country's 124 million
people and destroying an estimated 2.3 million tons of rice.
	   ``In terms of numbers of people to be assisted, this will be the
biggest emergency operation in WFP's history,'' said the agency's
executive director, Catherine Bertini.

Dissidents urge Thai army chief to call off visit to Myanmar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Exiled dissidents from Myanmar urged
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai on Friday to reschedule a trip to
Myanmar by his top general because it will coincide with the
anniversary of the military government's takeover.
	   Army Commander in Chief Gen. Chetta Thanajaro is scheduled to
visit Myanmar, also known as Burma, from Sept. 15-18. It will be
his final trip to Thailand's western neighbor as he is scheduled to
retire this year.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in
various guises since 1962. The current military government came to
power on Sept. 18, 1988 after brutally crushing a nationwide
democracy movement.
	   The All Burma Students Democratic Front asked Chuan in a letter
on Friday to urge the army chief to reschedule his trip.
	   ``Thailand is a democratic country and the military government
in Burma killed many people in 1988. Recently they have arrested
nearly a thousand members of opposition parties,'' said Aung Naing
Oo, chairman of the ABSDF.
	   He said Chetta's trip would create a negative image for the Thai
government and the Myanmar military would use the visit for
propaganda.

Asian markets follow Wall Street's lead with another slump
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with 7 grafs to UPDATE dollar-yen figure and closings of
the Hong Kong and Singapore stock markets.
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ignoring the good news about Russia, Asia's top
three stock markets fell sharply Friday, following the lead of
U.S., Latin American and European bourses instead.
	   Growing concerns about the future of American President Bill
Clinton also were blamed for the latest slump in the stock markets,
and another weakening of the U.S. dollar.
	   ``Unfortunately, what's good or bad for the U.S. is good or bad
for Asia'' and the rest of the world, said Eugene Chung, Asia
strategist at Warburg Dillon Read (HK) Ltd., in Hong Kong.
	   Japan's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average plummeted 749.05 points,
or 5.12 percent, to close at 13,916.98. It was the largest one-day
point fall this year. The finish also was just above the Nikkei's
12-year closing low of 13,915.63 set on Aug. 28.
	   In another sign of turbulence, the dollar fell once again,
buying 130.78 yen in late afternoon trading, down 4.92 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo. That figure also was below its late New
York level of 134.23 yen overnight.
	   Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 271.48 points, or 3.5
percent, to close at 7,578.48 Friday. Traders said the stock market
was taking a breather from recent gains. However, they also
acknowledged that the sharp falls in the New York and Tokyo bourses
were hurting the sentiment in Hong Kong.
	   In Singapore, where the market has been battered by capital
controls recently imposed by neighboring Malaysia, shares opened
lower and by the end of the day the Straits Times Index was down
11.81 points, or 1.3 percent, to 853.19 points.
	   On Thursday, Boris Yeltsin named a compromise candidate for
prime minister, defusing a dangerous power struggle that had
stalled efforts to tackle Russia's economic crisis.
	   The ruble and the Russian stock market quickly rebounded, and
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov was expected to win swift and
resounding approval by parliament. But Asia's markets were far more
influenced Friday by the wave of anxiety that had swept through
Washington and world markets the day before.
	   On Thursday, news reports indicated that independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's referral to the U.S. Congress accuses Clinton of
perjury and obstruction of justice, and contains evidence that
prosecutors contend shows impeachable offenses.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average responded by
finishing the day 249.48 points, or 3.2 percent, lower at 7,615.54.
That was more than 1,700 points, or 18.4 percent, below the July 17
record that the Dow had set at 9,337.97.
	   Combined with Wednesday's 155-point loss, the drop more than
wiped out the record 380 points that the Dow gained on Tuesday amid
hopes the U.S. Federal Reserve may intervene in the battle against
global economic distress by lowering U.S. interest rates.
	   The day's world stock selloff was highlighted by two trading
halts in Brazil, where the main stock index plunged 15 percent.
	   And in Europe, Frankfurt's DAX index fell 5.8 percent, London's
FT-SE 100 dropped 3.3 percent, and the CAC-40 in Paris was down 4.6
percent.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong tumbled Friday, with
the key index losing 3.5 percent on the back of sharp falls on U.S.
and Japanese markets.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 271.48 points to close at 7,578.48. On Thursday, the index had
lost 55.49 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 5.38 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
689 million), up from Thursday's 4.71 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 603 million).
	   Brokers said share prices opened lower in reaction to overnight
falls on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell
249.48 points to 7,615.54, amid fears that U.S. President Bill
Clinton may be forced to resign or be impeached.
	   Sharp declines on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Friday also pushed
down Hong Kong shares, brokers said .
	   Tokyo's key 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slumped 749.05
points, or 5.12 percent, closing at 13,916.98, in the biggest
single-day point fall this year.
	   Investors are worried about a global selloff because of an
economic crisis that has spread from Asia and Russia to Latin
America.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong fell 1.00 Hong Kong dollar to
33.00, and Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 80 cents to 25.40.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 4.00 dollars to

Kosovo refugees' suffering continues despite new appeals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with Rugova's quotes, trims &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTINIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The main political leader of Kosovo
Albanians on Friday joined a chorus of calls for a halt to Serb
military actions in Kosovo, where a huge new exodus of civilians
has alarmed international refugee officials.
	   Ibrahim Rugova described the situation in Kosovo as critical and
worsening, although he stopped short of his usual calls for Western
intervention to stop the Serb advance.
	   ``The humanitarian crisis is very grave, especially involving
the people who have fled to the mountains,'' he said in Kosovo's
capital Pristina.
	   Rugova estimated that 40,000 people are involved in the flight
from besieged villages in the southwest this week; international
officials have put the figure at about 25,000.
	   Despite the appeals, many of the ethnic Albanian refugees who
fled the Serb attacks in western Kosovo are losing hope.
	   Thousands remained camped around the southwestern Kosovo village
of Istinic, where they sought refuge from Serb-led Yugoslav forces
seeking to destroy the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army. Many
are losing hope.
	   ``This is what we sleep on,'' said Zenia Krasniqi, pointing to a
rain-soaked field, her third place of refuge since twice fleeing
Serb attacks. ``I will die here even if I have to hang myself from
this tree.''
	   U.N. officials, including Undersecretary-General Olara Otunnu,
planned to visit the refugees Friday. They hope their presence will
discourage police from arresting males suspected of links to the
KLA.
	   The KLA insists on independence for Kosovo from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians comprise some 90
percent of the province's population.
	   For now, Serb forces appear to have halted their advance, which
drove ethnic Albanians from their homes and farms into a huge
encampment around this village 75 kilometers (45 miles) southwest
of Pristina.
	   Parked tractors stretched for more than two kilometers (one
mile) from the center of the village, hooked to trailers piled high
with hurriedly gathered clothes and belongings.
	   Until this week's attacks, the Istinic area was one of the last
strongholds of the KLA.
	   Rrok Berisha, a member of Kosovo's unauthorized ethnic Albanian
parliament, said most of the refugees fled 40 nearby villages
shelled by police in the past few days.
	   Berisha said he feared 100,000 refugees could stream into the
area as more villages are cleared.
	   Refugees said they feared police soon would begin rounding up
men of fighting age on suspicion they had fought in the KLA. A
village elder in Istinic said about 40 men and women injured by
shelling fled into the hills Wednesday, fearing arrest. Another
refugee said six young men had been beaten by police.
	   In Belgrade, chief Yugoslav prosecutor Vukasin Jokanovic
declared that Serb troops had crushed the rebels and arrested ``a
large number'' of them. Jankovic said many ``terrorists'' would
soon face trial for ``terrorism and conspiracy against the state.''
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council issued yet another appeal
Thursday to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to ``halt all
repressive actions against the civilian population.''
	   John Shattuck, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human
Rights, warned again Thursday that Kosovo is headed for a
humanitarian catastrophe as the harsh Balkan winter approaches.
	   Kosovo fighting already has created an estimated 265,000
refugees. Western officials fear the worst if urgent help isn't
provided for the 50,000 or so living in the hills and forests,
especially with the arrival of winter in about six weeks.

Task force urges Japanese companies to speed preparations for year
</HEADLINE>
2000

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese companies should wind up their programs to
counter the millennium computer bug problem by next June, a
government panel set up to coordinate the efforts recommended
Friday.
	   The recommendation came in a report compiled by a special task
force chaired by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi called the Advanced
Information and Telecommunications Society Promotion Headquarters.
	   The report encouraged large firms to test their readiness for
the potential turn-of-the-century crisis by staging mock exercises
no later than June, 1999. Government-run computers which have a
substantial impact on people's welfare will be required to meet
this deadline, it said.
	   Experts say computers around the world could be vulnerable to
systemic crashes on the first day of the 21st century. Many
computers were programmed to recognize years by the last two
digits, so they may mistake January 1, 2000 for Jan. 1, 1900.
	   Japan has faced criticism that it has been slow to deal with the
so-called Year 2000 problem.
	   The Tokyo Stock Exchange said last month that less than 10
percent of 1,549 companies which responded to a recent survey said
they had completed their millennium bug preparations.
	   The Japanese panel instructed government agencies and ministries
to start compiling _ and then make public _ data tracking their
internal progress in coping with the problem on a quarterly basis.
	   Agencies and ministries will also be required to gauge the
efforts of private companies in industries under their jurisdiction
by carrying out spot checks every three months, the results of
which will be publicly released, the report said.

Turkish coast guards stop immigrants half way to Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DATCA, Turkey (AP) _ A boat carrying 220 would-be immigrants,
mostly Iraqi Kurds, was intercepted by the coast guard Friday in
the Aegean as it tried to reach a Greek island, the Anatolia news
agency said.
	   The report said the immigrants were headed to the island of
Simi, off this Turkish town.
	   Would-be immigrants try to reach Greece, a European Union
member, as a gateway to other EU countries. They usually enter
Turkey on tourist visas.

Singapore Airlines prepared for zero growth, but eyes buys
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Airlines said Friday it is
considering buying stakes in Thai Airways International and South
African Airways and buy some of its own stock when local law
changes to allow it.
	   The national carrier is also prepared for zero growth over the
next two to three years. If the Asian economic crisis worsens, the
reserves would be used to pay for aircraft, deputy chairman and
chief executive officer Cheong Choong Kong said.
	   The airline is deferring deliveries of at least 11 new aircraft
during the next two years, he said in a speech. He introduced new
products and services for all three passenger classes on the
government-controlled company's Megatop 747, Celestar A340 and
Jubilee 777 aircraft.
	   ``We are redeploying our aircraft from the troubled Asian arena
to the less tumultuous European and Australasian routes,'' Cheong
said.
	   Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa German Airlines are making
joint bids for South African Airways and Thai Airways. He said the
South African government has not yet said how much of its stake it
wants to sell. The Thai bidding should begin toward the second half
of next year, he said.
	   A final agreement on forming a strategic alliance with China
Airlines is expected next month, Cheong said, but he would not
comment on interest in Australia's Ansett Airlines.
	   ``If half of these opportunites are realized,'' he said, it
would require a large chunk of the cash reserves,'' he said. The
airline has 1.5 to 2 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 870 million to
dlrs 1.16 billion) in cash, he said.
	   If it confines itself to Singapore, with its shortage of
resources and rising cost of doing business, Singapore Airlines
would suffer a steady decline in rate of return on investment, he
said.
	   The launch of the new products and services, developed at a cost
of 500 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 288 million), is part of the
long-term strategy to get through economic turbulence that ``may
last two or three years or even longer,'' he said.
	   While the airline's profits ``will be eroded considerably, it is
highly unlikely, as of now, that it will end the financial year
with a loss,'' he said.
	   Another part of the strategy is ``accepting a much lower growth
rate than is characteristic of Singapore Airlines, and being
prepared even to bring the rate down to zero if necessary.''

Taiwan's Siew calls for peace treaty with China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ China should drop its threat of force
against Taiwan and agree to sign a peace treaty ending the
decades-long state of hostility between the sides, Premier Vincent
Siew said Friday.
	   China can further its goal of reunifying Taiwan with the
mainland by easing off the military threat and giving some degree
of recognition to the Nationalist government in Taipei, Siew said,
in an address to the opening session of the legislature.
	   Divided politically since Mao Tse-tung's communists drove Chiang
Kai-shek's followers off the mainland, Taiwan and China ended their
shooting war long ago. But China continues to threaten Taiwan with
invasion if it declares formal independence, and fired missiles
into waters near the island in 1996 in a attempt to intimidate
independence supporters.
	   Siew's remarks come at a time when Taipei's hopes of a
resumption of dialogue between the sides are floundering in the
face of China's refusal to discuss an agenda for resumed talks.
	   Taiwan hopes a meeting between two sides' top negotiators in
Beijing next month will lead to a restoration of negotiations that
China suspended three years ago in a fit of pique over Taiwan's
efforts to raise its international profile.
	   China has so far turned down Taiwan's calls for a meeting of
lower level officials to set an agenda for Koo Chen-fu's visit,
seen here as an indication that it expects little of substance to
result from the trip.
	   Officials say privately they believe China is seeking to
sideline Koo, chairman of the semiofficial Straits Exchange
Foundation, in favor of politicians here that it considers
friendlier to its goals.
	   Though the ruling Nationalists officially back reunification,
they say that can only happen after China democratizes and the gap
in living standards narrows between wealthy Taiwan and still
largely impoverished China. Taiwan says China's military threat and
relentless campaign to deny Taiwan international recognition only
alienate its citizens from China.

Ethiopian president threatens to use force against Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopia's president threatened to
use force if Eritrea does not withdraw from what he claimed was
Ethiopian territory.
	   Ethiopia has made ``relentless peace efforts,'' Negaso Gidada
said in an address broadcast Thursday, the Ethiopian New Year's
Eve. ``Patience has its limits.''
	   ``If the sha'biyya (Eritrean government) does not pull out from
the occupied territories, the last option open to us is only to use
force to defend our territorial integrity and sovereignity,'' he
said.
	   ``Therefore, we will resort to force to dislodge the aggressor
from the northern parts of our country after the government has
exhausted all its peace efforts.''
	   A border border dispute between the two countries boiled over
into armed clashes in June. Each side has accused the other of
trespassing.
	   Attempts by U.S. and African leaders to broker peace have
failed, though fighting has subsided with the rainy season.
	   Eritrean rebels fought Ethiopia for 30 years to gain
independence, succeeding in 1993. Relations between the two Horn of
Africa countries had been deteriorating since last year.

Protesters march again after mob kills one; king warns opposition

crowd. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Ruling party supporters fired guns,
threw rocks and swung clubs at vastly outnumbered opposition
protesters Friday as strongman Hun Sen turned to plainclothes mobs
to crush growing calls for his ouster. At least one person was
killed and several wounded.
	   Hun Sen used crowds in street clothes _ with men who appeared to
be police and soldiers _ instead of uniformed police a day after
King Norodom Sihanouk appealed to the army and police to stop
shooting and beating peaceful protesters and Buddhist monks.
	   Human-rights workers reported that an opposition supporter was
chased down, beaten, shot in the back and killed, bringing the
total of connfirmed deaths since Monday to four. A pool of blood
and his hat remained at the site.
	   Defiant anti-Hun Sen demonstrators regrouped, however, and
staged a protest march from the main market _ where they were
initially dispersed by police firing over their heads _ to the U.S.
Embassy. Their numbers swelled from 150 to about 1,200 before they
broke up peacefully.
	   Sihanouk, who treads a fine line as constitutional monarch,
balanced his implicit criticism of Hun Sen by pressuring the
opposition leaders _ his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and Sam
Rainsy _ to drop threats to boycott the National Assembly when it
meets Sept. 24.
	   The opposition accuses Hun Sen of winning parliamentary
elections July 26 by massive fraud and vows to withhold the
two-thirds majority support he needs to form a new government.
	   If they fail to take their seats, Sihanouk warned, they will not
have parliamentary immunity. Sam Rainsy, who is seeking refuge at
the local U.N. offices, is threatened with arrest by Hun Sen.
	   ``I cannot be helpful to you if you experience any danger or
anything eventually happens to you,'' the king said.
	   Week-long violence, the worst since Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh in
a coup last year, took a new turn when 2,000 backers of Hun Sen's
party, carrying clubs and guns and many drunk on rice wine, marched
against a gathering of 300 opposition supporters.
	   ``We are looking for the losers. They are trouble-makers,'' said
Chan Lay, 42, reeking of alcohol. He bore a club and a pistol
protruded from his shirt.
	   Warned in advance, the opposition protesters moved away from
their gathering point near the U.S. Embassy and Ranariddh's home.
There were inexplicably confronted by six security guards from a
seedy hotel who opened fire with pistols. At least three men were
wounded in the legs.
	   The two groups finally met on a side street, which erupted into
a rock-throwing battleground. Gunfire erupted from the Hun Sen
crowd. Opposition supporters fled on motorbikes and foot.
	   The U.N. human-rights office issued a statement calling on the
government ``to disband and disarm these groups. In the current
volatile climate, the activities of these groups risks provoking
further violence.''
	   Riot police who have acted as Hun Sen's shock troops since he
launched a crackdown Monday against weeks of peaceful protest
deployed only after the blood-letting. They gave the pro-Hun Sen
crowd _ some of whom were reportedly paid _ bread and water.
	   ``Police have been ordered not to intervene, just to protect
certain places,'' said government spokesman Khieu Kanharith. ``We
have only ordered the ambulances to be ready.''
	   A boy shot in the leg refused to enter an ambulance to take him
to the capital's Calmette hospital, seen as a bastion of Hun Sen
support. No other wounded were taken to Calmette.
	   Belief is widespread that a Buddhist monk reportedly slain in a
police charge Wednesday and taken by the ambulance never reached
the hospital. Many monks have been beaten and wounded in the
protests. Rumors that several have died intensified public anger.
	   Onlookers did not join the Hun Sen crowd, contrasting with an
opposition march that attracted more than 6,000 Thursday.
	   Mok Ban, 40, held up a club as thick as his arm and said he
supported the opposition's right to protest, but not to create
tension.
	   ``That's why we have come to suppress them, to stop them from
disrupting people's businesses,'' Mok Ban said. ``Our patience is
running short.''

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A bomb explosion in northern Jaffna's
city hall on Friday killed the mayor and the area's military and
police commanders and 17 others, military officials in Jaffna said.
	   The attack came just four months after the mayor's predecessor
was assassinated.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but military
officials said the bombing bore the hallmarks of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which is fighting for a homeland for
minority Tamils.
	   Civil administration in the area by moderate Tamils like Mayor
Ponnuthurai Sivapalan undermines the influence the rebels have over
the population.
	   Brigadier Susantha Mendis, the garrison commander of Jaffna,
Superintendent Chandra Perera, the city's police chief, six other
police officers, and an army officer were among the dead, officials
said.
	   Two foreign aid workers were among those killed in the explosion
in the Thinnaveli suburb of the city, said the officials, who asked
not to be named. It was not immediately clear which organizations
they worked for, nor what their nationalities were.
	   The victims were in a morning meeting about traffic arrangements
in Jaffna, a city dotted by sandbagged military checkpoints, when
the explosion occurred. It was not immediately clear if the bomb
had been planted in city hall, or was carried by a suicide bomber.
	   Rescue workers were digging through the rubble of city hall,
unsure whether more people were in the building at the time,
according to military officials reached by telephone in Jaffna.
	   The city's streets were deserted as the war-scarred city's
residents retreated into their homes, fearful of further violence.
	   Mayor Sivapalan, 46, took office in June after his predecessor
Sarojini Yogeswaran was shot and killed by two gunmen at her Jaffna
home on May 17. The previously unknown Sangilian Force claimed
responsibility for Yogeswaran's death, but the military says it is
a front group of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the main
rebel group in Sri Lanka's ethnic war.
	   Yogeswaran had been elected in the first vote in 15 years in
Jaffna, a once bustling cultural center transformed into a
bombed-out shell by the war. Jaffna is 300 kilometers (186 miles)
north of Colombo.
	   Tamil Tiger rebels had seized the city in 1990 and proclaimed a
government for the more than 1 million people who live in northern
Sri Lanka, where Tamils predominate. Sri Lanka's army retook the
city in 1995 after a 50-day offensive and ruled there until local
elections were held in a bid to restore normalcy.
	   Rebels continue to attack Jaffna from surrounding jungles.
	   The rebels say Sri Lanka's Tamil minority can only prosper in an
independent own homeland in the north and east, separate from the
areas where the Sinhalese majority predominates.
	   Many of Sri Lanka's 3.3 million Tamils, who make up 18 percent
of the population, accuse the Sinhalese of discrimination, though
few support the extreme solution proposed by the rebels.

German extreme-right rally banned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROSTOCK, Germany (AP) _ City officials have banned a Sept. 19
election rally by an extreme-right party near a building that was
set ablaze in an anti-foreigner riot six years ago.
	   The National Democratic Party announced Friday it was seeking
legal steps to overturn the Thursday night order.
	   The party has said it expected 5,000 supporters for the rally,
its last major campaign event for Sept. 27 elections in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, an economically depressed state in
former communist East Germany. Danish media reports said Danish
neo-Nazis also planned to show up.
	   The order by Rostock officials cited fears of violence at the
rally and its venue _ in front of a building that used to house
many Vietnamese and was torched by rightist extremists in 1992.
	   Another extreme-right party, the German People's Union, shocked
many Germans in April by coming out of nowhere to win about 13
percent of the vote in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt.

Russian political crisis nears resolution; economy awaits action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS news 6th and 7th grafs with Yeltsin nominating
ex-Soviet official to head central bank, EDITS to conform &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Friday
a new government would need time to tackle Russia's economic crisis
and he appealed to all political factions for support.
	   Primakov, whose appointment was expected to be confirmed by
lawmakers later Friday, was keeping quiet about his likely economic
policies. He told political leaders they should give the next
government up to a year before deciding if it was succeeding or
not.
	   ``I am for consolidation of all political forces and
mobilization of all efforts in order to come out of the crisis and
preserve Russia as a strong state,'' he was quoted as saying by the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   President Boris Yeltsin said a major crisis had been avoided by
compromise and that Primakov had strong backing from all sides. He
called for measures to stabilize prices, restore supplies to shops
and prop up the banking system.
	   ``I understand that it's hard for everyone, but one cannot give
in to emotions ... we'll have to draw lessons from the current
crisis and now we'll have to work on overcoming it,'' Yeltsin said
in a television address to the nation.
	   In a sign that the government wanted broad political support,
Yeltsin nominated Viktor Gerashchenko to head the Central Bank.
Gerashchenko, 60, an ex-head of the Soviet State Bank, headed the
Central Bank for nearly three years until being ousted in October
1994 after the ruble nosedived.
	   Critics blamed Geraschenko for fueling inflation with huge
credits to ailing industry and agriculture. Jeffrey Sachs, a former
economic adviser to the Kremlin, once called him ''the worst
central bank governor in history.''
	   Another ex-Soviet official, Yuri Maslyukov, would likely be
first deputy prime minister for economic affairs, Duma deputies
said. Maslyukov is a technocrat who until recently was trade and
industry minister.
	   Meanwhile, opposition and pro-government political leaders
hailed Yeltsin's decision to nominate Primakov for premier.
	   ``Common sense has prevailed in our state,'' Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov said Thursday. Zyuganov spearheaded the opposition
to the previous candidate for premier, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   Primakov, a former KGB spy chief respected across the political
spectrum, will need to quickly assemble a Cabinet to deal with the
most severe economic crisis since the Soviet collapse. The ruble
has plummeted, industrial production is stagnant and the government
is broke.
	   Despite such deep economic problems, Primakov's nomination
raised hopes on Russia's battered markets. The price of the ruble
was between 10 and 12 to the U.S. dollar _ up from 17 last Friday.
	   Primakov, 68, is supported by all but one of parliament's
factions. He is seen as a technocrat, non-ideological and loyal to
Yeltsin.
	   The low-key, publicity shy foreign minister appears more
comfortable handling discreet diplomatic negotiations than enduring
the glare of publicity that his new job will bring.
	   As foreign minister, Primakov won praise at home for his efforts
to restore some of Russia's diminished international clout and
create a ``multipolar'' world designed to counterbalance U.S.
dominance.
	   Primakov has cool but cordial relations with the United States.
There has been periodic friction over his desire to ease sanctions
against Iraq, maintain nuclear cooperation with Iran, and resist
NATO's expansion.
	   Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev picked him as one of his
closest aides during the reform period of the late 1980s.
	   He entered the international spotlight at the end of 1990 when,
shortly before the Gulf War began, he made several high-profile
trips to Iraq and tried unsuccessfully to persuade Saddam Hussein
to withdraw from Kuwait.
	   Primakov was briefly first deputy director of the KGB, the main
Soviet security organization in 1991. After the Soviet breakup, he
served as head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service until
Yeltsin named him foreign minister in 1996.
	   Yeltsin settled on Primakov after parliament twice rejected
Chernomyrdin, with opposition leaders vowing to vote him down again
on a third and final vote.
	   Chernomyrdin served five years as prime minister before Yeltsin
fired him last March. Many Russians blame him for the country's
economic problems.

Tamil lawyer turned mayor lived in shadows of death

 &UR; With Sri Lanka-Mayor Killed &QL; 
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The Sri Lankan mayor killed in a
massive bomb attack Friday knew the risks of trying to restore
normalcy to Sri Lanka's war-ravaged northern city of Jaffna.
	   ``I know the importance of my job and I also know the
consequences,'' Ponnuthurai Sivapalan, the 46-year-old lawyer
turned politician, told The Associated Press in June after being
named mayor of Jaffna, the center of Tamil culture and the former
headquarters of the Tamil Tiger separatists. His predecessor
Sarojini Yogeswaran, the first elected Jaffna chief in 15 years,
had been assassinated the previous month.
	   Unlike Yogeswaran_who had shunned bodyguards_Sivapalan accepted
security measures. He agreed to succeed Yogeswaran only after being
assured his security would be adequate.
	   ``There is no point in exposing oneself to risks and I don't see
any reason why I should not take precautions,'' Sivapalan, who like
Yogeswaran belonged to the main Tamil party, the Tamil United
Liberation Front, said in the interview.
	   Yogeswaran's murder was blamed on the main Tamil rebel group,
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Military officials said the
bombing that killed Sivapalan as well as Jaffna's police chief and
its main military officer also bore Tiger hallmarks.
	   The Tigers have targeted moderate Tamils like Yogeswaran and
Sivapalan for accepting anything less than a separate homeland, and
for participating in the central government's efforts to restore
democracy in the former rebel capital. The Tigers accuse Sri
Lanka's predominately Sinhalese-run government and military of
oppressing minority Tamils.
	   ``I will be happy if I can forward the cause of peace and
prosperity for the people of Jaffna. I am one of them,'' Sivapalan,
who practiced law in Jaffna until 1989, said. He left the city
after the LTTE took over Jaffna in 1990, returning as mayor eight
years later.
	   ``My first job will be to see that people do not suffer from
fear. This is the worst thing that can happen, I mean, to be
fearful,'' he said.
	   Sivapalan often spoke of the old glory of Jaffna.
	   Jaffna used to be an elegant city, with a renowned university
and Tamil-language library. Now it is a bombed-out shadow of its
former self, a victim of an ethnic war that so far has killed more
than 54,000 people.
	   The Tamil Tigers seized the city in 1990 and proclaimed a
government for the more than 1 million people who live in northern
Sri Lanka, where Tamils predominate. But Sri Lanka's army retook
the city in 1995 after a bitter 50-day offensive. The city was
under military rule until this year's local elections.
	   Sivapalan, his TULF party and the government were slowly
restoring the city. Schools and colleges reopened, as did one of
seven movie theaters, banks and hospitals.
	   Two private airlines operates five flights daily between Jaffna
and Colombo, the national capital 300 kilometers (180 miles) to the
south.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ John Conteh, Barry McGuigan, Mike
McCallum and Lennox Lewis all went on to become fearsome world
championships after they all won amateur titles for their countries
at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Conteh, later to become a standout light-heavyweight, fought for
England and triumphed in 1970 at middleweight.
	   McGuigan, in the colors of Northern Ireland, won the
bantamweight gold medal in 1978 and became a big-hitting WBA
featherweight champion.
	   McCallum won a welterweight crown in 1978 for Jamaica and became
one of the world champion middleweights who dominated the '80s.
	   Lewis won the super-heavyweight gold medal for Canada in 1986
and now is the WBC heavyweight champ.
	   Many other fighters have gone on to world title success as pros
after starting out as Commonwealth champions. But the production
line seems to be grinding to a halt and none of the 1994 champions
have so far made an impact as pros.
	   The latest crop of Commonwealth fighters go into action Saturday
at the Malawati stadium and the leading contenders appear to come
from Canada, Kenya, Australia and the four teams from England,
Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.
	   Troy Amos Ross, a Canadian light heavyweight, makes his
Commonwealth Games debut two years after making an impact at the
Olympics in Atlanta.
	   He lost on a 14-8 decision in the quarterfinal to Vassili Jirov
of Kazakstan, who won the Olympic gold and now is running up an
impressive unbeaten record as a pro, fighting out of Scottsdale,
Arizona.
	   ``Jirov was voted the best boxer at the Atlanta Olympics and
everyone said it was a close fight,'' Ross said,
	   ``I'm a better fighter now. I have matured over the last two
years and I know I can do much better than I did then.
	   ``I have the speed and the power and I know where I am in the
ring. I have two powerful hands and I can cause problems, being a
lefthander.''
	   Ross also had the advantage of knowing that he has already his
first round opponent from Cameroon, Paul Mgongo, at the Atlanta
Games on a 7-3 scoreline.
	   Canadian heavyweight Mark Simmons has been fighting since he was
5 1/2, when he weighed 44 pounds (20 kilos).
	   ``I am the bext boxer here at the weight and I know I'm going to
win. That's what I'm shooting for having had to watch the last
Commonwealth Games on TV,'' he said.
	   ``I lost out in the trials last time but I'd already beaten the
Canadian boxer who won the silver medal in '94 and I've beaten him
since as well.''
	   England's super-heavyweight, Audley Harrison, will come up
against the Oceania champion, Faii Falamoe of New Zealand in the
second round with both receiving first round byes.
	   The Kenyans, who won two golds in Victoria four years ago, have
sent a 10-strong team of newcomers and the biggest contender is
heavyweight Frederick Orieyo, who meets another New Zealander,
Garth Da Silva, in the first round.
	   Friday's weigh-in frustrated some of the teams.
	   Instead of carrying it out weight-by-weight, it was done
country-by-country in alphabetical order. That meant Australian
boxers and coaches were among those who went home early and Wales
and Zimbabwe had to wait.

Doctors warn: mosquitoes may take liking to kilt-clad men
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with items on Scottish kilts, Welsh hockey team, and
flooded media room &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Warning: wearing a kilt may leave
you overexposed.
	   Scottish team doctors at the Commonwealth Games urged their
athletes not to wear kilts at the opening ceremony Friday night for
fear mosquitoes could fly up them and bite.
	   ``Our medical team advised it as a precaution,'' said team
spokesman John Lindsay. ``It's up to the individual.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WELSH HOCKEY REBOUND: Stricken by suspected food poisoning, the
Welsh women's field hockey team is back on its feet.
	   Two members of the team believed to have suffered
gastroentiritis were discharged from a hospital in Kuala Lumpur on
Friday. Another seven players affected this week have been treated
and all are recovering, the Welsh management said in a statement.
	   ``The girls' rate of recovery is a testament to their careful
preparations and levels of fitness,'' said Dr. Wayne Griffiths,
chief medical officer for the team.
	   A postponed match against Canada, delayed because of the
illness, was scheduled for Saturday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   INTERVIEW INUNDATED: A large media contingent was all washed up
before the Commonwealth Games even started Friday.
	   Reporters, cameramen, photographers and sound technicians were
preparing for an interview in the main media room at the athletes'
village when a downpour hit.
	   Within seconds, small droplets of water were dripping from the
roof and within minutes a near-torrent of water was falling from
the ceiling of the ground floor room.
	   As officials scurried for buckets, the assembled media looked on
in bemusement.
	   Eventually, an interview began with two English athletes, but
the sound of falling water made it nearly impossible for the
journalists to hear any of the answers.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   FREE PASS TO JAIL: Two badminton fans spent the night in jail
for using borrowed volunteer worker passes to watch Commonwealth
Games events.
	   The two were released Thursday morning, and the two volunteer
workers who lent them the passes were dismissed, the New Straits
Times reported Friday.
	   Volunteers at the games ``had been briefed that they would pay
for their folly if they loaned their passes to their friends,'' the
newspaper quoted Johnny Quek, sports manager at the badminton
stadium, as saying.
	   It added, however, that the stadium was in no danger of running
short of workers. More than 750 people have volunteered to help at
badminton.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BOWLING FOR GOLD: Malta has just one tenpin bowling center, but
two sisters hope their skills in the sport will bring the
Mediterranean nation its first gold medal ever in the Commonwealth
Games.
	   Tenpin bowling is making its debut in the games, which until now
had only the lawn variety. Bowlers Melisa Anastasi, 29, and Suzanne
Abela, 32, are among 21 athletes in Malta's games delegation.
	   ``We come from a small country with a population of only
375,000. But imagine how meaningful it would be if we can return
home with a gold medal,'' Abela told the New Straits Times.
	   She said the sisters consider their chances about even in the
women's doubles, starting Sunday, because ``the competition is
quite well-balanced.''
	   Anastasi has a gold in doubles from the Mediterranean Challenge
Cup and a silver for all-events and team bowling. Abela has a
bronze in singles from the 1997 European zone championships.
	   Malta's total medals count for all previous Commonwealth Games
is one bronze in 1990.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BETTER THAN GOLD: Yvonne McGregor, England's only cycling gold
medalist in the last Commonwealth Games in 1994, is looking for
something even more satisfying at these games.
	   The 37-year-old rider finished second to Australian Lucy
Tyler-Sharman in the women's 3-kilometer pursuit race in the recent
World Track Championships in France and in both last year's World
Cup and World Championships.
	   Now she wants to beat her AND win the gold.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, McGregor is competing in the 28-kilometer
individual time trial.
	   ``Lucy has beaten me three times in my favourite event and I'm
fed up. Losing to her in France was very disappointing and I want
to avenge that defeat by winning here,'' said McGregor.
	   McGregor won her 1994 gold in the 25-kilometer points race. She
won the 1997 World Cup pursuit in Athens.

Bailey's career threatened after basketball injury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Donovan Bailey's career as a world-class sprinter
might be in jeopardy.
	   The 100-meter world-record holder and Olympic champion ruptured
an Achilles tendon Wednesday night while playing basketball with
friends, the Toronto Sun reported Thursday.
	   Bailey, 30, was taken to Oakville-Trafalgar Hospital, where
sources said the injury was diagnosed as a ruptured Achilles tendon
that retracted into the calf muscle
	   Bailey's agent, Ray Flynn, confirmed a serious Achilles injury
and said surgery might be required.
	   ``It's fairly bad,'' Flynn said, adding he wasn't sure when or
if Bailey would run again.
	   A source at the hospital told the newspaper that the attending
orthopedic surgeon believes the injury is career-threatening and
that, in normal cases, the patient would have undergone surgery
immediately.
	   Flynn said Bailey faced further tests Friday to determine the
extent of the injury and help decide the course of medical action.
	   Last October, Bailey walked away from a car crash in which his
dlrs 80,000 Mercedes was destroyed, suffering only a sore neck and
slightly injured left shoulder.
	   Bailey, who has been planning on defending his Olympic title in
the 2000 Sydney Games, suffered a season-ending quadriceps injury
Aug. 12 during a 100-meter race in Switzerland. Flynn said the
sprinter was well on the road to recovery from that injury.

Myanmar opposition says authorities detain 187 more members
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES material from BC-Myanmar-Suu Kyi &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government has
detained another 187 members of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu
Kyi's party, bringing the total to 702 arrested since a crackdown
began in May, the party said Friday.
	   If the figure is accurate, it would be the largest number of
arrests of opposition members since the nationwide democracy
uprising in 1988.
	   More than half the arrests have taken place since Sunday, in an
apparent government effort to stymie the National League for
Democracy's announced plans to convene parliament.
	   The NLD said 194 members of parliament are among the arrested
party members. The military rulers never allowed parliament to meet
after the NLD won a landslide victory in elections held in 1990.
	   The government avoids saying it has detained any NLD members. It
claims instead they were ``invited'' to government guest houses for
an exchange of views on convening parliament.
	   On Thursday night it released four photographs purporting to
show ``Invited guests enjoying watching TV'' and other activities.
Most of those photographed looked stiff and unsmiling.
	   The NLD statement, while announcing the new detentions, also
said that nine members of the NLD's organizing committee in the
capital had been released on Wednesday after being briefly
detained.
	   On Friday, groups representing three of Myanmar's ethnic groups
condemned the arrests and voiced their support for the convening of
parliament.
	   The Wa National Organization, the Palaung State Liberation Front
and the Lahu Democratic Front said the arrests were an ``insulting
act of shameless, barbaric arrogance against the people of Burma.''
Myanmar is also known as Burma.
	   The NLD has said that representatives of the Chin, Rakhine and
Mon ethnic groups were among those arrested in the latest
crackdown, while the All Burma Students Democratic Front said more
than 900 democracy activists have been arrested since May.
	   The British embassy in Yangon meanwhile denied allegations in
Myanmar's state-run press that NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi is a
British citizen, while military-run newspapers on Friday renewed
threats to deport the Nobel laureate.
	   Leading generals have also recently stepped up their verbal
attacks against 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi, who is
married to a British academic, calling her a traitor for her
attempts to bring democracy to the country.
	   Myanmar has been ruled by the military since 1962.
	   Earlier in the week, a commentary in the state-run New Light of
Myanmar signed ``Supreme Court Justice'' said that Suu Kyi is a
British citizen and so the government should deport her.
	   A 1982 law makes dual citizenship in Myanmar illegal.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Another comeback for Lothar Matthaeus.
	   The veteran 37-year-old Bayern Munich libero will be on
Germany's roster for the upcoming European championship
qualification games against Turkey and Moldova, the German soccer
federation (DFB) said Friday.
	   New German national team chief Erich Ribbeck called Matthaeus
Thursday afternoon and discussed his comeback. Matthaeus
immediately accepted, the DFB said in a statement.
	   ``My position was always that I will be available for the
national team if I am needed because I owe so much to the DFB,''
Matthaeus said. ``This went for Vogts and it goes for Ribbeck.''
	   ``It would be stupid to do without me if my performances are
good. Ribbeck made it very clear that he needs me as a key
player,'' Matthaeus said.
	   Matthaeus, who has played a record 129 games for Germany,
retired after Germany's ouster in the quarterfinals of the World
Cup _ with a little persuasion from then coach Berti Vogts.
	   Vogts had been planning to rejuvenate the team and was not
counting anymore on Matthaeus and other veterans.
	   But Vogts resigned Monday and Ribbeck, on his first day on the
job Thursday, said he would call up all of Germany's best players,
regardless of their age.
	   ``As soon as I was asked whether I would become team chief, my
first thought was to reactivate Lothar Matthaeus,'' Ribbeck said.
	   ``It can't be that he plays so well in the Bundesliga week after
week and that he has no role in the national team,'' the new coach
said. ``That he is already 37 is no obstacle whatsoever.''
	   ``I need experienced players for the inferno in Turkey,''
Ribbeck said.
	   Germany, the defending European champion, begins its qualifying
campaign for Euro 2000 on Oct. 10 in Turkey and Oct. 14 in Moldova.
	   Franz Beckenbauer, Bayern Munich president and one of the most
influential men in German soccer, said recalling Matthaeus was
``the best decision'' Ribbeck could have made.
	   ``Only the best can achieve qualification for the European
Championship,'' said Beckenbauer, who coached Germany to its third
and last World Cup title in 1990, when Matthaeus was the team's
captain.
	   Beckenbauer said Matthaeus should become one of the pillars of
the team and must not sit on the bench.
	   ``The best would be for Lothar to become captain, but Oliver
Bierhoff wouldn't want to give the post away,'' Beckenbauer said.
	   Vogts named Bierhoff national team captain the week before his
resignation. Bierhoff replaced Juergen Klinsmann, who retired after
the World Cup.
	   Matthaeus was dropped by Vogts before the 1996 European
Championship in England. But Vogts recalled Matthaeus before this
summer's World Cup when injuries took out several players.
Matthaeus began on the bench but soon advanced to a starter at the
World Cup.
	   Ribbeck said he would also talk to three Borussia Dortmund
veterans _ Thomas Haessler, Andreas Moeller and Stefan Reuter. All
quit after the World Cup but have said they could come back under
the new coach.
	   Two players _ libero Olaf Thon of Schalke and midfielder Thomas
Helmer of Bayern Munich _ have ruled out any comebacks.

Mental patients, health workers protest conditions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ Mental patients and health workers
from a psychiatric clinic demonstrated outside a government office
Friday, and the workers threatened to release the patients if back
wages were not paid.
	   ``There's no money for medicine. Not even money for a slice of
bread,'' said Galina Drachova, the strike leader and a nurse at the
City Psychiatric Hospital in the eastern port city of Vladivostok.
	   Thirty doctors, nurses, and other hospital workers took part in
the protest, and they brought with them about 60 mentally ill
patients from the hospital.
	   The patients banged out a cadence with cups and spoons as
members of the regional parliament arrived at the government
building to discuss the worsening social and economic situation.
	   The protesters threatened to release the patients if the
officials did not come up with the money for salaries and supplies
at the hospitals.
	   ``Of course, we brought the patients to protest today,'' said
Alexander Vitsotin, a psychiatrist at the hospital. ``They want to
eat, they're hungry.''
	   The hospital staff, which cares for 500 patients, received
450,000 rubles (about dlrs 45,000) for three months of back wages
last month. But according to Drachova, they are still owed another
9 million rubles (dlrs 900,000) for salaries, medicine and food for
patients.
	   Millions of workers in Russia receive their salaries months late
due to the country's economic problems.

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A huge bomb explosion at Jaffna city
hall on Friday killed the mayor and the area's military and police
commanders and 17 others, military officials in the northern Sri
Lankan city said.
	   The attack came just four months after the mayor's predecessor
was assassinated.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Defense
Ministry spokesman Maj. Kumar Dewage blamed the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam, who are fighting for a homeland for minority
Tamils.
	   Slain Mayor Ponnuthurai Sivapalan was trying to restore a
civilian administration to Jaffna, which would undermine the
Tigers' influence over the population.
	   The government said the bodies of 12 people were identified,
including the mayor, Jaffna garrison commander Brig. Susantha
Mendis, police chief Chandra Perera, five other police officers, an
army officer, and three other civilians. Other victims were not
immediately identified.
	   Other officials earlier said that two unidentified foreign aid
workers were among those killed in the explosion in the Thinnaveli
suburb of the city. But the Defense Ministry said it had no
information on any other casualties, except that a number of
civilians were wounded.
	   The victims were in a morning meeting about traffic arrangements
in Jaffna, a city dotted by sandbagged military checkpoints, when
the explosion occurred. It was not immediately clear if the bomb
had been planted, or carried by a suicide bomber.
	   Rescue workers were digging through the rubble of city hall,
unsure whether more people were in the building at the time,
according to military officials reached by telephone in Jaffna.
	   The city's streets were deserted as the city's residents
retreated into their homes, fearful of further violence.
	   Mayor Sivapalan, 46, took office in June after his predecessor
Sarojini Yogeswaran was shot and killed by two gunmen at her Jaffna
home on May 17.
	   Tamil Tiger rebels had seized the city, 300 kilometers (186
miles) north of Colombo, in 1990 and proclaimed a government for
the more than 1 million people who live in northern Sri Lanka,
where Tamils predominate.
	   Sri Lanka's army retook the city in 1995 after a 50-day
offensive and ruled there until local elections were held in a bid
to restore normalcy.
	   Rebels continue to attack Jaffna from surrounding jungles.
	   The rebels say Sri Lanka's Tamil minority can only prosper in an
independent own homeland in the north and east, separate from the
areas where the Sinhalese majority predominates.
	   Many of Sri Lanka's 3.3 million Tamils, who make up 18 percent
of the population, accuse the Sinhalese of discrimination, though
few support the extreme solution proposed by the rebels.

Loyalist forces claim advances as Kabila prepares for summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KAMANGA MUTOND &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Forces loyal to President Laurent Kabila
have recaptured the town of Lobutu on a key route between the
rebels' headquarters of Goma and the rebel-held city of Kisangani
in eastern Congo, state radio reported Friday.
	   The capture came as Kabila left the capital Friday to spend time
in his southwestern stronghold of Lubumbashi before flying to a
southern African summit in Mauritius that is likely to address
Congo's month-long war, state-controlled Voice of the People radio
said.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   The Southern African Development Community summit opens Monday
in the Indian Ocean island state. Representatives of the group's 14
member states are expected to discuss the war, which poses the
region's biggest security threat in years.
	   Loyalist forces recaptured Lobutu, about 300 kilometers (190
miles) northwest of Goma on Congo's eastern border with Rwanda and
roughly the same distance southeast of Kisangani in the eastern
interior, after ``intense bombardments'' on the town by loyalist
warplanes, state radio said.
	   The bombardment caused 49 deaths and allowed government forces
to capture 19 prisoners, the station added.
	   With the aid of Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian forces, Congo's
government has regained territory almost as quickly as it was lost
to the rebels in early August.
	   Leaders from neighboring countries embroiled in Congo's civil
war began a two-day peace conference Thursday in the Ethiopian
capital, Addis Ababa, to negotiate an immediate cease-fire and the
withdrawal of foreign troops.
	   The Ethiopian meetings are the fourth attempt at a diplomatic
solution to end fighting in the sprawling central African country.
	   Kabila made a lightning visit on Thursday to the Central African
Republic to brief President Ange Felix Patasse about the rebellion
before returning to Kinshasa, state radio said.
	   The Congolese government has expressed concerns about some 3,000
former soldiers under the country's late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko
who have taken refuge in Central African Republic since last year.
The country also harbors Hutu refugees from Rwanda implicated in
the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which more than 500,000 people were
killed.
	   Officials said late Thursday that the key Congo River port of
Matadi supplying the capital has resumed operations after several
weeks of inactivity during a rebel push to oust President Laurent
Kabila.
	   Matadi, which was captured last month by rebels, had resumed
activities more than a week after it was recaptured by Angolan
troops, acting government spokesman Edi Angulu said.
	   Kinshasa's Ndili international airport also reopened Thursday
and Belgian company Sabena SA was expected to resume normal
services to the city, which has been plagued by shortages of food
and other supplies.

Australians favored for first gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Two Australian riders who grabbed
headlines for different reasons at this year's drug-tainted Tour de
France will spearhead the country's bid for the first gold on offer
at the Commonwealth Games Saturday.
	   Neil Stephens, competing despite his ejection from the world's
most famous race along with his Festina teammates, will take a
central role as Australia seeks its first men's road race gold
since Phil Anderson won in 1978.
	   But Stephens, whose inclusion here has been criticized by
organizers, will act as a ``domestique'' in Saturday's
184-kilometer race.
	   The two leading candidates are Stuart O'Grady and Jay Sweet, and
Stephens' job is to protect them during the race, tire out their
opponents and keep them fresh for the final sprint.
	   Before the Festina drug bust dragged down the Tour de France,
O'Grady made his mark by becoming only the second Australian, after
Anderson, to wear the yellow leader's jersey.
	   ``This is the best road team we have ever had,'' said Australian
road coach Shayne Bannan. ``It will be a big disappointment if we
don't win.''
	   Australia was also favored to win the race four years ago, but
New Zealander Mark Rendell and compatriot Brian Fowler spoiled
their hopes with a 1-2 finish.
	   New Zealand will have veteran rider Graeme Miller, who won two
golds at the 1990 Auckland Games including the road race title, but
it lacks the depth of previous years.
	   England's best hope is another veteran, John Tanner, while Chris
Newtown and Stuart Dangerfield also have medal chances.
	   Canada's main hope is Brian Walton, who won the silver medal in
the points race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A sharp plunge in Japanese stock prices and
Wall Street's hefty losses overnight dragged most Asian stock
markets lower Friday, capping a dismal week for regional bourses.
	   Japanese and South Korean stocks plunged over 5 percent. Hong
Kong was off 3.2 percent, and Singapore fell 1.9 percent. In
Bangkok, the key SET index fell 2.8 percent to 212.70.
	   A number of concern weighed on the markets, including the recent
weakness on the Japanese yen, confusion over new capital controls
in Malaysia, and fears of more rioting in Indonesia.
	   Analysts said regional stock indices were tracking Wall Street's
3.4 percent drop on Thursday amid worries that U.S. President Bill
Clinton may be forced to resign or be impeached. The fallout from a
plunge in Latin American and European markets also hurt sentiment.
	   Investors fear instability in the United States would trigger a
global deflationary cycle and deepen the region's woes.
	   ``Unfortunately, what's good or bad for the U.S. is good or bad
for Asia,'' said Eugene Chung, Asia strategist for Warburg Dillon
Read in Hong Kong.
	   Elsewhere in the region, Australian stocks fell 2.3 percent, New
Zealand shares shed 1.9 percent, Indonesian equities lost 1
percent, and the Philippines' market dropped 1.6 percent to the
lowest level in nearly seven years.
	   In Japan, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average plummeted 749.05
points, or 5.12 percent, closing at 13,916.98. It was the largest
single-day point and percentage fall this year, and the close was
just above the Nikkei's 12-year closing low of 13,915.63 set on
Aug. 28.
	   Adding to the nation's economic malaise, Japan's central bank
said in its monthly report released Friday that economic conditions
continue to deteriorate.
	   ``We need to see reforms in Japan,'' said Chung, but reforming
the ailing banking system ``is less urgent for Japan that they rest
of the world'' because of a relatively stable political environment
in Tokyo.
	   Meanwhile, the Japanese yen surged against the U.S. dollar.
	   The U.S. currency bought 131.22 yen in mid-afternoon trading,
down 4.48 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo also below its late New
York level of 134.23 yen overnight.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index plunged 3.5 percent
to close at 7,578.48 on global concerns and on the back of a new
price war among local property developers.
	   In South Korea, the Kospi index was off 5.4 percent at 320.61,
mostly tracking Japan's decline.
	   In Malaysia, the benchmark Composite index was down 3.1 percent
at 368.53 as investors scale back their involvement in the market
amid regulatory confusion about what they can and cannot do,
dealers said.
	   The confusion in Malaysia spread over to neighboring Singapore,
a major center in offshore trading in Malaysian shares. A bank rate
cut also did little to lift share prices. The Straits Times Index
closed at 853.19.
	   Thai share prices ended 2.8% lower Friday in line with other
Asian markets following drop overnight in U.S. stocks, traders
said.
	   In Indonesia, the JSX Composite index closed down 1 percent at
324.040, as more reports of riots kept investors sidelined.
	   But Taiwan's stocks bucked the trend.
	   Led by big capitalized shares, the Weighted Price Index closed
0.55 higher on expectations a stock buyback system will be
implemented soon.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ John Conteh, Barry McGuigan, Mike
McCallum and Lennox Lewis all went on to become fearsome world
champions after they all won amateur titles for their countries at
the Commonwealth Games.
	   Conteh, later to become a standout light-heavyweight, fought for
England and triumphed in 1970 at middleweight.
	   McGuigan, in the colors of Northern Ireland, won the
bantamweight gold medal in 1978 and became a big-hitting WBA
featherweight champion.
	   McCallum won a welterweight crown in 1978 for Jamaica and became
one of the world champion middleweights who dominated the '80s.
	   Lewis won the super-heavyweight gold medal for Canada in 1986
and now is the WBC heavyweight champ.
	   Many other fighters have gone on to world title success as pros
after starting out as Commonwealth champions. But the production
line seems to be grinding to a halt and none of the 1994 champions
have so far made an impact as pros.
	   The latest crop of Commonwealth fighters go into action Saturday
at the Malawati stadium and the leading contenders appear to come
from Canada, Kenya, Australia and the four teams from England,
Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.
	   Troy Amos Ross, a Canadian light heavyweight, makes his
Commonwealth Games debut two years after making an impact at the
Olympics in Atlanta.
	   He lost on a 14-8 decision in the quarterfinal to Vassili Jirov
of Kazakstan, who won the Olympic gold and now is running up an
impressive unbeaten record as a pro, fighting out of Scottsdale,
Arizona.
	   ``Jirov was voted the best boxer at the Atlanta Olympics and
everyone said it was a close fight,'' Ross said,
	   ``I'm a better fighter now. I have matured over the last two
years and I know I can do much better than I did then.
	   ``I have the speed and the power and I know where I am in the
ring. I have two powerful hands and I can cause problems, being a
lefthander.''
	   Ross also had the advantage of knowing that he has already his
first round opponent from Cameroon, Paul Mgongo, at the Atlanta
Games on a 7-3 scoreline.
	   Canadian heavyweight Mark Simmons has been fighting since he was
5 1/2, when he weighed 44 pounds (20 kilos).
	   ``I am the best boxer here at the weight and I know I'm going to
win. That's what I'm shooting for having had to watch the last
Commonwealth Games on TV,'' he said.
	   ``I lost out in the trials last time but I'd already beaten the
Canadian boxer who won the silver medal in '94 and I've beaten him
since as well.''
	   England's super-heavyweight, Audley Harrison, will come up
against the Oceania champion, Faii Falamoe of New Zealand in the
second round with both receiving first round byes.
	   The Kenyans, who won two golds in Victoria four years ago, have
sent a 10-strong team of newcomers and the biggest contender is
heavyweight Frederick Orieyo, who meets another New Zealander,
Garth Da Silva, in the first round.
	   Friday's weigh-in frustrated some of the teams.
	   Instead of carrying it out weight-by-weight, it was done
country-by-country in alphabetical order. That meant Australian
boxers and coaches were among those who went home early and Wales
and Zimbabwe had to wait.

Philippine unemployment increases in July
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Unemployment in the Philippines
increased slightly in July from a year earlier, but declined from a
record high hit in April, the government said Friday.
	   The unemployment rate rose to 8.9 percent in July from 8.7
percent in July 1997. It was down from a seven-year high of 13.3
percent in April, the National Statistics Office said.
	   Employment in agriculture, which traditionally accounts for 40
percent of the country's total labor force, rose 5.5 percent in
July from April.
	   The government attributed the rise to more jobs becoming
available at the end of a drought due to the El Nino weather
phenomenon. El Nino had caused a slowdown in agricultural
production in the first half of the year.
	   Employment in the service sector fell 2.1 percent from April to
July 1998 as the number of wage and salaried workers declined.
Employment in industry declined by 6 percent from April to July.
	   The government said the third quarter usually shows an
improvement in employment as manufacturers build up their inventory
for the Christmas season.
	   The total work force also showed a 4.6 percent drop to 30.6
million in July from 32.1 million in April.
	   The agency said the decline in the total work force resulted
from more housewives, students, disabled people and retirees
choosing to stay out of the labor force.
	   The actual number of unemployed workers totaled 2.7 million in
July compared to 4.2 million in April.

Biggest Commonwealth Games ever open with bright, brassy spectacle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated as ceremony progresses

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The largest Commonwealth Games
ever were to open Friday night with brass bands, dazzling fireworks
and waves of dancers at a stadium expected to be packed with
100,000 people.
	   Neither Malaysia's worst economic recession nor a political
threat to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad could dim the inaugural
spectacle as the games came to Asia for the first time.
	   Athletes from 70 countries were to march around the track of the
Bukit Jalil Stadium with Britain's Prince Edward reading a message
from Queen Elizabeth II, nominal head of the Commonwealth.
	   Then Malaysian King Tuanku Ja'afar was to formally open the
games.
	   The Commonwealth Games claim to be the most important sporting
event after the Summer Olympics. They draw together countries once
linked as parts of the farflung British empire, but now divided by
culture, geography and economic status.
	   Known then as the Empire Games, Commonwealth sports began in
1930 in Hamilton, Canada, with a few dozen athletes from 10
visiting teams. The 1994 event in Victoria, 3,500 kilometers (2,200
miles) west of Hamilton, had 3,200 athletes.
	   Despite a crushing financial crisis, Malaysia has relished its
host role, not relenting in its penchant for superlatives.
	   Even as it scrapped billions of dollars worth of civil works,
dams and railroad projects, it ensured that the event was the
largest ever by insisting on including six new sports.
	   A 1.7 billion ringgit (dlrs 300 million) stadium was completed
just ahead of the games, a commuter rail link was finished and more
than a dozen other sports venues were erected.
	   Mahathir personally ensured a new international airport was
ready to receive athletes and officials.
	   The games organizing committee hired 16,000 people to help at
various venues, and some 5,350 police officers and other security
officials were deployed.
	   The opening ceremony itself, involving thousands of
schoolchildren, professional performers and volunteers, was also
perhaps the longest ever.
	   A two-hour cultural show of song, dance, aerobics and brass
bands, began at 5 p.m. (0900 GMT). The actual ceremony started
three hours later and was to last another three hours.
	   Malaysia is counting on dazzling thousands of athletes and
foreign reporters during the 10-day games to help regain some of
its eroded prestige.
	   In recent weeks, Mahathir has grabbed world attention with his
heavy-handed approach to a political challenge from his deputy,
moves to tighten curbs on the local press and reversal of
free-market policies in this nation of 22 million people.
	   The glitter of the games may also help distract attention from
growing worries over business failures and widespread job losses in
the coming months.
	   ``We are treating the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony as a
window to Malaysia. We have done our best,'' Sports Minister
Muhyiddin Yassin told reporters.

Iran promises to avenge deaths of diplomats in Afghanistan

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will avenge the deaths of nine of its
diplomats, who were killed by members of the Taliban militia in
Afghanistan, former President Hashemi Rafsanjani said Friday.
	   ``I condole the martyrs' families and promise them that we will
get revenge for their blood,'' Rafsanjani, still a key official,
said in a sermon during Friday prayers at Tehran University.
	   The Taliban said Thursday that the bodies of the nine Iranians
were found this week, and admitted that they had been killed by the
religious army's own troops. The disclosure was made in a letter
from the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan. The United Nations condemned the killings.
	   The diplomats had vanished Aug. 8 during a battle in which the
Taliban, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, seized the
northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   For weeks, Iran has accused the Taliban of holding some 70
Iranians, including 11 diplomats and a journalist, but the Taliban
has denied any knowledge of the whereabouts of the others.
	   On Friday, Deputy Foreign Minister Mohsen Aminzadeh said that
the other two Iranian diplomats captured by the Taliban had escaped
from their captors, Iranian television reported.
	   He said one of them was injured but gave no further details.
	   ``Efforts are underway to determine their exact whereabouts,''
he said, suggesting they were in Afghanistan or Pakistan.
	   The fate of the journalist, who works for Iran's Islamic
Republic News Agency, was not known.
	   Promises to avenge the diplomats' death also came from Iran's
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.
	   ``The revolutionary sons of Islamic Iran, by sacrificing their
own lives and through revolutionary wrath, shall give the
perpetrators of this crime what they justly deserve,'' a statement
broadcast on Iranian television said.
	   ``The Taliban and the main agents responsible for this horrific
crime must also know that they shall never be immune to the
tumultuous anger of the Islamic corps,'' the statement said.
	   Some 70,000 elite Iranian soldiers _ backed by tanks and
helicopter gunships _ held three days of maneuvers near the Afghan
border earlier this month in a show of force.
	   Iran's army chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Ali Shahbazi, said more
maneuvers would be held on the border but did not give a date.
	   The U.S. State Department has expressed concern about rising
tensions between Iran and Afghanistan and has urged both sides to
exercise restraint, possibly seeking U.N. mediation.
	   But Rafsanjani said Iran was acting within its rights and warned
the United States against interfering.
	   ``We reserve the right to protect and defend our national
interests and our nation. We keep this right and you will see that
we will act appropriately,'' he said.
	   Rafsanjani, who heads the powerful Expediency Council, a body
that advises the government, said Iran would act when it saw fit.
	   ``We definitely will punish these criminals but Iran will not
act in anger. We will have our plans, too,'' Rafsanjani said.
	   Later Friday, more than 200 policemen sealed off the area
surrounding the Pakistani Embassy to keep demonstrators away.
	   Pakistan is seen as a major backer of the Taliban, while Iran
has supported the Afghan opposition forces.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ignoring the good news about Russia, Asia's top
three stock markets fell sharply Friday, following the lead of
U.S., Latin American and European bourses instead. Growing concerns
about the future of American President Bill Clinton also were
blamed for the latest slump in the stock markets, and another
weakening of the U.S. dollar. Japan's 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average plummeted 749.05 points, or 5.12 percent, to close at
13,916.98. It was the largest one-day point fall this year. In
another sign of turbulence, the dollar fell once again, buying
130.78 yen in late afternoon trading, down 4.92 yen from late
Thursday in Tokyo. Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell
271.48 points, or 3.5 percent, to close at 7,578.48 Friday. In
Singapore, where the market has been battered by capital controls
recently imposed by neighboring Malaysia, shares closed down 11.81
points, or 1.3 percent, to 853.19 points. In Russia, the ruble and
stock market quickly rebounded Friday, the day that compromise
candidate Yevgeny Primakov was expected to win approval by
parliament, ending a two-week standoff over the future prime
minister. (WORLD MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Battered by declining consumer spending at home and
a worsening financial crisis abroad, Japan's economy shrank for a
third straight quarter, the Economic Planning Agency said Friday.
Japan's gross domestic product _ the measure of all goods and
services produced in the country _ declined by 0.8 percent between
April and June from the previous quarter, the EPA said. It was the
first time since 1955 that the Japanese economy has marked three
consecutive quarters of decline. Friday's figures showed the
economy contracting at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, the EPA said.
Last year, the economy shrank 0.7 percent, its first annual decline
since 1974. The numbers confirmed that Asia's economic powerhouse
remains mired in a stubborn recession from which EPA head Taichi
Sakaiya held out little hope for a quick recovery.
(JAPAN-RECESSION)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The inner circle of Europe's new
central bank face an unenviable task: formulating a financial
policy for next year while the world economy shows no sign of
stabilizing. Analysts were not expecting European Central Bank
president, Wim Duisenberg of the Netherlands, to announce any major
strategy decisions at the end of Friday's governing council
meeting. Starting Jan. 1, the bank is to set financial policy for
the 11 European Union members that are joining to launch the single
currency, called the euro. The question is whether to run financial
strategy based on money supply data or inflation data, with
arguments over which is the more reliable tool for tracking how the
economy is performing. Financial markets are keen for an answer.
Central bankers also will likely talk about slipping growth in
Europe. U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said last week
the U.S. economy was increasingly prey to global turmoil, and some
are asking whether Europe's is too. (GERMANY-EUROPE'S BANK)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Negotiators for Northwest Airlines and its
pilots have reached agreement on a deal to end a strike that has
grounded the U.S. airline for 13 days. ``I think the strike is
over,'' President Bill Clinton announced Thursday after speaking by
phone with leaders from the pilots' union and the company. Soon
after Clinton spoke, spokesmen for the airline and the Air Line
Pilots Association confirmed that a proposal to end the standoff
would be put to a vote of the union's executive board on Saturday.
No details were released. Northwest's 6,100 pilots will remain on
strike until at least Saturday, when the union's 17-member council
will meet in Minneapolis to consider the proposal. (US-NORTHWEST
STRIKE)
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Air Canada and its striking pilots have reached
a tentative agreement to end a nine-day strike that grounded the
fleet of Canada's largest airline. Ratification of the agreement,
which was reached Thursday night, by the 2,100 pilots is expected
to take about three days. The airline said its 500 daily flights
are expected to resume next Wednesday or Thursday. Air Canada,
which normally carries about 60,000 passengers a day, lost an
estimated dlrs 7 million U.S. daily during the strike. Jean-Marc
Belanger, chairman of the Air Canada Pilots Association, wouldn't
elaborate on the contents of the deal but said ``I am a happy man
tonight.'' (CANADA-AIR CANADA STRIKE)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Bluntly warned by Senate Democrats that he
faces impeachment, President Bill Clinton is preparing for a dark
day in his presidency _ public release of a prosecutor's report in
the Monica Lewinsky affair that accuses the president of perjury
and obstruction of justice, legal sources say. Once the House votes
Friday to authorize public release, millions of Internet users
worldwide can read the information _ some of it sexually graphic _
gathered by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. The report includes
a damaging portrayal of Clinton's contacts with the former White
House intern, and lays out information that prosecutors contend
shows 11 impeachable offenses, including perjury, obstruction of
justice, witness tampering and abuse of power, the sources said.
Clinton's private lawyer, David Kendall, again took a swipe at the
report Thursday even before seeing it. He called it simply a
collection of prosecutors' ``contentions, claims and allegations
and we look forward to the chance to rebut them.''
(US-CLINTON-CONGRESS)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's ruling party supporters
fired guns, threw rocks and swung clubs at vastly outnumbered
opposition protesters Friday as strongman Hun Sen turned to mobs to
crush growing calls for his ouster. At least one person was killed
and several wounded the day after King Norodom Sihanouk appealed to
the army and police to stop shooting and beating peaceful
protesters and Buddhist monks. Despite the violence, anti-Hun Sen
demonstrators regrouped later Friday and staged a protest march.
Sihanouk, who treads a fine line as constitutional monarch,
balanced the implicit criticism of Hun Sen by pressuring the
opposition leaders _ his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and Sam
Rainsy _ to drop threats to boycott the National Assembly when it
meets Sept. 24. The opposition accuses Hun Sen of winning
parliamentary elections July 26 by massive fraud and vows to
withhold the two-thirds majority support he needs to form a new
government. (CAMBODIA)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Friday
a new government would need time to tackle Russia's economic crisis
and he appealed to all political factions for support. Primakov,
whose appointment was expected to be confirmed by lawmakers later
Friday, was keeping quiet about his likely economic policies. He
told political leaders they should give the next government up to a
year before deciding if it was succeeding or not. President Boris
Yeltsin said a major crisis had been avoided by compromise and that
Primakov had strong backing from all sides. He called for measures
to stabilize prices, restore supplies to shops and prop up the
banking system. Communist lawmakers said they expected some of
their supporters to be named to posts in the new Cabinet, but
Primakov said it was too early to speak of policies or
appointments. (RUSSIA-POLITICS)
	   ISTINIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite new international calls for
Serb leaders to halt their attacks in the Kosovo province, many
ethnic Albanian refugees in the embattled region are losing hope.
An estimated 25,000 ethnic Albanians camped around the southwestern
Kosovo village of Istinic, where they sought refuge from Serb-led
Yugoslav forces seeking to destroy the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army. U.N. officials planned to visit the refugees
Friday to discourage police from arresting males suspected of links
to the KLA. For now, Serb forces appear to have halted their
advance, which drove ethnic Albanians from their homes and farms
into a huge encampment around this village, which was one of the
last strongholds of the KLA. Kosovo fighting already has created an
estimated 265,000 refugees. Western officials fear the worst if
urgent help isn't provided for the 50,000 or so living in the hills
and forests, especially with the arrival of winter in about six
weeks. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India hinted Friday that it was prepared
to sign on to a nuclear test ban, saying its objections have been
met and that it was already adhering to the treaty. Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee told reporters in the northern city of Lucknow
that his decision to refrain from conducting further nuclear tests
following a series in May amounted to ``adherence of the nuclear
test ban treaty in spirit.'' ``A final decision on signing the CTBT
will be taken soon,'' Vajpayee said. India has long objected that
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty freezes the advantage Britain,
China, France, Russia and the United States have gained by decades
of testing. Now India, too, has been able to refine its nuclear
arsenals and had no need for further tests, said Brajesh Mishra,
the Indian prime minister's top adviser. Rival Pakistan, with whom
India has fought three wars, responded by carrying out its own
nuclear tests. The Pakistani Parliament has scheduled a debate on
the CTBT, apparently in preparation for signing it. (INDIA-NUCLEAR)

Brazilian in Philippines accused of links to terrorists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine immigration agents have
arrested a Brazilian on suspicion he operated an illegal
long-distance phone service used by terrorists, a government
official said Friday.
	   Immigration Commissioner Rufus Rodriguez said the phone service
allegedly operated by the Brazilian, Deyrold Dean, was used by
local contacts of international terrorists to avoid detection by
police.
	   Rodriguez said at least two names found on a list in Dean's
possession were included on a government list of suspected
terrorists, and some calls were traced to Libya and Pakistan.
	   Dean told reporters he was innocent and said the phone service
was operated by someone else.
	   ``I admit I wanted to make an illegal phone call but this is not
my operation,'' he said.
	   Rodriguez said Dean was arrested Thursday following a complaint
by local phone companies. When arrested, Dean failed to show any
passport or travel documents, Rodriguez said.
	   The companies claimed that Dean, through the use of hi-tech
equipment, was able to tap into long distance facilities of
legitimate phone companies without paying toll fees.
	   Seized from Dean's house in suburban Caloocan City were phones
and other equipment, Rodriguez said.
	   Dean was turned over to an anti-hijacking and terrorism
commission for further investigation, Rodriguez said.
	   The phone companies reported losing at least 8 million pesos
(dlrs 186,000) in unpaid toll charges from the illegal phone
operation.
	   Dean's hometown was not immediately available.

China to boost railway investment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China will increase its investment in railway
construction this year by 4.2 billion yuan (dlrs 508 million) to a
total 53 billion yuan (dlrs 6.14 billion), the state-run Economic
Daily newspaper reported Friday.
	   China has stepped up government-financed construction of
railways, housing and other infrastructure in an attempt to boost
flagging economic growth.
	   Between January and August, China invested 21.76 billion yuan
(dlrs 2.63 billion) in large and medium-sized railway construction
projects, the report said.
	   But railway investment has to be further accelerated to meet
this year's target of spending 41.3 billion yuan (dlrs 5 billion).
	   The government plans to lay 1,876 kilometers (1,172 miles) of
railroad tracks, 1,210 kilometers (756 miles) of new rail lines,
575 kilometers (359 miles) of double-track lines and 1,091
kilometers (681 miles) of electric railways, the report said.
	   Investment in highway construction surged 82 percent in the
first eight months of the year over the same period a year earlier
to 86.2 billion yuan (dlrs 10.44 billion), Xinhua News Agency
reported.
	   China plans 38,500 kilometers (24,062 miles) of highway projects
this year, it said.

Georges Meyer, chairman of Galeries Lafayette
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Georges Meyer, a textile engineer who built
Galeries Lafayette into France's largest retail chain, has died,
the company said Friday. He was 67.
	   Meyer died of myeloma, a form of leukemia, at his Paris home on
Tuesday, a company spokeswoman said. He was buried in eastern
France on Thursday.
	   Due to his advancing illness, Meyer had passed his
responsibilities over to Philippe Houze and Philippe Lemoine, both
company vice presidents since 1993, the company said in a
statement.
	   Galeries Lafayette owns more than 300 stores in France as well
as Germany, China and Israel, with about 34,000 employees. Meyer
tried to establish a New York foothold in 1991 with a large store
in Trump Tower, but after losing dlrs 20 million a year closed it
three years later.
	   Born in Coteau, France on Sept. 21, 1930, the son of an
industrialist began in the textile industry in northern France in
the late 1950s.
	   He joined the 102-year-old Galeries Lafayette in 1964 after
marrying Noelle Meyer, the granddaughter of the company's founder
Theophile Bader.
	   Meyer became vice president in 1970 and became chairman in 1987,
spearheading a renewal of France's large department stores. He was
also behind the acquisition of Nouvelles Galeries, Bazar de l'Hotel
de Ville (BHV), Cofinoga and Prisunic.
	   Meyer was Commander of the Legion of Honor, one of the nation's
highest awards.
	   He is survived by his wife and three sons, Alexandre, David and
Raphael.
	   Galeries Lafayette said the next board of directors meeting
would decide on a permanent leadership structure.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a bid to shore up its leading role in Japan's
increasingly liberalized financial industry, Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. said Friday that it will link-up with three
other financing arms of the Mitsubishi group to form a joint
investment trust company.
	   Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Japan's largest lender and one of the world's
biggest banks, will forge new ties with Mitsubishi Trust and
Banking Corp., Meiji Life Insurance Co. and Tokio Marine and Fire
Insurance Co.
	   All four are core members of the powerful Mitsubishi group, a
faction of sister companies with large stakes in one another which
trace their origins to the Mitsubishi ``zaibatsu'' conglomerate
broken up after World War II.
	   The alliance is intended to strengthen the group as the
government implements its so-called Big Bang reforms to deregulate
the banking, insurance and securities industries. The changes
remove barriers which have long shielded domestic firms from
competitive pressures.
	   A number of Japanese financial concerns have already made
similar alliances, some with foreign companies eager to establish a
beachhead in Japan's lucrative market. Most recently, U.S.
financial giant Travelers Group Inc. bought a quarter of Nikko
Securities Co., Japan's third-largest broker.
	   That deal sent shockwaves through the tightly-knit Mitsubishi
group because it effectively removed Nikko from the group's sphere
of influence by replacing Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi as the
brokerage's top shareholder.
	   Analysts said the decision to strengthen ties was probably
triggered by the Travelers Group deal with Nikko Securities.
	   But Mitsubishi executives stressed Friday that the new joint
venture was not a defensive move prompted by concern over the
fortunes of the four individual firms in a more competitive _ and
more global _ marketplace.
	   ``We can survive by ourselves,'' said Kokei Higuchi, president
of Tokio Marine and Fire. ``But this alliance is aimed at helping
each other.''
	   Yoshinobu Yamada, senior analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.,
said the move was likely to help the Mitsubishi group in the
long-term, but would produce few immediate revenue gains.
	   Government officials welcomed the news.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said such cooperation is necessary
to compete on a worldwide basis and noted that other, similar
alliances could be formed. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
the Mitsubishi alliance was ``a good thing.''
	   The four Mitsubishi financial firms plan to set up the jointly
owned investment-trust company in December, and also cooperate in
pension and investment banking businesses.
	   Company officials said they will also consider tie-ups with
domestic financial companies outside the Mitsubishi group, as well
as foreign institutions, though nothing specific has been decided.
	   Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi President Satoru Kishi said that
Travelers is not among the companies they are considering as a
potential tie-up partner.
	   Kishi said that the Mitsubishi companies will continue to
compete with each other in asset management, derivatives and
insurance.

Doctors strike against hospital reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Doctors across Greece Friday began
striking against a government plan to abolish a rotating emergency
room duty system at hospitals.
	   Only serious cases are being treated. With the exception of
Athens, strikes at all public hospitals will last until Tuesday.
Athens doctors begin a three-day walkout Monday.
	   Doctors are protesting proposals abolishing a system where a
region's hospitals rotate emergency room duty. If not on duty,
hospitals will often not accept emergency cases.
	   The government wants each major hospital to have a permanent and
fully functioning emergency room by the end of 1998.
	   Doctors don't disagree with the proposal, but argue hospital
resources are over-stretched and that extra staff and funds are
needed for the new system.

PAL, union reach agreement to save ailing airline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with PAL, union agreeing on plan to save
airline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines chairman Lucio
Tan agreed Friday to give 20 percent ownership of the company to
its employees as part of a deal with the ground crew union to save
the ailing airline.
	   Under the agreement, the PAL Employees Association agreed to
suspend its collective bargaining agreement with the management for
10 years.
	   In a statement, the airline said the employees will be given
three seats on the 15-member board of directors of the airline.
	   Under the stock transfer, each employee will receive 60,000
shares of stock from the Tan group's shareholdings in PAL but will
not be allowed to dispose or sell their shares until their
retirement, the airline said.
	   There will also be no salary deductions, and retrenched union
members who have not received separation pay will be rehired. Their
medical benefits will be untouched, the airline said.
	   There are around 3,000 union members still employed by the
airline after 4,000 opted to retire.
	   The airline said last week it lost 2.2 billion pesos (dlrs 51
million) in the first quarter of the fiscal year, which began April
1, mainly because of work stoppages.
	   PAL said a 22-day strike by its pilots in June caused the
heaviest damage, canceling two-thirds of its flights and causing
revenue losses of about 200 million pesos (dlrs 4.6 million) a day.
	   The airline said its losses also rose due to soaring
dollar-denominated payments and continuing lease payments on unused
planes which have not yet been returned.
	   In the last fiscal year, the national flag carrier reported a
loss of 8.08 billion pesos (dlrs 185 million).
	   PAL is seeking to restructure its debts and has obtained
permission to suspend payments to domestic and international
creditors amounting to dlrs 2.1 billion while it prepares a
rehabilitation plan.
	   The plan includes layoffs, the disposal of most of the airline's
planes and a sharp reduction of flights.
	   The airline fired all the striking pilots after they ignored a
government return-to-work order.
	   At the height of the strike, PAL laid off 5,000 of its more than
13,000 workers to minimize its losses. It also halted an ambitious
dlrs 4 billion refleeting and modernization program.
	   The ground crew union went on strike in July but returned to
work after the company agreed to suspend for one month the
retrenchment of 1,800 of its members.

France risks winter electricity shortage: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's electrical utility may be forced to import
power this winter due to shutdowns at several nuclear power plants
since spring, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The state-owned monopoly Electricite de France (EDF) was seeking
approval to restart its Belleville nuclear power facility to offset
its energy output shortfall, the daily Le Monde said.
	   The move is expected to face opposition from the ecology-minded
Green Party, the report said.
	   EDF was holding a board meeting Friday to discuss the matter.
Officials at EDF weren't immediately reachable for comment.
	   According to an accompanying report, Le Monde said that of the
56 existing nuclear facilities in France, 41 are currently in
operation.
	   Le Monde said the outages may cut the company's 1998 forecast
profits by 400 million francs (dlrs 67 million) from a previously
estimated 1 billion francs (dlrs 169 million).
	   France depends on nuclear power for about 75 percent of its
electricity. The industrial think tank OECD, the Organization for
Cooperation and Economic Development, had urged in a report that
France reduce that figure and expand other energy sources.

EU's Santer criticizes Britain over Yugoslavia flight ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Commission President Jacques
Santer criticized Britain Friday for not immediately applying a
European Union flight ban on the Yugoslav national airline and is
considering legal action.
	   ``Decisions taken by the 15 member states should be applied by
the 15,'' Santer said in a statement. ``When one or more member
states do not play along, it makes sanctions meaningless.''
	   The 15 EU leaders ordered the ban at a summit in June in
response to the crackdown by Serbian troops against ethnic Albanian
separatists in Kosovo province. The EU finally introduced the ban
Tuesday, supposedly putting airports in all 15 EU nations out of
bounds to Yugoslav planes.
	   But Britain, citing a 1959 air agreement with Yugoslavia, said
it must allow the national carrier JAT to continue flights for
another 12 months.
	   ``We will examine where we will take this issue from here,''
said Santer. The Commission's legal experts are already
investigating the case officials said. If they consider Britain's
actions illegal, the Commission could take the country to EU's
highest court in Luxembourg.
	   British diplomats insisted their government supported the flight
ban and had stopped Yugoslav charter flights, but claimed Britain
would break international law if it failed to give JAT a year's
notice of cancellation of the air deal.

Kase, Hosoya share lead in Suntory Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INZAI, Japan (AP) _ Hideki Kase, in a slump for nearly two
years, shot his second straight 2-under-par 69 Friday to share a
one-stroke lead with little-known Norio Hosoya midway through the
100 million yen (dlrs 740,000) Suntory Open.
	   Kase, seeking his first victory in two years and fourth overall,
scored four birdies, including three straight from the sixth hole,
against two bogeys en route to a 4-under 138 total.
	   ``My golf has been unstable with a lot of easy mistakes,'' said
Kase, who last won in the 1996 Nikkei Cup. ``But it's getting back
on track since July.''
	   The Nikkei Cup gave him a two-year exempt status on the tour. He
will now have to worry about the qualifying tournaments.
	   Hosoya, a non-winner in 12 years as a pro, also fired his second
straight 69 over the par-71 Sobu Country Club course.
	   ``Now that I've just survived the cut, I want to free-flow even
though I may not be able to play impressively,'' said Hosoya, a
qualifier from the Monday tournament.
	   Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, winner of 108 career victories, also
shot a 69 and stood one shot off the pace along with overnight
leader Saburo Fujiki and two others.
	   After firing three birdies in the first 10 holes, Ozaki bogeyed
the par-3 11th but recovered with a birdie on the 12th and was
4-under until a bogey on the par-4 final hole cost him a share of
the lead.
	   ``Today I missed quite a few birdie putts from about 3 meters
(10 feet),'' said Ozaki. He missed such putts on the sixth,
seventh, 14th, 15th and 17th holes.
	   American Lee Janzen, this year's U.S. Open champion, shot a 72
for a share of 11th at 141.

Protesters march again after mob kills one; king warns opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Ruling party supporters fired guns,
threw rocks and swung clubs at vastly outnumbered opposition
protesters Friday as strongman Hun Sen turned to plainclothes mobs
to crush growing calls for his ouster. At least one person was
killed and several wounded.
	   Hun Sen used crowds in street clothes _ with men who appeared to
be police and soldiers _ instead of uniformed police a day after
King Norodom Sihanouk appealed to the army and police to stop
shooting and beating peaceful protesters and Buddhist monks.
	   Human-rights workers reported that an opposition supporter was
chased down, beaten, shot in the back and killed, bringing the
total of connfirmed deaths since Monday to four. A pool of blood
and his hat remained at the site.
	   Defiant anti-Hun Sen demonstrators regrouped, however, and
staged a protest march from the main market _ where they were
initially dispersed by police firing over their heads _ to the U.S.
Embassy. Their numbers swelled from 150 to about 1,200 before they
broke up peacefully.
	   Sihanouk, who treads a fine line as constitutional monarch,
balanced his implicit criticism of Hun Sen by pressuring the
opposition leaders _ his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and Sam
Rainsy _ to drop threats to boycott the National Assembly when it
meets Sept. 24.
	   The opposition accuses Hun Sen of winning parliamentary
elections July 26 by massive fraud and vows to withhold the
two-thirds majority support he needs to form a new government.
	   If they fail to take their seats, Sihanouk warned, they will not
have parliamentary immunity. Sam Rainsy, who is seeking refuge at
the local U.N. offices, is threatened with arrest by Hun Sen.
	   ``I cannot be helpful to you if you experience any danger or
anything eventually happens to you,'' the king said.
	   The army chief of staff, Gen. Ke Kim Yan, signaled that the
opposition cannot count on the military breaking with Hun Sen,
saying in a televised address that protesters were creating
``worrying anarchy'' and the armed forces would uphold the election
results.
	   Week-long violence, the worst since Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh in
a coup last year, took a new turn when 2,000 backers of Hun Sen's
party, carrying clubs and guns and many drunk on rice wine, marched
against a gathering of 300 opposition supporters.
	   ``We are looking for the losers. They are trouble-makers,'' said
Chan Lay, 42, reeking of alcohol. He bore a club and a pistol
protruded from his shirt.
	   Warned in advance, the opposition protesters moved away from
their gathering point near the U.S. Embassy and Ranariddh's home.
There were inexplicably confronted by six security guards from a
seedy hotel who opened fire with pistols. At least three men were
wounded in the legs.
	   The two groups finally met on a side street, which erupted into
a rock-throwing battleground. Gunfire erupted from the Hun Sen
crowd. Opposition supporters fled on motorbikes and foot.
	   The U.N. human-rights office issued a statement calling on the
government ``to disband and disarm these groups. In the current
volatile climate, the activities of these groups risks provoking
further violence.''
	   Riot police who have acted as Hun Sen's shock troops since he
launched a crackdown Monday against weeks of peaceful protest
deployed only after the blood-letting. They gave the pro-Hun Sen
crowd _ some of whom were reportedly paid _ bread and water.
	   ``Police have been ordered not to intervene, just to protect
certain places,'' said government spokesman Khieu Kanharith. ``We
have only ordered the ambulances to be ready.''
	   A boy shot in the leg refused to enter an ambulance to take him
to the capital's Calmette hospital, seen as a bastion of Hun Sen
support. No other wounded were taken to Calmette.
	   Belief is widespread that a Buddhist monk reportedly slain in a
police charge Wednesday and taken by the ambulance never reached
the hospital. Many monks have been beaten and wounded in the
protests. Rumors that several have died intensified public anger.
	   Onlookers did not join the Hun Sen crowd, contrasting with an
opposition march that attracted more than 6,000 Thursday.
	   Mok Ban, 40, held up a club as thick as his arm and said he
supported the opposition's right to protest, but not to create
tension.
	   ``That's why we have come to suppress them, to stop them from
disrupting people's businesses,'' Mok Ban said. ``Our patience is
running short.''

Iran promises to avenge deaths of diplomats in Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Afghanistan-Diplomats &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will avenge the deaths of nine of its
diplomats, who were killed by members of the Taliban militia in
Afghanistan, former President Hashemi Rafsanjani said Friday.
	   ``I condole the martyrs' families and promise them that we will
get revenge for their blood,'' Rafsanjani, still a key official,
said in a sermon during Friday prayers at Tehran University.
	   The Taliban said Thursday that the bodies of the nine Iranians
were found this week, and admitted that they had been killed by the
religious army's own troops. The disclosure was made in a letter
from the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan. The United Nations condemned the killings.
	   The diplomats had vanished Aug. 8 during a battle in which the
Taliban, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, seized the
northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   For weeks, Iran has accused the Taliban of holding some 70
Iranians, including 11 diplomats and a journalist, but the Taliban
has denied any knowledge of the whereabouts of the others.
	   On Friday, Deputy Foreign Minister Mohsen Aminzadeh said that
the other two Iranian diplomats captured by the Taliban had escaped
from their captors, Iranian television reported.
	   He said one of them was injured but gave no further details.
	   ``Efforts are underway to determine their exact whereabouts,''
he said, suggesting they were in Afghanistan or Pakistan.
	   Pakistan is seen as a major backer of the Taliban, while Iran
has supported the Afghan opposition forces.
	   The fate of the journalist, who works for Iran's Islamic
Republic News Agency, was not known.
	   Promises to avenge the diplomats' death also came from Iran's
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.
	   ``The revolutionary sons of Islamic Iran, by sacrificing their
own lives and through revolutionary wrath, shall give the
perpetrators of this crime what they justly deserve,'' a statement
broadcast on Iranian television said.
	   ``The Taliban and the main agents responsible for this horrific
crime must also know that they shall never be immune to the
tumultuous anger of the Islamic corps,'' the statement said.
	   Some 70,000 elite Iranian soldiers _ backed by tanks and
helicopter gunships _ held three days of maneuvers near the Afghan
border earlier this month in a show of force.
	   Iran's army chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Ali Shahbazi, said more
maneuvers would be held on the border but did not give a date.
	   The U.S. State Department has expressed concern about rising
tensions between Iran and Afghanistan and has urged both sides to
exercise restraint, possibly seeking U.N. mediation.
	   But Rafsanjani said Iran was acting within its rights and warned
the United States against interfering.
	   ``We reserve the right to protect and defend our national
interests and our nation. We keep this right and you will see that
we will act appropriately,'' he said.
	   Rafsanjani, who heads the powerful Expediency Council, a body
that advises the government, said Iran would act when it saw fit.
	   ``We definitely will punish these criminals but Iran will not
act in anger. We will have our plans, too,'' Rafsanjani said.
	   Later Friday, more than 200 policemen sealed off the area
surrounding the Pakistani Embassy to keep demonstrators away.

Last pre-election poll in Slovakia shows Meciar in first place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's
ruling party clung to first place in the last opinion poll allowed
before parliamentary elections, results released Friday showed.
	   However, the poll indicates that top opposition parties have a
good chance of taking power after the Sept. 25-26 elections if they
can put aside their differences and form a coalition.
	   The poll, conducted Sept. 5-9 by the independent agency MVK,
showed Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia receiving the
support of 28 percent of respondents. The largest opposition party,
the Slovak Democratic Coalition, was second with 23 percent.
	   The second-largest opposition party, the Party of Civic
Understanding, came in third with 15 percent, and the former
communist party, Party of the Democratic Left, gained the support
of 13 percent.
	   The poll, based on personal interviews with 1,308 people,
carries a margin of error of plus or minus 2-3 percent.
	   The survey showed that two other political parties are on target
to clear the minimum 5 percent needed to gain seats in Parliament _
the opposition Party of Hungarian Coalition with 7 percent and the
Slovak National Party, one of Meciar's former coalition partners,
with 6 percent.
	   Anna Malikova, first vice-chairwoman of the Slovak National
Party, said the poll was biased in favor of the opposition, adding
that its own surveys show it with 8 percent or more.
	   She said she was glad polls are not allowed in the final two
weeks of the campaign, because ``they are abused as a tool for the
political campaign.''
	   The director of the poll agency, Pavel Haulik, said Meciar's
party is very likely to get 28 to 32 percent, but dismissed the
party's predictions of 40 percent as unreasonable.
	   About 66 percent of poll respondents said they planned to vote.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ For the second time since
their devastating war ended, Bosnians begin two days of voting for
national leaders Saturday with the outcome likely to decide how
much the divided country will adhere to its complex peace treaty.
	   Western powers led by the United States and European Union, who
run the country now under the 1995 Dayton peace plan, hope
ethnic-driven political parties that waged the 3 1-2 -year war lose
support and fade away.
	   They want more moderate leaders willing to implement the Dayton
treaty, which set up two ethnic-based entities _ one a Serb
republic and the other a Muslim-Croat federation _ with the goal of
slowly forcing a democratic evolution in the former Yugoslav
republic.
	   But ethnic nationalist sentiments remain strong among Bosnian
Serbs and Bosnian Croats, and the outcome of major races involving
their candidates were uncertain as campaigning ended Thursday.
	   ``I do hope very much they (the winners) will be people who look
to the future and not to the past,'' NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said Friday.
	   A total of 83 candidates, parties and coalitions are on the
complicated ballots, with voters only choosing leaders in the
entity in which they registered. More than 2.7 million of Bosnia's
4.3 million people are registered.
	   Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic, one of the nation's
three-member presidency under the Dayton accord setup, was expected
to easily win re-election to the panel.
	   The races for the Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat members of the
presidency looked much tighter, with the results certain to
influence how much further progress is made in adopting the Dayton
requirements.
	   More than 30,000 NATO-led troops, mostly from the United States
and Europe, impose security in Bosnia as international officials in
charge try to use Dayton to force the country toward European
integration.
	   The officials complain the Bosnian Serb member of the
presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik, has obstructed efforts to implement
the peace plan and openly oppose his re-election.
	   They say hard-line followers of Krajisnik still hold positions
in the Bosnian Serb republic such as mayors and police chiefs and
oppose steps called for under the Dayton treaty, including the
return of refugees to their pre-war homes.
	   ``I think if this election works out and that Krajisnik
disappears from the scene,'' replacing hard-line Serb officials
would proceed more easily, said Jacques Paul Klein, the chief
deputy to the European overseer of Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp.
	   Because of the inability of the three-member presidency to agree
on policy issues, due to lingering hatred and mistrust from their
war, Westendorp has been given what amounts to absolute power to
force decisions on the panel.
	   That has brought measures aimed at moving Bosnia toward
operating as a single nation, something Krajisnik and his fervently
Serbian nationalist party and allies oppose.
	   To them, the Bosnian Serb republic is a separate entity in
Bosnia with stronger ties to Yugoslavia than the Muslim-Croat
federation. They insist Izetbegovic, the Muslim leader, wants to
make Bosnia a single state with a Muslim majority, which they say
differs from the Dayton agreement's concept of separate entities.
	   Krajisnik's main opponent is Zivko Radisic of the moderate
Harmony coalition, which has adopted a pro-Dayton stance to gain
support from Western powers.
	   The race for the Bosnian Croat seat on the presidency is between
incumbent Kresimir Zubak, a moderate who broke away from the
hard-line Croatian Democratic Union of his opponent, Ante Jelavic.
	   Voters also will choose a national parliament, along with
separate parliaments in each entity. In the Bosnian Serb republic,
voters will select a new republic president, with former hard-liner
Biljana Plavsic running for re-election against Krajisnik ally
Nikola Poplasen.
	   Plavsic, a Bosnian Serb leader during the war, has modified her
image to distance herself from Radovan Karadzic, the former
nationalist leader now wanted on a war crimes indictment. Her
government has received millions of dollars in Western aid for its
support of the Dayton agreement.

Volkswagen board to meet on fund for slave laborers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Announcement on fund expected by 1300 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Volkswagen's supervisory board worked
Friday on the final details of a fund to compensate former slave
laborers forced to work for the company by the Nazis during World
War II.
	   But a lawyer involved in one lawsuit against the automaker said
VW's plans to offer ``humanitarian aid'' to survivors would not be
enough to fend off legal action.
	   New York lawyer Ed Fagan said the company should provide a list
of slave laborers who worked in the plants and acknowledge a legal
debt to them.
	   ``What they keep doing is trying to confuse charity with a legal
obligation,'' said Fagan, who was traveling in Jerusalem.
	   ``Without producing those lists there is no settlement and there
is no agreement, and we will continue to attack them and make them
pay in an American court,'' he said.
	   Like many other German firms, Volkswagen maintains it has no
legal obligation to compensate former slave laborers, arguing they
were forced on it by the Nazis.
	   But VW broke ranks with the bulk of German industry in July by
announcing it would set up a fund to give ``humanitarian aid'' to
survivors.
	   The automaker's supervisory board met Friday to settle details
of how much money it will involve and how it will be administered.
	   Lawsuits and threatened lawsuits have raised the pressure on
German firms to address the claims of concentration camp inmates,
mostly Jews, forced to work in their factories.
	   Some companies recently suggested they'd be willing to
contribute to a publicly administered fund, but Chancellor Helmut
Kohl has rejected any government involvement.
	   German attorney Klaus von Muenchhausen threatened early this
year to file a lawsuit on behalf of 30 Hungarian Jews forced to
work for Volkswagen, but held off on those plans after VW announced
it would set up a fund.

Thyssen, Krupp announced stock valuation plan in their merger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ Thyssen and Krupp announced an
agreement Friday on stock valuation for their merger to create one
of Europe's largest industrial firms.
	   The agreement means the two companies enter the final phase of
their merger, to take effect March 31. European Union officials
already have approved the plans.
	   The combined company will have 180,000 employees and about 70
billion marks (dlrs 38 billion) a year in sales in products ranging
from steel to elevators.
	   The companies said Friday they would complete a stock swap by
Oct. 1 based on a 1-to-0.79 ratio of company values between Thyssen
and Krupp. The ratio is based on a value of 690.09 (dlrs 383.38)
marks per Thyssen share and 543.82 marks (dlrs 302.12) per Krupp
share, the companies said.
	   The merger creates Europe's fifth largest industrial concern,
behind other German companies such as electronics giant Siemens and
automaker Volkswagen.
	   Last year, the two companies merged their steel operations to
create Europe's largest steelmaker, in a move that led to talks on
a full merger.
	   Thyssen AG, based in Duesseldorf, has operations in capital
goods, manufactured products, trading and services, in addition to
steel.
	   Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp, of Essen, resulted from the merger of
German steel and engineering groups Krupp AG and Hoesch AG in
December 1992.

 &UR; Protests, calls for revenge after Israel kills Hamas fugitives &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with protest marches, clashes in West Bank,
Gaza, changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   EL BIREH, West Bank (AP) _ Shouting ``we want revenge now,''
hundreds of Hamas supporters marched in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip on Friday after Israel killed the group's two top fugitives.
In one town, protesters hurled stones at Israeli troops.
	   Hamas, an Islamic militant group, vowed to detonate new suicide
bombings in Israel to avenge the deaths of brothers Imad and Adel
Awadallah. Bracing for attacks, Israel sealed off the West Bank and
Gaza Strip and security forces were placed on high alert.
	   The new tension came as U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross shuttled
between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in hopes of concluding
a deal on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   A new outbreak of violence would make it exceedingly difficult
for Ross to negotiate a breakthrough and end a 17-month stalemate.
	   On the third day of his mission, Ross met Friday with
Palestinian security chiefs to discuss the possible release of
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Later in the day, Ross was
to hold talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The killings triggered protest marches in the West Bank and
Gaza. In the town of Nablus, about 1,000 Hamas supporters clamoring
for revenge chanted ``we want bombings.''
	   In the town of El Bireh, some 300 people marched from the home
of the Awadallah family to the nearby Jewish settlement of Psagot,
shouting ``revenge, revenge.'' Several dozen marchers broke away
and threw stones and empty bottles at Israeli troops who fired
several rounds of rubber bullets.
	   In Gaza City, Hamas supporters led by the group's founder, Ahmed
Yassin, shouted ``we want revenge now,'' shaking their fists in the
air. A leaflet distributed during the march said that Hamas will
take revenge and ``create an earthquake under the Zionists' feet.''
The retaliation will be similar in scope to the response to the
1996 killing of Hamas' chief bombmaker, Yehiyeh Ayyash, it said.
	   At the time, Hamas detonated four suicide bombings that killed
dozens of Israelis, disrupted peace talks and brought Israel's
hardline leader, Netanyahu, to power.
	   The Awadallah brothers were killed Thursday afternoon in a
remote house surrounded by vineyards and orchards near the village
of Taibeh, west of the West Bank town of Hebron. The safehouse is
in an area under full Israeli security control.
	   Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, suggested that the
Awadallah brothers were killed in a carefully planned ambush.
	   ``This is another example of terrorists known for killing
Israelis being pursued wherever they are,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Palestinian peace negotiator Hassan Asfour condemned the
killings as ``a terrorist act.''
	   Israel has killed Islamic militants in the past, including
Islamic Jihad leader Fathi Shekaki, who was shot to death outside a
Malta hotel in 1995 by gunmen on a motorcycle.
	   Palestinian witnesses said they saw a truck and four vans pull
up to the Taibeh safehouse at about 4 p.m. Thursday. Dozens of men
jumped out and surrounded the house, the witnesses said. Several
minutes later, shots were heard. There were conflicting reports
about whether the men wore army uniforms or civilian clothes.
	   The army would only say that troops raided the home after shots
and an explosion were heard and that the two fugitives were killed
in a gun battle with soldiers.
	   Adel Awadallah, commander of the Hamas military wing Izzedine al
Qassam in the West Bank, headed Israel's most wanted list. Israel
believed he masterminded several suicide bombings.
	   Imad Awadallah, also a leading figure in Izzedine al Qassam,
escaped from a Palestinian jail last month. He had been held on
suspicion that he killed a fellow Hamas fugitive, Mohiyedine
Sharif, in a fight over power and money.

PAL, union reach agreement to save ailing airline
</HEADLINE>

refusal to accept PAL tickets because of debts; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines chairman Lucio
Tan agreed Friday to give 20 percent ownership of the company to
its employees as part of a deal with the ground crew union to save
the ailing airline.
	   In exchange, the PAL Employees Association, the airline's
largest union, agreed to suspend its collective bargaining
agreement with management for 10 years, officials said.
	   The agreement gives the ailing flag carrier ``a new lease on
life,'' PAL said in a statement.
	   It said three seats have also been reserved for employees on the
airline's 15-member board of directors.
	   Under the stock transfer, employees will each receive 60,000
shares of stock from the Tan group's shareholdings in PAL. However,
they will not be allowed to dispose of or sell their shares until
their retirement, the airline said.
	   There will also be no salary reductions, and retrenched union
members who have not received separation pay will be rehired, the
airline said.
	   There are around 3,000 union members still employed by the
airline after 4,000 opted to retire.
	   The airline said last week it lost 2.2 billion pesos (dlrs 51
million) in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning April 1,
mainly because of work stoppages.
	   PAL said a 22-day strike by its pilots in June caused the
heaviest damage, canceling two-thirds of its flights and causing
revenue losses of about 200 million pesos (dlrs 4.6 million) a day.
	   The airline fired all the striking pilots after they ignored a
government return-to-work order.
	   The airline said its losses also rose because of soaring
dollar-denominated payments and continuing lease payments on unused
planes which have not yet been returned.
	   In the previous fiscal year, the carrier reported a loss of 8.08
billion pesos (dlrs 185 million).
	   PAL is seeking to restructure its debts and has obtained
permission to suspend payments to domestic and international
creditors amounting to dlrs 2.1 billion while it prepares a
rehabilitation plan. The plan includes the disposal of most of the
airline's planes and a sharp reduction of flights.
	   The suspension of the collective bargaining agreement was also a
key condition required by the airline's creditors, PAL said.
	   At the height of the strike, PAL laid off 5,000 of its more than
13,000 workers to minimize its losses. It also halted an ambitious
dlrs 4 billion refleeting and modernization program.
	   In a sign Friday of the seriousness of the airline's problems, a
senior PAL official said other airlines are now refusing to
recognize its tickets because it is unable to repay dlrs 25 million
owed them.

Ambassador asks pope to make another visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) _ Bosnia's new ambassador to the
Vatican asked Pope John Paul II on Friday to make a second visit,
saying his presence would spur efforts to rebuild the country.
	   ``The biggest help to resolve all our problems would be another
visit,'' Ambassador Vlatko Kraljevic said when presenting his
credentials at the pope's vacation palace in the Alban Hills south
of Rome.
	   John Paul paid a 25-hour visit to Sarajevo, the capital of
Bosnia-Herzegovina, in April 1997, fulfilling a desire he
repeatedly expressed when the Bosnian war was raging and Sarajevo
was under siege by Bosnian Serbs.
	   He did not respond to the new invitation, but called last year's
visit ``memorable.''

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A Sudanese government warplane bombed the
largest camp for those displaced by fighting in rebel-held southern
Sudan, killing two people, an aid group said Friday.
	   On the eastern front, rebels said its forces killed 20
government soldiers in military camp near Roseires, site of a dam
that produces much of the electricity for Khartoum, 475 kilometers
(300 miles) to the northwest.
	   The dam remained in government control after Thursday's attack,
said Hassan Ahmed al-Hassan, the Cairo-based spokesman for the
National Democratic Alliance, a group of northern Sudanese
opposition parties.
	   The government bombing raid was the latest in a series of
attacks on Labone Camp near Sudan's border with Uganda, said Chaap
Paul, of Norwegian People's Aid, which runs a hospital in the camp.
	   ``We condemn the attack in the strongest possible terms because
it is not a military target at all,'' Paul said at the agency's
headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya.
	   An Antonov dropped three bombs at 9:10 a.m. (0710 GMT) Thursday,
he said. Two displaced Sudanese were killed, and one lightly
wounded. No damage was done to the camp, where 45,000 people have
lived since 1994.
	   The camp is in an area controlled by the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, which has fought a 15-year war for greater
autonomy in the south from the Arab, Muslim-dominated government in
the north. In 1995, the SPLA formed an alliance with the NDA.
	   On Aug. 3 the government declared a unilateral cease-fire
throughout southern Sudan, to promote the flow of aid to hundreds
of thousands of Sudanese facing famine. The announcement expanded a
previous three-month agreement covering a smaller area.
	   About 1.5 million people have died in fighting and famines since
1983.

Another comeback for Lothar Matthaeus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more quotes from Matthaeus &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Another comeback for Lothar Matthaeus.
	   The veteran 37-year-old Bayern Munich libero will be on
Germany's roster for the upcoming European championship
qualification games against Turkey and Moldova, the German soccer
federation (DFB) said Friday.
	   New German national team chief Erich Ribbeck called Matthaeus
Thursday afternoon and discussed his comeback. Matthaeus
immediately accepted, the DFB said in a statement.
	   ``My position was always that I will be available for the
national team if I am needed because I owe so much to the DFB,''
Matthaeus said. ``This went for Vogts and it goes for Ribbeck.''
	   ``It would be stupid to do without me if my performances are
good. Ribbeck made it very clear that he needs me as a key
player,'' Matthaeus said.
	   ``I immediately accepted to help the national team and German
soccer,'' said Matthaeus, who this summer became the only outfield
player to play in five World Cup finals.
	   ``He didn't get me so that I can sit on the bench. He has other
players for that,'' Matthaeus said.
	   Matthaeus, who has played a record 129 games for Germany,
retired after Germany's ouster in the quarterfinals of the World
Cup _ with a little persuasion from then coach Berti Vogts.
	   Vogts had been planning to rejuvenate the team and was not
counting anymore on Matthaeus and other veterans.
	   But Vogts resigned Monday and Ribbeck, on his first day on the
job Thursday, said he would call up all of Germany's best players,
regardless of their age.
	   ``As soon as I was asked whether I would become team chief, my
first thought was to reactivate Lothar Matthaeus,'' Ribbeck said.
	   ``It can't be that he plays so well in the Bundesliga week after
week and that he has no role in the national team,'' the new coach
said. ``That he is already 37 is no obstacle whatsoever.''
	   ``I need experienced players for the inferno in Turkey,''
Ribbeck said.
	   Germany, the defending European champion, begins its qualifying
campaign for Euro 2000 on Oct. 10 in Turkey and Oct. 14 in Moldova.
	   Franz Beckenbauer, Bayern Munich president and one of the most
influential men in German soccer, said recalling Matthaeus was
``the best decision'' Ribbeck could have made.
	   ``Only the best can achieve qualification for the European
Championship,'' said Beckenbauer, who coached Germany to its third
and last World Cup title in 1990, when Matthaeus was the team's
captain.
	   Beckenbauer said Matthaeus should become one of the pillars of
the team and must not sit on the bench.
	   ``The best would be for Lothar to become captain, but Oliver
Bierhoff wouldn't want to give the post away,'' Beckenbauer said.
	   Vogts named Bierhoff national team captain the week before his
resignation. Bierhoff replaced Juergen Klinsmann, who retired after
the World Cup.
	   Matthaeus was dropped by Vogts before the 1996 European
Championship in England. But Vogts recalled Matthaeus before this
summer's World Cup when injuries took out several players.
	   Matthaeus, who had not played for Germany since December 1994,
began on the bench but soon advanced to a starter at the World Cup.
	   Ribbeck said he would also talk to three Borussia Dortmund
veterans _ Thomas Haessler, Andreas Moeller and Stefan Reuter. All
quit after the World Cup but have said they could come back under
the new coach.
	   Two players _ libero Olaf Thon of Schalke and midfielder Thomas
Helmer of Bayern Munich _ have ruled out any comebacks.

Clinton crisis leaves some Asians worried about the future
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with China reaction in grafs 13-15 &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Like many other Asians, Japanese housewife Ayako
Sugi doesn't really understand the Clinton scandal. Given the
problems her own country faces, she hasn't had time to follow it.
	   But she does know one thing: she is worried about what could
happen to the world, and its ballooning economic crisis, if the
leader of its only superpower is impeached.
	   ``It's a personal matter. So long as he can do the job right,
that's OK,'' Mrs. Sugi, 47, said at first, when asked about the
accusations that U.S. President Bill Clinton now faces. ``I don't
know if he should resign. Things are going well in the America.''
	   But after glancing over at the friend she was shopping with in
downtown Tokyo on Friday, Mrs. Sugi said:
	   ``I don't want a world recession. And that could happen if he
does get impeached, given how bad things are already.''
	   From Singapore to Australia, the latest developments in the
Clinton crisis produced headlines Friday such as ``U.S. President
Desperate,'' ``Weakened U.S.,'' and ``Presidency in Crisis.''
	   Like news accounts in Europe and the Middle East, there was a
sense of disbelief that Clinton's sexual relations with Monica
Lewinsky, and attempts to cover them up, should have so weakened
what many regard as a politically successful president.
	   ``There is no doubt that a weakened presidency, its energy to
deal with global issues sapped, is bad news for the world,'' said
an editorial in Singapore's Straits Times newspaper.
	   It said the many problems the world faces include increased
terrorist attacks against the United States, North Korea's recent
firing of a ballistic missile over Japan, Iraq's lack of
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors, and Iran's mobilization
of troops along the Afghanistan border.
	   The Straits Times also carried a front-page story about how U.S.
stocks had fallen sharply as fresh fears over Clinton's future
rocked an already jittery world market.
	   In Australia, Clinton's troubles knocked that country's national
election campaign right off the front pages of newspapers, and were
the lead item of television and radio bulletins.
	   ``Two dark vans that drove (Kenneth Starr's report) to the
Capitol were akin to hearses arriving to take away the corpse of
the Clinton presidency,'' said a news analysis in The Sydney
Morning Herald written by its Washington correspondent.
	   In China, where the private lives of the secretive Communist
Party leaders are off limits, few people are willing to mix the
personal and political. Government-controlled reports on the
scandal have been matter-of-fact.
	   Despite the official silence, Chinese leaders and foreign policy
experts are worried about whether the rapprochement Clinton and
President Jiang Zemin symbolized in their recent summit in Beijing
is imperiled.
	   ``China is very concerned. Many people here consider that steady
bilateral relations need a strong president,'' said Jin Canrong, an
American expert at the government-backed Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.
	   In Taiwan, newspapers included front-page stories about the
scandal and photographs of the tons of Starr investigation
documents being transferred to the U.S. Congress on Thursday.
	   In fact, such coverage pushed stories about the heated debate
between President Lee Teng-hui and Taiwan's lawmakers over land
rezoning to the back pages of newspapers.
	   However, in other countries where Asia's year-old economic
crisis has set off political, social and business upheaval the
media all but ignored Washington's turbulence.
	   In Malaysia, papers focused on the government's own sex scandal
involving its sacked deputy prime minister, and frantic
preparations for the opening ceremonies of the 16th Commonwealth
Games in Kuala Lumpur on Friday night.
	   In South Korea media gave more attention to bickering between
rival politicians at home.
	   And in Indonesia, many people questioned in downtown Jakarta
said they were unaware of the Washington scandal, which their
newspapers mostly ignored on Friday.
	   Instead, people said they are preoccupied with soaring food
prices and violence being caused by Indonesia's worst economic
crisis in 30 years.
	   Riots sparked by the crisis forced longtime Indonesian President
Suharto out of office in May, and new protests are now threatening
his successor, President B.J. Habibie.

Despite Lewinsky affair, Clinton praised in China

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Even amid the careful talk at the launching of a
high-minded book on U.S. President Bill Clinton's summertime China
summit, discussion about his damaged presidency couldn't be
contained.
	   Policy experts and publishing executives gathered at the
highbrow Guolinfeng Bookstore on Friday to discuss ``Clinton's Trip
to China: Words and Deeds'' mostly commended Clinton for
stabilizing often rocky relations with China.
	   In keeping with the tenor of the book _ a collection of
Clinton's remarks in China accompanied by scholarly commentaries _
they focused their comments on the brighter China-U.S. relations
that followed the summit and their importance for China's
development.
	   ``Of course, now there's a problem in the United States,''
interjected Jin Canrong, an American expert at the
government-backed Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ``Clinton's
own personal position has weakened a bit, and this could have a
negative effect on China-U.S. relations.''
	   That was as close as the ten panelists wanted to come to
Monica-gate. Like the state-run media's controlled, factual reports
on the fallout from Clinton's White House affair, Chinese are
reluctant to mix the personal and political. After all, the private
lives of China's secretive Communist Party leaders are off-limits.
	   The 361-page Clinton book never mentions the persistent
investigations that have dogged Clinton's presidency, now coming to
a head with a special prosecutor's report to Congress.
	   ``Some people suggested we put in material about his personal
problems. But this has no direct bearing on China-U.S. relations,''
said Wang Lei, who oversees distribution for the China Social
Sciences Publishing House. ``This sort of thing happens all the
time. In this case, it happened to a president.''
	   Interest in Clinton and the impact of his summitry remains high.
Publishers said they printed 30,000 copies of the Clinton book, and
everyone from the conservative government-run Xinhua Bookstore
chain to small roadside peddlers are selling it.
	   Despite the official silence, Chinese leaders and foreign policy
wonks are worried about whether the rapprochement Clinton and
President Jiang Zemin engineered is imperiled.
	   ``China is very concerned. Many people here consider that steady
bilateral relations need a strong president,'' American expert Jin
said after the panel discussion and book-launching was over. ``In
our system, we want to speak to one secretary of state, not 530 of
them. We feel uneasy dealing with Congress.''

Toshiba to cut 6,000 jobs in next two years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Suffering from falling computer chip prices and a
slowdown in computer sales, Japanese electrical machinery maker
Toshiba Corp. said Friday it plans to slash more than 6,000 jobs in
the next two years.
	   Toshiba said it foresees breaking even for the fiscal year
ending in March 1999. A half-year ago, Toshiba had predicted a
profit of 40 billion yen (dlrs 306 million) for the fiscal year.
	   For the first half of the fiscal year, the period from April
through September, Toshiba expects to a loss of 25 billion yen
(dlrs 191 million), the company said in a statement.
	   To become more competitive, Toshiba will reduce its workers at
headquarters to 300 from 700. Overall, the parent company will trim
its work force to below 60,000 by March 2000 from the current
66,000, partly through attrition, it said.
	   Directors' salaries will be cut by up to 20 percent starting
next month.
	   Toshiba President Taizo Nishimuro blamed the Asian economic
crisis, shrinking computer market and falling chip prices as
``seriously wounding'' the company.

Kosovo refugees' suffering continues despite new appeals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with Rugova's quotes, trims &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTINIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The main political leader of Kosovo
Albanians on Friday joined a chorus of calls for a halt to Serb
military actions in Kosovo, where a new exodus of civilians has
alarmed international refugee officials.
	   Ibrahim Rugova described the situation in Kosovo as critical and
worsening, although he stopped short of his usual calls for Western
intervention to stop the Serb advance.
	   ``The humanitarian crisis is very grave, especially involving
the people who have fled to the mountains,'' he said in Kosovo's
capital Pristina.
	   Rugova estimated that 40,000 people are involved in the flight
from besieged villages in the southwest this week; international
officials have put the figure at about 25,000.
	   Despite the appeals, many of the ethnic Albanian refugees who
fled the Serb attacks in western Kosovo are losing hope.
	   Thousands remained camped around the southwestern Kosovo village
of Istinic, where they sought refuge from Serb-led Yugoslav forces
seeking to destroy the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army. Many
are losing hope.
	   ``This is what we sleep on,'' said Zenia Krasniqi, pointing to a
rain-soaked field, her third place of refuge since twice fleeing
Serb attacks. ``I will die here even if I have to hang myself from
this tree.''
	   U.N. officials, including Undersecretary-General Olara Otunnu,
planned to visit the refugees Friday. They hope their presence will
discourage police from arresting men and boys suspected of links to
the KLA.
	   The KLA insists on independence for Kosovo from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians comprise some 90
percent of the province's population.
	   For now, Serb forces appear to have halted their advance, which
drove ethnic Albanians from their homes and farms into a huge
encampment around this village 75 kilometers (45 miles) southwest
of Pristina.
	   Parked tractors stretched for more than two kilometers (one
mile) from the center of the village, hooked to trailers piled high
with hurriedly gathered clothes and belongings.
	   Until this week's attacks, the Istinic area was one of the last
strongholds of the KLA.
	   Rrok Berisha, a member of Kosovo's unauthorized ethnic Albanian
parliament, said most of the refugees fled 40 nearby villages
shelled by police in the past few days.
	   Berisha said he feared 100,000 refugees could stream into the
area as more villages are cleared.
	   Refugees said they feared police soon would begin rounding up
men of fighting age on suspicion they had fought in the KLA. A
village elder in Istinic said about 40 men and women injured by
shelling fled into the hills Wednesday, fearing arrest. Another
refugee said six young men had been beaten by police.
	   In Belgrade, chief Yugoslav prosecutor Vukasin Jokanovic
declared that Serb troops had crushed the rebels and arrested ``a
large number'' of them. Jankovic said many ``terrorists'' would
soon face trial for ``terrorism and conspiracy against the state.''
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council issued yet another appeal
Thursday to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to ``halt all
repressive actions against the civilian population.''
	   John Shattuck, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human
Rights, warned again Thursday that Kosovo is headed for a
humanitarian catastrophe as the harsh Balkan winter approaches.
	   Kosovo fighting already has created an estimated 265,000
refugees. Western officials fear the worst if urgent help isn't
provided for the 50,000 or so living in the hills and forests,
especially with the arrival of winter in about six weeks.

Ferrari drivers lead free practice for Italian GP
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED with quotes &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MONZA, Italy (AP) _ Ferrari teammates Eddie Irvine and Michael
Schumacher led perennial McLaren rivals David Coulthard and Mika
Hakkinen and defending world champion Jacques Villeneuve in
Friday's rain-marred free practice for the Italian Formula One
Grand Prix.
	   Irvine, the No.2 driver of the Italian team, edged Schumacher by
0.25 seconds as he turned his fastest lap on the 5.77-kilometer
(3.585-mile) Monza circuit in one minute, 24.987 seconds or 235.941
kmph (146.283 mph).
	   Coulthard was third fastest in 1:25.690.
	   Villeneuve, in a Williams-Mecachrome, edged Hakkinen for fourth
place in 1:26.053, more than one second slower than Irvine.
	   The result made Ferrari fans happy but meant little for Sunday's
Grand Prix as most teams used the two-hour session to test
settings, engines and tactics in race condition.
	   The decisive qualifying hour, awarding the pole position, is
scheduled at 1100GMT Saturday.
	   Irvine, still without a victory in 78 Grands Prix, set the
fastest lap shortly before battering rain forced teams to use
slower rain tires and settings in the last 30 minutes of practice.
	   The weather office predicted bright sun condition on the race
day Sunday.
	   Hakkinen and Schumacher, the top contenders for the 1998 world
drivers title, enter the Italian GP split by seven points -- 77 to
70.
	   Both did not complete the previous GP in Belgium. Schumacher was
forced to withdraw while leading the race following a collision
with Hakkinen's teammate David Coulthard which touched off a bitter
controversy between the two drivers.
	   Schumacher, who had accused the McLaren driver of reckless
driving, shook hands and officially made peace with Coulthard at
Monza Thursday.
	   However the hot-tempered Ferrari fans still booed and jeered
Coulthard any time he left the pits for practice laps.
	   Sunday's race, the 14th of the 16-round World Championship,
could grant decisive points for the title and is touching off
excitement among auto racing fans.
	   Hakkinen, shooting for his first world title, has a season
record of six GP wins compared with five of two-rime world champion
Schumacher.
	   Coulthard, third in the world standings with 48 points, is the
defending champion in Monza where he won the 1997 GP.

Russia owes Germany dlrs 432 million in interest payments on loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Russia has been slow in paying interest on
debt to the German government this year, with 735 million marks
(dlrs 432 million) still overdue, the government said Friday.
	   But the economics and finance ministries said there were no
plans to alter Germany's conditions on lending to Russia.
	   Germany is confident that Russia will make up the shortfall by
year's end, Finance Ministry spokesman Boris Knapp said.
	   The outstanding interest debt stems from Soviet-era loans,
Economics Ministry spokeswoman Regina Wierig said.
	   Russian payments for more recent loans under the German
government's Hermes credit-guarantee program have been coming on
schedule, she added.

Arab League calls positive U.N. decision on Iraq review
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Security Council's decision to review
Iraqi compliance with disarmament demands is a positive step that
could lead to the end of sanctions, an Arab League official said.
	   The council has endorsed a recommendation by the U.N.
secretary-general for a comprehensive look at Iraq's progress in
complying with U.N. resolutions. The council would conduct the
review once Iraq rescinds its decision to freeze cooperation with
U.N. inspectors, which has paralyzed inspections.
	   The decision Wednesday was a ``positive point,'' said Ahmed bin
Hili, the Arab League deputy secretary-general.
	   The decision could eventually lead to the lifting of U.N.
sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, Hili was
quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East News Agency on Friday.
	   He also said the Arab League wanted Iraq and the United Nations
to resume the inspections ``as soon as possible.''
	   Iraq froze cooperation with U.N. inspectors on Aug. 3, after the
chief inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons.

King, army warn opposition; protesters march again after one killed

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Warning that Cambodia faces disaster
from anarchy in the streets, King Norodom Sihanouk and the head of
the army pressured opposition leaders Friday to accept the victory
of strongman Hun Sen in recent parliamentary elections.
	   The warnings came after a pro-Hun Sen mob _ many appearing to be
police and soldiers in plainclothes _ fired guns, threw rocks and
swung clubs at vastly outnumbered opposition demonstrators calling
for Hun Sen's ouster. One man was killed and several injured.
	   The pressure from the king and army cuts off potential support
for the opposition from two key institutions even as backing
appears to be growing in the streets, fueled by disgust with the
violence Hun Sen has unleashed this week to crush protest.
	   Gen. Ke Kim Yan said in a televised address that the general
staff would not break ranks and said that the country faced ``new,
ever-lasting disaster,'' which he blamed on the opposition. The
army would protect public institutions, he said.
	   Sihanouk told the opposition leaders _ his son, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, and Sam Rainsy _ that they would lose parliamentary
immunity and his protection if they maintain their threat to
boycott the National Assembly.
	   ``I cannot be helpful to you if you experience any danger or
anything eventually happens to you,'' the king said.
	   They contend Hun Sen used massive fraud to win a slight majority
of the assembly seats in elections July 26 and threaten to deny him
the two-thirds support needed to form a new government when it
convenes Sept. 24.
	   Sihanouk, who treads a fine line as a constitutional monarch,
had appealed to the security forces Thursday to stop shooting and
beating peaceful protesters and Buddhist monks.
	   Friday morning, the riot police that have spearheaded Hun Sen's
week-long crackdown were largely absent from the streets.
	   Instead, a crowd of 2,000 supporters of Hun Sen's ruling
Cambodian People's Party, carrying clubs and guns and drunk on rice
wine, marched against a gathering of 300 unarmed opposition
protesters.
	   ``We are looking for the losers. They are trouble-makers,'' said
Chan Lay, 42, reeking of alcohol. He bore a club and a pistol
protruded from his shirt.
	   Mok Ban, 40, held up a club as thick as his arm and said he
supported the right to protest, but not to create tension.
	   ``That's why we have come to suppress them, to stop them from
disrupting people's businesses,'' he said.
	   Warned in advance, the protesters moved away from their
gathering point near the U.S. Embassy and Ranariddh's home. They
were confronted by six security guards from a seedy hotel who
opened fire with pistols. At least three men were wounded in the
legs.
	   The two groups finally met on a side street, which erupted into
a rock-throwing battleground. Gunfire erupted from the Hun Sen
crowd. Opposition supporters fled on motorbikes and foot.
	   Human-rights workers reported that an opposition supporter was
chased down, beaten, shot in the back and killed, bringing the
total of confirmed deaths since Monday to four. A pool of blood and
his hat remained at the site.
	   Afterward, uniformed riot police brought the pro-Hun Sen crowd
water and bread.
	   ``Police have been ordered not to intervene, just to protect
certain places,'' said government spokesman Khieu Kanharith. ``We
have only ordered the ambulances to be ready.''
	   Defiant demonstrators later regrouped, however, and staged a
march from the main market _ where they were initially dispersed by
police firing over their heads _ to the U.S. Embassy. Their numbers
swelled to about 1,200 before they broke up peacefully.
	   The U.N. human-rights office issued a statement calling on the
government ``to disband and disarm'' the pro-Hun Sen mob.
	   ``In the current volatile climate, the activities of these
groups risks provoking further violence,'' the statement said.
	   Hun Sen's crackdown on weeks of protest follows a grenade attack
against his house Monday. He has blamed Sam Rainsy, who calls the
charge a ``ridiculous pretext.'' The violence is the worst since
Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a coup last year.

Tanzania expels Iraqis, Libyan questioned in U.S. embassy bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Tanzania expelled five Iraqis and
a Libyan who were questioned by the FBI and police in connection of
the bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa last month, a
newspaper reported Friday.
	   Immigration officials escorted the Libyan, Atif Issa Enhamed, to
the airport and put him on a flight to an undisclosed Middle East
destination, said Uhuru, or Freedom, a Swahili newspaper owned by
the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party.
	   Five Iraqis, whose names were not disclosed, also were deported,
the newspaper said.
	   It gave no reason for the expulsions and Tanzania's criminal
investigation and immigration departments could not be reached for
comment.
	   Nearly simultaneous bombings at U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, on Aug. 7 killed 258 people,
including 12 Americans, and injured more than 5,500 people. Of
those killed, 11 were killed in Tanzania.
	   Two key suspects in the Kenya bombing have been handed over to
the United States for trial. American authorities allege the
attacks were plotted by Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden.
	   On Sunday, Tanzanian police and FBI agents said they had made
``extraordinary discoveries,'' having determined what the Dar es
Salaam bomb was made of and who carried it to the embassy. They
refused to provide details.
	   Media reports in Tanzania have said the ingredients for the
bombs had originated in the Middle East and were transferred by sea
via the Comoro Islands to Tanzania.
	   Reports in Kenya said the components of the bomb that exploded
in Nairobi were transported by road from Tanzania to Kenya.
	   The East African nations share a long and mostly unguarded
border.
	   On Sept. 2, police in the Comoros archipelago, off the Tanzanian
coast, raided two homes and searched for a suspect in the bombings
identified as Abdallah Mohammed Fadhul, a Comorian Muslim who had
lived with his wife in Sudan until shortly after the bombings.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) - The government intends to present a
five-year strategy to the meeting of the World Bank's Consultative
Group on Mozambique that will center on manpower, improving
infrastructures and simplifying the country's bureaucracy.
	   The two sides are to meet in the Mozambican capital at the end
of September in the first such encounter.
	   The government document defines the development of human
resources as the key objective, and one which is crucial to growth
over the medium and long terms.
	   ``Special attention will be paid to primary education, to
improving school results at this level, to reducing the drop-out
rate of girls, and to improving the training of teachers,'' says
the document.

	   KRUGERSDORP, South Africa (AP) _ Rangers fear 10 warthogs may
have escaped from the Rhino and Lion Nature Reserve near
Krugersdorp after thieves cut the warthog camp fence last weekend
to get to a nearby house.
	   Ranger Kelly Pera said Friday the warthogs were counted on a
daily basis but it would be a few weeks before they could assess
how many were missing because some are in their ground hollows
during the count.
	   In the week since the fence was cut, no one had reported seeing
any warthogs, Pera said. The break-in was discovered a day after it
happened.
	   Reserve owner Ed Hern bought 60 warthogs from the Itala Game
Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal about a month ago, but 25 of the animals
died from the stress of the relocation. Warthogs are particularly
sensitive to being moved, Pera said.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Central Bank of Kenya said Friday it
will ban certificates of deposits in April because it suspects they
are being used for tax evasion, money laundering and corruption
payments.
	   ``Following a consultative meeting with the Kenya Bankers'
Association, it was agreed that CDs shall cease to be financial
instruments on April 30, 1999 at which time any remaining CDs in
circulation should be presented to the issuing banks for
discounting,'' Nzioki Kibua, CBK deputy governor, said in a
statement to commercial banks.
	   Banks are expected to begin winding down their sales of CDs over
the next seven months by progressively converting them to ordinary
deposits, he said.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Geologists have discovered the
first dinosaur fossil in Namibia, the University of Witwatersrand
said.
	   The skeleton of a Massospondylus, a plant-eating dinosaur about
2 meters (yards) long, was discovered preserved in 208
million-year-old sandstone in exposed rock in a park.
	   The team that found the fossil came from Witwatersrand as well
as the universities of Liverpool, England, and Wuerzburg, Germany.
	   The find was announced Thursday.
	   --
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ A 19 percent stake in troubled
Air Afrique will be offered for sale to the public in the company's
11 shareholding countries, Ivory Coast's Transport Minister Adama
Coulibaly said Thursday.
	   Coulibaly, head of a committee of the Air Afrique countries, was
in Burkina Faso on a visit to discuss the airline's operations with
President Blaise Campaore.
	   He did not say when the shares would be sold or how much they
would be worth.
	   Air Afrique was forced in July to give up four planes to
creditors to cover dlrs 50 million in unpaid debts.
	   The shareholding countries _ Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali,
Republic of Congo, Mauritania, Chad, Niger, Benin, Togo, Burkina
Faso, Mali and Central African Public _ own 70 percent of the
company.
	   --
	   NIAMEY, Niger (AP) _ Nigeria's military ruler Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar was in neighboring Niger on Friday for a whirlwind 48-hour
visit in which Niger's President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara was to
appeal for disaster relief, officials said.
	   In a brief statement released here, Niger's government said the
visit was to improve relations between the two West African
countries.
	   Niger suffered a devastating flood last week that destroyed at
least one village and caused untold damages in other towns and
cities.
	   --
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ President Bill Clinton has conveyed a
desire to meet Nigeria's military ruler Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar
during a visit later this month to the U.N. General Assembly in New
York, officials said Friday.
	   A statement issued by Abubakar's office late Thursday said U.S.
Ambassador William Twaddel conveyed Clinton's message in a meeting
with the Nigerian leader at the head of state's villa in the
capital of Abuja.
	   Twaddel assured Abubakar that ``the U.S. government's response
to positive steps taken by Gen. Abubakar's administration would be
given practical expression soon in many areas of cooperation,'' the
statement said.
	   Abubakar's promises of a democratic transition to civilian rule
by next May have begun to dissolve diplomatic barriers that
prevailed between Nigeria and the international community during
the discredited rule of his predecessor, the late dictator Gen.
Sani Abacha.
	   --
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Ghana's economy continued to grow moderately
last year, despite a sharp fall in the price of gold, one of
Ghana's biggest exports, according to government figures released
here.
	   The West African country's gross domestic product grew by 3
percent in 1997, mainly as a result of increased cocoa prices and
growth in the service sector, the government report released
Thursday said.
	   Finance Minister Kwame Peprah predicted the economy would
continue to expand as a result of strong cocoa production in Ghana,
which is the world's second largest producer behind neighboring
Ivory Coast.
	   Sources in the government said Ghana expects inflation, however,
to be around 12 or 13 percent by the end of 1998. Inflation topped
20 percent last year.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Stocks plunged worldwide Friday _ with Tokyo blue
chips suffering their worst fall of the year as traders fretted
over weakness on Wall Street and U.S. President Bill Clinton's
precarious position.
	   The red ink spread from Asia to Europe as investors nervously
awaited the next opening on the New York Stock Exchange, where the
Dow Jones industrial average had dropped 249 points on Thursday.
	   The recent decline by the U.S. dollar also sent shudders through
foreign markets, where analysts worried their corporations could be
hurt by more competitively priced exports from America.
	   ``Unfortunately, what's good or bad for the U.S. is good or bad
for Asia'' and the rest of the world, said Eugene Chung, Asia
strategist at Warburg Dillon Read (HK) Ltd., in Hong Kong.
	   On the London Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest market, the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off by 1.8
percent at 5,044.0 by midday. The so-called ``footsie'' had traded
somewhat lower in the morning.
	   Traders were anxiously awaiting new direction from New York
dealings, while watching the political situation in Washington,
where members of Congress were expected to release details of a
special prosecutor's report on an investigation into Clinton.
	   News reports have indicated the report from Kenneth Starr
contains evidence of alleged crimes by Clinton including perjury
and witness tampering _ which raised the threat of impeachment.
	   Many investors were staying out of the market, figuring much of
the information might come out after London had finished trading
for the day.
	   ``I don't know if people will be brave enough to do anything
today,'' said Peter Caulkett, a stock salesman at the brokerage
Teather and Greenwood. ``No one knows what will be in Starr's
report.''
	   Key market indexes were off by 1.4 percent in Frankfurt and
Paris, with blue chips in Milan off by 4 percent.
	   The damage was heavier on big Asian markets.
	   Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average plummeted 749.05 points,
or 5.12 percent, to close at 13,916.98. It was the largest one-day
point fall this year. The finish was just barely above the Nikkei's
12-year closing low of 13,915.63 set on Aug. 28.
	   Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 271.48 points, or 3.5
percent, to close at 7,578.48 Friday.
	   In Singapore, where the market has been battered by capital
controls recently imposed by neighboring Malaysia, shares opened
lower and by the end of the day the Straits Times Index was down
11.81 points, or 1.3 percent, at 853.19 points.
	   Traders largely ignored positive political developments in
Russia, where a recent economic collapse has jolted markets
worldwide.

Protests, calls for revenge after Israel kills Hamas fugitives
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with heavy clashes near home of victims, defense
minister saying the victims were responsible for deaths of five
Israelis &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   EL BIREH, West Bank (AP) _ Shouting ``we want revenge now,''
hundreds of Hamas supporters marched in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip on Friday after Israel killed the group's two top fugitives.
In two towns, protesters clashes with Israeli troops.
	   Hamas, an Islamic militant group, vowed to detonate more suicide
bombings in Israel to avenge the deaths of brothers Imad and Adel
Awadallah. Bracing for attacks, Israel sealed off the West Bank and
Gaza Strip and security forces were placed on high alert.
	   The new tension came as U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross shuttled
between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in hopes of concluding
a deal on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   A new outbreak of violence would make it exceedingly difficult
for Ross to negotiate a breakthrough and end a 17-month stalemate.
	   On the third day of his mission, Ross met Friday with
Palestinian security chiefs to discuss the possible release of
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Later in the day, Ross was
to hold talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The killings triggered protest marches and clashes.
	   In the town of El Bireh, some 300 people marched from the home
of the Awadallah family to the nearby Jewish settlement of Psagot,
shouting ``revenge, revenge.''
	   Some 200 marchers threw stones and empty bottles at Israeli
troops who sprayed the crowd with rubber-coated steel pellets. Five
people were injured, including a WTN cameraman.
	   In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, several dozen teen-agers
armed with slingshots threw stones at Israeli soldiers guarding
Rachel's Tomb, an Israeli enclave in the Palestinian city. Troops
did not respond.
	   In Nablus, also in the West Bank, about 1,000 Hamas supporters
clamoring for revenge chanted ``we want bombings.''
	   In Gaza, City, Hamas supporters led by the group's founder,
Ahmed Yassin, shouted ``we want revenge now,'' shaking their fists
in the air.
	   A leaflet distributed during the march said that Hamas will take
revenge and ``create an earthquake under the Zionists' feet.'' The
retaliation will be similar in scope to the response to the 1996
killing of Hamas' chief bombmaker, Yehiyeh Ayyash, it said.
	   At the time, Hamas detonated four suicide bombings that killed
dozens of Israelis, disrupted peace talks and brought Israel's
hardline leader, Netanyahu, to power.
	   The Awadallah brothers were killed Thursday afternoon in a
remote house surrounded by vineyards and orchards near the village
of Taibeh, west of the West Bank town of Hebron. The safehouse is
in an area under full Israeli security control.
	   Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, suggested that the
Awadallah brothers were killed in a carefully planned ambush.
	   ``This is another example of terrorists known for killing
Israelis being pursued wherever they are,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Palestinian peace negotiator Hassan Asfour condemned the
killings as ``a terrorist act.''
	   Israel has killed Islamic militants in the past, including
Islamic Jihad leader Fathi Shekaki, who was shot to death outside a
Malta hotel in 1995 by gunmen on a motorcycle.
	   In Thursday's incident, Palestinian witnesses said they saw a
truck and four vans pull up to the Taibeh safehouse at about 4 p.m.
Dozens of men jumped out and surrounded the house, the witnesses
said. Minutes later, shots were heard. There were conflicting
reports about whether the men wore army uniforms or not.
	   The army would only say that troops raided the home after shots
and an explosion were heard and that the two fugitives were killed
in a gun battle with soldiers.
	   Adel Awadallah, commander of the Hamas military wing Izzedine al
Qassam in the West Bank, headed Israel's most wanted list.
	   Imad Awadallah, also a leading figure in Izzedine al Qassam,
escaped from a Palestinian jail last month. He had been held on
suspicion that he killed a fellow Hamas fugitive, Mohiyedine
Sharif, in a fight over power and money.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said the two were
killed as they prepared another bombing. He said they were
responsible for the deaths of five Israelis.

	   Facts about the Friday-Saturday election in Bosnia-Herzegovina:
	   ___
	   THE COUNTRY:
	   Bosnia-Herzegovina, one of the six republics in the former
Yugoslavia, is made up of two parts under the Dayton peace
agreement. The Muslim-Croat Federation controls 51 percent of
territory; a Serb republic, the Republika Srpska, covers the other
49 percent, home mostly to Bosnian Serbs.
	   ___
	   VOTERS:
	   2.75 million registered in a population of 4.3 million.
	   ___
	   ISSUES: How much to adhere to the Dayton treaty. Maintaining
stability, establishing democracy, returning refugees to their
pre-war homes. More than 30,000 NATO-led troops impose security in
Bosnia.
	   ___
	   THE GOVERNMENT: The Dayton agreement set up a national
government, with limited powers, for all of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Under it are separate governments for the Muslim-Croat federation
and the Serb republic.
	   The national government has a three-member presidency consisting
of a Muslim, Serb and Croat. The leadership changes every eight
months.
	   There is a two-chamber legislature: an appointed 15-member upper
house divided equally among Muslims, Croats and Serbs and a lower
house with 28 members from the federation and 14 from the Serb
republic.
	   The Muslim-Croat and Serb governments also have their own
presidents and legislatures.
	   ___
	   WHAT'S AT STAKE:
	   In the Muslim-Croat Federation:
	   _ Two members, one Muslim and one Croat, of the three-member
national presidency; four-year terms.

individual candidates are taking part.
	   ___
	   POLLS:
	   Polls open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. local time (0500-1700 GMT)
Saturday, and from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. (0500-1400 GMT) Sunday.
	   ___
	   RESULTS:
	   First results not expected before Tuesday; final results may
take two weeks or more.

Swedish striker set to join Premier League Gunners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger is set to hire Swedish
striker Fredrik Ljungberg in a 3 million pound (dlrs 4.95 million)
transfer from Halmstad.
	   Ljungberg, part of the Sweden team which beat England 2-1 in the
Euro 2000 qualifier at Stockholm last Saturday, was expected to
undergo a medical at Highbury on Friday before the deal was
complete.
	   Arsenal, defending FA Cup and Premier League-double champions,
has recruited the 21-year-old striker to replace England
international Ian Wright.
	   Wright, who had seven seasons at Arsenal, was sold to West Ham
in the off-season as the Gunners attempted to lure Dutch striker
Patrick Kluivert from AC Milan.
	   Another Dutch star, Dennis Bergkamp, and French international
Nicolas Anelka have assumed the attacking responsibilities in
Wright's absence but Arsenal has tied three of its first four games
and Wenger has been looking for extra strike force.
	   Vinvenzo Morabito, Ljungberg's agent, said the deal was a ``100
percent certainty.''
	   Ljungberg, rated by Swedish coach Tommy Soderberg as ``the
fastest runner with the ball in Europe'', has scored one goal in
five internationals for Sweden.
	   An Arsenal spokeswoman confirmed negotiations were in progress
but would not comment on the deal.
	   Ljungberg will not be eligible for Arsenal for the first six
matches of its European Champions campaign after missing last
month's UEFA transfer deadline for the tournament.

Austrian government plans to return art seized by Nazis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Austria expected to start returning
other confiscated works, culture minister comment. INCORPORATES
US-Austria Art &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austria expects to return by year's end
hundreds of art works confiscated by the Nazis and on display in
some of the country's leading museums.
	   The Cabinet agreed Thursday to send a restitution law to
parliament that would return the works to their rightful owners.
Officials said they expect the measure to be passed next month.
	   ``We want to have a clean slate by the end of the century,''
Culture Minister Elisabeth Gehrer told the daily Der Standard.
	   The works, mainly confiscated from Jewish families, include
paintings, coin collections and antique furniture. They have been
on display at sites such as the Art History Museum and the
Belvedere, a former home of the Habsburg family, Austria's longtime
rulers.
	   The ownership of 400 to 500 works already has been verified,
with many belonging to such prominent families as the Rothschilds.
A commission will be set up to review further ownership claims.
	   In a related development in New York, the Museum of Modern Art
asked a state appeals court Wednesday to let it return two Egon
Schiele paintings borrowed from an Austrian foundation. Claimants
say ``Dead City III'' and ``Portrait of Wally'' were stolen by the
Nazis and should not returned to their families.
	   A lower court ruled earlier this year that state law prohibits
the seizure of art loaned to New York institutions.
	   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau obtained a
subpoena requiring the two paintings to remain in the United States
while his office investigates claims that Nazis stole them from
Jewish owners during the Holocaust.
	   When the exhibit ended, Morgenthau intervened on behalf of two
families who claim the works were plundered during the Nazi era
from relatives. He obtained a subpoena blocking the paintings'
return to Vienna while the question of ownership was investigated.
	   The museum wants the appeals court to uphold a lower court's May
13 decision that ruled state law prohibits the seizure of art
loaned to New York institutions.
	   In papers filed Wednesday, the museum said the subpoena has had
a ``chilling effect'' on foreign art loans to New York.
	   Barbara Thompson, spokeswoman for the district attorney's
office, said prosecutors would file a response next week.
	   The Leopold Foundation, which owns the works, has maintained
that the paintings were acquired in good faith from legitimate
postwar owners.

NATO presence in Bosnia depends on election, Solana says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A decision on whether to
retain the more than 30,000 NATO-led foreign troops in Bosnia
depends on this weekend's election results, top NATO officials said
Friday.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark,
NATO commander for Europe, met with the members of Bosnia's current
three-man presidency, perhaps ``for the last time,'' Solana told
journalists.
	   Western powers running Bosnia hope voters change at least some
of the presidency members, particularly Bosnian Serb hard-liner
Momcilo Krajisnik, who they accuse of obstructing implementation of
the 1995 Dayton peace plan that ended Bosnia's 3 1/2-year war.
	   Solana noted the current presidency ``started Dayton'' and
called Friday's meeting with the three men ``an emotional moment.''
	   Asked whether the number of NATO troops deployed in Bosnia would
decrease any time soon, Solana said election results would
influence that decision.
	   U.S. officials said they'll decide in December whether to pull
out any of the more than 6,000 American troops in the force.
	   The top U.S. official in the office overseeing Bosnia said the
NATO-led force could eventually change from a heavy-duty operation
with tanks into a more mobile monitoring force.
	   Jacques Paul Klein, chief deputy to High Representative Carlos
Westendorp, said under that scenario, air power from outside the
country could be used for major military missions.
	   No Western officials want to offer a timetable for when troops
might leave, and most people expect foreign troops to be in Bosnia
for years.
	   Many decisions affecting Bosnia remain in the hands of foreign
officials.
	   The three-man presidency set up under the Dayton accords has one
member from each of the main ethnic groups _ Muslims, Serbs and
Croats. Only Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic is considered
virtually certain to retain his seat.
	   The inability of the three former foes to agree on most issues
caused Western powers to give their officials overseeing Bosnia
virtual absolute power to force decisions on the presidency.
	   Solana expressed hope the election results would give Bosnia
``new momentum'' in solving crucial problems such as allowing
refugees to return home.

Havel lobbying for new RFE broadcast

 &UR; Eds: UPGRADES attribution to DELETE reference to paper, ADDS more

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel is trying
to persuade his Cabinet to drop objections to planned Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty broadcasts to Iran and Iraq, a spokesman said
Friday.
	   The U.S. government-funded radio station, which operates out of
Prague, intends to start its broadcasts by the end of September.
But the Cabinet of Milos Zeman expressed its doubts last month
about the program's objectivity and potential terrorist risks for
the Czech Republic.
	   It remains unclear whether the government would move to actively
block the broadcasts.
	   Havel stepped in after receiving a letter Tuesday from U.S. Rep.
Benjamin A. Gilman, the New York Republican who chairs the House
International Relations Committee, urging the president to help.
	   ``My colleagues and I thus very much hope you will work with
Prime Minister Zeman ... to ensure that RFE/RL will be able to
begin its broadcasts to Iran and Iraq this fall,'' said the letter,
published Friday by the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes.
	   Havel spokesman Ladislav Spacek said the president spoke to
Zeman and Foreign Minister Jan Kavan on the issue. Havel was unable
to immediately change the Cabinet's position, but the aide
indicated the government seemed unlikely to block the broadcasts.
	   Spacek said Havel will meet with Gilman within a debate forum
planned during his five-day official trip to the United States
starting next Tuesday.
	   ``The president made it clear he is in favor of the broadcast
and now it's up to the (Czech) government to take the next step,''
Spacek said.
	   The agreement to start the controversial broadcasts was made
between U.S. authorities and the previous government of Josef
Tosovsky.
	   Zeman expects an official request from the U.S. government
asking for permission to go ahead. He also plans to monitor the
broadcasts for objectivity until the end of the year.

 &UR; German papers assail soccer boss; Beckenbauer proposed for job &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German soccer federation (DFB)
president Egidius Braun came under fire Friday for his erratic
search for a new national team coach.
	   ``Madhouse DFB,'' said a banner front-page headline in the
mass-circulation newspaper Bild. ``Enough, Herr Braun.''
	   Other newspapers also criticized the 73-year-old DFB president.
	   ``The way Braun went looking for a new coach was very
confusing,'' said the conservative, influential Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung.
	   Any ``village club'' would be ashamed of the ``chaos'' that
ruled at the DFB, the newspaper said.
	   Braun spent a hectic 48 hours looking for a new coach after the
resignation of Berti Vogts on Monday.
	   During the two days, Braun had considered several candidates and
talked to some of them, before naming Erich Ribbeck late Wednesday.
	   Former Real Madrid coach Jupp Heynckes turned down the job
because of his wife's poor health; Franz Beckenbauer, the former
superstar who coached Germany to the 1990 World Cup title, said he
wasn't interested; three Bundesliga coaches were bound by contracts
to their clubs.
	   Braun even talked to Roy Hodgson, former Blackburn Rovers, Inter
Milan and Swiss national team coach, only to withdraw the offer a
couple of hours later.
	   The DFB chief then came up with the idea of calling Paul
Breitner, a star of Germany's 1974 World Cup-winning team with the
reputation of a leftist rebel.
	   Breitner, who works as a television commentator, immediately
accepted the offer and began preparing for the job.
	   But the next day, on Wednesday morning, Braun read a newspaper
interview _ given before the job offer had been made _ in which
Breitner called for the resignation of the entire DFB leadership,
including Braun. Breitner was finished as possible national coach.
	   ``I intended to introduce a revolution with Breitner, but he
wanted immediately to kill me,'' Braun commented.
	   Braun then considered Uli Stielike, a DFB coach working with the
junior team. Stielike, who once coached the Swiss national team,
accepted.
	   And while Stielike was already giving interviews and explaining
his visions for rebuilding the national team, Braun decided to
install Ribbeck, with Stielike as his assistant.
	   On Thursday, at a news conference at DFB headquarters in
Frankfurt called to introduce Ribbeck, Braun spent the first 35
minutes rambling on about his search for a new coach, while a
stone-faced Ribbeck sat next to him.
	   Bild said Braun's presentation was ``embarrassing'' and damaging
to Ribbeck's credibility.
	   Breitner, in an interview with Bild published Friday, renewed
his call for the removal of Braun and other DFB leaders and said
Beckenbauer should become the new DFB boss.
	   ``The federation urgently needs new structures, new people and
new ideas,'' Breitner said. ``We should do everything to persuade
Franz to take over a leadership position.''
	   Beckenbauer, now chairman of Bayern Munich and already one of
the most influential men in German soccer, often has been mentioned
as a possible future DFB president.
	   Bild's attack could be the beginning of a campaign to remove
Braun and install Beckenbauer. Braun will stand for re-election
next month.
	   Braun's leadership was first questioned during the World Cup,
when he at one point considered whether Germany should pull out of
the tournament because of an attack by German hooligans on a French
policeman.
	   His choice of Ribbeck also has met with some skepticism.
Ribbeck, 61, had not coached since April 1996.
	   ``He (Ribbeck) is so far removed from soccer as the earth from
the moon,'' said Werner Lorant, coach of the Bundesliga club 1860
Munich.
	   Some soccer writers have expressed doubt that Ribbeck is the
right man to rebuild the German team, shaken by its World Cup
quarterfinal ouster.
	   Ribbeck's first move as coach was to recall 37-year-old veteran
Lothar Matthaeus and he plans to bring back some other players who
quit under Vogts.

Lee surges ahead in Japan LPGA Championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIHO, Japan (AP) _ South Korean Lee O-soon shot a 2-under-par 70
Friday to grab a two-stroke lead after two rounds in the 70 million
yen (dlrs 518,000) Japan LPGA Championship.
	   Lee, who has yet to win in three years on the Japan LPGA Tour,
overcame tough pin-placements and scored four birdies against a
pair of bogeys en route to a 1-under 143 total at the hilly
6,550-yard (5,961-meter) Miho Golf Club course. She was three shots
off the pace overnight.
	   ``This is the first time that I've ever been in the lead in a
tournament in Japan,'' said the 36-year-old Lee. ``I've been
putting better and playing some good golf this season compared to
last year.''
	   Michiko Hattori, winner of the Nasu Ogawa ladies in April,
turned in a 73 for 145.
	   Another stroke back at 146 were Fuki Kido and Yuri Kawanami.
Kido, who shot a 70, was the only player other than Lee to break
par in the round.
	   Defending champion Akiko Fukushima carded a 73 for a share of
eighth at 149 with four others.
	   The winner Sunday will receive a top prize of 12.6 million yen
(dlrs 93,000) and a five-year exempt status. The tournament is one
of three major events of the tour.

South Africa's 1999 election challenge includes orderly

registration

	   FOUR WAYS, South Africa (AP) _ In 1994, many South Africans
stood in line for days to cast their first ballot ever in a
democratic election.
	   The surge was so great that officials extended the voting time
from one to four days and allowed people to vote on the basis of
any identity document.
	   Now the Independent Electoral Commission is gearing up for the
second free elections in the country's history. But is caught in a
dispute over registration as it tackles another milestone for the
new democracy _ that of creating a national voters' roll.
	   ``Nineteen-ninety-four was called a miracle,'' said Mandla
Mchunu, the country's chief electoral officer, speaking on Friday
at an election strategy session with managers of the newly created
Independent Electoral Commission. ``Now we must repeat the
miracle.''
	   The controversy involves the issuance of bar-coded identity
documents for computer scanners. The electoral commission
originally suggested that the Department of Home Affairs issue them
to all South Africans as a prerequisite for the country's estimated
24 million voters to register.
	   But a report by the Human Sciences Research Council commissioned
by the elections board showed that up to 20 percent of the voters
could be excluded from voting because of the enormous backlog in
issuing the IDs.
	   The commission has changed its mind about the bar codes and
wants Parliament to allow all identity documents to be used in
voter registration.
	   But the bar code idea has taken on a momentum of its own, and
has passed two of three hurdles on its way to becoming part of a
new electoral law with approval by Parliament's upper house.
	   The lower house is expected to vote on the proposal later this
month.
	   Any legal challenge to the bill could tie up election
preparations for months, commission officials say.
	   President Nelson Mandela has yet to announce an election date,
but it will not occur before April 1999.
	   Registering to vote is cumbersome because it requires three
steps: applying for an ID document at Home Affairs; taking a
temporary receipt to a registration site to register; then
returning to Home Affairs for the permanent ID document in time for
election day.
	   Many Africans have no identity documents, and older Africans
often do not know the date and year of their birth.

 &UR; Protests, calls for revenge after Israel kills Hamas fugitives
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with protest marches, clashes in West Bank,
Gaza, defense minister saying the victims were responsible for
deaths of five Israelis. CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   EL BIREH, West Bank (AP) _ Shouting ``we want revenge now,''
hundreds of Hamas supporters marched Friday in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip after Israel killed the group's two top fugitives. In
two towns, protesters clashed with Israeli troops.
	   Hamas, an Islamic militant group, vowed to detonate more suicide
bombings in Israel to avenge the deaths of brothers Imad and Adel
Awadallah. Bracing for attacks, Israel sealed off the West Bank and
Gaza Strip and security forces were placed on high alert.
	   The new tension came as U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross shuttled
between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in hopes of concluding
a deal on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   A new outbreak of violence would make it exceedingly difficult
for Ross to negotiate a breakthrough to a 17-month stalemate.
	   On Friday, the third day of his mission, Ross met with
Palestinian security chiefs to discuss the possible release of
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Later in the day, Ross was
to hold talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The killings triggered protest marches and clashes.
	   In the town of El Bireh, 300 people marched from the home of the
Awadallah family to the nearby Jewish settlement of Psagot,
shouting ``revenge, revenge.''
	   Some 200 marchers threw stones and empty bottles at Israeli
troops who sprayed the crowd with rubber-coated steel pellets. Five
people were injured, including a cameraman for the U.S. television
network WTN.
	   In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, several dozen teen-agers
armed with slingshots threw stones at Israeli soldiers guarding
Rachel's Tomb, an Israeli enclave in the Palestinian city. Troops
did not respond.
	   In Nablus, also in the West Bank, about 1,000 Hamas supporters
clamoring for revenge chanted ``we want bombings.''
	   In Gaza, City, Hamas supporters led by the group's founder,
Ahmed Yassin, shouted ``we want revenge now,'' shaking their fists
in the air.
	   A leaflet distributed during the march said that Hamas will take
revenge and ``create an earthquake under the Zionists' feet.'' The
retaliation will be similar in scope to the response to the 1996
killing of Hamas' chief bombmaker, Yehiyeh Ayyash, it said.
	   At that time, four Hamas suicide bombings killed dozens of
Israelis, disrupted peace talks and brought to power Israel's
hard-line leader, Netanyahu.
	   The Awadallah brothers were killed Thursday afternoon in a
remote house surrounded by vineyards and orchards near the village
of Taibeh, west of the West Bank town of Hebron. The safehouse is
in an area under full Israeli security control.
	   Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, suggested that the
Awadallah brothers were killed in a carefully planned ambush.
	   ``This is another example of terrorists known for killing
Israelis being pursued wherever they are,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Palestinian peace negotiator Hassan Asfour condemned the
killings as ``a terrorist act.''
	   Israel has killed Islamic militants in the past, including
Islamic Jihad leader Fathi Shekaki, who was shot to death outside a
Malta hotel in 1995 by gunmen on a motorcycle.
	   In Thursday's incident, Palestinian witnesses said they saw a
truck and four vans pull up to the Taibeh safehouse in the
afternoon. Dozens of men jumped out and surrounded the house, the
witnesses said. Minutes later, shots were heard. There were
conflicting reports about whether the men wore army uniforms or
not.
	   The army would only say that troops raided the home after shots
and an explosion were heard and that the two fugitives were killed
in a gun battle with soldiers.
	   Adel Awadallah, commander of the Hamas military wing Izzedine al
Qassam in the West Bank, headed Israel's most wanted list.
	   Imad Awadallah, also a leading figure in Izzedine al Qassam,
last month escaped from a Palestinian jail. He had been held on
suspicion that he killed a fellow Hamas fugitive, Mohiyedine
Sharif, in a fight over power and money.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said the two were
killed as they prepared another bombing. He said they were
responsible for the deaths of five Israelis.

 &UR; Volkswagen announces fund for ex-slave laborers &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fund announcement &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Facing lawsuits in the United States and threats
of others elsewhere, Volkswagen approved a 20 million mark (dlrs 12
million) fund Friday to compensate former slave laborers forced to
work for the company by the Nazis during World War II.
	   The automaker said it was ``morally called upon'' to ``provide
humanitarian relief'' to former forced laborers, while adding it
believed it was under no legal obligation to do so.
	   The first payments from the fund, to be administered by the
accounting firm KPMG, will be made ``before the end of the year,''
VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said in a statement.
	   But a lawyer involved in one lawsuit against the automaker said
shortly before the announcement that an offer of ``humanitarian
aid'' to survivors would not be enough to fend off legal action.
	   New York lawyer Ed Fagan said VW should provide a list of slave
laborers who worked in the plants and acknowledge a legal debt to
them.
	   ``What they keep doing is trying to confuse charity with a legal
obligation,'' said Fagan, who was traveling in Jerusalem. ``These
companies have a legal obligation to pay the slaves they abused and
killed. ...
	   ``Without producing those lists there is no settlement and there
is no agreement, and we will continue to attack them and make them
pay in an American court,'' he said.
	   Like many other German firms, Volkswagen maintains it has no
legal obligation to compensate former slave laborers, arguing they
were forced on it by the Nazis.
	   But VW broke ranks with the bulk of German industry in July by
announcing it would set up a fund to give ``humanitarian aid'' to
survivors.
	   The automaker's supervisory board approved the details Friday.
	   A statement issued after the meeting said Volkswagen ``is
engaged in discussions with prominent persons'' to set up a council
to determine the amount of individual payments. It said fund
administrators would announce shortly where former forced laborers
can apply.
	   Lawsuits and threatened lawsuits have raised the pressure on
German firms to address the claims of concentration camp inmates,
mostly Jews, forced to work in their factories.
	   Some companies recently suggested they'd be willing to
contribute to a publicly administered fund, but Chancellor Helmut
Kohl has rejected any government involvement.
	   German attorney Klaus von Muenchhausen threatened early this
year to file a lawsuit on behalf of 30 Hungarian Jews forced to
work for Volkswagen, but held off on those plans after VW announced
it would set up a fund.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German soccer federation (DFB)
president Egidius Braun came under fire Friday for his erratic
search for a new national team coach.
	   ``Madhouse DFB,'' said a banner front-page headline in the
mass-circulation newspaper Bild. ``Enough, Herr Braun.''
	   Other newspapers also criticized the 73-year-old DFB president.
	   ``The way Braun went looking for a new coach was very
confusing,'' said the conservative, influential Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung.
	   Any ``village club'' would be ashamed of the ``chaos'' that
ruled at the DFB, the newspaper said.
	   In a call-in survey conducted by the Cologne-based WDR radio
station, 87 percent of more than 5,200 callers said Braun should
resign.

Hard-pressed Pakistan opens debate on accepting nuclear test ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With India-Nuclear &QL; 
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's parliament opened debate
Friday on joining a nuclear test ban treaty, after months of
international sanctions against its atomic tests strained the
economy to the breaking point.
	   Pakistan, a nation of 130 million people, tested six nuclear
devices in May in response to similar tests by its hostile neighbor
India. Since the two South Asian nations have fought three wars
since 1947, their actions set off widespread alarm that they could
actually use atomic weapons.
	   Key donors, including the United States, Japan, the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund, cut off funding to Pakistan to
protest the tests. That left Pakistan desperately short of foreign
exchange, and in danger of defaulting on its September payments on
dlrs 32 billion in external debt.
	   Publicly, Pakistan insists that it cannot be coerced into
signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, although the Pakistani
news media says the government has already decided in principle to
sign the treaty.
	   ``We will make this decision in accordance with the wishes of
parliament and the wishes of the Pakistani people,'' said Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif as he entered Parliament for the start of the
debate. ``We will not make this decision under any (outside)
pressure.''
	   Proponents of nuclear testing filled the streets after May's
test blasts, celebrating the impoverished but proud Pakistan for
closing an arms gap with India, and for joining the world's nuclear
powers.
	   Although mainstream political parties appear set to endorse the
treaty, the government is wary of opposition from small right-wing
religious parties.
	   The government has said it wants a broad national consensus on
the treaty, starting with the debate in a joint session of
Parliament's upper and lower houses. The government has also
assured the public that a promise not to test weapons does not stop
nuclear weapons development.
	   Parliament's joint treaty debate, expected to last into next
week, begins as a team from the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank arrived in the capital of Islamabad to discuss an
economic bailout package for Pakistan.
	   The donors stalled the last payment of a dlrs 1.6 billion loan
and credits package after the nuclear tests. Pakistan this week
resorted to signing a dlrs 1.5 billion bailout deal with the
Islamic Development Bank, at a crippling interest rate of more than
10 percent.
	   Since that is not enough, Pakistan hopes for a dlrs 2.5 billion
IMF and World Bank package, in exchange for spending cuts, tax
hikes and privatization of state industries.
	   The most important condition, however, appears to be the joining
the test ban treaty, or CTBT.
	   ``Apparently, Islamabad is going to sign the CTBT for a mere
financial bailout package,'' complained Islamabad's The Nation
newspaper Friday. ``No one knows, clearly, however, what benefits
Pakistan will accrue out of this deal under tremendous pressure
from the United States except burdening the economy with more
loans.''

	   Release of the 445-page Starr report on President Bill Clinton
is expected sometime Friday, but the time is still uncertain. We
will advise you of anything more definitive.
	   Because of the volume, perhaps as much as 150,000 words, and the
danger of overloading computer systems, we will be unable to
transmit the complete text on AP World Service wires.
	   However, we will provide a full text of the report at an
Internet ftp site.
	   To keep the site from being overloaded, we won't put the address
and password on the wire. Instead, subscribers should contact their
local AP bureau for the site address, username and password. If you
can't get through to the local AP bureau, call the International
Desk editorial assistant in New York at 212-621-1644, who will
provide the Internet ftp access information.
	   On World Service circuits, we plan to transmit all or most of
report's introduction (estimated at up to 7,500 words) and then
excerpts of the entire report.

U.S. to work with Ukraine on selling its gas emission quota
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The United States hopes to buy Ukraine's
quota of greenhouse gas emissions, a senior American envoy said
Friday.
	   International rules on greenhouse gas emissions, last agreed at
the Kyoto Climate Change Conference in December 1997, set limits
for each country, but permit industrialized nations to trade their
quotas.
	   According to the Kyoto accord, by 2012 the European Union must
cut its emissions by 8 percent, the United States by 7 percent and
Japan by 6 percent from 1990 levels.
	   ``Ukraine stands to gain billions of dollars every year from
selling emissions permits,'' Undersecretary of State for Economic
Affairs Stuart Eizenstat told a news conference in Ukraine's
capital Kiev.
	   Eizenstat arrived in Ukraine on Thursday for a two-day visit to
discuss a wide range of issues with senior government officials,
including Environment Minister Vasyl Shevchuk.
	   Quota trading allows countries that fall short of meeting their
reduction target to purchase quota credits from other countries
that surpass their target. The U.S. government is under pressure
from American industries to trade quotas with countries like
Ukraine that produce less of the gases blamed for the so-called
greenhouse effect.
	   Scientists say the emissions of carbon dioxide and other
so-called greenhouse gases, which allow sunlight to reach Earth but
trap the resulting heat, may boost global average temperatures by
up to 6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, raising ocean levels through
heat expansion and abruptly shifting climate zones.

Europe's health getting worse, WHO says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAN M. OLSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ For the first time since World War
II, the average life expectancy in Europe has declined, mainly due
to serious health problems in the former Soviet bloc, WHO officials
said Friday.
	   Tuberculosis, malaria and diphtheria have returned, heavy
drinking and smoking are causing untold harm, cardiovascular
diseases and cancer are on the rise and sexually transmitted
diseases have reached epidemic proportions, the World Health
Organization said about its biggest region including 51 states and
870 million people.
	   ``It's not a pretty picture,'' WHO Regional Director Jo E.
Asvall said. ``Health is a basic human right and should be put
higher on the political agenda.''
	   The decline in the average life expectancy _ from 73.1 years in
1991 to 72.4 years in 1994 _ is mainly due to the mortality crisis
in the former Soviet republics and eastern Europe, Asval said at
the WHO's European office in Copenhagen.
	   ``These countries have the biggest problems right now,'' said
Arun Nanda of the WHO's Epidemiology, Statistics and Health
Information department.
	   The U.N. body blamed poverty, unemployment, homelessness,
excessive drinking and smoking for the general drop. Health care
reforms ``that are overly reliant on market reforms'' also were
mentioned as a factor.
	   There is strong evidence that alcohol is largely responsible for
the mortality crisis, especially among middle-age males in the
states of the former Soviet Union, the agency said.
	   The wealthier European Union countries also have growing health
woes; rising unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor
have their shares of increasing health problems there.
	   Nanda said there were ``three main killers'' that hit both the
eastern and western parts of the WHO's European region:
cardiovascular diseases, cancer and accidents.
	   Around 30 percent of the region's adults smoke on a daily basis
and tobacco was estimated for 13 percent of all deaths. If death
rate for smoking-related disease among men are decreasing in
western Europe, it continues to rise for women, said Nanda. He
added that Denmark, Norway and Sweden have most women smokers of
the whole region.
	   ``Smoking kill 3,500 people everyday in the region. This equals
to 25 air planes crashing each day,'' he told reporters. Next week,
a report on the European region's state of health will be presented
at the WHO's annual meeting of regional health officials.

NATO presence in Bosnia depends on election, Solana says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A decision on whether to
retain the more than 30,000 NATO-led foreign troops in Bosnia
depends on this weekend's election results, top NATO officials said
Friday.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark,
NATO commander for Europe, met with the members of Bosnia's current
three-man presidency, perhaps ``for the last time,'' Solana told
journalists.
	   Western powers running Bosnia hope voters change at least some
of the presidency members, particularly Bosnian Serb hard-liner
Momcilo Krajisnik, whom they accuse of obstructing implementation
of the 1995 Dayton peace plan that ended Bosnia's 3 1/2-year war.
	   Solana noted the current presidency ``started Dayton'' and
called Friday's meeting with the three men ``an emotional moment.''
	   Asked whether the number of NATO troops deployed in Bosnia would
decrease any time soon, Solana said election results would
influence that decision.
	   U.S. officials said they'll decide in December whether to pull
out any of the more than 6,000 American troops in the force.
	   The top U.S. official in the office overseeing Bosnia said the
NATO-led force could eventually change from a heavy-duty operation
with tanks into a more mobile monitoring force.
	   Jacques Paul Klein, chief deputy to High Representative Carlos
Westendorp, said under that scenario, air power from outside the
country could be used for major military missions.
	   No Western officials want to offer a timetable for when troops
might leave, and most people expect foreign troops to be in Bosnia
for years.
	   Many decisions affecting Bosnia remain in the hands of foreign
officials.
	   The three-man presidency set up under the Dayton accords has one
member from each of the main ethnic groups _ Muslims, Serbs and
Croats. Only Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic is considered
virtually certain to retain his seat.
	   The inability of the three former foes to agree on most issues
caused Western powers to give their officials overseeing Bosnia
virtual absolute power to force decisions on the presidency.
	   Solana expressed hope the election results would give Bosnia
``new momentum'' in solving crucial problems such as allowing
refugees to return home.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Forces loyal to President Laurent Kabila
have recaptured the town of Lubutu on a key route between the
rebels' headquarters of Goma and the rebel-held city of Kisangani
in eastern Congo, state radio reported Friday.
	   The capture came as Kabila left the capital Friday to spend time
in his southwestern stronghold of Lubumbashi before flying to a
southern African summit in Mauritius that is likely to address
Congo's month-long war, state-controlled Voice of the People radio
said.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   The Southern African Development Community summit opens Monday
in the Indian Ocean island state. Representatives of the group's 14
member states are expected to discuss the war, which poses the
region's biggest security threat in years.
	   Loyalist forces recaptured Lubutu, about 300 kilometers (190
miles) northwest of Goma on Congo's eastern border with Rwanda and
roughly the same distance southeast of Kisangani in the eastern
interior, after ``intense bombardments'' on the town by loyalist
warplanes, state radio said.

Sailor kills eight crew members on Russian nuclear submarine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with sailor's family flown to submarine base, sailor
barricaded in torpedo compartment, negotiations continuing. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A 19-year-old sailor on a Russian nuclear
submarine stole a machine gun and shot dead at least eight crewmen
before barricading himself in the torpedo section of the vessel,
which was docked at a northern port, officials said Friday.
	   Alexander Kuzminykh, a draftee who's been in the navy since last
year, went on a shooting spree before dawn Friday on the submarine
in Severomorsk, near the city of Murmansk, the Defense Ministry
said in a statement.
	   Eight sailors were dead and the standoff continued into the late
afternoon, the statement added. The ITAR-Tass news agency put the
death toll at nine. The discrepancy could not immediately be
reconciled.
	   The submarine was of the Bars class, a nuclear-powered fleet
submarine that is designed to carry nuclear cruise missiles and
torpedoes, navy officials said.
	   However, there were no nuclear weapons on the submarine because
it was in port, officials said. Still, the torpedo compartment
where Kuzminykh was holed up did contain conventional explosives,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The shooting rampage began when Kuzminykh seized a machine gun
from a guard, killing him and then fatally shooting seven more crew
members, the Defense Ministry said.
	   The account gave no word on what might have prompted his
actions. However, the Interfax news agency said Kuzminykh had been
in detention on disciplinary charges when he seized the weapon.
	   The commander of the Russian navy, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, flew
to the port to handle the situation. Kuzminykh's family members,
including his mother and a brother, were flown to the site, news
reports said.
	   Officials tried to contact the sailor and appealed to him to
surrender, but he was not responding to their calls. Nor had he
made any demands, the Defense Ministry said.
	   There has been a rash of mass killings in the Russian armed
forces, which are plagued by brutal hazings and abysmal living
conditions. The military is chronically short of money because of
the country's economic problems and young servicemen often complain
of abuse at the hands of their superiors.

Government says it can't afford early mayoral elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's government said it can't
afford to hold early mayoral elections in Bucharest, but the main
opposition party on Friday accused authorities of making excuses
not to stage them.
	   Bucharest has had an acting mayor since November 1996 when the
city's elected mayor, Victor Ciorbea, took the job of prime
minister. Officially, Ciorbea was able to keep both jobs.
	   After Ciorbea went to the government, his deputy Viorel Lis took
over as acting mayor. Amid economic and political pressures,
Ciorbea stepped down as premier in March and quit the post of mayor
at the same time.
	   According to the law, Lis, who is a member of the ruling Peasant
Party, can keep his post until the next scheduled city elections in
2000. But the opposition is pushing for elections now _ they
already have a respected surgeon, as their candidate.
	   ``We consider that the financial pressure on the budget to
organize the elections makes us wonder whether the elections are
necessary,'' said Prime Minister Radu Vasile on Thursday, refusing
to set elections for Oct. 11.
	   Vasile said early elections would cost 15 billion lei (dlrs 1.7
million). The government is currently trying to slash expenditures
to rein in the budget deficit.
	   The Social Democratic Party, the main opposition grouping called
Vasile's decision ``illegal,'' adding the sum only represents half
of 1 percent of Bucharest's city hall budget for 1998.

Finns to send food, medical aid to needy Russians near border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Answering Russian calls for food and
medical supplies, Finland on Friday earmarked 5.5 million markkaa
(dlrs 1.1 million) to help the needy near the border.
	   Most of the aid, channeled through the Finnish Red Cross, will
be for hospitals, nurseries, schools and old people's homes in
Karelia and the Murmansk area.
	   The government decision follows aid requests Thursday by
officials in Vyborg and Svetogorsk, towns in northwest Russia near
the 1,270-kilometer (790-mile) Finnish-Russian border.
	   On Monday, Murmanks provincial governor Yuri Yevdokimov called
on officials in Finnish Lapland for food supplies, including meat,
butter, sugar and food oil.
	   Last year, Finland gave 4 million markkaa (dlrs 770,000) in
humanitarian aid to Russians in Karelia and Murmansk.

Central, Eastern European leaders urged to cooperate on free trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech Premier Milos Zeman called
for closer cooperation among Central and Eastern European countries
during a two-day summit on free trade, the CTK news agency reported
Friday.
	   Prime ministers from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland,
Hungary, Slovenia, Romania and Bulgaria arrived in Prague for a
two-day summit of CEFTA, a regional free trade organization.
	   ``It is the opinion of the new government of the Czech Republic
that we should return to the half-forgotten idea ... that would
give regional cooperation in Central Europe a new dimension,''
Zeman said.
	   He also called for the lowering of trade barriers to encourage
the movement of capital and agricultural products.
	   Zeman offered no immediate details, but his words seemed to
criticize the position of the previous Czech government of Vaclav
Klaus.
	   Klaus was instrumental in founding the Central European Free
Trade Agreement in 1992 as a groundwork for a future free trade
zone. But he was known for rejecting attempts to make it a strong
institution since all of its members declared their intention to
join the European Union.
	   Hungarian Premier Viktor Orban joined Zeman in a call for less
protectionism in trade with food products, CTK said.
	   Poland and Hungary are currently at loggerheads over an import
tax on agricultural products because both countries have a huge
food surplus.
	   The summit is likely to produce a series of bilateral talks
among the nations' leaders, such as the first unofficial meeting
between Zeman and Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar.
	   CEFTA intends to become a free trade zone in 2001, most likely
before any of its members are admitted in the EU.

Turkey protests Libyan support to Kurdish rebels, withdraws

ambassador &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Angered by Libya's public support of a
Kurdish rebel group, Turkey has recalled its ambassador to Tripoli,
the semi-official Anatolia news agency said Friday.
	   In retaliation, Tripoli withdraw its ambassador to Ankara, the
agency said.
	   Several men and women in Kurdish national dress and carrying the
flags of the outlawed Kurdish guerrilla group, PKK, marched in a
Sept. 1 parade marking the anniversary of the coup that brought
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to power.
	   The parade was the second public display of support for the PKK,
which the United States and many European countries regard as a
terrorist organization. In August, Libyan officials took part in
the PKK's anniversary celebrations in a Tripoli park.
	   Some 400 PKK members are believed based in Libya.
	   ``Gadhafi's attitude has surpassed all levels of tolerance,''
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said Friday.
	   Anatolia said Ambassador Mufit Ozdes was being recalled because
Libya had failed to provide a satisfactory explanation in reply to
an official protest lodged by Turkey.
	   Foreign Ministry officials were not immediately available for
comment.
	   The PKK has been waging a guerrilla war for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey since 1984. Some 37,000 people have died in the
conflict.

French customs seize banned doping products in Cofidis team van
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANNECY, France (AP) - French customs officials have found banned
doping substances in a van used by the Cofidis cycling team,
judicial sources said Friday.
	   The drugs were found Thursday during a search of a van that the
French team planned to use for future races.
	   A small number of the doping products were found in the personal
bags of team members, said judicial sources, on customary condition
of anonymity, in the border town of Thonon-les-Bains, where an
enquiry is beginning.
	   The recent Tour de France was marred by doping controversies.
	   The Festina team was thrown out of the famous race after
admitting to using the banned doping substance EPO, while six other
teams withdrew in protest at police actions.
	   Cofidis completed the Tour de France, but has not been free of
controversy.
	   One of its top riders, Philippe Gaumont, withdrew from the Tour
of Spain Wednesday to address allegations that he took a banned
substance for a race four months ago.

Russian man arrested for manufacturing, selling chemical weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police have arrested a man suspected of
manufacturing and trying to sell mustard gas and other powerful
poisons to Moscow criminals, news reports said Friday.
	   After the arrest, the suspect allegedly boasted that his
chemicals were much more powerful than the nerve gas used by
Japan's doomsday cult Aum Shinri Kyo for the 1995 attack on Tokyo
subways, according to two newspapers, Izvestia and Moskovsky
Komsomolets. The attack in Tokyo had killed 12 people.
	   The suspect, a chemist identified as Valery Borzov, 40, began
making chemical weapons in his Moscow apartment after he lost his
job at a research institute last year, the reports said.
	   Borzov allegedly contacted criminal leaders in the Russian
capital, offering to sell mustard gas and other poisons. Police
learned about the offers, and used an undercover police officer to
convince the chemist to deal exclusively with him, Moskovsky
Komsomolets said.
	   Borzov was arrested Aug. 6 after he provided the officer a
sample of mustard gas in an iodine bottle, Kommersant reported.

South Africa narrows soccer coach search to six
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ And now they are six.
	   Soccer officials here have narrowed their search down to a
half-dozen men to coach the South African national team.
	   A committee has interviewed three so far -- Ron Atkinson, Shakes
Mashaba and Trott Moloto, said Veli Mahlngu, head of the South
African Football Association's search committee.
	   Atkinson, a veteran of the Premier League, failed to have his
contract with Sheffield renewed. Mashaba is the national under-23
coach and Moloto was assistant to former coach Philippe Troussier,
who was dropped after Bafana Bafana's disappointing performance at
the World Cup finals this summer in France.
	   Brazil's Carlos Alberto Parreira, who coached Saudi Arabia at
the World Cup; Dutchman Ruud Krol and Gordon Igesund, coach of the
South African team Manning Rangers should be interviewed in the
next few weeks, Mahlngu said.
	   A decision is not expected before Oct. 4, he said. Moloto has
been running the team meantime.

Host Germany sends 17 boats to final, USA 14
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Host Germany was the most successful
nation at the end of the semifinals Friday at the world rowing
championships, sending 17 boats into the weekend's finals, three
more than the United States.
	   Out of the 33 nations represented in the medal races, Italy and
Australia have qualified 12, Britain sent 11, while Chile, Hong
Kong and Mexico qualified boats in the finals for the first time at
a world championship.
	   Germany, which captured the most titles at last year's worlds,
winning five of the 14 boat classes, will spearhead its gold medal
campaign with its star eight boat. The eight Germans won at the
most recent World Cup regatta in Lucerne where the team raced with
its complete crew for the first time.
	   The United States, which won four golds at last year's
championships, is also pinning its hopes on its men's eights,
counting on the crew to defend its crown.
	   Seeking to improve on last year's two world titles, the
finely-tuned British team will be led by its coxless four of Steve
Redgrave, Matthew Pinsent, James Cracknell and Tim Foster. The crew
has not lost a race since it joined forces in May last year.
	   The only blemish on the team's record is a fourth place finish
at the World Cup in Munich last May, when the crew had subsituted
in Luka Gurbor after regular Foster injured his hand.
	   Three-time Olympic champion Marnie McBean of Canada, racing in
the coxless four final Saturday, will attempt to become the first
woman to win Olympic or world championship medals in six different
boat classes.
	   The finals begin Saturday with the men's and women's lightweight
single scull.
	   In the men's event, reigning champion Karsten Nielsen of Denmark
will attempt to fend off attacks from Australia's Haimish Karrash,
three-time world champion Peter Haining of Britain and American
James Martinez.
	   In the men's heavyweight final, Olympic and 1996 world champion
Xeno Mueller of Switzerland, the 1995 world titlist Iztok Cop of
Slovenia, and last year's bronze medallist Greg Searle of Britain
will take advantage of the absence of reigning world champion James
Koven, loser in the semifinals after his oar came loose.
	   Runnerup at last year's world's, Denmark's Trina Hansen will
attempt to rectify the situation with a title in the women's single
sculls.
	   Russia's Irina Fedotova, who swept the three World Cup events
this year and 1997 bronze medallist Maria Brandin of Sweden are
expected to offer the fiercest challenge.

Poll shows German opposition increasing lead over Kohl
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAINZ, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's union parties,
which for months have been slowly catching up to the opposition
Social Democrats, fell further behind in a poll released Friday _
just two weeks before the national vote.
	   But the closely watched Politbarometer for ZDF public television
also found one in three voters still undecided about which party
would get their vote Sept. 27. Eighty percent also said they
believe the election outcome is still open.
	   The poll showed Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and its
Bavarian branch, the Christian Social Union, falling from 37
percent a week ago to 34 percent.
	   The Social Democrats, led by Gerhard Schroeder, gained strength,
moving from 43 percent to 45 percent. Its likely coalition partner,
the ecology-minded Greens, went from 7 percent to 8 percent.
	   The Free Democrats, junior coalition partner in Kohl's
government, also gained a point, to 6 percent.
	   Schroeder also gained in the popularity contest, according to
the survey, leading the four-term chancellor now by 57 percent to
36 percent.
	   The survey of 1,271 eligible voters by Forschungsgruppe Wahlen -
or Election Research Group - had a margin of error of up to 2.5
percentage points.
	   Kohl, who likes to boast he loses polls but wins elections,
remained optimistic.
	   ``The great majority don't want a left alliance of SPD and
Greens,'' he told the Schwarzwaelder Bote newspaper, saying such a
government would kill Germany's fragile economic recovery.

Three police officials ousted after beating death of Italian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) - Interior Minister Ivan Penic ousted a
police chief and two of his deputies Friday in the southern town of
Sibenik after their subordinates were charged with beating an
Italian man to death.
	   Penic acknowledged that he also felt personal responsibility,
and said his job could be reviewed by the government, the state-run
news agency HINA reported. There has been no such action yet.
	   Seven Sibenik policemen, all younger than 35, were arrested and
charged with assault in the line of duty and inflicting grievous
bodily harm to 44-year-old Ricardo Cetina.
	   Cetina, of Udine, died Sunday, a few hours after he was severely
beaten by the group.
	   Police said Cetina had disturbed public peace and endangered
traffic.
	   It was the worst case of police violence in Croatia, where there
have been several previous cases of policemen using unauthorized
force against suspected criminals.
	   An initial autopsy and a police investigation monitored by the
Italian Embassy showed Cetina's death was caused by a brain
hemorrhage and contusions.
	   Although the seven officers have not yet been tried, Penic
decided to fire Sibenik Police Chief Drago Matic and two of his
deputies.
	   The case alarmed the Italian public and threatened to erode
relations between the two countries.
	   Earlier this week, Premier Zlatko Matesa wrote his Italian
counterpart, Romano Prodi, promising that authorities ``will do
everything possible'' to investigate the case and prosecute
perpetrators.
	   Penic said he did not believe the incident would cause a crisis
in Croatian-Italian relations.
	   ``However, in order to avoid it, we will do everything to
clarify all causes that led to the terrible death of the Italian
citizen,'' he said at the press conference.

Agriculture minister re-opens hunting season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greeks were allowed to start hunting again
Friday after the agriculture minister sidestepped a court decision
that had suspended the season.
	   Agriculture Minister Stefanos Tzoumakas issued a decree
re-opening the season late Thursday, two days after the country's
highest administrative court ruled in favor of two environmental
groups who said it was too early to start hunting birds.
	   Tzoumakas had originally ordered hunting season to run from Aug.
20 until Feb. 28. The Council of State Tuesday suspended the
hunting season until Dec. 9.
	   The agriculture minister said he re-opened the season because
Greeks have a right to hunt, but did restrict the hunting of four
types of birds after January 31. They are two types of snipe, a
species of duck and turtle doves.
	   Environmental groups complained that of the four species, two
are not hunted and the other two have migrated out of Greece after
January.
	   There are about 250,000 registered hunters in Greece. Bird
hunting here is also popular with Italians.

Cavallo: Russia's financial crisis result of wrong privatization
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ One reason for the financial crisis in
Russia was a misconceived model for privatizing the nation's large
state enterprises, Argentina's former economics minister said
Friday.
	   Domingo Cavallo, architect of Argentina's economic reform plan,
said that these enterprises, although privatized, had retained a
monopoly in their sectors, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Cavallo was speaking during a meeting with Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma in Kiev, where he arrived this week to advise the
government on how to battle the difficult financial situation in
the country.
	   Cavallo said that because privatization in Ukraine is less
advanced than in in Russia, the country is capable of avoiding the
mistakes Russia made.
	   He said he was familiar with the Ukrainian government's action
plan to prevent the spillover of Russia's crisis into Ukraine, and
added that it would be sufficient to keep the situation under
control, Interfax said.
	   Ukraine has been badly hit by the financial turmoil in
neighboring Russia, and the government was forced to take urgent
actions to prevent a similar crisis.
	   The measures included protection of the national hryvna currency
by imposing sharp restrictions on bank operations with foreign
currencies, and introduction of benefits for exporters.

Russian political crisis nears resolution; economy awaits action

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Friday
a new government would need time to tackle Russia's deep economic
crisis and he appealed to all political factions for support.
	   Primakov, who was expected to be confirmed by lawmakers Friday,
gave no clear indication of his economic policies in a speech to
parliament.
	   He said he did not yet have an economic program because he had
only been nominated the day before. He said economic reform would
continue and it was necessary to take steps to fix the banking and
financial sectors, which have been badly damaged by the economic
crisis.
	   But at the same time he called for strong state regulation to
help build the rest of the economy.
	   ``The government should intervene into the economic affairs and
regulate them. This is not a return to the administrative and
command system,'' he said.
	   He denied this would be a return to Soviet economic control,
instead comparing it to emergency measures taken by the U.S.
government during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
	   ``So what must we do? Repeat the wild capitalism that we had up
till now? Or use the experience of other countries,'' he said.
	   He said the government had to do a much better job running the
country.
	   ``We need to strengthen discipline. We should stop this
sloppiness which now exists in the government,'' he said.
	   On foreign policy, Primakov said there would be no confrontation
with the West, but it was vital to defend Russia's national
interests.
	   ``We don't need confrontation, a return to the Cold War. And
that will not happen. But at the same time we will strictly defend
the interests of the state.''
	   Earlier in the day, Primakov told political leaders they should
give the next government up to a year before deciding if it was
succeeding or not.

Protests, calls for revenge after Israel kills Hamas fugitives
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ross meeting with Netanyahu &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   EL BIREH, West Bank (AP) _ Shouting ``we want revenge now,''
hundreds of Hamas supporters marched in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip on Friday after Israel killed the group's two top fugitives.
In two towns, protesters clashes with Israeli troops.
	   Hamas, an Islamic militant group, vowed to detonate more suicide
bombings in Israel to avenge the deaths of brothers Imad and Adel
Awadallah. Bracing for attacks, Israel sealed off the West Bank and
Gaza Strip and security forces were placed on high alert.
	   The new tension came as U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross shuttled
between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in hopes of concluding
a deal on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   A new outbreak of violence would make it exceedingly difficult
for Ross to negotiate a breakthrough and end a 17-month stalemate.
	   On the third day of his mission, Ross met Friday with
Palestinian security chiefs to discuss the possible release of
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Later in the day, Ross held
talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Volkswagen announces fund for ex-slave laborers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional details &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Facing lawsuits in the United States and threats
of more at home, Volkswagen approved a 20 million mark (dlrs 12
million) fund Friday to compensate former slave laborers forced to
work for the company by the Nazis during World War II.
	   The German automaker said it was ``morally called upon'' to
``provide humanitarian relief'' to former forced laborers, while
stressing it believed it was under no legal obligation to do so.
	   The first payments from the fund, to be administered by the
accounting firm KPMG, will be made ``before the end of the year,''
VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said in a statement.
	   But an attorney involved in a lawsuit filed against VW last week
in New Jersey said shortly before the announcement that an offer of
``humanitarian aid'' to survivors would not be enough to fend off
legal action.
	   New York lawyer Ed Fagan, who together with a German partner
represents the interests of some 30,000 Holocaust survivors, said
VW should provide a list of slave laborers who worked for it and
acknowledge a legal debt to them.
	   ``What they keep doing is trying to confuse charity with a legal
obligation,'' said Fagan, who was traveling in Jerusalem. ``These
companies have a legal obligation to pay the slaves they abused and
killed. ...
	   ``Without producing those lists there is no settlement and there
is no agreement, and we will continue to attack them and make them
pay in an American court,'' he said.
	   An estimated 17,000 forced laborers worked at Volkswagen between
1941 and the end of the war.
	   Like many other German firms, Volkswagen maintains it has no
legal obligation to compensate them, arguing they were forced to
employ slave laborers by the Nazis.
	   But VW broke ranks with the bulk of German industry in July,
becoming the first major German firm to set up a fund to give
``humanitarian aid'' directly to survivors.
	   The automaker's supervisory board approved the details Friday.
	   A statement issued after the board meeting said Volkswagen ``is
engaged in discussions with prominent persons'' to set up a council
to determine the amount of individual payments. It said fund
administrators would announce shortly where former forced laborers
can apply.
	   Lawsuits and threatened lawsuits have raised the pressure on
German firms to address the claims of concentration camp inmates,
mostly Jews, forced to work in their factories.
	   Some companies recently suggested they'd be willing to
contribute to a publicly administered fund, but Chancellor Helmut
Kohl has rejected any government involvement.
	   German attorney Klaus von Muenchhausen threatened early this
year to file a lawsuit on behalf of 30 Hungarian Jews forced to
work for Volkswagen, but held off after VW announced it would set
up a fund.

Tens of thousands of demonstrators protest social exclusion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Tens of thousands of demonstrators
jammed the streets of Brussels Friday demanding improved social
services and more government money to help the needy.
	   Some 30,000 trade unionists demanded the center-left government
use the upturn in Belgium's economy to siphon off more budgetary
funds to the social sector, including health, pensions and
unemployment benefits.
	   The Belgian National Bank Friday predicted continued economic
health despite the international financial crisis. The bank revised
its 1998 growth estimates to 2.8 percent from 2.5 percent in its
July forecast.
	   The government is in the process of planning its 1999 budget.

Extortion pushes up fares by 100 percent in Somalia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somali (AP) _ Passenger fares have risen by
100 percent along a road linking Mogadishu and southern
Somalia because of numerous roadblocks mounted by bandits,
drivers said Friday.
	   The drivers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the fares have, for example, risen from 2,000 Somali
shillings to 5,000 Somali shillings on a route 30
kilometers (about 18 miles) from Mogadishu because drivers
have to pay their way through 19 roadblocks.
	   On Thursday, hundreds of drivers demonstrated in the
streets of Mogadishu against the extortion and called on
faction leaders, the public and the Islamic court to fight
banditry.
	   Four court chairmen said they are ready to send
militiamen to clear the roadblocks.
	   On Oct. 21, public vehicle drivers again demonstrated
in Mogadishu against the bandits and threatened to halt
all transport if faction leaders and the courts failed to
stop the banditry.
	   Somalia has had no central government since 1991, when
a coalition of rebels ousted the late dictator Mohamed
Siad Barre and the country disintegrated into fiefs
protected by militias.
	   Faction leaders and Islamic courts in the
predominantly Muslim country enforce order in response to
public pressure.

Kinkel supports Poland's speedy acceptance into NATO, EU
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said
Friday Poland should join NATO as well as the European Union ``as
soon as possible.''
	   Kinkel, who was in Krakow to award an annual Polish-German
prize, stressed that Germany's support for Poland's inclusion into
Western military and political organizations was firm and could not
be affected by any bilateral issues, the PAP news agency said.
	   ``We will not allow anything to cloud our relations,'' Kinkel
told a joint news conference with his Polish counterpart Bronislaw
Geremek.
	   Kinkel was referring to the Association of Exiles in Germany
demanding compensation and the right to settle in the areas they
inhabited before World War II, before Poland and the Czech Republic
could join the EU.
	   The problem of German exiles remains a sensitive issue in Warsaw
and Prague as well as in Berlin, but Polish and Czech officials
have argued the case dating back to the final days of World War II
is closed.
	   About 5 million Germans were resettled from Poland following the
Potsdam Allied Conference in August 1945. The Conference forced
Poland to cede a large part of its eastern territories to the
former Soviet Union, but it gained lands in the west that
previously belonged to Germany.
	   The conference also sanctioned the expulsion of some 2.5 million
Germans from a border region in then-Czechoslovakia.
	   The exiles' demands and recent letters from Germans demanding
return of their real estate nationalized by Poland's communist
authorities in 1945 highlighted Polish fears that Poland's entry
into the EU could enable German exiles to reclaim their former
property.
	   Kinkel assured Poles Friday that most of the exiles opted for
reconciliation with Poland and reject radical demands.
	   Kinkel and Geremek awarded the annual Polish-German Prize to
Tygodnik Powszechny, an influential weekly published in Krakow by
Catholic intellectuals, and the Anna Morawska Seminar, a former
East German Catholic opposition group. They were honored for joint
efforts dating back to 1960s to to build reconciliation between
Poles and Germans.

Host Germany sends 17 boats to final, U.S. 14
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Host Germany was the most successful
nation at the end of the semifinals Friday at the world rowing
championships, sending 17 boats into the weekend's finals, three
more than the United States.
	   Out of the 33 nations represented in the medal races, Italy and
Australia qualified 12 boats each and Britain sent 11, while Chile,
Hong Kong and Mexico qualified boats in the finals for the first
time at a world championship.
	   Germany, which captured the most titles at last year's world
championships, winning five of the 14 boat classes, will spearhead
its gold medal campaign with its star eight boat. The eight Germans
won at the most recent World Cup regatta in Lucerne where the team
raced with its complete crew for the first time.
	   The United States, which won four golds at last year's
championships, is also pinning its hopes on its men's eights,
counting on the crew to defend its crown.
	   Seeking to improve on last year's two world titles, the
finely-tuned British team will be led by its coxless four of Steve
Redgrave, Matthew Pinsent, James Cracknell and Tim Foster. The crew
has not lost a race since it joined forces in May last year.
	   The only blemish on the team's record is a fourth place finish
at the World Cup in Munich last May, when the crew had subsituted
in Luka Gurbor after regular Foster injured his hand.
	   Three-time Olympic champion Marnie McBean of Canada, racing in
the coxless four final Saturday, will attempt to become the first
woman to win Olympic or world championship medals in six different
boat classes.
	   The finals begin Saturday with the men's and women's lightweight
single scull.
	   In the men's event, reigning champion Karsten Nielsen of Denmark
will attempt to fend off attacks from Australia's Haimish Karrash,
three-time world champion Peter Haining of Britain and American
James Martinez.
	   In the men's heavyweight final, Olympic and 1996 world champion
Xeno Mueller of Switzerland, the 1995 world titlist Iztok Cop of
Slovenia, and last year's bronze medallist Greg Searle of Britain
will take advantage of the absence of reigning world champion James
Koven, loser in the semifinals after his oar came loose.
	   Runnerup at last year's world's, Denmark's Trina Hansen will
attempt to rectify the situation with a title in the women's single
sculls.
	   Russia's Irina Fedotova, who swept the three World Cup events
this year and 1997 bronze medallist Maria Brandin of Sweden are
expected to offer the fiercest challenge.

Setting up trade battle, US takes aim at Chinese beetle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: For release at 1500 GMT Friday, Sept. 11; Time set by source &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Setting up a potentially bruising trade battle,
the United States announced strict regulations Friday to force
China to keep a hungry beetle out of U.S.-bound exports.
	   The Asian long-horned beetle, bullet-shaped and coal-black, is
believed to have arrived in wood packing crates from its native
China as long as seven years ago. Since then, the pests have eaten
through thousands of trees in the New York and Chicago areas
costing as much as dlrs 8 million in damage.
	   From late-December on, Chinese exporters must fumigate or treat
with heat or preservatives wood crates and pallets carrying goods
to the United States. Shipments must have an official certificate
guaranteeing the treatment. Even exports without wood-packaging
need documents declaring the contents wood-free.
	   ``The new regulations are based on science and a real biological
threat,'' Isi Siddiqui, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of
agriculture, told reporters in a satellite interview.
	   Without such ``emergency regulations,'' U.S. officials estimate
the beetle could cause as much as dlrs 138 billion in damage.
Impervious to most known pesticides or predators, the beetle partly
shields itself by burrowing into the trees.
	   In the United States, maples seem to be the beetle's favorite
meal. Since 1996, officials have documented at least three cases of
infestation _ in New York City's Greenpoint neighborhood and nearby
Amityville and in Chicago. But new outbreaks have been reported in
recent months near Amityville and Chicago.
	   The new rules come at a sensitive time for U.S.-China trade. The
United States is China's No. 1 market and increasingly important as
exports dwindle to Asian trading partners weakened by the yearlong
regional financial turmoil.
	   Washington has complained that the dlrs 62.6 billion in trade
last year unfairly benefited China and blames Beijing's dlrs 40
billion surplus partly on import restrictions.
	   China has refused U.S. wheat, for example, due to the presence
of TCK smut, a fungus sometimes found on American grain that U.S.
officials claim is harmless.
	   About a third to half of all Chinese exports to the United
States are packed in solid wood. That trade could be at risk if
Chinese exporters cannot meet the 90-day deadline to comply with
the new regulations.
	   A spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation said the government is looking into the regulations and
their potential impact on trade.
	   Siddiqui and U.S. Embassy officials in Beijing pledged to work
with the Chinese government and shippers to prevent disruption to
trade.

Arab League calls positive U.N. decision on Iraq review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to CLARIFY the main thrust of U.N. resolution;
CORRECTS date in final graf; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council's decision to
review Iraq's progress toward disarmament is a positive step that
could lead to the end of sanctions, an Arab League official said in
remarks published Friday.
	   In a resolution Wednesday, the council said it was suspending
the two-monthly reviews of the sweeping sanctions imposed on Iraq
since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait because of the Baghdad
government's decision to freeze cooperation with U.N. disarmament
inspectors.
	   But the resolution also said that once Baghdad restored
cooperation, the U.N. secretary-general would carry out a
comprehensive review of Iraq's progress toward complying with U.N.
resolutions that call for its elimination of weapons of mass
destruction and long-range missiles.
	   The decision to conduct such a review was a ``positive point,''
said Ahmed bin Hili, the Arab League deputy secretary-general, told
Egypt's official Middle East News Agency.
	   The decision could eventually lead to the lifting of U.N.
sanctions, Hili was quoted as saying.
	   The agency did not report Hili as commenting on the council's
suspension of sanctions reviews.
	   Hili did say the Arab League wanted Iraq and the United Nations
to resume the inspections ``as soon as possible.''
	   Iraq froze cooperation with U.N. inspectors on Aug. 5, after the
chief inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons.

Protests, calls for revenge after Israel kills Hamas fugitives
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ross meeting with Netanyahu &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   EL BIREH, West Bank (AP) _ Shouting ``we want revenge now,''
hundreds of Hamas supporters marched Friday in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip after Israel killed the group's two top fugitives. In
two towns, protesters clashes with Israeli troops.
	   Hamas, an Islamic militant group, vowed to detonate more suicide
bombings in Israel to avenge the deaths of brothers Imad and Adel
Awadallah. Bracing for attacks, Israel sealed off the West Bank and
Gaza Strip and security forces were placed on high alert.
	   The new tension came as U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross shuttled
between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in hopes of concluding
a deal on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   A new outbreak of violence would make it exceedingly difficult
for Ross to negotiate a breakthrough and end a 17-month stalemate.
	   On the third day of his mission, Ross met Friday with
Palestinian security chiefs to discuss the possible release of
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Later in the day, Ross held
talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

	   MONZA, Italy (AP) _ Eddie Irvine was faster than the rain and
his Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher as he led the field in
Friday's free practice for the Italian Formula One grand prix.
	   Irvine, the No.2 driver of the Italian team, edged Schumacher by
0.25 seconds as he turned his fastest lap on the 5.77-kilometer
(3.585-mile) Monza circuit in one minute, 24.987 seconds or 235.941
kmph (146.283 mph).
	   McLaren teammates David Coulthard and Mika Hakkinen, Ferrari's
main rivals, placed third and fifth respectively with defending
world champion Jacques Villeneuve coming in fourth in a
Williams-Mecachrome.
	   Coulthard had a gap of 0.7 seconds from Irvine while Villeneuve
and Hakkinen trailed the practice leader by more than one second.
	   Irvine, still without a victory in 78 Formula One races, showed
perfect timing as he set the fastest lap shortly before battering
rain forced teams to use slower rain tires in the last 30 minutes
of practice.
	   The result made Ferrari fans happy but meant little for Sunday's
Grand Prix as most teams used the two-hour session to test set-ups,
engines and tactics in race conditions.
	   The weather office predicted bright sun on the race day Sunday
and clouds and possibly rain on Saturday when the decisive
qualifying hour, awarding the pole position, is scheduled at 1100
GMT.
	   ``It's a nice feeling to be at the top of the page, in front of
all the tifosi (fans) at Monza, even though Friday's time is never
very important,'' Irvine said.
	   ``There is still room for improvement tomorrow. I feel we can
really put McLaren under pressure,'' he added.
	   Hakkinen and Schumacher, the top contenders for the 1998 world
drivers title, enter the Italian GP split by only seven points --
77 to 70.
	   Both did not complete the previous GP in Belgium on Aug. 30.
	   Schumacher was forced to withdraw while leading the race
following a collision with Hakkinen's teammate David Coulthard,
which touched off a bitter controversy between the two drivers.
	   Schumacher, who had accused the McLaren driver of reckless
driving, shook hands and officially made peace with Coulthard at
Monza Thursday.
	   However the hot-tempered Ferrari fans still booed and jeered
Coulthard any time he left the pits for practice laps.
	   ``We feel a sort of psychological war around the team,'' said
Ron Dennis, McLaren-Mercedes general manager. ``We must keep cool
and calm ... to achieve our goals.''
	   Schumacher said Ferrari cars looked quite competitive both in
dry and wet conditions.
	   ``I hope I can give the tifosi something to cheer about tomorrow
and on Sunday,'' the German driver said.
	   Hakkinen said he could not do any better because of the sudden
rain.
	   Sunday's race, the 14th of the 16-round World Championship,
could grant decisive points for the title and is touching off
excitement among auto racing fans.
	   Coulthard, third in the world standings with 48 points, is the
defending champion in Monza where he won the 1997 GP ahead of Jean
Alesi.

British government releases six IRA, pro-British militants
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with seventh man released, but CLARIFIES he is not
part of any paramilitary group, SUBS 1st graf to change to six
militants to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The British government freed
six convicted IRA and pro-British militants Friday, the first
paramilitary inmates to win parole under terms of the Northern
Ireland peace accord.
	   Three members of the outlawed Ulster Defense Association, the
largest paramilitary group rooted in hard-line Protestant areas,
were the first to walk free from the anti-terrorist Maze prison
southwest of Belfast.
	   Dan Annesley, Matt McCormick and Gary Hall all covered their
faces as they left through a gantlet of reporters and television
crews.
	   Hall had served six years of a 14-year sentence for trying to
kill a Catholic couple in north Belfast in 1992. McCormick had
served six years of a 14-year sentence for conspiring to kill a
Catholic, and Annesley had served two years of a five-year sentence
for extorting protection money from businessmen.
	   Later, three members of the Irish Republican Army walked free
through the same gates _ Sean McGuigan, serving 12 years for gross
bodily harm; Louis McNally, midway through a 22-year sentence for
conspiracy to murder, and Gerard Magee, who received a 20-year
sentence for conspiracy to murder.
	   Greeting them were senior members of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein
party, including two prominent officials who led a mass escape from
the Maze in 1983.
	   A seventh prisoner in Northern Ireland's Magilligan prison also
was released Friday under the umbrella of the agreement, even
though he did not belong to any paramilitary organization. Mark
Bellringer had been serving 7 years for manslaughter.
	   April's agreement promised that more than 400 imprisoned members
of the IRA, UDA and another pro-British paramilitary group, the
Ulster Volunteer Force, would be freed by mid-2000 in recognition
of their truces.
	   The IRA formally stopped its campaign to abolish Northern
Ireland and its British links in July 1997. The UDA and UVF _
equally committed to maintaining Northern Ireland as a
Protestant-majority state _ have observed a joint cease-fire since
October 1994.

coming back from huge losses Thursday; UPDATING Treasury bond
market. RECASTS. Changes byline. &QL;

 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks shook off early losses and began rising
sharply on Wall Street Friday morning, interrupting a global
selling spree that included the biggest decline of the year by
Tokyo's blue-chip stocks.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, down 248.48 points Thursday,
was off an additional 96.30 in the early going. But it recovered to
a gain of 111.73 at 7,727.27 by midmorning, with the
technology-heavy Nasdaq index also was rising, helped by
encouraging earnings statements from Intel Corp. and Oracle Corp.
	   Still, traders remained on edge in advance of the release of the
Independent Counsel's report on the Monica Lewinsky affair, with
sources saying the prosecutor accuses President Bill Clinton of
perjury and obstruction of justice.
	   Markets continued to be unsettled by economic problems that now
are plaguing Latin American financial markets after roiling Russia
and Asia. There was some encouragement, however, as Brazilian
shares began rising Friday after the government raised interest
rates sharply. Trading on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin
America's largest, was halted twice in Thursday's frenzied session,
when shares plummeted 15.8 percent.
	   The unease worldwide has led to a buying binge for U.S. Treasury
bonds, a traditional haven for cash in times of unrest. There were
new sharp gains for government bonds early in the day, as global
stock markets were being battered, but those gains began shrinking
as U.S. stocks turned higher.
	   Stocks already were falling outside the United States as Wall
Street's trading day began.
	   On the London Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest market, the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off by 1.8
percent by midday. The index had traded somewhat lower in the
morning.
	   Many investors were staying out of the market, figuring much of
the information might come out after London had finished trading
for the day.
	   ``I don't know if people will be brave enough to do anything
today,'' said Peter Caulkett, a stock salesman at the brokerage
Teather and Greenwood. ``No one knows what will be in Starr's
report.''
	   Key market indexes were off by 1.4 percent in Frankfurt and
Paris, with blue chips in Milan off by 4 percent.
	   The damage was heavier on big Asian markets.
	   Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average plummeted 749.05 points,
or 5.12 percent, to close at 13,916.98. It was the largest one-day
point fall this year. The finish was just barely above the Nikkei's
12-year closing low of 13,915.63 set on Aug. 28.
	   Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 3.5 percent, while
shares in Singapore fell, sending the Straits Times Index down 1.3
percent.
	   The recent decline by the U.S. dollar also sent shudders through
foreign markets, where analysts worried their corporations could be
hurt by more competitively priced exports from America.
	   ``Unfortunately, what's good or bad for the U.S. is good or bad
for Asia'' and the rest of the world, said Eugene Chung, Asia
strategist at Warburg Dillon Read (HK) Ltd., in Hong Kong.

Pakistan accuses India of troop build up on disputed border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Pakistan-Nuclear Treaty &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan on Friday accused
neighboring India of reinforcing troops along the disputed Kashmir
border, moving heavy artillery pieces closer to Pakistani territory
and firing indiscriminately.
	   India has been stepping up its military presence along the
disputed border during the past week, the defense ministry said.
	   Saying the build up ``cannot be ignored,'' the ministry
statement said ``adequate arrangements have been made for a
suitable response,'' without elaborating.
	   The 51-year-old dispute over the Himalayan state of Kashmir has
been the cause of two wars between India and Pakistan, in 1948 and
1965. The two neighbors fought a third war in 1971 over Bangladesh
or what was then East Pakistan.
	   The Kashmir dispute, which began in 1947 when the former
princely state was divided between India and Pakistan, gained
international prominence last May after the neighbors conducted
underground nuclear tests.
	   Pakistan and India declared themselves nuclear powers after
carrying out tit-for-tat underground tests. It's not clear how far
either country has gone toward developing nuclear weapons, but both
India and Pakistan have test fired medium and long range missiles
capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
	   The United States believes Pakistan acquired M-11 missiles from
China, also capable of carrying nuclear weapons.
	   The United Nations has urged both countries to find a peaceful
settlement to the dispute over the divided Kashmir, which both
sides claim in its entirety.
	   India accuses Pakistan of fomenting violence on its side of the
border where a violent secessionist movement has been raging since
1989.
	   Kashmir is predominately Hindu India's only Muslim-dominated
state and the secessionist movement involving a variety of Islamic
parties is demanding either outright independence or union with
Islamic Pakistan.
	   Pakistan has denied aiding the militants, saying it is providing
only moral and political support.
	   The defense ministry statement warned New Delhi that its
``threatening posture'' could scuttle attempts at restarting
stalled peace negotiations.
	   Calling the buildup ``ominous,'' the defense ministry warned
that it might be a precursor to cross-border attacks on civilians
living in the area.
	   ``The Pakistan armed forces are fully prepared and equipped to
thwart the nefarious designs of the enemy,'' the statement said.

Kosovo refugees' suffering continues despite new appeals

<TEXT>
	   ISTINIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The main political leader of Kosovo
Albanians on Friday joined a chorus of calls for a halt to Serb
military actions in Kosovo, where a huge new exodus of civilians
has alarmed international refugee officials.
	   Ibrahim Rugova described the situation in Kosovo as critical and
worsening, although he stopped short of his usual calls for Western
intervention to stop the Serb advance.
	   ``The humanitarian crisis is very grave, especially involving
the people who have fled to the mountains,'' he said in Kosovo's
capital Pristina.
	   Some 20,000 refugees remained camped Friday around the
southwestern Kosovo village of Istinic, where they sought refuge
from Serb-led Yugoslav forces seeking to destroy the secessionist
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Humanitarian workers who visited the area witnessed widespread
illness, hunger and war injuries among the refugees, trapped for
days or weeks with little food and no medical care.
	   Workers from Doctors Without Borders and Oregon-based Mercy
Corp. said most children were sick, suffering from infections,
untreated illnesses or other ailments.
	   ``We just got here a half-hour ago and we've seen almost all the
children have diarrhea,'' said a nurse in a four-member team of
Doctors Without Borders.
	   Minutes after the team arrived, about 150 refugees lined up
outside a makeshift home for medical treatment.
	   Until this week's Serb attacks, the Istinic area was one of the
last strongholds of the KLA.
	   The KLA insists on independence for Kosovo from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians comprise some 90
percent of the province's population.
	   For now, Serb forces appear to have halted their advance, which
drove ethnic Albanians from their homes and farms into the huge
encampment around this village 75 kilometers (45 miles) southwest
of Pristina.
	   Rrok Berisha, a member of Kosovo's unauthorized ethnic Albanian
parliament, said most of the refugees fled 40 nearby villages
shelled by police in the past few days.
	   Berisha said he feared 100,000 refugees could stream into the
area as more villages are cleared.
	   Refugees said they feared police soon would begin rounding up
men of fighting age on suspicion they had fought in the KLA. A
village elder in Istinic said about 40 men and women injured by
shelling fled into the hills Wednesday, fearing arrest. Another
refugee said six young men had been beaten by police.
	   In the latest reports of fighting, the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo
Information Center reported that Serb forces had launched attacks
Friday on the village of Rezala in the Drenica area of central
Kosovo. Many KLA fighters moved to Drewnica following their defeat
in western Kosovo.
	   Boasting that the KLA had been routed in the west, police told
the pro-government Serb Media Center on Friday that they had found
hundreds of abandoned rifles and uniforms with the UCK (KLA)
insignia.
	   The top Serbian official in Kosovo, Andrija Milosavljevic,
estimated Friday that there are 150,000 displaced in Kosovo _ fewer
than international officials have said.
	   He told the Beta news agency the figure changes constantly, with
10,000 people returning to their villages in one area while 20,000
other civilians were flushed out of their homes around Istinic.
	   Milosavljevic also said that according to initial estimates some
10,000 houses and structures have been damaged in the fighting and
will be repaired.

Swiss hold services for Flight 111 victims before New York
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Hundreds of Swiss mourners filled historic St.
Peter's Cathedral in one of three memorial services on both sides
of the Atlantic on Friday for the victims of Swissair Flight 111.
	   ``The tragedy of Halifax has just sadly reminded of the
fragility of our life and the absurdity of our frantic
lifestyles,'' said Swiss President Flavio Cotti.
	   Cotti joined Philippe Bruggisser, chief executive of the
airline's parent, at the ecumenical service in the cathedral, John
Calvin's base during the Protestant Reformation.
	   Other government officials and Swissair representatives were
taking part in simulateous service in St. Peter's Church in Zurich.
Four hours later a similar memorial was planned for Lincoln Center
in New York.
	   Switzerland declared a week of mourning for the victims of the
Sept. 2 crash, with flags around the country lowered to half staff.
A number of memorial services have already been held in
Switzerland, the United States and Canada.

Ferrari drivers lead free practice for Italian GP

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONZA, Italy (AP) _ Eddie Irvine was faster than the rain and
his Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher as he led the field in
Friday's free practice for the Italian Formula One grand prix.
	   Irvine, the No.2 driver of the Italian team, edged Schumacher by
0.25 seconds as he turned his fastest lap on the 5.77-kilometer
(3.585-mile) Monza circuit in one minute, 24.987 seconds or 235.941
kmph (146.283 mph).
	   McLaren teammates David Coulthard and Mika Hakkinen, Ferrari's
main rivals, placed third and fifth respectively with defending
world champion Jacques Villeneuve coming in fourth in a
Williams-Mecachrome.
	   Coulthard had a gap of 0.7 seconds from Irvine while Villeneuve
and Hakkinen trailed the practice leader by more than one second.
	   Irvine, still without a victory in 78 Formula One races, showed
perfect timing as he set the fastest lap shortly before battering
rain forced teams to use slower rain tires in the last 30 minutes
of practice.
	   The result made Ferrari fans happy but meant little for Sunday's
Grand Prix as most teams used the two-hour session to test set-ups,
engines and tactics in race conditions.
	   The weather office predicted bright sun on the race day Sunday
and clouds and possibly rain on Saturday when the decisive
qualifying hour, awarding the pole position, is scheduled at 1100
GMT.
	   ``It's a nice feeling to be at the top of the page, in front of
all the tifosi (fans) at Monza, even though Friday's time is never
very important,'' Irvine said.
	   ``There is still room for improvement tomorrow. I feel we can
really put McLaren under pressure,'' he added.
	   Hakkinen and Schumacher, the top contenders for the 1998 world
drivers title, enter the Italian GP split by only seven points --77
to 70.
	   Both did not complete the previous GP in Belgium on Aug. 30.
	   Hakkinen was knocked out in the first lap of the re-started
race.
	   Schumacher was forced to withdraw while leading following a
collision with Hakkinen's teammate David Coulthard, which touched
off a bitter controversy between the two drivers.
	   Schumacher, who had accused the McLaren driver of reckless
driving, shook hands and officially made peace with Coulthard at
Monza Thursday.
	   However the hot-tempered Ferrari fans still booed and jeered
Coulthard any time he left the pits for practice laps.
	   ``We feel a sort of psychological war around the team,'' said
Ron Dennis, McLaren-Mercedes general manager. ``We must keep cool
and calm ... to achieve our goals.''
	   Schumacher said Ferrari cars looked quite competitive both in
dry and wet conditions.
	   ``I hope I can give the tifosi something to cheer about tomorrow
and on Sunday,'' the German driver said.
	   Hakkinen said he could not do any better because of the sudden
rain.
	   ``But I'm in a good frame of mind for the weekend,'' Hakkinen
said.
	   Sunday's race, the 14th of the 16-round World Championship,
could grant decisive points for the title and is touching off
excitement among auto racing fans.
	   Coulthard, third in the world standings with 48 points, is the
defending champion in Monza where he won the 1997 GP ahead of Jean
Alesi.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hundreds of demonstrators called for holy
war against the Taliban militia here Friday because of the killing
of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan, the official Iranian news
agency reported.
	   ``Death to the Taliban! Shame on Pakistan!'' the protesters
shouted according to the Islamic Republic News Agency.
	   The demonstration was staged by people who just attended Friday
prayers at Tehran University where former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani said that Iran would avenge Taliban's killing of nine
diplomats in northern Afghanistan.
	   ``I condole the martyrs' families and promise them that we will
get revenge for their blood,'' said Rafsanjani, who heads a
government policy-making body.
	   The Taliban said Thursday that bodies of nine Iranian diplomats
were found this week, and admitted that they had been killed by the
religious army's own troops. The disclosure was made in a letter
from the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan. The United Nations condemned the killings.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's woes deepened Friday when the government
announced the economy has slid even further into recession,
shrinking for a third quarter _ the first such contraction in more
than 40 years.
	   Heightening fears the world's second-largest economy could set
off a global slump, the Economic Planning Agency said Japan's
economy is on track to shrink at an annual rate of 3.3 percent _ a
significant deterioration from last year's 0.7 percent contraction.
	   ``The Japanese economy is walking along the edge of a
deflationary spiral,'' said Taichi Sakaiya, the agency's head.
	   Hit by feeble consumer spending and the financial meltdown
elsewhere in Asia, Japan's gross domestic product _ the measure of
all goods and services produced _ declined by a worse-than-expected
0.8 percent between April and June compared to the previous
quarter, the EPA said.
	   That marked three consecutive quarters of negative results,
something which has not previously been recorded since the
government began disseminating GDP data in 1955.
	   Officially the government still estimates the economy will grow
1.9 percent in the current fiscal year, which ends at the end of
next March, but officials have acknowledged that the forecast was
unattainable.
	   While Sakaiya held out hope for a recovery sometime in the next
two years, some economists suggested Japan has entered a dangerous
new phase of decline.
	   ``It's clear that the economy is imploding,'' said Andrew
Shipley, senior economist at Schroders Securities (Japan).
	   The figures were released after the Tokyo Stock Exchange had
closed for the week, but widespread pessimism about the economy's
prospects helped drive down the benchmark index 5.12 percent _ its
steepest drop so far this year.
	   Japanese bond prices hit new all-time lows Friday, with the
benchmark 10-year bond yield sinking to 0.77 percent.
	   The latest batch of dismal economic news appeared likely to add
to uncertainty about the prospects for embattled Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi, who has pledged to turn the economy around in two
year's time.
	   ``These numbers may lead to a loss of confidence in the
government,'' said Susumu Kato, senior economist at Barclays
Capital Japan.
	   The EPA said many Japanese companies had cut back drastically on
spending for new factories and equipment, with capital outlays
falling 5.5 percent compared to the previous quarter.
	   One reason, say economists, was a sharp drop in demand from
Asia, which remains in the grips of a financial mess triggered by a
wave of currency devaluations last year.
	   Japanese companies have also had difficulty raising money to
finance new investments. The country's banks are still struggling
to shake off the effects of a plunge in land prices in the early
1990s that left them holding an estimated 76 trillion yen (dlrs 570
billion) in failed or risky loans.
	   As banks set aside money to cover their losses, they've cut back
on new lending.
	   Friday's figures also showed a 0.8 percent drop in personal
consumption, the single largest component of the economy. Consumer
spending has been on the skids since an ill-timed increase in the
national sales tax last year, just as the economy was showing signs
of recovery.
	   A belated income tax cut offered by Obuchi in August has failed
to spur consumption as pessimism about the future is driving most
Japanese to simply put the extra money in the bank, the Bank of
Japan found in a monthly report, which was also released Friday.
	   ``Japan's economic conditions continue to deteriorate,'' the
report said.

Hard-pressed Pakistan opens debate on accepting nuclear test ban
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A frustrated and nearly powerless
opposition walked out of a Pakistani parliament debate Friday on a
nuclear test ban treaty, claiming the government had already
decided to sign the pact.
	   Tough international sanctions have strained Pakistan's economy
to the breaking point, after the nation of 130 million people
tested six nuclear devices in May in response to similar tests by
its hostile neighbor India. Pakistan desperately needs
international loans, which appear to hinge on its signing the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
	   ``I am really amazed and appalled that the decision on the CTBT
has already been taken by the government,'' said Raza Rabbani, a
leading member of the opposition Pakistan People's Party. ``They
want to use the parliament as a rubber stamp.''
	   The two South Asian nations have fought three wars since 1947,
so their nuclear tests caused alarm that they could actually use
atomic weapons. India also faces sanctions, but has so far refused
to sign the treaty.
	   Key donors, including the United States, Japan, the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund, cut off Pakistan to protest
the tests. That left Pakistan desperately short of foreign currency
and in danger of defaulting on its September payments on dlrs 32
billion in debt.
	   Parliament's joint treaty debate, expected to continue into next
week, opens the same day as a team from the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank arrived in the capital of Islamabad to
discuss an economic bailout package for Pakistan.
	   Publicly, the government insists that it cannot be coerced into
signing the treaty, although the Pakistani news media says the
government has already decided to sign.
	   ``We will make this decision in accordance with the wishes of
parliament and the wishes of the Pakistani people,'' said Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif as he entered Parliament for Friday's opening
session of the hastily called debate. ``We will not make this
decision under any (outside) pressure.''
	   Proponents of nuclear testing filled the streets after May's
test blasts, celebrating Pakistan's closure of the arms gap with
India and its joining the world's nuclear powers.
	   Mainstream political parties appear to favor the treaty.
However, the opposition was furious over what they claimed was a
government bid to slip the treaty through in a hastily called
joint-session of parliament. Without enough seats in parliament to
stop the ruling Pakistan Muslim League, opposition parties
routinely walk out of sessions in protest.
	   The government has said it wants a broad national consensus on
the treaty, but expects opposition from small but influential
right-wing religious parties. The government has also assured the
public that a promise not to test weapons does not stop nuclear
weapons development.
	   The IMF stalled the last payment of a dlrs 1.5 billion loan and
credits package after the nuclear tests. Pakistan this week
resorted to signing a dlrs 1.5 billion bailout deal with the
Islamic Development Bank, at a crippling interest rate of more than
10 percent.
	   Since that is not enough, the country hopes for a dlrs 2.5
billion IMF and World Bank package, in exchange for government
spending cuts, tax hikes and privatization of state industries.
	   The most important condition, however, appears to be the test
ban treaty, or CTBT.
	   ``Apparently, Islamabad is going to sign the CTBT for a mere
financial bailout package,'' Islamabad's The Nation newspaper said
Friday. ``No one knows, clearly, however, what benefits Pakistan
will accrue out of this deal under tremendous pressure from the
United States except burdening the economy with more loans.''

U.S sees allies getting ready for action without UN nod
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The U.S. administration sees a growing
readiness in the NATO alliance for military action against Serbia
even without prior approval from the United Nations, a senior
American diplomat said Friday.
	   The allies have been prevented from taking a more forceful
stance over Kosovo by divisions over whether U.N. blessing is
needed for military action to halt President Slobodan Milosevic's
crackdown on the rebellion by ethnic Albanians.
	   In recent months, NATO has repeatedly threatened to use force
and laid extensive plans for punitive military action while
Milosevic's operations in Kosovo continued unabated, creating some
265,000 refugees.
	   However, France, in particular, has insisted a NATO campaign be
endorsed beforehand by the U.N. Security Council. Russia, opposed
to such intervention, could use its veto it.
	   The diplomat said talks with officials in France, Germany,
Britain and other allies in recent weeks, revealed a hardening of
views toward Milosevic and a desire not to be held hostage by a
Russian `no' in the U.N. Security Council.
	   ``Things are coming to a head,'' said the diplomat, who asked
not to be identified.
	   ``No ally wants to see NATO blocked by the need to get a United
Nations mandate. Serbian security forces are still on the offensive
(in) actions that go beyond teaching the KLA a lesson.''
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence for
Kosovo, a Serbian province where 90 percent of the population is
ethnic Albanian.
	   The American dimplomat predicted a continued ``accumulation of
horror'' in Kosovo will spark the allies into military action.
	   The diplomat insisted Washington was winning the argument NATO
can pursue military action against Milosevic outside of the United
Nations. He cited as one legal basis the threat that fighting in
Kosovo poses for stability in Albania and other neighbors.
	   This week, NATO completed planning for military operations in
and around Kosovo aimed at forcing Milosevic and Kosovo Albanians
to sit down and negotiate a peaceful solution to their conflict.
	   NATO has worked out three basic options:
	   - A preventive deployment of NATO troops in Albania along the
border with Kosovo.
	   - Air operations inside Yugoslavia, both limited and full scale.
	   - Deployment of ground troops backed by air power to support a
cease-fire or a peace agreement for Kosovo. That could involve as
many as 60,000 troops.
	   Such operations could involve both NATO and non-member
countries, the official said.

Humanitarian groups overwhelmed in squalid Kosovo refugee camp
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES and RECASTS with color from refugee camp,
humanitarian agencies arriving, refugees afraid to return home.

<TEXT>
	   ISTINIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Humanitarian workers trickled on
Friday into a western Kosovo town teeming with thousands of
refugees, many ill, wounded and shell-shocked after fleeing
villages under Serb siege.
	   ``There is too much work for us to do,'' said a French nurse
with Doctors Without Frontiers, who asked for anonymity. She said
most of the children suffer from diarrhea, and infections were also
wide-spread, particularly among the aged.
	   About 150 men, women and children crowded around a house serving
as an impromptu clinic staffed by two nurses and two doctors from
the humanitarian organization.
	   Some had festering wounds. Others appeared feeble after nights
sleeping on damp fields with little food and no clean water.
	   Most refugees fled to Istinic, about 75 kilometers (45 miles)
west of the provincial capital of Pristina, from areas to the north
and south targeted by a police offensive that ousted the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army from one of their last
strongholds almost a week ago. Dozens were wounded and several
killed by mortar shells and bullets.
	   Many had already spent weeks in other refugee pockets where they
fled earlier fighting in the six-month-old conflict that has killed
hundreds and left more than a quarter of a million homeless in
Kosovo. The province is 90 per cent ethnic Albanian, who
overwhelmingly seek independence, but belongs to Serbia, the
dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation.
	   Tractors and trailers loaded with hastily packed belongings
jammed farm fields for kilometers around Istinic Friday. Refugees
cooked what little food they had on open fires.
	   In a crowded field outside the town, one boy in his early teens
lay on his family's meager pile of clothing with a bullet in his
groin. A relative said the boy was shot when police attacked his
village several days ago.
	   Humanitarian workers said supplies to arrive Friday and Saturday
will be meager due to the need to care for at least 50,000 more
refugees who have fled to hills and forests after the conflict
began in late February.
	   A senior Serb police officer, whose colleagues had circled the
refugee camp, said he escorted thousands of refugees back to their
villages in the last two days. Some reporters at the scene
estimated around 10,000 refugees in the village _ less than in
previous days.
	   The police officer, who refused to identify himself, said his
men were collecting a few weapons still with the refugees and then
guaranteeing their safety.
	   However, several refugees said police loaded only six buses with
men, women and children and refused to allow others to leave.
	   Others said they were afraid to leave the refugee camp for fear
of police violence.
	   Also Friday, the main political leader of Kosovo Albanians
joined a chorus of calls for a halt to Serb military actions in
Kosovo where the growing refugee flow has alarmed international
refugee officials.
	   Ibrahim Rugova described the situation in Kosovo as critical and
worsening, although he stopped short of his usual calls for Western
intervention to stop attacks by Serbian police and the Yugoslav
army.
	   U.N. officials, including Undersecretary-General Olara Otunnu,
planned to visit the refugees Friday. They hope their presence will
discourage police from arresting men and boys suspected of links to
the KLA.
	   In Belgrade, chief Yugoslav prosecutor Vukasin Jokanovic
declared that Serb troops had crushed the rebels and arrested ``a
large number.'' Jokanovic said many ``terrorists'' would soon face
trial for ``terrorism and conspiracy against the state.''
	   John Shattuck, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human
Rights, warned again Thursday that Kosovo is headed for a
humanitarian catastrophe as the harsh Balkan winter approaches.

Volkswagen announces fund for ex-slave laborers

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Shimon Peres asked to oversee fund &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Facing lawsuits in the United States and threats
of more at home, Volkswagen approved a 20 million mark (dlrs 12
million) fund Friday to compensate former slave laborers forced to
work for the company by the Nazis during World War II.
	   The German automaker said it was ``morally called upon'' to
``provide humanitarian relief'' to former forced laborers, while
stressing it believed it was under no legal obligation to do so.
	   The first payments from the fund, to be administered by the
accounting firm KPMG, will be made ``before the end of the year,''
VW said in a statement issued in Wolfsburg. Spokesman Klaus Kocks
said former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres is among those
asked to help oversee the fund.

African, U.N. leaders seek peace in Congo; Rwanda threatens to
</HEADLINE>
intervene &QL; 
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ African and U.N. leaders scrambled
Friday to stop Congo's 6-week-old civil war, while Rwanda renewed
its threat to deploy troops to prevent the persecution of ethnic
Tutsis.
	   Leaders from seven countries embroiled in Congo's war met for a
second day in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa to negotiate an
immediate cease-fire and the withdrawal of foreign troops.
	   Their prospects for success were dim: Rebels said they would not
be bound by any pact agreed by the ministers because they were
barred from the negotiations.
	   Rwanda complained about the exclusion of the rebels from the
meeting, which was to end Friday, and threatened to step into the
conflict.
	   Congolese President Laurent Kabila claims both Rwanda and Uganda
already are involved. Despite denials from both governments,
witnesses have seen Rwandan and Ugandan troops deep in Congo.
	   ``We reserve the right to intervene when Rwanda's security is
threatened or when genocide is the order of the day in Congo,''
Emmanuel Gasana, a defense adviser, said in the Rwandan capital.
``But as for the date and hour, you shall see when it happens.''
	   Despite the warning, Gasana said Rwanda still believed in a
peaceful solution and participated in the Addis Ababa talks.
	   Zambian Defense Minister Chitalu Sampa said the negotiators in
Ethiopia would try to set up a method for ensuring all parties,
including foreign troops, comply with the cease-fire. Kabila was on
the verge of defeat before Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe sent help.
	   It was the fourth formal attempt to bring peace to the troubled
country.
	   A Congolese rebel delegation angrily abandoned negotiations
Tuesday in Zimbabwe, just before a draft of a cease-fire agreement
was expected to be signed. It was the only time they had been
invited to peace talks.
	   Fighting immediately surged in eastern Congo.
	   The rebels trying to unseat Congo's year-old government claim
Kabila has failed to implement democratic reforms and has worsened
ethnic hatred.
	   Among those attending the latest two-day effort were government
ministers of Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, whose armies have backed
Kabila. Congo also sent its defense minister.
	   Also participating were representatives of Uganda and Rwanda,
which supported Kabila's ouster of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last
year.
	   Zambia, which has remained neutral but borders Congo, sent Sampa
to act as chairman.
	   The turmoil in Congo also was on the agenda of the annual
Southern African Development Community summit, scheduled for Monday
in Mauritius.
	   Rebels were not invited because ``this is a meeting of sovereign
states,'' SADC executive secretary Kaire Mbuende said Friday.
Leaders of all 14 member-countries were expected to participate,
including Kabila.

Japanese high court sends territorial case back to lower court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A high court ruled Friday that Japan has
jurisdiction over recently expanded territory waters and can
prosecute a South Korean boat captain for illegally fishing there,
a news report said.
	   The Matsue Branch of the Hiroshima High Court in Shimane
Prefecture, western Japan, overturned the August 1997 dismissal of
a case against Kim Sun Gi, 36, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   The decision sends the case _ part of a larger battle between
Japan and South Korea over fishing rights _ back to a lower
district court. Neither court could be reached late Friday for
comment.
	   Kim was charged with infringing on Japanese waters by fishing
for eels in the Sea of Japan off Hamada, Shimane Prefecture, in
June 1997.
	   The waters where Kim was fishing were beyond Japan's
12-nautical-mile (14-mile or 22.4-kilometer) exclusive fishing zone
established under a 1965 treaty, but within Japanese territorial
waters as unilaterally declared by Japan in January 1997.
	   The lower court had ruled that Japan had no right to prosecute
South Korean boats operating in the new territorial waters because
of the 1965 fisheries pact between Japan and South Korea.
	   But in Friday's high court ruling, Judge Susumu Kakuta said the
area where the fishing boat was operating was within Japanese
territory and that Japan was authorized under international law to
prosecute intruders.
	   Prosecutors had sought a sentence of six months in prison and a
fine of 1.2 million yen (dlrs 9,160) for the alleged incursion and
launched an appeal to the high court after the district court
rejected the case.
	   Kim filed an appeal Friday with the Supreme Court against the
high court ruling, Kyodo reported.
	   Japan declared the territorial waters under the U.N. Convention
of the Law of the Sea, but South Korea has refused to recognize the
declaration and retaliated by allowing its boats to fish freely in
waters close to Japan. Some of those fishermen were arrested and
prosecuted.
	   The two countries are still working on reconciling their fishing
pact with the U.N. convention, which allows countries to set
200-nautical-mile (230 miles or 370 kilometers) exclusive economic
zones around their shores.
	   An official at the South Korean Foreign Affairs and Trade
Ministry in Seoul said the decision was ``regrettable,'' Kyodo
reported.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch banking and insurance
combine ING Groep NV said Friday it will acquire U.S. real estate
asset manager Clarion Partners LLC and its subsidiary CRA Real
Estate Securities for an undisclosed sum.
	   The purchase, which must be approved by regulatory authorities,
will make ING Real Estate the third largest asset manager in the
world with total assets under management of dlrs17 billion, ING
said.
	   ING said it will integrate its existing investment portfolio in
the United States, totaling about dlrs 900 million, into those of
New York-based Clarion.
	   Clarion was founded in 1982 and its assets under management
amount to about dlrs 4.5 billion, while CRA's assets under
management reach about dlrs 1.6 billion.

	   Primakov said he did not have an economic program because he had
only been nominated the day before, but economic reform would
continue.
	   ``Reforms are necessary. The present situation cannot be
overcome without them,'' he said.
	   But at the same time he called for a strong state role in
regulating the economy. ``The govrnment should intervene into the
economic affairs and regulate them. This is not a return to the
administrative and command system,'' he said.
	   He denied this would be a return to Soviet economic control,
instead comparing it to emergency measures taken by the U.S.
government during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
	   ``So what must we do? Repeat the wild capitalism that we had up
till now? Or use the experience of other countries,'' he said.
	   He said the government had to do a much better job running the
country.
	   ``We need to strengthen discipline. We should stop this
sloppiness which now exists in the government,'' he said.
	   Primakov said he wanted representatives of all political parties
in his Cabinet, but warned they should put aside party interests.
	   ``Representatives of all parties should join the Cabinet as
professionals and work as members of a single team. And there
should be no orders from the organizations they belong to.''
	   On foreign policy, Primakov said there would be no confrontation
with the West, but it was vital to defend Russia's national
interests.
	   ``We don't need confrontation, a return to the Cold War. And
that will not happen,'' he said. ``But at the same time we will
strictly defend the interests of the state.''

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hundreds of demonstrators called for holy
war against the Taliban militia here Friday because of the killing
of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan, the official Iranian news
agency reported.
	   ``Death to the Taliban! Shame on Pakistan!'' the protesters
shouted according to the Islamic Republic News Agency.
	   The demonstration was staged by people who just attended Friday
prayers at Tehran University where former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani said that Iran would avenge Taliban's killing of nine
diplomats in northern Afghanistan.
	   ``I condole the martyrs' families and promise them that we will
get revenge for their blood,'' said Rafsanjani, who heads a
government policy-making body.
	   The Taliban said Thursday that bodies of nine Iranian diplomats
were found this week, and admitted that they had been killed by the
religious army's own troops. The disclosure was made in a letter
from the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan. The United Nations condemned the killings.

Biggest Commonwealth Games ever open with bright, brassy spectacle

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The largest Commonwealth Games
ever opened Friday night with brass bands, dazzling fireworks and
waves of dancers at a stadium expected to be packed with 100,000
people.
	   Neither Malaysia's worst economic recession nor a political
threat to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad could dim the inaugural
spectacle as the games came to Asia for the first time.
	   Athletes from 70 countries marched around the track of the Bukit
Jalil Stadium as a card section in the stands neatly scrolled out
each delegation's name. The South African team marched in the
colors and formation of the nation's rainbow flag.
	   Before an audience including International Olympic Committee
president Juan Antonio Samaranch, Britain's Prince Edward read a
message from Queen Elizabeth II, nominal head of the Commonwealth.
	   Then Malaysian King Tuanku Ja'afar formally opened the games,
and punctuated the declaration with three strokes on a gong.
	   Thousands of balloons lifted into the air, fireworks whistled
and burst over the stadium, and a 16-gun salute sounded.
	   The Commonwealth Games claim to be the most important sporting
event after the Summer Olympics. They draw together countries once
linked as parts of the farflung British empire, but now divided by
culture, geography and economic status.
	   Known then as the Empire Games, Commonwealth sports began in
1930 in Hamilton, Canada, with a few dozen athletes from 10
visiting teams. The 1994 event in Victoria, 3,500 kilometers (2,200
miles) west of Hamilton, had 3,200 athletes.
	   Despite a crushing financial crisis, Malaysia has relished its
host role, not relenting in its penchant for superlatives.
	   Even as it scrapped billions of dollars worth of civil works,
dams and railroad projects, it ensured that the event was the
largest ever by insisting on including six new sports.
	   A 1.7 billion ringgit (dlrs 300 million) stadium was completed
just ahead of the games, a commuter rail link was finished and more
than a dozen other sports venues were erected.
	   Mahathir personally ensured a new international airport was
ready to receive athletes and officials.
	   ``Despite the economic downturn in Asia, we have built sports
facilities which are best in the region and comparable to those
found elsewhere in the world,'' Hashim Mohammad Ali, the chief
organizer of the games, said in a speech.
	   The games organizing committee hired 16,000 people to help at
various venues, and some 5,350 police officers and other security
officials were deployed.
	   The opening ceremony itself, involving thousands of
schoolchildren, professional performers and volunteers, was also
perhaps the longest ever.
	   A two-hour cultural show of song, dance, aerobics and brass
bands, began at 5 p.m. (0900 GMT). The actual ceremony started
three hours later and was to last another three hours.
	   Malaysia is counting on dazzling thousands of athletes and
foreign reporters during the 10-day games to help regain some of
its eroded prestige.
	   In recent weeks, Mahathir has grabbed world attention with his
heavy-handed approach to a political challenge from his deputy,
moves to tighten curbs on the local press and reversal of
free-market policies in this nation of 22 million people.
	   The glitter of the games may also help distract attention from
growing worries over business failures and widespread job losses in
the coming months.
	   ``We are treating the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony as a
window to Malaysia. We have done our best,'' Sports Minister
Muhyiddin Yassin told reporters.

MOSCOW: the state.''

	   Primakov was keeping quiet about his likely economic policies.
	   ``I am for consolidation of all political forces and
mobilization of all efforts in order to come out of the crisis and
preserve Russia as a strong state,'' he was quoted as saying by the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   President Boris Yeltsin said a major crisis had been avoided by
compromise and that Primakov had strong backing from all sides. He
called for measures to stabilize prices, restore supplies to shops
and prop up the banking system.
	   ``I understand that it's hard for everyone, but one cannot give
in to emotions ... we'll have to draw lessons from the current
crisis and now we'll have to work on overcoming it,'' Yeltsin said
in a television address to the nation.
	   In a sign that the government wanted broad political support,
Yeltsin nominated Viktor Gerashchenko to head the Central Bank.
Gerashchenko, 60, an ex-head of the Soviet State Bank, headed the
Central Bank for nearly three years until being ousted in October
1994 after the ruble nose dived.
	   Critics blamed Geraschenko for fueling inflation with huge
credits to ailing industry and agriculture. Jeffrey Sachs, a former
economic adviser to the Kremlin, once called him ''the worst
central bank governor in history.''
	   Another ex-Soviet official, Yuri Maslyukov, would likely be
first deputy prime minister for economic affairs, Duma deputies
said. Maslyukov is a technocrat who until recently was trade and
industry minister.
	   Meanwhile, opposition and pro-government political leaders
hailed Primakov's appointment.
	   ``Common sense has prevailed in our state,'' Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov said Thursday. Zyuganov spearheaded the opposition
to the previous candidate for premier, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   Primakov, a former KGB spy chief respected across the political
spectrum, will need to quickly assemble a Cabinet to deal with the
most severe economic crisis since the Soviet collapse. The ruble
has plummeted, industrial production is stagnant and the government
is broke.
	   Despite such deep economic problems, Primakov's nomination
raised hopes on Russia's battered markets. The price of the ruble
was between 10 and 12 to the U.S. dollar _ up from 17 last Friday.
	   Primakov, 68, is seen as a technocrat, non-ideological and loyal
to Yeltsin. The low-key, publicity shy premier appears more
comfortable handling discreet diplomatic negotiations than enduring
the glare of publicity that his new job will bring.
	   As foreign minister, Primakov won praise at home for his efforts
to restore some of Russia's diminished international clout and
create a ``multipolar'' world designed to counterbalance U.S.
dominance.
	   Primakov has cool but cordial relations with the United States.
There has been periodic friction over his desire to ease sanctions
against Iraq, maintain nuclear cooperation with Iran, and resist
NATO's expansion.
	   Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev picked him as one of his
closest aides during the reform period of the late 1980s.
	   He entered the international spotlight at the end of 1990 when,
shortly before the Gulf War began, he made several high-profile
trips to Iraq and tried unsuccessfully to persuade Saddam Hussein
to withdraw from Kuwait.
	   Primakov was briefly first deputy director of the KGB, the main
Soviet security organization in 1991. After the Soviet breakup, he
served as head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service until
Yeltsin named him foreign minister in 1996.
	   Yeltsin settled on Primakov after parliament twice rejected
Chernomyrdin, with opposition leaders vowing to vote him down again
on a third and final vote.
	   Chernomyrdin served five years as prime minister before Yeltsin
fired him last March. Many Russians blame him for the country's
economic problems.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wall Street was off to a shaky start Friday amid
a global selling spree that included the biggest decline of the
year by Tokyo's blue-chip stocks.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, down 248.48 points Thursday,
was off an additional 96.30 in the early going, then shot up to a
gain of 117.40, before giving up some of the gains. By midmorning,
it was up 46.08 at 7,661.62 in heavy trading.
	   The technology-heavy Nasdaq index was rising sharply, however,
helped by encouraging earnings statements from Intel Corp. and

Havel lobbying for new RFE broadcast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel is trying
to persuade his Cabinet to drop objections to planned Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty broadcasts to Iran and Iraq, a spokesman said
Friday.
	   The U.S. government-funded radio station, which operates out of
Prague, intends to start its broadcasts by the end of September.
But the Cabinet of Milos Zeman expressed its doubts last month
about the program's objectivity and potential terrorist risks for
the Czech Republic.
	   It remains unclear whether the government would move to actively
block the broadcasts.
	   Havel stepped in after receiving a letter Tuesday from U.S. Rep.
Benjamin A. Gilman, the New York Republican who chairs the House
International Relations Committee, urging the president to help.
	   ``My colleagues and I thus very much hope you will work with
Prime Minister Zeman ... to ensure that RFE/RL will be able to
begin its broadcasts to Iran and Iraq this fall,'' said the letter,
published Friday by the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes.
	   Havel spokesman Ladislav Spacek said the president spoke to
Zeman and Foreign Minister Jan Kavan on the issue. Havel was unable
to immediately change the Cabinet's position, but the aide
indicated the government seemed unlikely to block the broadcasts.
	   Spacek said Havel will meet with Gilman within a debate forum
planned during his five-day official trip to the United States
starting next Tuesday.
	   ``The president made it clear he is in favor of the broadcast
and now it's up to the (Czech) government to take the next step,''
Spacek said.
	   The agreement to start the controversial broadcasts was made
between U.S. authorities and the previous government of Josef
Tosovsky.
	   Zeman expects an official request from the U.S. government
asking for permission to go ahead. He also plans to monitor the
broadcasts for objectivity until the end of the year.

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Two armed gunmen pumped 13 bullets into a
consultant for a popular cable network in India's film city Friday,
killing him instantly, police said.
	   The assailants accosted Ram Punjabi as he was getting into his
car in the driveway of his home in northwest Bombay. The car driver
received gunshot wounds and was hospitalized, police said.
	   The killers escaped after the crime. The motive for Punjabi's
murder was not known.
	   In Bombay, the rich and famous of the entertainment and
construction industry have been targeted by gangs demanding
protection money, and some have been killed for refusing to pay up.
But Punjabi is not known to have received any such threats, police
said.
	   Last year, Gulshan Kumar, a wealthy Indian film music magnate,
was murdered and the killing was allegedly organized by a music
composer who felt Lumar was trying to end his career.
	   Nadeem Akhtar, the accused, fled to London where he is fighting
a court battle against his extradition to India for trial.

 &UR; Clinton worries, perplexes Asians, Europeans &QL;

	   LONDON (AP) _ Asians worried that the U.S. presidential crisis
could further destabilize the world economy. Russians had woes of
their own. And some Frenchmen wondered why a leader might lose his
office over a fling.
	   From Auckland to Amsterdam, commentators and common folks
gloomily watched the political drama surrounding U.S. President
Bill Clinton unfold on television, on the Internet and in the
press, as Congress opened debate on the report by special
prosecutor Kenneth Starr.
	   ``There is no doubt that a weakened presidency, its energy to
deal with global issues sapped, is bad news for the world,'' said
an editorial in Singapore's Straits Times newspaper.
	   ``Even if Clinton survives, his presidency is already dead,''
wrote the Washington correspondent of the Italian daily La
Repubblica. ``The forecasts for autumn aren't good: tempest over
Washington, rain on all of us.''
	   In Australia, Clinton's troubles knocked that country's national
election campaign off the front pages of newspapers, and were the
lead item of television and radio bulletins.
	   ``Two dark vans that drove (the report) to the Capitol were akin
to hearses arriving to take away the corpse of the Clinton
presidency,'' wrote the U.S. correspondent of The Sydney Morning
Herald.
	   Some stood by the American president, despite the erosion of
political support for Clinton in the United states.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he still regarded Clinton
as a ``very close friend and ally,'' and his office said he
intended to travel to the United Nations and meet with the U.S.
president there as planned later this month.
	   In Asia, Europe and the Middle East, papers and people expressed
disbelief that Clinton's extramarital sexual relations with Monica
Lewinsky, and attempts to cover them up, should have so weakened
what many regard as a politically successful president.
	   In Tokyo, housewife Ayako Sugi called it ``a personal matter. So
long as he can do the job right, that's OK. I don't know if he
should resign. Things are going well in the America.''
	   ``I don't want a world recession,'' she said. ``And that could
happen if he does get impeached, given how bad things are
already.''
	   Those sentiments were echoed in Paris by Jean Loup Demignieux,
international director of France Television.
	   ``We always like to know who is with who, but we don't think it
is in any way related to his job and his public life,'' Demignieux
said.
	   French newspapers were less forgiving.
	   ``The Clinton affair creates a climate of crisis in the world,''
the daily Le Monde said in a front-page headline. Le Figaro called
the matter ``a sad affair of sex in bad taste which goes beyond
anything one could have imagined.''
	   In France, as in many other countries, the intimate lives of
politicians are not newspaper fodder. Early on in the
Clinton-Lewinsky affair, many French people considered the issue a
private one. Former French President Francois Mitterrand had a
wife, a lover and out of wedlock daughter born before he became
president _ an open secret.
	   In China, where the private lives of the secretive Communist
Party leaders are off-limits, government-controlled reports on the
scandal have been matter-of-fact.
	   Despite the official silence, Chinese leaders and foreign policy
experts expresed concern that the crisis might imperil the
rapprochement Clinton and President Jiang Zemin symbolized in their
recent summit in Beijing.
	   ``China is very concerned. Many people here consider that steady
bilateral relations need a strong president,'' said Jin Canrong, an
America expert at the government-backed Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.
	   Russian media carried scant word of the events in Washington,
concentrating instead on the ongoing political and economic crisis
at home.
	   Likewise in Malaysia, papers focused on the government's own sex
scandal involving its sacked deputy prime minister, and frantic
preparations for Friday night's opening ceremonies of the 16th
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur.
	   And in Indonesia, many people questioned in downtown Jakarta
said they were unaware of the Washington scandal, which their
newspapers mostly ignored Friday, devoting attention instead to
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years.

Police seize large quantity of Albanian marijuana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Authorities confiscated a total of 438
kilograms (965.6 pounds) of marijuana in two separate operations
over the past week, police announced Friday.
	   Authorities on Tuesday arrested four men, all Albanian
nationals, just north of the capital when they allegedly attempted
to hire an undercover police officer to transport just over 287
kilograms (632 pounds) of marijuana packaged in 82 packets ready
for distribution, the announcement said.
	   In a separate incident, police arrested two Greek men and were
searching for four Albanians following a surveillance operation
during which they confiscated 151 kilograms (333 pounds) of
marijuana following a tip-off, authorities stated.

Zimbabwe modifies plan for land seizures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Pressured by donor countries, the
government on Friday eased its plan to take farmland from whites
and give it to landless blacks.
	   In a dramatic gesture, President Robert Mugabe's administration
struck 512 farms off the list of 1,400 properties comprising 5
million hectares (12 million acres) it had targeted for
nationalization over five years. The amount of land the 512 farms
comprises was not immediately disclosed, but it was expected to be
significant.
	   Rural Development Minister John Nkomo told an aid conference of
representatives of some 40 nations that the government would heed
the demands of donor nations and institutions for transparency and
better economic management of the land redistribution plan.
	   Nkomo said there was no going back on land redistribution to
blacks in a nation where about 4,000 whites own a third of the
land. But Nkomo declared aid donors would be fully consulted during
a 24-month ``inception period'' when the government planned to
resettle landless blacks ``with an appropriate aptitude for
agriculture'' on 1 million hectares (2.4 million acres) of land.
	   Western financial institutions who have pumped aid into Zimbabwe
have demanded guarantees that farm production and investor
confidence not be harmed by land seizures. Aid donors also want
land reform to honor constitutional and ownership rights, including
payment of compensation linked to the market value of land, before
they will provide aid.
	   However, no change was announced Friday in the government's plan
to pay only for buildings and improvements on seized land. The
government argues that whites don't deserve compensation for the
land itself because it had been taken from blacks in the colonial
era by mostly British settlers.
	   Officials said donors, during closed-door meetings, called for
the formation of an independent agency to handle funds and the
selection of farms suitable for acquisition.
	   Jos Schellar, representing Holland, said his nation was willing
to support the government's commitment to ``a step by step approach
that would be more efficient and cost effective.''
	   Since independence in 1980, some 70,000 black families have been
resettled on former white-owned farms, but the program has been
plagued by delays, mismanagement and corruption, with some
properties going to politicians and their cronies.

Seibu Lions beat league leading Nippon Ham Fighters 7-3
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Pinch-hitter Rudy Pemberton hit a three-run home
run to lead the Seibu Lions to a 7-3 win over the Nippon Ham
Fighters at the Seibu Dome on Friday.
	   The Lions have now edged within 0.5 games of the Pacific League
leading Fighters, who have lost their last three games.
	   The Fighters were leading 2-1 for the first three innings, but a
two-base hit by Tatsuya Ozeki tied the game and a sacrifice fly to
center by Ken Suzuki added the run that put Seibu ahead for good.
	   The first home run of the season for Pemberton, formerly with
the Boston Red Sox, followed in the fourth inning.
	   Fumiya Nishiguchi allowed only three runs in 6 2/3 innings to
improve to 10 wins.
	   At Fukuoka Dome, outfielder Arihito Muramatsu had a three-base
hit in the sixth as the Daiei Hawks beat the Kintetsu Buffaloes
5-4. Kazuhiro Takeda chalked up his league-leading 13th win.
	   In Kobe, Toshiyuki Goto (3-1) pitched a shutout to give the
Chiba Lotte Marines a 5-0 win against the Orix BlueWave. Mark
Mimbs, formerly of Triple-A Norfolk got the loss.
	   In the only game in Central League action, Hiroshima hurler
Nathan Minchey, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, held Yakult to
just one run in nine innings for his 13th win, as the Carp beat the
Swallows 2-1.

Nana Rawlings refutes drug smuggling reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Testifying in court for the first time,
Ghana's first lady Nana Konadu Rawlings denied four-year-old
newspaper allegations that she was linked to drug and gold
smuggling in the West African country.
	   ``I thought about it seriously and realized that ... there have
been calculated attempts to discredit me,'' Rawlings said during
testimony at the Accra circuit court on Thursday.
	   She was giving evidence at the trial of former newspaper editor
Eden Quarcoo, who is charged with libel for printing the
accusations against the wife of President Jerry Rawlings in the
bi-weekly Free Press on December 3, 1994.
	   The allegations that Mrs. Rawlings were involved in drug and
gold smuggling were originally published in the U.S.-based magazine
African Observer.
	   Mrs. Rawlings said she was angry and upset for some time after
the story emerged, adding the matter had been ``very embarrassing
and damaging'' to her reputation.
	   In another related court case, two other newspaper editors were
in July sentenced to 30 days in prison for publishing details of
the matter.
	   Kwaku Baako Jr., editor of The Guide and Abdul Harruna Atta,
editor of The Statesman, were also fined dlrs 4,500 following their
conviction on contempt charges.
	   Earlier in the year, the two editors disregarded a court order
forbidding publication of details surrounding Mrs. Rawlings'
lawsuits.

British condemn murder of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iran-Afghanistan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain on Friday condemned the killing of Iranian
diplomats in Afghanistan, but urged Iran to seek a peaceful
settlement to the conflict.
	   The bodies of the nine diplomats were found Wednesday. The
Iranians vanished when the ruling Taliban religious militia seized
the northern Afghanistan city of Mazar-e-Sharif from rival forces
on Aug. 8.
	   After denying any involvement in the disappearances for a month,
the Taliban claimed responsibility for the deaths of nine of 11
missing diplomats in a letter Thursday from the supreme leader,
Mullah Omar, to United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   In London on Friday, Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett
expressed ``outrage'' at the confirmation from the Taliban ``that
the diplomats missing from the Iranian Consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif
have been murdered.''
	   ``We offer our sympathy and condolences to the Iranian
government and the families of the victims,'' he said in a
statement.``These murders deserve universal condemnation. We hope
that those responsible will quickly be brought to justice.''
	   In its letter to Annan, Omar said the Taliban, ``while
expressing sadness, announces thats the nine Iranian workers who
entered Mazar-e-Sharif during the war, either intentionally or
unintentionally, have been killed by unidentified soldiers,'' of
the Taliban. He stressed that the soldiers acted on their own.
	   There was no word on the fate of two other diplomats.
	   Fatchett, citing a United Nations Security Council resolution,
said ``any foreign interference in the Afghan conflict is
unacceptable,'' and urged Iran to proceed carefully.
	   ``We hope that Iran will use its influence in Afghanistan to
obtain a peaceful settlement,'' he said. ``We will do all we can to
support this.''
	   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban, who control 90 percent of
Afghanistan, have increased in recent weeks as Tehran demanded the
return of its diplomats.

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A Swissair plane with 151 people on
board on Friday was involved in a near miss with a KLM jumbo jet in
the skies over Ireland, a spokesman for the Swiss company said.
	   A collision was avoided thanks to electronic warning devices,
said Swissair spokesman Erwin Schaerer. He said there were no
injuries.
	   The plane involved was a MD-11 _ the same type as the one which
crashed in Canada last week, killing all 229 on board.
	   There were no immediate further details on Friday's incident.

One Russian's strange problem _ too much cash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos available &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Larisa Miasnikova has a uniquely Russian problem:
a plastic bag stuffed with cash is sitting atop her desk, and she
doesn't know what to do with it.
	   If this were a normal economy, Miasnikova, a shoe store owner,
would give thanks for the recent buying binge that's cleaned out
her shop and make haste for the nearest bank.
	   But Russia's latest emergency has further skewered an economy
that was already badly contorted, and Miasnikova's choices are
actually quite complicated and fraught with risk.
	   ``I don't know what I'm going to do,'' said Miasnikova. Her odd
personal dilemma is one of countless mini-dramas unfolding as
Russians try to improvise their way through the current turmoil.
	   The seemingly sensible bank option is a potential booby trap.
Banks have been freezing or restricting accounts, and she might
never see the money again if she deposits it.
	   She needs to restock her store, but the imported shoes she buys
are suddenly two or three times more expensive due to the country's
currency devaluation.
	   The third obvious choice is to convert the rubles to U.S.
dollars. But the jitterbug currency has been crashing _ and
sometimes rising _ by the hour. Miasnikova feels she'd get burned
by changing currencies at such a volatile time.
	   So the stash of rubles remains on her desk, growing larger and
yet perversely losing value on most days.
	   ``If this doesn't end soon, small businesses like this will be
ruined,'' she said.
	   Russia's turmoil has produced all sorts of economic quirks, and
Russians have learned to adapt during these recurring crises. They
gripe, they curse and they shake their heads in disgust at their
inept leaders. But they don't waste time panicking as they struggle
to stay a step ahead of the next currency fluctuation or an
imminent toilet paper shortage.
	   Through bitter experience, they've learned one lesson well: when
the currency sinks and inflation is on the horizon, you dash to the
stores and buy everything you can.
	   Since the crisis hit in mid-August, many Russians have been
shopping as if it were the day before Christmas.
	   First they vacuumed up the staples such as flour, sugar, salt
and oil. Then they bought clothes and shoes, and even household
appliances. Jewelry has also been popular because of the notion
that gold will hold its value.
	   Russians who had dollar savings traded in the greenbacks and
found themselves briefly in a shopper's paradise. Last month each
dollar was fetching only six rubles. They were worth as much as 20
rubles at the beginning of this week, and are now hovering around
10.
	   But the bubble has burst. Old prices are vanishing as stores
sell out and new stocks are often two or three times higher.
	   Inflation, which was at less than 1 percent a month, leapt to 15
percent in August. In just the first week of September, it was 36
percent.
	   In these grim conditions, Alexander, a large, burly man with a
full black beard, is near the end of his tether.
	   A relatively well-off businessman, he's part of the impatient
crowd that gathers each morning outside Most Bank, hoping to
withdraw his savings. So far, he's claimed dlrs 10,000 of the
13,000 in his account.
	   He was allowed to take out dlrs 1,000 a day initially. Then the
limit was cut to dlrs 500. A day earlier, he wasn't allowed to
touch his money.
	   ``The bank doesn't even bother to give you an explanation,''
said Alexander, 42, who declined to give his last name. When the
rest of his money is in hand, he's flying to Germany to set up a
bank account there.
	   ``I'll never put my money in a Russian bank again,'' he said.
	   At least Alexander still has some cash.
	   Millions of Russians haven't been received their salaries for
months, and one of the great mysteries of the crisis is why these
people haven't taken to the streets.
	   One-day strikes are common, but sustained walkouts are rare
aside from the motley group of coal miners who have established a
makeshift tent camp just outside the White House, the main
government building.
	   Over the past three months, the strikers have received loads of
press coverage and home-cooked meals. But they haven't seen their
wages.
	   With little to pass the time, the miners have taken up
landscaping.
	   They've turned some dirt to give the appearance of a freshly dug
grave. Tree branches have been turned into a wooden cross, and a
makeshift tombstone has the name ``B.N. Yeltsin'' painted in red.
	   As a finishing touch, dozens of empty vodka bottles, the necks
planted into the ground, encircle the mock grave site.
	   ``We're going to continue fighting for our salaries,'' said
Vladimir Potishny, the strike leader. ``We have nowhere else to go.
We have nothing left to lose.''

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Six major European soccer clubs will take part in
UEFA's bid to reform its club competitions and stave off a
breakaway European Super League, the governing body of European
soccer said Friday.
	   Senior officials from Italy's Juventus, England's Liverpool,
Germany's Bayern Munich, Ajax Amsterdam in the Netherlands, FC
Porto of Portugal and France's Olympique Lyonnais will all attend
the first meeting of a specially-created task force on Monday in
Geneva.
	   Senior UEFA officials and representatives from national leagues
in England, Germany and Italy will also sit on the 14-member panel.
	   UEFA created the task force to find ways of restructuring its
tournaments in response to plans by Italy's Media Partners company
to start up a European ``super league'' competition. The committee
is due to make initial recommendations before Christmas.

U.S sees allies getting ready for action without UN nod
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RETRANSMITTING to correct attribution to senior NATO diplomat &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The U.S. administration sees a growing
readiness in the NATO alliance for military action against Serbia
even without prior approval from the United Nations, a senior NATO
diplomat said Friday.
	   The allies have been prevented from taking a more forceful
stance over Kosovo by divisions over whether U.N. blessing is
needed for military action to halt President Slobodan Milosevic's
crackdown on the rebellion by ethnic Albanians.
	   In recent months, NATO has repeatedly threatened to use force
and laid extensive plans for punitive military action while
Milosevic's operations in Kosovo continued unabated, creating some
265,000 refugees.
	   However, France, in particular, has insisted a NATO campaign be
endorsed beforehand by the U.N. Security Council. Russia, opposed
to such intervention, could use its veto it.
	   The diplomat said talks the United States has had with officials
in France, Germany, Britain and other allies in recent weeks
revealed a hardening of views toward Milosevic and a desire not to
be held hostage by a Russian `no' in the U.N. Security Council.
	   ``Things are coming to a head,'' said the NATO diplomat, who
asked not to be identified.
	   ``No ally wants to see NATO blocked by the need to get a United
Nations mandate. Serbian security forces are still on the offensive
(in) actions that go beyond teaching the KLA a lesson.''
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence for
Kosovo, a Serbian province where 90 percent of the population is
ethnic Albanian.
	   The NATO diplomat predicted a continued ``accumulation of
horror'' in Kosovo will spark the allies into military action.
	   The official said Washington was winning the argument NATO can
pursue military action against Milosevic outside of the United
Nations.
	   In Washington's view, said the diplomat, one legal basis could
be the threat that fighting in Kosovo poses for stability in
Albania and other neighbors.
	   This week, NATO completed planning for military operations in
and around Kosovo aimed at forcing Milosevic and Kosovo Albanians
to sit down and negotiate a peaceful solution to their conflict.
	   NATO has worked out three basic options:
	   - A preventive deployment of NATO troops in Albania along the
border with Kosovo.
	   - Air operations inside Yugoslavia, both limited and full scale.
	   - Deployment of ground troops backed by air power to support a
cease-fire or a peace agreement for Kosovo. That could involve as
many as 60,000 troops. Such operations could involve both NATO and
non-member countries.

Motorola buys bankrupt Slovak factory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Motorola officials signed a contract
for the purchase of a bankrupt telecommunications components
factory in western Slovakia, media reported Friday.
	   The U.S. firm purchased the former Teslapiestany in the town of
Piestany, 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of the capital,
Bratislava.
	   Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Illinois, did not disclose the
purchase price.
	   The factory, which has been renamed Slovakia Electronics
Industries, will produce semiconductors.
	   The components made in Slovakia will be exported to Motorola
customers.
	   ``The official start of production at the plant is planned for
the beginning of the year,'' said Vaclav Smid, Motorola's director
of market development for the Czech and Slovak republics.
	   Motorola plans to invest dlrs 90 million into restructuring the
company, Smid said, and the company will employ 1,500 people.
	   He said that within five to seven years, the company plans to
annually export components worth dlrs 60 million.
	   Motorola is the first company to take advantage of new 10-year
tax holidays that went into effect July 1 and are designed to get
foreign companies to set up export-oriented factories in Slovakia.

Kenya to resume loan talks with IMF
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MBAGATHI, Kenya (AP) _ The government and the International
Monetary Fund will resume negotiations aimed at restoring a dlrs
220 million loan suspended last year to force economic reforms, the
finance minister said Friday.
	   ``As a government, we are happy that all outstanding issues with
the IMF have been resolved and negotiations should begin soon,''
Simeon Nyachae said.
	   The IMF suspended the loan in August 1997, citing the
government's failure to meet conditions including aggressive
efforts to fight high-level corruption, improvements in tax
collection and better management of public funds.
	   In addition to regaining loans from the IMF, the government
needs IMF approval to collect dlrs 506 million in loans from
multilateral and bilateral institutions for development projects
included in the 1998/99 budget.
	   Nyachae spoke at a meeting the government called to explain
measures it is taking to recharge an economy damaged mostly by the
government's failure to properly manage public funds.
	   President Daniel arap Moi was chairman of Friday's meeting,
which was attended by members of Parliament, business executives,
diplomats and representatives of the multilateral lending agencies,
including the World Bank and the IMF.
	   Nyachae said the government has improved tax collections by
strengthening the Kenya Revenue Authority, liberalizing the
telecommunications sector and is fighting graft through the Kenya
Anticorruption Authority.
	   Nyachae said IMF officials were expected in Kenya next week.
	   The issue of corruption is bound to be tricky because Moi last
month suspended Haroun Mwau, the anti-graft authority director, and
named a commission to investigate his conduct.
	   Mwau, a successful businessman, was suspended after obtaining an
arrest warrant for four senior treasury and tax department
officials and 11 lower-ranking officials.
	   Mwau accused the officials of failing to collect dlrs 3.8
million in duties on imported wheat and sugar.
	   Some participants at the meeting Friday questioned the
government's determination to fight graft.
	   Paul Muite, leader of the opposition Safina party, challenged
Moi to dismiss one of his assistant ministers accused of diverting
sugar in transit to the local market.

Rome prosecutor asks to dismiss charges against ex-Nazi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A military prosecutor has concluded that there is
not enough evidence to seek trial for Nazi officer Erich Priebke
for a wartime massacre of 14 civilians on the outskirts of Rome,
Italian news reports said Friday.
	   Prosecutor Antonino Intelisano said in his ruling that the
evidence collected during preliminary investigations does not
warrant indictment of Priebke, who was tried and convicted by a
military court in Rome earlier this year for another massacre, the
ANSA and AGI news agencies said.
	   The ruling Friday referred to the killing of 14 men on June 4,
1944. The victims had been taken from jails in Rome run by the Nazi
forces then occupying Rome and taken to the town of La Storta, just
north of the capital, and shot. Among them was a union leader,
Bruno Buozzi.
	   Priebke, who was working in the Nazi jails at that time, helped
transport the prisoners but did not attend the actual executions,
according to Intelisano.
	   A Rome judge must now decide whether or not to indict Priebke.
	   Priebke, 86, was convicted earlier this year for the 1944
Ardeatine Caves massacre of 335 civilians and sentenced to life in
prison. Because of poor health and his age, he has been allowed to
serve the sentence in a house in Rome.

Clinton shows the remorse that was lacking for so long
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With-US-Clinton; US-Clinton-Congress &QL; 
 &UR; By RON FOURNIER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Political Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Gone was the angry Bill Clinton who waved his
finger in denial and showed more pique than apology.
	   Emotional, compelling and contrite, he told religious leaders
Friday: ``I have sinned. ... I have repented.'' His eyes were
moist, his voice choking, as he talked about the ``rock bottom
truth'' of his transgressions, vowed to change his lifestyle and
expressed hope that some day he'll be worthy of a child's
admiration.
	   But on this day, the first of what promise to be many ugly days
on the road to possible impeachment, the president's performance
left unanswered the question: Is it too late?
	   Clinton, addressing the annual National Prayer Breakfast, said
his sorrow was genuine, not just for his family, friends, staff,
Cabinet and the American people, but also for Monica Lewinsky and
her family.
	   It was the first time he had expressed any remorse for dragging
the former White House intern not half his age into a presidential
affair.
	   For the first time, he admitted he had a problem and promised to
seek ``pastoral support'' and help from others.
	   For the first time, he provided a wholehearted expression of
contrition without a hint of the anger embedded in the Aug. 17
speech in which he first acknowledged the affair. Even when he
promised an aggressive defense strategy, Clinton avoided
blame-shifting.
	   ``I will instruct my lawyers to mount a vigorous defense using
all available and appropriate arguments,'' he said. ``But legal
language must not obscure the fact that I have done wrong.''
	   Clinton has balked at such language for months. He might have
softened the blow of Kenneth Starr's investigation if he had
publicly repented in January, when news of the inquiry first
leaked. He might have shored up Democratic support if he had been
more contrite on Aug. 17.
	   He could have avoided the whole mess if, instead of becoming
involved with Ms. Lewinsky, he had recognized the potential impact
of such recklessness. Finally, he has.
	   ``The children of this country can learn in a profound way that
integrity is important and selfishness is wrong,'' Clinton said,
holding himself up as an example of how not to conduct a life.
	   Perhaps now he can be a lesson to children, Clinton said: Even
the president of the United States pays in some way for dishonor
and selfishness.
	   He recalled again a conversation with a child in Florida this
week. The boy wanted to grow up to be president _ just like
Clinton. Just like Clinton? Even the president realizes he is a
flawed model, at least for now.
	   ``But God can change us,'' he told the ministers, ``and make us
strong at the broken places.''

Volkswagen announces fund for ex-slave laborers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with VW saying Peres and former Austrian chancellor
signaling willingness to participate in fund; New quotes from
lawyer and dispute over number of slave laborers at VW; German
lawyer saying he'll wait for more details &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Facing lawsuits in the United States and threats
of more at home, Volkswagen approved a 20 million mark (dlrs 12
million) fund Friday to compensate former slave laborers forced to
work for the company by the Nazis during World War II.
	   The German automaker said it was ``morally called upon'' to
``provide humanitarian relief'' to former forced laborers, while
stressing it believed it was under no legal obligation to do so.
	   The first payments from the fund, to be administered by the
accounting firm KPMG, will be made ``before the end of the year,''
VW said in a statement issued in Wolfsburg.
	   Spokesman Klaus Kocks told reporters former Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres and former Austrian Chancellor Franz
Vranitzky have signaled willingness to help oversee the fund.
	   But an attorney involved in a lawsuit filed against VW last week
in New Jersey called the size of the fund ``insulting'' and said
his legal action would continue.
	   New York lawyer Ed Fagan, who together with a German partner
represents some 30,000 Holocaust survivors, demanded VW provide a
list of slave laborers who worked for it and acknowledge a legal
debt to them.
	   ``What they keep doing is trying to confuse charity with a legal
obligation,'' said Fagan, who was traveling in Jerusalem. ``These
companies have a legal obligation to pay the slaves they abused and
killed. ...
	   ``They are not going to buy these people off and their memory is
not going to be silent.''
	   VW estimates 17,000 forced laborers worked in its factories
between 1941 and the end of the war _ although Fagan said the
number is much higher.
	   Like many other German firms, Volkswagen maintains it has no
legal obligation to compensate them, arguing it was forced to
employ slave laborers by the Nazis.
	   But VW broke ranks with the bulk of German industry in July,
becoming the first major German firm to announce a fund to give
``humanitarian aid'' directly to survivors.
	   The automaker's supervisory board approved the details Friday.
	   A statement issued after the board meeting said Volkswagen ``is
engaged in discussions with prominent persons'' to set up a council
to determine the amount of individual payments. It said fund
administrators would announce shortly where former forced laborers
can apply.
	   Lawsuits and threatened lawsuits have raised the pressure on
German firms to address the claims of concentration camp inmates,
mostly Jews, forced to work in their factories.
	   Some companies recently suggested they'd be willing to
contribute to a publicly administered fund, but Chancellor Helmut
Kohl has rejected any government involvement.
	   German attorney Klaus von Muenchhausen threatened early this
year to file a lawsuit on behalf of 30 Hungarian Jews forced to
work for Volkswagen, but held off after VW announced it would set
up a fund.
	   He told German television Friday he would wait to learn how much
individual payments will be before deciding his next step.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ A senior dissident army officer and nine
of his followers were arrested Friday as upheavals continued in
this mountainous kingdom over the results of the general elections
in May.
	   The 10 resisted arrest and were put into a maximum security
prison, said Colette Mason, an official with the British Embassy in
Maseru, the capital.
	   South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said in Pretoria,
South Africa's capital, that there appeared to be a revolt in the
Lesotho army, the South African Press Association reported. The
news agency reported a lot of troop movement in Maseru.
	   However, Mason said neither she nor British Ambassador Peter
Smith had seen unusual troop movements.
	   The Britsh ambassador's residence is near the barracks where the
arrests occurred, and that area, as well as downtown Maseru,
appeared calm Friday evening, Mason said.
	   King Letsie III had reportedly ordered the arrest of the senior
officer, who was not immediately identified. The reason for the
arrest was unclear. Government offices were closed and no one was
answering the telephone there.
	   Lesotho, a country of 2 million people surrounded by South
Africa, has a turbulent past.
	   In early 1994, an army rebellion killed Deputy Prime Minister
Selometsi Baholo. The following August, King Letsie _ the current
king's late father _ dismissed the government, then restored it a
month later after mediation by southern African diplomats.
	   Supporters of the three main opposition parties claim the
election last May was rigged in favor of the ruling party, which
won 79 of 80 seats in the National Assembly.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Six major soccer clubs will take part in UEFA's
bid to reform its club competitions and stave off a breakaway
European Super League, the governing body of European soccer said
Friday.
	   Senior officials from Italy's Juventus, England's Liverpool,
Germany's Bayern Munich, Ajax Amsterdam in the Netherlands, FC
Porto of Portugal and France's Olympique Lyonnais will all attend
the first meeting of a specially-created task force on Monday in
Geneva.
	   Senior UEFA officials and representatives from national leagues
in England, Germany and Italy will also sit on the 14-member panel.
	   UEFA created the task force to find ways of restructuring its
tournaments in response to plans by Italy's Media Partners company
to start up a European ``super league'' competition. The committee
is due to make initial recommendations before Christmas.

Hard-pressed Pakistan opens debate on accepting nuclear test ban

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan will not sign a nuclear test
ban treaty until crippling economic sanctions are lifted, the
foreign minister said Friday, after a frustrated and nearly
powerless opposition walked out of a parliamentary debate claiming
the government had already decided to sign the pact.
	   Tough international sanctions have strained Pakistan's economy
to the breaking point, after the nation of 130 million people
tested six nuclear devices in May in response to similar tests by
its hostile neighbor India. Pakistan desperately needs
international loans, which appear to hinge on its signing the
treaty.
	   Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz, however, said Friday that his
government would not sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty until
the sanctions have been lifted.
	   ``We will not accept the CTBT under an atmosphere of coercion.
The economic sanctions and pressures must be removed before we
adhere to the Treaty,'' Aziz said.
	   Regardless of whether Pakistan signs, he said ``We are a nuclear
state and will remain so in future.''
	   Key donors, including the United States, Japan, the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund, cut off Pakistan to protest
the tests. That left Pakistan desperately short of foreign currency
and in danger of defaulting on its September payments on dlrs 32
billion in debt.
	   The two South Asian nations have fought three wars since 1947,
so their nuclear tests caused alarm that they could actually use
atomic weapons. India also faces sanctions, but has so far refused
to sign the treaty.
	   Parliament's joint treaty debate, expected to continue into next
week, opens the same day as a team from the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank arrived in the capital of Islamabad to
discuss an economic bailout package for Pakistan.
	   Publicly, the government insists that it cannot be coerced into
signing the treaty, although the Pakistani news media says the
government has already decided to sign.
	   ``We will make this decision in accordance with the wishes of
parliament and the wishes of the Pakistani people,'' said Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif as he entered Parliament for Friday's opening
session of the hastily called debate. ``We will not make this
decision under any (outside) pressure.''
	   Proponents of nuclear testing filled the streets after May's
test blasts, celebrating Pakistan's closure of the arms gap with
India and its joining the world's nuclear powers.
	   Mainstream political parties appear to favor the treaty.
However, the opposition was furious over what they claimed was a
government bid to slip the treaty through in a hastily called
joint-session of parliament. Without enough seats in parliament to
stop the ruling Pakistan Muslim League, opposition parties
routinely walk out of sessions in protest.
	   ``I am really amazed and appalled that the decision on the CTBT
has already been taken by the government,'' said Raza Rabbani, a
leading member of the opposition Pakistan People's Party. ``They
want to use the parliament as a rubber stamp.''
	   The government has said it wants a broad national consensus on
the treaty, but expects opposition from small but influential
right-wing religious parties. The government has also assured the
public that a promise not to test weapons does not stop nuclear
weapons development.
	   The IMF stalled the last payment of a dlrs 1.5 billion loan and
credits package after the nuclear tests. Pakistan this week
resorted to signing a dlrs 1.5 billion bailout deal with the
Islamic Development Bank, at a crippling interest rate of more than
10 percent.
	   Since that is not enough, the country hopes for a dlrs 2.5
billion IMF and World Bank package, in exchange for government
spending cuts, tax hikes and privatization of state industries.
	   The most important condition, however, appears to be the test
ban treaty, or CTBT.
	   ``Apparently, Islamabad is going to sign the CTBT for a mere
financial bailout package,'' Islamabad's The Nation newspaper said
Friday. ``No one knows, clearly, however, what benefits Pakistan
will accrue out of this deal under tremendous pressure from the
United States except burdening the economy with more loans.''

Libya responds to trial offer in Lockerbie bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Libya has made contact with the United Nations
about the plan by the United States and Britain to try the
Lockerbie bombing suspects in The Hague under Scottish law,
Britain's Foreign Office said Friday.
	   Details of the response, in the form of a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, were not known, said Nev Johnson, a
Foreign Office spokesman.
	   ``We know Kofi Annan had some sort of paper given to him,''
Johnson said. ``We don't know what's in the paper.''
	   The Guardian newspaper in Britain reported that the letter from
Libyan Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser sought clarification of
how the trial would be conducted.
	   Approved unanimously by the U.N. Security Council last month,
the plan represents a further bid to bring to trial the two Libyans
accused of planting the bomb that blew up the Pan Am jet over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270.
	   The plans calls for the suspects to be transferred to Dutch
custody for a trial in the Netherlands conducted by Scottish
judges. If the men are convicted, they will serve their time in a
British prison.
	   Both Washington and London have said the offer is
``non-negotiable.'' They dropped a demand last month that the
suspects be tried in either the United States or Britain.
	   Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for failing to
hand over the suspects, Abdel Baset Ali Mohamed al-Megrahi and
Lamen Khalifa Fhimah.

 &UR; Killing of Hamas fugitives triggers violent chain reaction &QL;

 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A volley of shots fired in a remote West Bank
cottage set off a violent chain reaction Friday that threatened to
scotch Washington's latest Mideast peace mission.
	   The bullets fired by Israeli troops in a raid of a Hamas hideout
killed two top fugitives sought for planning terror attacks. Vowing
retaliation, Islamic militants said they would detonate bombs in
the Jewish state. Hundreds of Hamas supporter took to the streets,
clamoring for revenge, and threw stones at Israeli soldiers.
	   Troops sprayed one group of protesters in the West Bank town of
El Bireh with rubber bullets, injuring five people.
	   The army also sealed the West Bank and Gaza Strip, fanning
Palestinian resentment already running high over the 17-month
stalemate in talks on an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   Despite the rising tensions, U.S. envoy Dennis Ross on Friday
pressed on with efforts to narrow the gaps between Israel and the
Palestinians. He met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai. Asked how the negotiations were
going, Mordechai said: ``Slowly, slowly.''
	   One of the main stumbling blocks is Israel's demand to
renegotiate an understanding on security cooperation worked out in
December by Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. officials.
	   The document serves, among other things, as a blueprint for a
Palestinian crackdown on Hamas. Netanyahu rejected the initial deal
as insufficient.
	   However, Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said after a
meeting with Ross earlier Friday that the Palestinians would not
agree to changes in the document.
	   Asfour also condemned Thursday's killing of two top Hamas
fugitives, brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, as a ``terrorist act''
aimed at scuttling the peace process. Asfour said the Netanyahu
government chose to kill the fugitives at this time to underscore
its claims that Israel is under constant threat from militants.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said it was
Israel's policy to pursue suspected terrorists at all times,
regardless of possible repercussions.
	   A West Bank army commander, Col. Yitzhak Eitan, said Israel was
tipped off three days ago that two major Hamas figures were hiding
out in a summer cottage west of the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   On Thursday afternoon, troops stormed the one-room house, killed
the two in a gun battle and only then identified the dead as the
Awadallahs, senior figures in Hamas' Izzedine al Qassam group,
Eitan told reporters. The bodies were placed in white plastic bags
and laid on the ground outside the house.
	   Several bullets had struck the walls in the bedroom. A large
banner reading ``Izzedine al Qassam'' was draped across one wall.
Troops found a weapons cache, including an Uzi submachine gun,
grenades, two pistols and three wigs.
	   Eitan said the Awadallah brothers apparently had planned to
kidnap Israelis or carry out a drive-by shooting.
	   When word of the killings spread Friday morning, Hamas was quick
to threaten revenge. Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin convened the
group's leadership in Gaza City and a spokesman, Mahmoud Zahar,
said Israel would ``pay a high price'' for killing the Awadallahs.
	   Hamas said the retaliation would be on par with the group's
response to the 1996 assassination of its chief bomb maker, Yehiyeh
Ayyash. At that time, Hamas carried out four suicide bombings over
nine days that killed scores of Israelis, disrupted peace talks and
brought Israel's right-wing leader, Netanyahu, to power.
	   Hundreds of mourners streamed to the Awadallah home in the West
Bank town of El Bireh on Friday. From there, a procession chanting
``revenge, revenge'' marched toward the nearby Jewish settlement of
Psagot. Dozens of young men broke away from the crowd and stoned
Israeli troops guarding the settlement. Soldiers fired
rubber-coated steel pellets, dozens at a time, and five people were
injured, including a WTN cameraman who was hit in the nose.
	   In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, dozens of teen-agers
twirling slingshots stoned soldiers who did not respond.
	   The largest crowd gathered in Nablus, also in the West Bank,
where about 1,000 people took to the streets after Friday noon
prayers, chanting ``we want bombings.''
	   One of the Hamas leaders in the city, Jamil Salim, said the
killings were proof that the Palestinians had gained nothing from
signing a peace agreement with Israel.
	   ``The time has come to throw this agreement in Netanyahu's
face,'' Salim told the crowd.

Relief, civic groups accuse Kenyan government of harassment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ International and local aid and civic
groups on Friday accused the government of harassment after it
banned 16 private relief agencies.
	   The National Council of Nongovernmental Organizations, an
umbrella group, said the government failed to follow proper
procedures in banning groups for alleged security violations.
	   ``The council, therefore, views the ongoing moves as the
beginning of systematic harassment,'' said Berewa Jommo, a council
executive member.
	   One of the banned agencies was raided by police and FBI agents
in connection with the twin terrorist bombings of the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7, which killed 258 people.
	   Kenya's NGO Coordinating Board, which registers all NGOs, banned
the agencies this week, alleging they ``had been found to be
working against the interests of Kenyans in terms of security.''
	   Six of the banned organizations were linked to Islamic
organizations, but served both Muslims and non-Muslims. Muslim
groups protested, claiming their agencies were targeted because
U.S. authorities allege the bombers were hired by Saudi terrorist
Osama bin Laden, a militant Muslim.
	   On Thursday, the government said the banned agencies have a
right to appeal.
	   ``The NGO council is unequivocal in asserting that if
individuals break the law, they must be dealt with through the
system of justice as individuals instead of criminalizing entire
organizations,'' Jommo said.

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A Swissair plane with 151 people on
board heading to New York from Geneva on Friday narrowly missed a
KLM jumbo jet in the skies over Ireland, a spokesman for the Swiss
company said.
	   A collision was avoided thanks to electronic warning devices,
said Swissair spokesman Erwin Schaerer. He said there were no
injuries.
	   The plane involved was a MD-11 _ the same type as the one which
crashed in Canada last week, killing all 229 on board. The route on
which the incident took place was also the same.
	   The Swiss aircraft, flight 114, was flying at 10,500 meters
(34,650 feet) above the Irish district of Shanwick at 1330 GMT as
the Dutch Boeing 747 airliner approached, Schaerer said. He didn't
give the distance between the two aircraft.
	   Both aircraft had Traffic Collision Avoidance System equipment,
which made the Swissair airliner descend and the KLM aircraft rise,
Schaerer said. The equipment detects other aircraft ``a long way
ahead,'' he said without being more specific.
	   There were no immediate further details on Friday's incident.

Many Russian firms facing widespread layoffs in wake of crisis

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The staff at the Paradigma advertising agency are
disappearing fast _ as fast, in fact, as the clients that once paid
handsomely for catchy slogans and flashy spreads.
	   ``We had to cut our staff by about 20 people,'' said Rosalina
Yunusova, a secretary at Paradigma. ``We had no choice _ our
clients just refused to buy any more ads.''
	   As buyers and sellers alike cut back in the wake of Russia's
economic crisis, many businesses have begun a massive round of
layoffs in an effort to survive the storm.
	   Almost every type of business is preparing to fire employees,
giving their workers a month or two of warning before they have to
face a job market with few takers.
	   ``The crisis hasn't hit just yet,'' said Vladimir Sedlenek, a
partner with the Triza employment agency. ``But by November there's
going to be a huge explosion of unemployed specialists.''
	   The heaviest layoffs will likely hit financial firms, trading
companies, tourist agencies, and advertising companies _ businesses
tied closer to the West, Sedlenek said. Triza's branch offices were
already receiving more than 1,500 resumes a day, up from 750 last
month.
	   The most prominent victims of the crisis are Russia's banks,
which alone are expected to fire between 15 and 20 percent of their
workers as they suffer under the weight of a devalued ruble and bad
debts, according to Sergei Yegor, the head of the Russian
Association of Banks.
	   For some banks, the numbers will be even higher. Bank Menatep,
one of the institutions most devastated by the crisis, is planning
to cut back by 30 percent by firing some and sending other staff on
vacation until the crisis settles.
	   ``We're reorganizing and will have to combine some
departments,'' said a spokeswoman for Menatep, speaking under the
bank's customary policy of anonymity. ``We don't have any choice
with this crisis.''
	   Other banks hadn't made final decisions, but said layoffs were
likely. ``We're certainly discussing cutting back,'' said Tatyana
Golodets, spokeswoman for Vneshekonombank. ``I don't have any
definite figures yet, but I can say it's probably going to
happen.''
	   In at least one case, the crisis left workers in total limbo. At
the Babylon International Trading Company, employees said their
boss had taken off for the United States, leaving them on the job
but without any idea if they should stay there.
	   For others, however, the situation was depressingly clear. Night
clubs, advertisement agencies, and investment bankers all have
watched co-workers let go as business drops off.
	   ``You see it on the television, you hear it on the radio,'' said
Yunusova, the Paradigma secretary. ``This is nothing new. The
crisis is hurting practically all of us.''

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP)_ A Briton wanted over a 'road rage' killing
in London has been moved from a prison in southern Spain to another
in Madrid for possible extradition.
	   The British Embassy said Friday that Kenneth Noye, 51, who was
arrested August 29 in the town of Barbate, was transferred last
Saturday to Valdemoro prison in Madrid from a jail in southern
Cadiz province.
	   He was moved on orders from Judge Baltasar Garzon of the
National Court, who will decide whether to extradite him to
Britain.
	   Described as one of that country's most wanted men, Noye faces
charges of stabbing 21-year-old Stephen Cameron to death in May,
1996 after getting into an argument with him at an entry road to
the busy six-lane highway that encircles London.
	   Cameron's girlfriend, who was driving the car in which Cameron
was traveling, says it all started when she had to brake suddenly.

	   ``I am convinced that you and your government will continue the
well-tested, trusting German-Russian cooperation and the
cooperation in many international questions,'' Kohl said in the
telegram, according to a German government press release.

Finland, Norway to send food, medical aid to Russians near border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout to ADD aid from Norway &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Answering Russian calls for food and
medical supplies, Finland and Norway said Friday they will provide
emergency aid to help the needy across their eastern borders.
	   Most of the Finnish aid, worth 5.5 million markkaa (dlrs 1.1
million), will be channeled through the Finnish Red Cross for
Russian hospitals, nurseries, schools and old people's homes in
Karelia and the northwestern Murmansk province.
	   The Norwegian government earmarked emergency aid worth 2 million
kroner (dlrs 260,000) to Murmansk in answer to provincial governor
Yuri Yevdokimov's appeal earlier this week for food supplies.
	   Norway also was preparing for a possible influx of thousands of
refugees from the northeast where it shares a border with Russia,
Foreign Ministry officials said in Oslo. Several Norwegian
organizations were collecting clothes and shoes for orphanages in
Murmansk.
	   The Finnish government's decision to provide aid was prompted by
requests for food and medical supplies from officials in Vyborg and
Svetogorsk, towns in northwest Russia near the 1,270-kilometer
(790-mile) Finnish-Russian border.
	   On Monday, Yevdokimov also asked regional leaders in northern
Finland and Sweden for aid, including meat, butter, sugar and food
oil.
	   Last year, Finland gave 4 million markkaa (dlrs 770,000) in
humanitarian aid to Russians in Karelia and Murmansk.

Russian crisis not to affect euro introduction, EU official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ The European Union will introduce its
common currency Jan. 1 as planned, despite Russia's economic
crisis, a senior EU official said Friday.
	   ``The Russian crisis will have no impact on the euro,'' said
Hans van den Broek, the European Union's foreign affairs
commissioner. ``No one doubts that the euro will be introduced on
Jan. 1.''
	   Van den Broek spoke after discussing Bulgarian efforts to meet
EU membership criteria with Bulgarian leaders.
	   He said the EU expected Bulgaria to speed up the turnover of
state assets to the private sector and reform its public service to
help speed up the transformation into a western-style democracy.
	   Bulgaria also was expected to close by 2002 the two oldest units
at at its Kozlodui nuclear power plant and to shut down two more
units between 2007-2010, Van den Broek said.
	   Bulgaria and the EU are considering a program to replace the
units slated for closure by conventional power sources, he added.
	   The Kozlodui plant, located 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of
Sofia, has four 440-megawatt pressurized water units, without
safety encasements that made operational between 1974 and 1982.
	   Two newer 1,000-megawatt units with encasements were installed
in 1987 and 1989.
	   The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency has long
described the four older units as safety risk.
	   Bulgaria has invested over dlrs 100 million to upgrade the
reactor's safety systems and has repeatedly balked at calls from
the West to close them down.
	   The plant provides some 40 percent of the country's electricity.

One person dies, several injured, in Kigali explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ A teen-age girl was killed and several
other people were injured on Friday in an explosion in downtown
Kigali, witnesses said.
	   Several taxi drivers parked nearby also were injured.
	   It wasn't clear whether the 10:30 a.m. (0830 GMT) explosion in
Kigali's busy commercial district was caused by a grenade or a
mine.
	   Witnesses at the Kigali's main roundabout, where the incident
took place, said they saw a person toss a grenade before he ran
away.
	   Police said they were investigating, and no officials were
immediately available for comment.
	   Nobody has claimed responsibility for the incident.
	   Located in the heart of Rwanda, Kigali has been spared of
killings and incidents so common in the countryside, where the
government has been battling Hutu rebels.
	   Thousands of people have died in Rwanda since the rebels _
former Hutu soldiers and militiamen _ trickled back into the
country following the victory of Tutsi-led rebels in July 1994.
	   The Tutsi fighters ended the Hutu government-sponsored slaughter
of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
	   Recently, a shadowy rebel group calling itself PALIR, or the
Rwanda Liberation Army, had claimed responsibility for a series of
attacks in northwestern Rwanda, including the kidnapping in August
of three foreign tourists in neighboring Congo, where many rebels
are believed to be based.
	   Security has been tightened on the roads approaching Kigali,
where cars and passengers are regularly checked for their
identities and cargos. Rwandans living or working in Kigali are
frequently stopped for their identity cards, and often imprisoned
if they lack one.

	   JAFFNA, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Tamil Tiger rebels on Friday bombed the
city hall of their former stronghold, killing the Tamil mayor, the
area's military and police chiefs and 17 others and making it clear
that they won't be sidelined in the government campaign to end Sri
Lanka's ethnic war.
	   The explosion destroyed much of the mayor's office, flinging
parts of the tiled roof 100 meters (yards) away.
	   Among the victims was a female Tamil architect, Mallika
Rajaratnam, who was attending the meeting called to streamline the
city's traffic system.
	   ``I saw bodies that were really mutilated,'' said Mr. Ananda
Sangaree, vice president of the mainstream Tamil United Liberation
Front, which now governs Jaffna. ``You can't recognize them. I also
saw badly wounded people in the hospital.''
	   Twenty persons were injured, three of them critically, officials
said.
	   ``It must have been a very powerful bomb. The scars are
everywhere,'' Sangaree said referring to the mood in Jaffna, a city
dotted by sandbagged military checkpoints and bullet poked
buildings. The city's streets were deserted as the war-scarred
residents retreated into their homes, fearful of further violence.
	   Military officials in Jaffna said two Claymore mines had been
placed on the tiled roof of the one-story building, which was a
temporary office since the old Town Hall had been badly damaged
during the civil war.
	   Only one of the mines went off. The other was found in tact,
with about five kilograms (11 pounds) of TNT explosive in it, and
was defused. It was not immediatley clear how the mine was
detonated.
	   Local residents and officials speculated that the mines may have
been placed when the building was being readied to be used as a
municipal office.
	   The rebels seized Jaffna in 1990 and proclaimed a government for
the 1 million people, mostly minority Tamils, who live in the
north.
	   The army retook the city in 1995 after a 50-day offensive and
ruled there until local elections were held last year in a bid to
restore normalcy.
	   Rebels continue to attack Jaffna from surrounding jungles.
	   Militants among the 3.3 million Tamils are fighting for 15 years
for a Tamil homeland that they say will prevent discrimination from
the Sinhalese majority.
	   The government is willing to grant autonomy, but will not allow
secession.
	   In Colombo, Defense Ministry spokesman Brigadier Sunil Tennekoon
said initial investigation confirmed that the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, or LTTE, carried out the attack.
	   ``This will not deter us from fighting the terrorists. In fact,
this attack clearly showed that the LTTE is getting desperate and
targeting civilians,'' Tennekoon said.
	   But military analysts say the attack may set back the
government's plan to hand over Jaffna's administration to a
political party and redeploy 10,000 soldiers stationed there.
	   ``This attack is a crippling blow to the government's plan to
ease the military out,'' said Harry Goonatilleke, a military
analyst. ``Civilians won't come forward to take on political posts,
and the military will be tied down.''
	   Tamil rebels carried out the attack to show that they can still
be devastatingly effective even in heavily guarded Jaffna and that
the government cannot undermine their influence over the region.
	   They targeted Mayor Ponnuthurai Sivapalan, a 46-year-old
lawyer-turned-politician who was trying to restore a civilian
administration after his predecessor, Sarojini Yogeswaran, was
assassinated in May.
	   Mrs. Yogeswaran was elected in the first vote in 15 years in
Jaffna, a once bustling cultural center 300 kilometers (185 miles)
north of Colombo.
	   The government hoped to crush the rebels with a 2-phase plan:
capture Jaffna and flush out the guerrillas from the northern
jungles.
	   The first stage was completed in May 1996. The second started a
year later, with nearly troops advancing up the region's main
highway.

Marion Jones wins 200-meter sprint in World Cup record time

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ American Marion Jones raced to
victory Friday in the women's 200-meter sprint, leading from start
to finish to set a new World Cup record with a time of 21.62
seconds.
	   Jones' performance gave the American star the third-fastest time
ever over the distance, keeping her undefeated this year in women's
sprints and long jump competition. Only Florence Griffith-Joyner of
the United States, holder of the world record at 21.34, has run
faster than Jones in the 200.
	   The winning time also was a personal best for Jones, which was
the goal she had set coming into her first race at high altitude.
	   The three-day, finals-only World Cup competition brings together
athletes from the United States, Africa, Europe, the Americas,
Oceania, Asia, and two European national squads to compete for team
honors.
	   In the meet's first upset, Nezha Bidouane of Morocco sped by
world record-holder and race favorite Kim Batten of the United
States in the final strides to win the women's 400-meter hurdles.
	   Bidouane's time of 52.96 seconds set a new World Cup record in
getting the win for the Africas team. Batten, the favorite, clipped
the last hurdle with her foot and faded to third in 53.17, behind
Deon Hemmings of Jamaica at 53.03.
	   ``I was quite confident I would win,'' Bidouane said. ``I had a
good end to my season and I knew that the altitude in Johannesburg
would suit me. I'm happy to win the first gold medal for Africa.''
	   Zambia's Samuel Matete also thrilled the partisan African crowd
at Johannesburg Stadium, holding on to win the men's 400 hurdles in
48.08. Al-Nubi Mubarak of Qatar, representing the Asian team,
finished second in 48.17 and Dinsdale Morgan of Jamaica was third
at 48.40 for the Americas team.
	   ``This is great,'' Matete said. ``My fourth time in South Africa
and I never lose here.''

 &UR; Killing of Hamas fugitives triggers violent chain reaction &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A volley of shots fired in a remote West Bank
cottage set off a violent chain reaction Friday that threatened to
cripple Washington's latest Mideast peace mission.
	   The bullets fired by Israeli troops in a raid of a Hamas hideout
killed two top fugitives sought for planning terror attacks. Vowing
retaliation, Islamic militants said they would detonate bombs in
the Jewish state. Hundreds of Hamas supporters took to the streets,
clamoring for revenge, and threw stones at Israeli soldiers.
	   Troops sprayed one group of protesters in the West Bank town of
El Bireh with rubber bullets, injuring five people.
	   The army also sealed the West Bank and Gaza Strip, fanning
Palestinian resentment already running high over the 17-month
stalemate in talks on an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   Despite the rising tensions, U.S. envoy Dennis Ross on Friday
pressed on with efforts to narrow the gaps between Israel and the
Palestinians. He met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai. Asked how the negotiations were
going, Mordechai said: ``Slowly, slowly.''
	   One of the main stumbling blocks is Israel's demand to
renegotiate an understanding on security cooperation worked out in
December by Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. officials.
	   The document serves, among other things, as a blueprint for a
Palestinian crackdown on Hamas. Netanyahu rejected the initial deal
as insufficient.
	   However, Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said after a
meeting with Ross earlier Friday that the Palestinians would not
agree to changes in the document.
	   Asfour also condemned Thursday's killing of two top Hamas
fugitives, brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, as a ``terrorist act''
aimed at scuttling the peace process. Asfour said the Netanyahu
government chose to kill the fugitives at this time to underscore
its claims that Israel is under constant threat from militants.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said it was
Israel's policy to pursue suspected terrorists at all times,
regardless of possible repercussions.
	   A West Bank army commander, Col. Yitzhak Eitan, said Israel was
tipped off three days ago that two major Hamas figures were hiding
out in a summer cottage west of the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   On Thursday afternoon, troops stormed the one-room house, killed
the two in a gun battle and only then identified the dead as the
Awadallahs, senior figures in Hamas' Izzedine al Qassam group,
Eitan told reporters. The bodies were placed in white plastic bags
and laid on the ground outside the house.
	   Several bullets had struck the walls in the bedroom. A large
banner reading ``Izzedine al Qassam'' was draped across one wall.
Troops found a weapons cache, including an Uzi submachine gun,
grenades, two pistols and three wigs.
	   Eitan said the Awadallah brothers apparently had planned to
kidnap Israelis or carry out a drive-by shooting.
	   When word of the killings spread Friday morning, Hamas was quick
to threaten revenge. Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin convened the
group's leadership in Gaza City and a spokesman, Mahmoud Zahar,
said Israel would ``pay a high price'' for killing the Awadallahs.
	   Hamas said the retaliation would be on par with the group's
response to the 1996 assassination of its chief bomb maker, Yehiyeh
Ayyash. At that time, Hamas carried out four suicide bombings over
nine days that killed scores of Israelis, disrupted peace talks and
brought Israel's right-wing leader, Netanyahu, to power.
	   Hundreds of mourners streamed to the Awadallah home in the West
Bank town of El Bireh on Friday. From there, a procession chanting
``revenge, revenge'' marched toward the nearby Jewish settlement of
Psagot. Dozens of young men broke away from the crowd and stoned
Israeli troops guarding the settlement. Soldiers fired
rubber-coated steel pellets, dozens at a time, and five people were
injured, including a WTN cameraman who was hit in the nose.
	   In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, dozens of teen-agers
twirling slingshots stoned soldiers who did not respond.
	   The largest crowd gathered in Nablus, also in the West Bank,
where about 1,000 people took to the streets after Friday noon
prayers, chanting ``we want bombings.''
	   One of the Hamas leaders in the city, Jamil Salim, said the
killings were proof that the Palestinians had gained nothing from
signing a peace agreement with Israel.
	   ``The time has come to throw this agreement in Netanyahu's
face,'' Salim told the crowd.

Military unrest reported in Lesotho
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. diplomat describing mutiny &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Several dozen mutinying soldiers were
holed up Friday at military headquarters and were surrounded by
loyal troops, a U.S. diplomat said.
	   Gunshots were heard at the headquarters. It was unclear who
fired or whether there were any casualties, said the U.S. deputy
chief of mission, Raymond Brown.
	   ``There was a mutiny by a small armed group - maybe one or two
platoons of soldiers who have objected to the retirement of a
colonel whom they have an association with,'' Brown said in a
telephone interview. The colonel, identified only by his surname,
Motene, was forced to retire for unspecified reasons, Brown said.
	   The mutiny in this mountainous kingdom was occurring amid
upheaval over general elections last May which opposition parties
have branded as fraudulent.
	   Brown said the mutineers' motives were unclear.
	   The 2,000-member Lesotho military has a history of dividing into
political factions, Brown said.
	   ``It's conceivable that this activity may be associated with
that,'' Brown said, stressing that the situation remained confused.
	   Another diplomat said a senior dissident army officer and nine
of his followers were arrested Friday morning. Their identities
were not immediately known and it was unclear what link, if any,
they had with Motene.
	   The 10 resisted arrest and were put into a maximum security
prison, said Colette Mason, an official with the British Embassy in
Maseru, the capital.
	   South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said in Pretoria,
South Africa's capital, that there appeared to be a revolt in the
Lesotho army, the South African Press Association reported. The
news agency reported a lot of troop movement in Maseru.
	   However, Mason said neither she nor British Ambassador Peter
Smith had seen unusual troop movements.
	   The Britsh ambassador's residence is near the barracks where the
arrests occurred, and that area, as well as downtown Maseru,
appeared calm Friday evening, Mason said.
	   King Letsie III had reportedly ordered the arrest of the senior
officer. The reason for the arrest was unclear. Government offices
were closed and no one was answering the telephone there.
	   Lesotho, a country of 2 million people surrounded by South
Africa, has a turbulent past.
	   In early 1994, an army rebellion killed Deputy Prime Minister
Selometsi Baholo. The following August, King Letsie _ the current
king's late father _ dismissed the government, then restored it a
month later after mediation by southern African diplomats.
	   Supporters of the three main opposition parties claim the
election last May was rigged in favor of the ruling party, which
won 79 of 80 seats in the National Assembly.

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The ruling Taliban army on Friday
claimed it had seized seven villages, as well as arms and
ammunition, in central Afghanistan after an opposition commander
and his troops switched sides in the country's civil war, Kabul
radio reported. The northern-based opposition immediately denied
the claim.
	   According to the Taliban-controlled radio, the religious militia
advanced into villages in the districts of Kohmard and Saighon as
part of a fierce drive to take an opposition stronghold in the
Bamian province, roughly 125 kilometers (80 miles) west Kabul, the
Afghan capital.
	   However, Haji Mohammed Moahqaq, a top leader of the northern
alliance, denied that Taliban had seized the villages, or that his
side's troops had deserted to join the enemy.
	   Bamiyan is one of four provinces still held by an anti-Taliban
alliance led by ousted Afghan Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Masood.
The radio also said Taliban leader Mullah Omar has ordered his
troops to protect the lives of civilians in their three-pronged
drive to take Bamian, the main city in the province of the same
name.
	   The Taliban and its foes routinely make contradictory claims
that are often impossible to verify.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's woes deepened Friday when the government
announced the economy has slid even further into recession,
shrinking for a third quarter _ the first such contraction in more
than 40 years.
	   Heightening fears the world's second-largest economy could set
off a global slump, the Economic Planning Agency said Japan's
economy shrank at an annualized rate of 3.3 percent in the most

China concerned about Afghanistan, condemns Iranian deaths
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Friday condemned the killing of Iranian
diplomats in Afghanistan and expressed concern over the ongoing
Afghani civil war.
	   ``We expressed our deep regret on the death of the Iranian
diplomats and our sympathy and solicitude to the relatives of the
victims,'' an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a
statement released by the official Xinhua News Agency.
	   The spokesman added that killing of the nine diplomats violated
international law.
	   The Taliban, the conservative religious militia ruling much of
Afghanistan, has admitted that its forces killed the diplomats.
	   China has grown increasingly anxious that the chaos in
Afghanistan and the Taliban's religious fervor will seep across the
border. China has been fighting a low-level, but persistent
rebellion by ethnic, Muslim separatists in its northwesternmost
region of Xinjiang.
	   The spokesman said that ``as a good neighbor of Afghanistan,''
China hopes all parties stop fighting at an early date.

Russian parliament approves Primakov as prime minister

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian parliament overwhelmingly approved
Yevgeny Primakov as prime minister Friday after he called on all
political factions to unite behind his government and tackle the
country's economic crisis.
	   The Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, voted 317-63 to
confirm Primakov, in a major show of support for the new
government. He called for political stability, asking party leaders
to give his government up to a year before deciding if it was
succeeding or not.
	   ``We need unity to come out of this very grave crisis,'' he told
the hushed chamber.
	   ``Do not expect to continue political confrontation,'' he added.
	   Primakov said he did not have an economic program because he had
only been nominated the day before, but economic reform would
continue.
	   ``Reforms are necessary. The present situation cannot be
overcome without them,'' he said.
	   But at the same time he called for a strong state role in
regulating the economy. ``The government should intervene into the
economic affairs and regulate them. This is not a return to the
administrative and command system,'' he said.
	   He denied this would be a return to Soviet economic control,
instead comparing it to emergency measures taken by the U.S.
government during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
	   ``So what must we do? Repeat the wild capitalism that we had up
till now? Or use the experience of other countries,'' he said.
	   He said the government had to do a much better job running the
country.
	   ``We need to strengthen discipline. We should stop this
sloppiness which now exists in the government,'' he said.
	   Primakov said he wanted representatives of all political parties
in his Cabinet, but warned they should put aside party interests.
	   ``Representatives of all parties should join the Cabinet as
professionals and work as members of a single team. And there
should be no orders from the organizations they belong to.''
	   On foreign policy, Primakov said there would be no confrontation
with the West, but it was vital to defend Russia's national
interests.
	   ``We don't need confrontation, a return to the Cold War. And
that will not happen,'' he said. ``But at the same time we will
strictly defend the interests of the state.''
	   Primakov was keeping quiet about his likely economic policies.
	   ``I am for consolidation of all political forces and
mobilization of all efforts in order to come out of the crisis and
preserve Russia as a strong state,'' he was quoted as saying by the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   President Boris Yeltsin said a major crisis had been avoided by
compromise and that Primakov had strong backing from all sides. He
called for measures to stabilize prices, restore supplies to shops
and prop up the banking system.
	   ``I understand that it's hard for everyone, but one cannot give
in to emotions ... we'll have to draw lessons from the current
crisis and now we'll have to work on overcoming it,'' Yeltsin said
in a television address to the nation.
	   In a sign that the government wanted broad political support,
Yeltsin nominated Viktor Gerashchenko to head the Central Bank.
Gerashchenko, 60, an ex-head of the Soviet State Bank, headed the
Central Bank for nearly three years until being ousted in October
1994 after the ruble nose dived.
	   Critics blamed Gerashchenko for fueling inflation with huge
credits to ailing industry and agriculture. Jeffrey Sachs, a former
economic adviser to the Kremlin, once called him ''the worst
central bank governor in history.''
	   But the Duma apparently felt differently, and quickly and
strongly confirmed Gerashchenko later in the day with a 273-65
vote.
	   Later in the day, Primakov said he would promote his deputy,
Igor Ivanov, to replace him as foreign minister. Ivanov, 53, a
career diplomat and former ambassador to Spain, became deputy
foreign minister in the early 1990s. His appointment needs to be
confirmed by Yeltsin to take effect.

UN rights chief in Tibet asks for missing Panchen Lama candidate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.N. rights chief Mary Robinson asked leaders of
Chinese-ruled Tibet Friday about a boy not seen in public since the
Dalai Lama named him a high Buddhist cleric three years ago.
	   Amid a discussion about human rights, religion and
Tibetan-language education, Robinson's query about the Dalai Lama's
choice for Panchen Lama ``raised eyebrows'' among the officials,
said her spokesman Jose Diaz.
	   The officials, including the region's Communist Party Vice
Secretary Legqog, did not disclose the boy's whereabouts and
repeated that he was with his family and under guard for his own
protection.
	   Gendun Choekyi Nyima has not been seen in public since the Dalai
Lama's announcement in May 1995. Now 9 years old, he is often
called the world's youngest political prisoner by human rights
groups.
	   The Panchen Lama is considered the highest-ranking spiritual
leader still in Tibet since the Dalai Lama fled into exile 40 years
ago. After rejecting the Dalai Lama's choice, Chinese leaders
forced Tibet's clergy to name another Panchen Lama.
	   Robinson is half way through her 10-day China trip, the first
ever official mission by a U.N. high commissioner for human rights.
She and Chinese leaders are hoping the visit will end nearly a
decade of confrontation between China and U.N. groups over human
rights.
	   Unlike her first four days in Beijing, where she refrained from
meeting dissidents, Robinson attempted to arrange a meeting with a
well-known dissident monk in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital.
	   Touring the Jokhang Temple, Tibet's holiest shrine, on Thursday,
Robinson handed a senior monk a written request to meet with Yulo
Dawa Tsering, Diaz said. He said officials claimed the monk could
not be found and that her schedule had no time for such a meeting.
	   Robinson was particularly concerned about Tsering because he was
placed under house arrest after speaking to a U.N. human rights
team in 1994. A three-member delegation from the European
Parliament saw him two years ago for ten minutes. One politician
described Tsering as ``not the master of his own movements.''
	   Tsering, a senior monk from Ganden monastery, was believed to
have been first arrested in 1959, amid a large-scale purge of
independence-minded members of the Buddhist clergy. He was
imprisoned again in 1987 for speaking to two tourists from Italy
and released before the visit of the U.N. team.
	   Robinson leaves Tibet Saturday for Shanghai and then returns
Monday to Beijing.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Raging floodwaters that have submerged
much of the flood-prone nation of Bangladesh have resulted too much
water, nearly all of it too polluted to drink.
	   Most of the nation's 120 million people depend on wells for
drinking water. But tens of thousands of wells across Bangladesh
have been submerged since July, when the intense deluge began.
	   Although 20,000 relief workers are distributing water
purification tablets throughout the country, diseases that stem
from drinking contaminated water are spreading. On Friday, the
government reported nearly 194,000 cases of diarrhea. At least 160
people have died.
	   Health experts fear that the real trouble will begin when the
flood waters recede and 35 million displaced people return home.
	   ``My guess is that these people will be forced to drink polluted
water. That will be dangerous,'' said Mohammad Hakim, a doctor in
Bangladesh's capital of Dhaka.
	   The International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research Center
in Dhaka is treating nearly 900 patients a day, even though it has
only 300 beds. It has pitched tents to cope with the new arrivals.
	   Lying on a bed inside a tent, 5-year-old Sahela Shirin is being
treated for severe diarrhea. Doctors say she is out of danger.
	   The girl's mother Zubeida Khatoon, a maid, lives in a slum on
the flooded outskirts of Dhaka.
	   ``The two wells in our slum have gone under water,'' she said.
	   In Dhaka, volunteer agencies are supporting the government's
efforts to ferry drinking water in trucks to the flood victims.
	   CARE, an international relief agency, said its workers were
distributing clean drinking water in half a dozen flood shelters.
	   Each year, diarrhea kills more than 100,000 people in
Bangladesh, most of them children from poor families. Millions more
are afflicted.
	   ``In a flood situation, diarrhea is a major concern,'' said
Shahida Azfar, head of the U.N. Children's Fund in Dhaka. Officials
fear that overcrowding in shelters, combined with the shortage of
food and safe drinking water, will lead to a major disease
outbreak.
	   The UNICEF's Dhaka office has asked its headquarters to release
dlrs 8 million to buy water purification tablets and saline, which
is used to treat diarrhea.

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A Swissair plane with 151 people on
board heading to New York from Geneva on Friday narrowly missed a
KLM jumbo jet in the skies over Ireland, a spokesman for the Swiss
company said.
	   A collision was avoided thanks to electronic warning devices,
said Swissair spokesman Erwin Schaerer. There were no injuries and
passengers aboard the Swiss airliner weren't in danger, he added.
	   Both planes involved were MD-11s _ the same type as the one
which crashed in Canada last week, killing all 229 on board. The
Swiss airliner's route on which the incident took place was also
the same.
	   The Swissair plane, flight 114, was flying at 10,500 meters
(34,650 feet) above the Irish district of Shanwick at 1330 GMT as
the Dutch airliner approached, Schaerer said. He didn't give the
exact distance between the two aircraft, but said it was
``certainly several kilometers (miles).''
	   Both aircraft had Traffic Collision Avoidance System equipment,
which made the Swissair airliner descend and the KLM aircraft rise,
Schaerer said. The equipment detects other aircraft ``a long way
ahead,'' he said without being more specific.
	   KLM spokesman Peter Wellhuner confirmed there had been a near
miss south of Ireland but had few details to add.
	   He had no immediate details on how many passengers were aboard
the KLM flight or the distance between the two aircraft.
	   The Dutch flight was KL752 en route from Curacao in the Dutch
Antilles to Amsterdam's Schiphol airport.

<TEXT>
	   Thumbnails of Russia's new economic team _ the prime minister,
Central Bank chairman, and the expected deputy prime minister for
economic policy:
	   YEVGENY PRIMAKOV, prime minister: A former spymaster, the
68-year-old Middle East specialist has been Russia's foreign
minister since 1996. Primakov is known as a low-key but skillful
administrator and diplomat respected by hard-liners and liberals
alike. He has cool but cordial relations with the West, and has
pushed a foreign policy aimed at containing America's global
dominance. He has no experience running the economy and has rarely
expressed views on domestic matters.
	    &UR; ___
	   VIKTOR GERASHCHENKO, the new Central Bank chairman: A
bureaucratic holdover from the Soviet era, Gerashchenko, 60, was
head of the Soviet State Bank in 1991 and masterminded the currency
reform that cost many Russians their savings. Many economists also
blame Gerashchenko for fueling hyperinflation by printing rubles to
pay off state debts. Market reaction to his candidacy has generally
been negative.
	    &UR; ___
	   YURI MASLYUKOV, nominee for deputy prime minister in charge of
economic policy: Maslyukov, 60, began his career as a defense
industry engineer. In 1988, Mikhail Gorbachev named him chief of
Gosplan, the huge Soviet agency in charge of economic planning, and
brought him into the ruling Politburo in 1989. Unlike such senior
Communists as Yeltsin, Maslyukov remained in the party even after
the failed anti-Gorbachev coup and ensuing Soviet collapse. Last
July, in an effort to appease his hard-line opposition, Yeltsin
made him trade and industry minister.

Rome prosecutor asks to dismiss charges against ex-Nazi
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Changes attribution to prosecutor; ADDS details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A military prosecutor said Friday he has concluded
that there is not enough evidence to seek trial for Nazi officer
Erich Priebke for a wartime massacre of 14 civilians on the
outskirts of Rome.
	   Prosecutor Antonino Intelisano said in his ruling that the
evidence collected during preliminary investigations does not
warrant indictment of Priebke, who was tried and convicted by a
military court in Rome earlier this year for another massacre.
	   The ruling referred to the killing of 14 men on June 4, 1944.
The victims had been taken from jails in Rome run by the Nazi
forces then occupying Rome and taken to the town of La Storta, just
north of the capital, and shot. Among them was a union leader,
Bruno Buozzi.
	   Priebke, who was working in the Nazi jails at that time, helped
transport the prisoners but did not attend the actual executions,
according to Intelisano.
	   Intelisano said he reached his conclusion in late May and
notified those concerned, including relatives of the 14 victims.
The decision became public Friday after some of the family members
told news media.
	   A Rome judge will decide withing a month whether to accept
Intelisano's opinion or order indictment.
	   Priebke, 86, was convicted earlier this year for the 1944
Ardeatine Caves massacre of 335 civilians and sentenced to life in
prison. Because of poor health and his age, he has been allowed to
serve the sentence in a house in Rome.

Sampras-Rafter heads men's semifinals at Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The only thing wrong with Saturday's semifinal
showdown between Patrick Rafter and Pete Sampras at the U.S. Open
is that it's not for the championship.
	   Two of the heaviest hitters in tennis meet in a dream match with
the winner advancing to the final against the winner of the other
semifinal between Carlos Moya and Mark Philippoussis.
	   The two men's semis are sandwiched around the women's final in a
resumption of Super Saturday, a potential of 13 sets of
high-tension tennis.
	   Sampras, a four-time Open winner, is bidding for a 12th Grand
Slam championship which would tie Roy Emerson's record. Rafter won
this tournament last year for his first Slam after Sampras was
upset in the fourth round by Petr Korda.
	   The two met at Cincinnati a month ago with Rafter winning the
Open-tuneup on a controversial match point call. That defeat stung
Sampras, who prides himself on learning from every loss.
	   ``I felt I was playing well enough to beat him,'' he said. ``But
he hung in there and played a good match.''
	   That victory, plus Rafter's status as defending champion at the
Open, turns up the heat for the semifinal.
	   ``Winning here last year, he's the man to beat,'' Sampras said.
``He's played well. He's breezed through this tournament. He's a
great mover, a great athlete, one of the best volleyers in the
game. It's just a matter of the return of serve. If I can return
well, make him volley, over the course of a four- or five-set
match, I can wear him down.''
	   Sampras offered a scouting report on the match.
	   ``We both try to come in,'' he said. ``We play similar. I
probably stay back a little more. He's not easy to play. But I know
what to expect, and so does he. It is just a matter of who does it
better.''
	   The Sampras-Rafter match overshadows the other semifinal between
Moya, the French Open champion, and Philippoussis, who never has
advanced this far in a Grand Slam tournament.
	   Moya knows the 21-year-old Australian will pose a major problem.
	   ``He's a very dangerous player, a very good player,'' Moya said.
``He has big potential. He can win any tournament.''
	   Philippoussis knows Moya's strengths.
	   ``The guy's basically not going to miss from the back,'' he
said. ``He's going to run everything down.''
	   Sampras is still aggravated by the loss to Rafter at Cincinnati.
He has been on a roll, winning 11 straight sets and dropping only
one set in his first five matches at the Open.
	   Rafter has had a harder time. He lost the first two sets in his
opening match against Hicham Arazi and was in danger of becoming
the first defending champion to go out in the first round before a
dramatic rally enabled him to survive. He also dropped a set to
Goran Ivanisevic in the fourth round.
	   Rafter, however, was at the top of his game in the
quarterfinals, a straight-sets victory over Jonas Bjorkman.
	   ``I can't play much better than that,'' he said.
	   Rafter said the Cincinnati experience gave him confidence
against Sampras.
	   ``It helps to know I have beaten him recently,'' he said. ``I
won't go on the court feeling as intimidated as I had before. I
learned that if I'm playing well, then I can compete. It's a good
feeling to know I can do it.''
	   Sampras, thinking about the Slam record, knows Rafter probably
is a more difficult obstacle in the semis than either Moya or
Philippoussis would be in the final.
	   ``I'm looking forward to Saturday,'' he said. ``It's going to be
a good match.''
	   After the tough Cincinnati loss, a frustrated Sampras was asked
the difference between him and Rafter.
	   ``Ten Grand Slams,'' he said.

Experts arrive to aid in conservation of ancient Roman fresco

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAESAREA, Israel (AP) _ The conservators could see beyond the
centuries of grime. They said the faded splotches of color were
deer, foxes, horses and leopards leaping about a floral backdrop.
	   The experts are part of an international team that has come to
Israel to help restore a rare 150-meter-long Roman fresco uncovered
in King Herod's hippodrome in Caesarea, the ancient Roman seat of
government in Palestine.
	   Although ancient Roman amphitheaters and hippodromes were
typically decorated with frescoes, few have survived in open-air
environments such as the one in Caesarea, the conservators said
Friday.
	   They want to preserve the fresco in its original location _ an
entertainment complex where 25,000 spectators gathered 2,000 years
ago to watch gladiator battles, animal fights and chariot races.
	   In Roman times, the frescoes ran along the wall separating the
arena from the seats, in the same place where ads would be
plastered in modern-day arenas.
	   But conserving the artwork is proving to be difficult. The
Mediterranean, with its corrosive salt spray and wind, is less than
100 meters away.
	   ``All those factors are against conservation,'' said Marisa
Tabasso, the head of research for the Rome-based International
Center for the Study of the Preservation and the Restoration of
Cultural Property. ``But taking them (the frescoes) out is to
destroy them.''
	   Excavations in Caesarea, one of Israel's most important
archaeological sites, began in 1974. The hippodrome was found about
five years ago, in addition to offices thought to have been used by
the Roman secret police and the foundations of a seaside temple.
	   The original frescoes were painted by teams of artists around
170 A.D. Repair work from ancient times is visible. A geometric
pattern that mimics marble slabs was later painted over the
original.
	   The condition of the frescoes vary, with some parts well
preserved and others completely lost, said to Gianluigi Colalucci,
the conservator of the Sistine Chapel frescoes.
	   Additional portions of the fresco will become visible as the
work continues. A team of four has been working with sponges,
brushes, water and chemicals to remove the sediment of 2,000 years.
	   ``We do the best to protect it and exhibit not just for our eyes
but for the whole world,'' said Israeli archaeologist Yosef Porat.

Malta renews application for EU membership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ Malta's new conservative government on
Friday reactivated its application for European Union membership,
making good on its campaign pledge to try to strengthen the island
nation's ties to Europe.
	   Foreign Minister Guido de Marco's letter to the EU ends Malta's
two-year-old suspension of its application.
	   Malta's previous socialist government had argued Malta was not
ready for the tough economic criteria of membership. The
Nationalists routed Labor in Sept. 5 parliamentary elections with a
promise to revive the nation's EU drive.
	   In his letter, de Marco reminded EU officials of earlier
declarations to include Malta in its next round of expansion.
	   The 15-member EU had agreed to start membership talks with Malta
in 1995. The next word on whether those talks can pick up where
they left off may come in December, when EU leaders meet in Vienna.

Congolese rebel leader promises long fight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The Congolese rebel leader promised a
long guerrilla fight against President Laurent Kabila and dampened
hopes of a ceasefire, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   ``We are not interested in power for power's sake,'' Ernest
Wambia dia Wamba was quoted as saying by Metical, an independent
newspaper.
	   But he said his movement was prepared for a lengthy struggle on
the lines of the liberation wars fought in Mozambique and Angola
against Portuguese colonial rule.
	   ``We have the basic resource, the people, who are fed up with
misery,'' he was quoted as saying. Metical said Wamba dia Wamba was
interviewed from his headquarters in Goma, in eastern Congo.
	   Leaders from seven countries involved in the six-week civil war
met for a second day in Ethiopia to try to negotiate a cease-fire
and the withdrawal of foreign troops.
	   Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia are backing Kabila. Rwanda and
Uganda deny they are supporting the rebels.
	   Rebel representatives were not invited to Friday's talks.
	   No ceasefire could be reached ``unless there is a political
agreement among the protagonists -- us and the Zimbabwean, Angolan
and Namibian troops. Kabila has no troops,'' Wamba dia Wamba said.
	   He claimed the rebels controlled areas inhabited by about 15
million people, and that their army numbers 60,000. The figures
could not be independently confirmed.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES Dow, helped by American Express statement, Primakov
confirmed as Russia's prime minister, European markets closing
above day's lows. &QL; 
 &UR; By BRUCE MEYERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks were rising in shaky U.S. trading,
interrupting a global selling spree that included the biggest
decline of the year by Tokyo's blue-chip stocks.
	   Wall Street's gains helped cut losses in late trading on
European markets but came too late to ease the pain in Asian
exchanges.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, down 248.48 points Thursday,
was off an additional 96.30 in the early going, then shot up to a
gain of 117.40, before giving up some of that ground. By early this
afternoon, it was up 39.39 at 7,654.93 in heavy trading, helped by
a gain from American Express, which said it has not been hit hard
by worldwide market turmoil.
	   The technology-heavy Nasdaq index was rising sharply, helped by
encouraging earnings statements after markets closed Thursday from
Intel Corp. and Oracle Corp.
	   Still, traders remained on edge in advance of the release of the
Independent Counsel's report on the Monica Lewinsky affair, with
sources saying the prosecutor accuses President Clinton of perjury
and obstruction of justice.
	   Markets continued to be unsettled by economic problems that now
are plaguing Latin American financial markets after roiling Russia
and Asia.
	   There was some encouragement, however, as Brazilian shares were
rising Friday after the government raised interest rates sharply.
Trading on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest,
was halted twice in Thursday's frenzied session, when shares
plummeted 15.8 percent.
	   In addition, Russia was moving to resolve some of the political
problems that have prevented the country from bailing out its
economy. The parliament overwhelmingly confirmed the appointment of
Yevgeny Primakov as prime minister.
	   Meantime, a Labor Department report of a sharper-than-expected
drop in U.S. wholesale prices last month raised expectations that
the Federal Reserve's next move would be to reduce short-term
interest rates to help offset the fallout from the global economic
crisis.
	   The unease worldwide has led to a buying binge for U.S. Treasury
bonds, a traditional haven for cash in times of unrest. There were
new sharp gains for government bonds early in the day, as global
stock markets were being battered, but those gains began shrinking
as U.S. stocks turned higher.
	   Stocks already were falling outside the United States as Wall
Street's trading day began but regained most of the lost ground in
late trading as U.S. shares began rising in the morning.
	   On the London Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest market, the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed with a loss
of 0.4 percent after being down 1.8 percent at midday.
	   Many European investors were staying out of the market, figuring
much of the information might come out after London had finished
trading for the day.
	   ``I don't know if people will be brave enough to do anything
today,'' said Peter Caulkett, a stock salesman at the brokerage
Teather and Greenwood. ``No one knows what will be in Starr's
report.''
	   Key market indexes were off by 0.2 percent in Frankfurt,
Germany, and down 0.3 percent Paris, both well above the day's
lows.
	   The damage was heavier on big Asian markets, which had closed
before trading began in New York.
	   Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average plummeted 749.05 points,
or 5.12 percent, to close at 13,916.98. It was the largest one-day
point fall this year. The finish was just barely above the Nikkei's
12-year closing low of 13,915.63 set on Aug. 28.
	   Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 3.5 percent, while
shares in Singapore fell, sending the Straits Times Index down 1.3
percent.
	   The recent decline by the U.S. dollar also sent shudders through
foreign markets, where analysts worried their corporations could be
hurt by more competitively priced exports from America.
	   ``Unfortunately, what's good or bad for the U.S. is good or bad
for Asia'' and the rest of the world, said Eugene Chung, Asia
strategist at Warburg Dillon Read (HK) Ltd., in Hong Kong.

Baltics cautious about Primakov's rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) _ Leaders in the former Soviet Baltic
republics aren't enthusiastic about Yevgeny Primakov, who became
Russia's prime minister on Friday, but say they are relieved that
their giant neighbor at least has a head of government.
	   As foreign minister, Primakov led Russia's efforts to keep
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from pursuing NATO membership and
many in the Baltics also are wary of him because of his Communist
ppast.
	   Nonetheless, ``I welcome anything that gets our Russian neighbor
out of its state of uncertainty and out of its economic crisis,''
Estonian President Lennart Meri was quoted as saying by the
newspaper Postimees on Friday.
	   Latvia also said it was heartened that Russia was putting
together a functional government, but was concerned that the
Kremlin's often-bitter relationship with Latvia would not improve.
	   Russia this year threatened trade sanctions against Latvia
unless the country eased natuarlaization requirements for the
hundreds of thousands of stateless ethnic Russians who live there.
	   The threats came during Russia's previous governmental crisis
and many believed they were an attempt to distract Russians from
the problems at home.
	   ``We are cautious,'' Latvian foreign ministry spokesman Andrejs
Pildegovics. ``If their political and economic crisis continues,
Russia might use external policies for internal domestic
purposes.''
	   Former Estonian foreign Minister Siim Kallas also had a mixed
view of Primakov.
	   ``He still bears a grudge against the Baltic states because they
broke aw ay from the Soviet Union,'' Kallas was quoted as telling
the Baltic News Service. ``He thinks their independence was
humiliating to Russia and he hasnt gotten over that yet.''
	   But Kallas he also said Primakov is pragmatic and shows
equanimity.
	   ``Though he may be surrounded by people who wouldn't mind
twisting a few arms, he has no dictatorial tendencies himself,'' he
said.
	   Lithuanian Foreign Minister Algirdas Saudargas said he was happy
the new Russian prime minister was a known entity.
	   ``He is highly valued as a predictable politician,'' BNS quoted
him as saying.

 &UR; Swissair plane in near miss with KLM aircraft
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with new information, including that both
planes involved were MD-11s, CORRECTS that near miss took place
southwest of Ireland; ADDs spokesman for KLM &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ A Swissair plane heading to New York from
Geneva with 151 people on board narrowly missed a KLM aircraft in
the skies southwest of Ireland on Friday, a spokesman for the Swiss
company said.
	   A collision was avoided thanks to electronic warning devices,
said Swissair spokesman Erwin Schaerer. He said there were no
injuries.
	   Both planes involved were MD-11s _ the same type as the Swissair
airliner that crashed in Canada last week, killing all 229 on
board. The route on which the incident took place was also the
same.
	   Swissair Flight 114 was flying at 10,500 meters (34,650 feet) in
the aviation district of Shanwick at 1330 GMT as the Dutch aircraft
approached, Schaerer said. He didn't give the distance between the
two aircraft.
	   The incident took place in the Shanwick Oceanic Airspace,
southwest of Ireland, said Louise Edwards, a senior manager at the
Irish Aviation Authority. The aviation jurisdiction comes under the
control of Britain's Civil Aviation Authority, she said.
	   A spokesman for the British agency said it could not immediately
comment on the incident, but had launched an investigation and was
talking to pilots from both planes.
	   Both aircraft had Traffic Collision Avoidance System equipment,
which made the Swissair airliner descend and the KLM aircraft rise,
Schaerer said. The equipment detects other aircraft ``a long way
ahead,'' he said without being more specific.
	   KLM spokesman Youssef Eddini said that the KLM flight, KL0752,
involved in the near miss was on a route from Curacao in the Dutch
Antilles to Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, and had landed safely at
the airport.
	   ``We are talking to the crew and the captain to find about what
has happened exactly,'' Eddini said.

Newspaper says Bulgaria abducted dissident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Bulgaria abducted a dissident from
Denmark in 1974 in the first of a series of defector killings that
included the notorious killing of Georgi Markov with a
poison-tipped umbrella, a Danish newspaper reported Friday.
	   The respected daily Berlingske Tidende said it discovered the
previously unknown abduction of Boris Arsov while investigating the
case of a Dane suspected in the Markov killing.
	   The newspaper said Bulgarian secret-police files showed that
Arsov was sedated and abducted from his home in Aarhus by
Bulgaria's agents.
	   It also said the files showed that Arsov was taken to Sofia, the
Bulgarian capital, where he died under unclear circumstances.
	   ``The kidnapping and murder of Arsov was a test case'' for other
killings, including Markov's, Bogdan Karayotov, a department chief
at the National Investigation Office in Sofia, was quoted as
telling the newspaper.
	   Officials at the Bulgarian embassy in Denmark declined to
comment on the report to The Associated Press.
	   British investigators long have suspected Bulgarian agents in
the unsolved murder of Markov, who died after being injected with
poison Sept. 7, 1978. Investigators determined a poison pellet was
fired into Markov from a mechanism
	   concealed in an umbrella.
	   Francesco Guillino of Denmark was charged by Danish authorities
in 1993 with collaborating with the Bulgarian secret service in the
murder.
	   He was freed while Danish police awaited further evidence from
Bulgaria, which never came. He left the country and is believed to
have settled in Hungary or Romania.
	   Bulgaria's post-Communist leaders have vowed to clear the Markov
case in an effort to clean up the country's image.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Early morning skies were clear but a little hazy across Puerto
Rico and the U.S. Virgin islands. By late in the morning a few
clouds had developed especially over the west interior to west.
There were no reports of showers, however, National Weather Service
Doppler radar indicated showers in the Caribbean coastal waters
south of St. Croix moving west. Temperatures rose quickly to 75 to
80 in the mountains and 90 along the coasts. Winds near calm became
east near 10 mph.
	   High pressure centered over the central Atlantic will produce a
light to moderate trade wind and relatively dry weather through
Saturday. There will be the chance for a thunderstorm or two over
west interior to west Puerto Rico in the afternoons. Any
thunderstorms which do develop will be very isolated. Two tropical
waves, one about 1,500 miles east and the other about 2,500 miles
east of Puerto Rico show no substantial development. These waves
are too far away to know what impact if any they will have on our
weather.
	   The strong winds of recent days have calmed down quite a bit.
This will mean calmer seas with pleasant marine conditions
especially for near shore recreational water activities during the
weekend.
 &UR; San Juan and north sections of Puerto Rico
	   Today ... Mostly sunny morning and hazy. Partly cloudy afternoon
with a 30 percent chance of showers. Slight chance of a
thunderstorm. High 90 to 95. Wind east 10 to 15 mph, except
northeast along the coast.
	   Tonight ... Becoming fair west. Partly cloudy east with a 20
percent chance of showers. Low 75 to 80. Wind light southeast.
	   Saturday ... Partly cloudy and hazy with a 20 percent chance of
showers. High near 90. Slight chance of afternoon thunderstorms,
mainly west and inland. Wind southeast 10 to 15 mph.
 &UR; East sections of Puerto Rico
	   Today ... Partly cloudy and hazy with a 20 percent chance of
showers. High near 90. Wind east to southeast 10 to 15 mph.
	   Tonight ... Partly cloudy and hazy with a 30 percent chance of
showers. Low 75 to 80. Wind east 5 to 10 mph.
	   Saturday ... Partly cloudy and hazy with a 20 percent chance of
showers. High near 90. Wind east to southeast 10 to 15 mph.
 &UR; Ponce and south sections of Puerto Rico

Clinton worries, perplexes Asians, Europeans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to UPDATE with Congress voting to release
report; INSERTS new graf 14 with additional French reaction. &QL; 
 &UR; By BRYAN BRUMLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Asians worried that the U.S. presidential crisis
could further destabilize the world economy. Russians had woes of
their own. And some Frenchmen wondered why a leader might lose his
office over a fling.
	   From Auckland to Amsterdam, commentators and common folks
gloomily watched the political drama surrounding U.S. President
Bill Clinton unfold on television, on the Internet and in the
press, as Congress voted to release the report by independent
prosecutor Kenneth Starr.
	   ``There is no doubt that a weakened presidency, its energy to
deal with global issues sapped, is bad news for the world,'' said
an editorial in Singapore's Straits Times newspaper.
	   ``Even if Clinton survives, his presidency is already dead,''
wrote the Washington correspondent of the Italian daily La
Repubblica. ``The forecasts for autumn aren't good: tempest over
Washington, rain on all of us.''
	   In Australia, Clinton's troubles knocked that country's national
election campaign off the front pages of newspapers, and were the
lead item of television and radio bulletins.
	   ``Two dark vans that drove (the report) to the Capitol were akin
to hearses arriving to take away the corpse of the Clinton
presidency,'' wrote the U.S. correspondent of The Sydney Morning
Herald.
	   Some stood by the American president, despite the erosion of
political support for Clinton in the United states.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he still regarded Clinton
as a ``very close friend and ally,'' and his office said he
intended to travel to the United Nations and meet with the U.S.
president there as planned later this month.
	   Across Asia, Europe and the Middle East, papers and people
expressed disbelief that Clinton's extramarital sexual relations
with Monica Lewinsky, and attempts to cover them up, should have so
weakened what many regard as a politically successful president.
	   In Tokyo, housewife Ayako Sugi called it ``a personal matter. So
long as he can do the job right, that's OK. I don't know if he
should resign. Things are going well in the America.''
	   ``I don't want a world recession,'' she said. ``And that could
happen if he does get impeached, given how bad things are
already.''
	   Those sentiments were echoed in Paris.
	   ``We always like to know who is with who, but we don't think it
is in any way related to his job and his public life,'' said Jean
Loup Demignieux, international director of France Television.
	   ``It's not a very French approach,'' said Emmanuel Delhomme, a
Paris bookseller. ``We're at the opposite of all that ... because
if tomorrow we had to do the same thing to our politicians, the
parliament would be empty.''
	   French newspapers were less forgiving.
	   ``The Clinton affair creates a climate of crisis in the world,''
the daily Le Monde said in a front-page headline. Le Figaro called
the matter ``a sad affair of sex in bad taste which goes beyond
anything one could have imagined.''
	   In France, as in many other countries, the intimate lives of
politicians are not newspaper fodder. Early on in the
Clinton-Lewinsky affair, many French people considered the issue a
private one. Former French President Francois Mitterrand had a
wife, a lover and out of wedlock daughter born before he became
president _ an open secret.
	   In China, where the private lives of the secretive Communist
Party leaders are off-limits, government-controlled reports on the
scandal have been matter-of-fact.
	   Despite the official silence, Chinese leaders and foreign policy
experts expresed concern that the crisis might imperil the
rapprochement Clinton and President Jiang Zemin symbolized in their
recent summit in Beijing.
	   ``China is very concerned. Many people here consider that steady
bilateral relations need a strong president,'' said Jin Canrong, an
America expert at the government-backed Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.
	   Russian media carried scant word of the events in Washington,
concentrating instead on the ongoing political and economic crisis
at home.
	   Likewise in Malaysia, papers focused on the government's own sex
scandal involving its sacked deputy prime minister, and frantic
preparations for Friday night's opening ceremonies of the 16th
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur.
	   And in Indonesia, many people questioned in downtown Jakarta
said they were unaware of the Washington scandal, which their
newspapers mostly ignored Friday, devoting attention instead to
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Comments by Russian political leaders on the
confirmation of Yevgeny Primakov as Russia's new prime minister:
	   President Boris Yeltsin, calling for measures to stabilize the
economy:
	   ``I understand that it's hard for everyone, but one cannot give
in to emotions.... We'll have to draw lessons from the current
crisis and now we'll have to work on overcoming it.''
	   Yevgeny Primakov, calling for greater state control over the
economy:
	   ``Nobody criticized Roosevelt when he introduced state controls
over the economy after the Great Depression. So what must we do?
Repeat the wild capitalism that we had up till now? Or use the
experience of other countries?''
	   ``Don't expect quick results. I am no magician. With the country
in such a state, we will do everything to stop its decline and
promote growth of the economy. Don't judge the government by its
first 100 days.''
	   Oleg Morozov, leader of moderate Russia's Regions faction:
	   ``Yevgeny Maksimovich, you have a chance to become the Russian
Roosevelt. You mustn't miss this chance.''
	   Konstantin Borovoi, independent liberal lawmaker:
	   ``What is going on here is a collusion between the president and
the Communists, to allow (the president) to stay in power by
backtracking on democratic reforms and free-market economy. We view
the latest developments as a Communist coup.''
	   Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal opposition faction
Yabloko:
	   ``Only Yevgeny Maksimovich Primakov could become the compromise
figure that would satisfy both the president and all parliamentary
factions.''
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov:
	   ``For the first time, some sort of a consolidated decision has
been made in society.''

Writers worried over increasing number of banished authors

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Alarmed by a growing number of exiled
novelists, playwrights and poets, delegates at an international
writers meeting pledged Friday to intensify the struggle for those
whom authorities have silenced by expulsion.
	   ``Governments and regimes are finding that a much better and
effective way of gagging writers than imprisonment is to expel
them,'' said Moris Farhi, head of the PEN committee of writers in
prison.
	   During the Soviet era, dissidents were sent to prisons and labor
camps, but now repression in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere
in the world is changing, Farhi said.
	   ``There's more harrassment, death threats and attacks on writers
and their families,'' said Farhi, a Turkish-born novelist and poet
who lives in England. ``We are very worried about it.''
	   Representing 70 countries, some 330 members of PEN, an
international writers association, wound up the week-long
conference by demanding the release of writers in prison and a halt
to harassment.
	   PEN says it has records of 600 cases of death threats, killings
or attacks against writers and journalists, of whom at least 11
have been killed this year.
	   Some 200 writers in Turkey are in jail facing charges of
anti-government action, and large numbers have been jailed and
attacked in Vietnam, Iran and South America, PEN members said.
	   To combat the problems faced by the growing number of banished
authors, PEN plans to form a committee for exiled writers.
	   ``Exiled writers may escape imprisonment, torture and murder,
but they end up in countries where they are in a completely new,
strange environment,'' said Kalevi Haikara, a member of the
committee founding group.
	   ``In such surroundings and often difficult situations, it's
almost impossible for them to work. They have such great problems I
don't know how we're going to solve them,'' Haikara said.
	   PEN members fear that the practice of expelling writers will
increase.
	   ``It's going to get worse, because it's so much easier to banish
writers than to mistreat or imprison them,'' said Farhi. ``We have
to be prepared to meet that challenge.''
	   PEN, which was founded in 1921 to promote freedom of speech and
cooperation between writers, has 14,000 members in 94 countries.
The writers in exile committee will be formed at its next annual
meeting in Warsaw, Poland in June.

Humanitarian groups overwhelmed in squalid Kosovo refugee camp

	   ISTINIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Humanitarian workers trickled on
Friday into a western Kosovo town teeming with thousands of
refugees, many ill, wounded and shell-shocked after fleeing
villages under Serb siege.
	   Most refugees fled to Istinic, from areas to the north and south
targeted by a police offensive that ousted the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army from one of their last strongholds almost a week
ago. Dozens were wounded and several killed by mortar shells and
bullets.
	   Many had already spent weeks in other refugee pockets where they
fled earlier fighting in the six-month conflict that has killed
hundreds and left more than a quarter of a million homeless in
Kosovo. The province is 90 percent ethnic Albanian, who
overwhelmingly seek independence, but belongs to Serbia, the
dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation.
	   Terry Heselius of the Oregon-based Mercy Corps said little
humanitarian aid has reached the pocket of refugees in Istinic,
about 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of the provincial capital of
Pristina.
	   ``I've been here five years but this is the worst I've seen,''
he said while dozens of refugees crowded around him to tell tales
of fear and misery.
	   Humanitarian workers said supplies to arrive Friday and Saturday
will be meager due to the need to care for at least 50,000 more
refugees who have fled to hills and forests after the conflict
began in late February.
	   On Friday, the main political leader of Kosovo Albanians joined
a chorus of calls for a halt to Serb military actions in Kosovo
where the growing refugee flow has alarmed international refugee
officials.
	   Ibrahim Rugova described the situation in Kosovo as critical and
worsening, although he stopped short of his usual calls for Western
intervention to stop attacks by Serbian police and the Yugoslav
army.
	   In recent months, NATO has repeatedly threatened to use force
and laid extensive plans for punitive military action while the
offensive in Kosovo continued unabated.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, a senior NATO dilpomat said Friday that
the U.S. administration sees a growing readiness in the alliance
for military action against Serbia even without prior approval from
the United Nations.
	   The allies have been prevented from taking a more forceful
stance over Kosovo by divisions over whether U.N. blessing is
needed for military action to halt President Slobodan Milosevic's
crackdown on the rebellion by ethnic Albanians.
	   John Shattuck, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human
Rights, warned again Thursday that Kosovo is headed for a
humanitarian catastrophe as the harsh Balkan winter approaches.
	   On Friday, tractors and trailers loaded with hastily packed
belongings jammed farm fields for kilometers around Istinic.
Refugees cooked what little food they had on open fires.
	   In a crowded field outside the town, one boy in his early teens
lay on his family's meager pile of clothing with a bullet in his
groin. A relative said the boy was shot when police attacked his
village several days ago.
	   A senior Serb police officer, whose colleagues had circled the
refugee camp, said he escorted thousands of refugees back to their
villages in the last two days. Some reporters at the scene
estimated around 10,000 refugees in the village _ fewer than in
previous days.
	   The police officer, who refused to identify himself, said his
men were collecting a few weapons still with the refugees and then
guaranteeing their safety.
	   However, several refugees said police loaded only six buses with
men, women and children and refused to let others leave.
	   Others said they were afraid to leave the refugee camp for fear
of police violence.
	   In Belgrade, chief Yugoslav prosecutor Vukasin Jokanovic
declared that Serb troops had crushed the rebels and arrested ``a
large number.'' Jokanovic said many ``terrorists'' would soon face
trial for ``terrorism and conspiracy against the state.''
	   U.N. officials, including Undersecretary-General Olara Otunnu,
planned to visit the refugees Friday. They hope their presence will
discourage police from arresting men and boys suspected of links to
the KLA.

Marion Jones wins 200-meter sprint in World Cup record time

 &UR; Eds: Updates with World Cup record in men's 100, Jones quotes,
other results &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY CHENAULT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ American Marion Jones raced to
victory Friday in the women's 200-meter sprint, leading from start
to finish to set a new World Cup record with a time of 21.62
seconds.
	   Sprinter Obadele Thompson of Barbados also set a new World Cup
record, winning the men's 100 meters in 9.87 seconds -- just off
the world mark of 9.84. Seun Ogunkoya of Nigeria was second at
9.92, with Britain's Dwain Chambers third at 10.03.
	   Jones' performance gave the American star the third-fastest time
ever in the women's 200, keeping her undefeated this year in
women's sprints and long jump competitions. Only Florence
Griffith-Joyner of the United States, holder of the world record at
21.34, has run faster than Jones in the women's 200.
	   The winning time was a personal best for Jones, which was the
goal she set coming into the World Cup _ her first race at high
altitude. But after the race, Jones said she felt hindered by the
thin air at Johannesburg Stadium because she had not adjusted to
the city's 1,650-meter altitude.
	   ``The altitude made me feel a little sluggish,'' she admitted.
``To run 21.62 today felt unbelievable.''
	   Despite her concerns about sluggishness, Jones said she wasn't
surprised by her speedy time. She also hinted that a record could
fall on Saturday, when she runs in the women's 100.
	   ``I'm looking forward to the 100 meters tomorrow. Any time I
step onto the track, I feel capable of setting a record,'' she
said.
	   The three-day, finals-only World Cup competition brings together
athletes from the United States, Africa, Europe, the Americas,
Oceania, Asia, and two European national squads to compete for team
honors. Britain and Germany compete in the men's field, while
Germany and Russia round out the women's competition.
	   In the women's 400-meter hurdles, Nezha Bidouane of Morocco sped
by world record-holder and race favorite Kim Batten of the United
States in the final strides to win.
	   Bidouane's time of 52.96 seconds set a new World Cup record in
getting the win for the Africas team. Batten, the pre-race
favorite, clipped the last hurdle with her foot and faded to third
in 53.17, behind Deon Hemmings of Jamaica at 53.03.
	   ``I was quite confident I would win,'' Bidouane said. ``I had a
good end to my season and I knew that the altitude in Johannesburg
would suit me. I'm happy to win the first gold medal for Africa.''
	   Zambia's Samuel Matete also thrilled the partisan African crowd
at Johannesburg Stadium, holding on to win the men's 400 hurdles in
48.08. Al-Nubi Mubarak of Qatar, representing the Asian team,
finished second in 48.17 and Dinsdale Morgan of Jamaica was third
at 48.40 for the Americas team.
	   ``This is great,'' Matete said. ``My fourth time in South Africa
and I never lose here.''
	   John Godina picked up another win for the United States in the
shot put with a heave of 21.48 meters. Aleksandr Bagach of the
Ukraine finished second at 20.45, and Germany's Oliveri-Sven Buder
was third at 20.42.
	   Nils Schumann claimed Germany's first victory in the men's 800,
with a time of 1 minute, 48.66 seconds. Mark Everett of the United
States took second at 1:48.73, with Cuba's Norberto Tellez third at
1:48.92.

U.S sees allies getting ready for action without UN nod
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The U.S. administration sees a growing
readiness in the NATO alliance for military action against Serbia
even without prior approval from the United Nations, a senior NATO
diplomat said Friday.
	   The allies have been prevented from taking a more forceful
stance over Kosovo by divisions over whether U.N. blessing is
needed for military action to halt President Slobodan Milosevic's
crackdown on the rebellion by ethnic Albanians.
	   In recent months, NATO has repeatedly threatened to use force
and laid extensive plans for punitive military action while
Milosevic's operations in Kosovo continued unabated, creating some
265,000 refugees.
	   However, France, in particular, has insisted a NATO campaign be
endorsed beforehand by the U.N. Security Council. Russia, opposed
to such intervention, could use its veto it.
	   The diplomat said talks the United States has had with officials
in France, Germany, Britain and other allies in recent weeks
revealed a hardening of views toward Milosevic and a desire not to
be held hostage by a Russian `no' in the U.N. Security Council.
	   ``Things are coming to a head,'' said the NATO diplomat, who
asked not to be identified.
	   ``No ally wants to see NATO blocked by the need to get a United
Nations mandate. Serbian security forces are still on the offensive
(in) actions that go beyond teaching the KLA a lesson.''
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence for
Kosovo, a Serbian province where 90 percent of the population is
ethnic Albanian.
	   The NATO diplomat predicted a continued ``accumulation of
horror'' in Kosovo will spark the allies into military action.
	   The official said Washington was winning the argument NATO can
pursue military action against Milosevic outside of the United
Nations.
	   In Washington's view, said the diplomat, one legal basis could
be the threat that fighting in Kosovo poses for stability in
Albania and other neighbors.
	   This week, NATO completed planning for military operations in
and around Kosovo aimed at forcing Milosevic and Kosovo Albanians
to sit down and negotiate a peaceful solution to their conflict.
	   NATO has worked out three basic options:
	   - A preventive deployment of NATO troops in Albania along the
border with Kosovo.
	   - Air operations inside Yugoslavia, both limited and full scale.
	   - Deployment of ground troops backed by air power to support a
cease-fire or a peace agreement for Kosovo. That could involve as
many as 60,000 troops. Such operations could involve both NATO
members and non-members.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In a rare show of accord, Russia's fractious
parliament Friday confirmed Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov after
he called for Russians to unite and conquer the worse economic
crisis since the Soviet collapse.
	   ``We need unity to come out of this very grave crisis,''
Primakov told the hushed State Duma, the lower chamber of
parliament, before he was approved by a 317-63 vote.
	   Assuming one of the world's toughest and most thankless jobs,
Primakov warned he had no easy solution for an economy shattered by
a plummeting currency, stagnant industry, restive regions and a
broke government.
	   ``Don't expect quick results. I'm no magician,'' Primakov warned
the legislators.
	   President Boris Yeltsin chose the 68-year-old, former foreign
minister and intelligence chief as a compromise candidate after his
previous pick, Viktor Chernomyrdin, was rejected twice by the
Communist-dominated Duma.
	   Primakov's nomination raised hopes on Russia's battered
financial markets. The price of the ruble was between 10 and 12 to
the U.S. dollar _ up from 17 a week ago.
	   Primakov said that the government would not abandon reforms to
build a market economy. ``Reforms are necessary. The present
situation cannot be overcome without them.''
	   At the same time, he called for a strong state role in
regulating the economy, but ruled out a return to the Soviet
economic system.
	   ``The government should intervene in economic affairs and
regulate them. This is not a return to the administrative and
command system,'' the communist economic mechanism, he said.
	   Instead, Primakov likened his proposed approach to emergency
measures taken by the U.S. government during the Great Depression
of the 1930s.
	   ``So what must we do? Repeat the wild capitalism that we had up
till now? Or use the experience of other countries?'' he asked.
	   Signaling he wanted broad political support, Yeltsin nominated
Viktor Gerashchenko to head the Central Bank. Gerashchenko, 60, had
led the Soviet State Bank and then Russia's Central Bank for nearly
three years until being ousted in October 1994 after the ruble
nosedived. Critics blamed Gerashchenko for fueling inflation with
huge credits to ailing industry and agriculture.
	   Yuri Maslyukov, 60, was named first deputy prime minister for
economic affairs. The two men have ties to the Communist Party, but
both have worked under Yeltsin before and are thought to favor
continuing reform with greater state supervision.
	   Primakov said that in order to improve the economy, the
government had to clean up its own household.
	   ``We need to strengthen discipline. We should stop this
sloppiness which now exists in the government,'' he said.
	   In a subtle slap at the previous government, Primakov pledged
that he would do everything to build up Russia's economic base,
including financial levers for investment.
	   ``Instead of destroying the financial and credit system in
place, we will use it for developing industry and the national
economy,'' he said. While the previous Cabinet's concentration on
increasing state revenues was important, privatization and
development of the tax system ``should serve not only fiscal
reasons ... but also restructure the economy, restructure industry
and rejuvenate fixed assets,'' he said.
	   Primakov warned that Russia was in danger of being split up, and
called for its disgruntled regions to be allowed more independence
from the center in decision-making. Many regions have already paved
the way by introducing price controls and other emergency measures
this week in an attempt to stave off economic disaster.
	   Primakov, 68, is seen as a technocrat, non-ideological and loyal
to Yeltsin. As foreign minister, Primakov won praise at home for
his efforts to restore some of Russia's diminished international
clout and create a ``multipolar'' world designed to counterbalance
U.S. dominance.
	   In a televised address to the nation before the Duma vote,
Yeltsin said a major crisis had been avoided by compromise. He
called for measures to stabilize prices, restore supplies to shops
and prop up the banking system.
	   ``I understand that it's hard for everyone, but one cannot give
in to emotions ... we'll have to draw lessons from the current
crisis and now we'll have to work on overcoming it,'' Yeltsin said.

Swiss hold services for Flight 111 victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Hundreds of Swiss mourners filled historic St.
Peter's Cathedral on Friday in one of three memorial services for
the victims of Swissair Flight 111.
	   ``The tragedy of Halifax has just sadly reminded of the
fragility of our life and the absurdity of our frantic
lifestyles,'' said Swiss President Flavio Cotti.
	   Cotti joined Philippe Bruggisser, chief executive of the
airline's parent, at the ecumenical service in the cathedral, John
Calvin's base during the Protestant Reformation.
	   Other government officials and Swissair representatives were
taking part in simultaneous service in St. Peter's Church in
Zurich. A similar memorial was planned for later Friday at Lincoln
Center in New York.
	   Switzerland declared a week of mourning for the victims of the
Sept. 2 crash, with flags around the country lowered to half staff.
A number of memorial services have already been held in
Switzerland, the United States and Canada.

Iran promises to avenge deaths of diplomats in Afghanistan

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran vowed revenge Friday and demonstrators
called for holy war against the Taliban militia because of the
killing of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan.
	   ``Death to the Taliban! Shame on Pakistan!'' shouted protesters
in a crowd of several hundred outside Tehran University after
Friday prayers, witnesses said.
	   Former President Hashemi Rafsanjani had told the prayer service
that Iran would avenge the killing of nine diplomats by the
Taliban, who are widely believed to be backed by Pakistan.
	   ``I condole the martyrs' families and promise them that we will
get revenge for their blood,'' said Rafsanjani, who heads a
government policy-making body.
	   Some of the demonstrators called for holy war against the
Taliban militia, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan,
witnesses told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
	   The Taliban said Thursday it had found the bodies of nine
Iranian diplomats and admitted that they had been killed by the
religious army's own troops. The disclosure was made in a letter
from the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
	   The United Nations, Britain, Germany and Greece condemned the
killings Friday. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel issued a
statement accusing the Taliban of ``grossly violating human
rights.''
	   The British, German and Greek statements described the killings
as ``murders'' and said the killers should be brought to justice.
	   The diplomats vanished Aug. 8 during a battle in which the
Taliban seized the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   For weeks, Iran accused the Taliban of holding some 70 Iranians,
including 11 diplomats and a journalist, but the Taliban denied any
knowledge of the whereabouts of the others.
	   Two other Iranian diplomats captured by the Taliban have escaped
from their captors, Iranian television reported Deputy Foreign
Minister Mohsen Aminzadeh as saying Friday.
	   Aminzadeh said one diplomat was injured but gave no further
details.
	   ``Efforts are underway to determine their exact whereabouts,''
he said, suggesting they were in Afghanistan or Pakistan.
	   The fate of the journalist, who works for Iran's Islamic
Republic News Agency, is not known.
	   Promises to avenge the diplomats' death also came from the
speaker of the Iranian parliament and the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps.
	   ``The revolutionary sons of Islamic Iran, by sacrificing their
own lives and through revolutionary wrath, shall give the
perpetrators of this crime what they justly deserve,'' the elite
fighting force said in a statement broadcast on Iranian television.
	   Some 70,000 Iranian soldiers _ backed by tanks and helicopter
gunships _ held three days of maneuvers near the Afghan border
earlier this month in a show of force.
	   Iran's army chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Ali Shahbazi, said more
maneuvers would be held on the border but did not give a date.
	   The U.S. State Department has expressed concern about rising
tensions between Iran and Afghanistan and has urged both sides to
exercise restraint, possibly seeking U.N. mediation.
	   But Rafsanjani warned the United States against interfering.
	   ``We reserve the right to protect and defend our national
interests and our nation. We keep this right and you will see that
we will act appropriately,'' he said.
	   Rafsanjani said Iran would act when it saw fit.
	   ``We definitely will punish these criminals but Iran will not
act in anger. We will have our plans, too,'' Rafsanjani said.

EU Commission wants to scrutinize UEFA multi-ownership rules
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ UEFA Secretary General Gerhard Aigner
said Friday the European soccer federation would likely investigate
whether to extend limits on soccer ownership to include teams being
owned by television rights holders.
	   Aigner's comments came after Manchester United was bought by
Rupert Murdoch's BskyB, which currently holds the rights to the
Premier League matches in England. It has raised fears Murdoch
would become too dominant in English soccer.
	   ``We will probably look into that with the professional football
committee,'' said Aigner after meeting with EU Competition
Commissioner Karel Van Miert.
	   He stressed ``we do that not because of particular concern but
because of an issue of general interest.'' He did not take a stand
on the issue.
	   Over the summer, UEFA already ruled that owners who control more
than one European club will only be allowed to enter one of their
teams in the same European club competition.
	   Aigner has said such closely intertwined ownership might affect
the integrity of the game.
	   Van Miert told Aigner Friday he wants to scrutinize that
decision to see whether it does not violate any EU rules. It might
raise issues of fair competition since UEFA has a monopoly on
European club competitions.
	   The 15-nation EU already proved it had vast authority over
soccer when it imposed the so-called Bosman ruling on the game in
1995, effectively launching free-agency and stripping any limits on
foreign EU players in the 18 national leagues.
	   UEFA's multi-ownership rule has already been successfully
challenged in the Lausanne-based Court of Sports Arbitration, and
Britain's ENIC company was allowed to field two of its teams, AEK
Athens and Slavia Prague, in the UEFA competition this year.
	   UEFA originally took the decision because of the increasing
trend in cross ownership of clubs from different nations.
	   The investment trust company ENIC has purchased AEK Athens, has
large stakes in Italy's Vicenza, Glasgow Rangers and in Slavia
Prague.
	   Aigner and Van Miert also discussed the plans for a breakaway
super league, which has been put forward by Milan-based marketing
firm Media Partners. UEFA plans to head off the breakaway by
reforming its own club competitions.

British release first seven terrorist prisoners under peace deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW for AMs

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The British government on
Friday began the slow and controversial process of releasing
convicted terrorists under terms of April's historic peace accord.
	   Three Irish Republican Army members and three pro-British
militants from the outlawed Ulster Defense Association walked free
from the top-security Maze prison southwest of Belfast at midday.
	   Most of those released had served only a third of their
sentences for a range of crimes, ranging from extortion and ``gross
bodily harm'' to bombings and attempted murders.
	   While the UDA men covered their faces as they left with
relatives, the IRA trio were welcomed by high-profile members of
the IRA's political allies, the Sinn Fein party
	   The Sinn Fein delegation included Brendan McFarlane, who led the
IRA prisoners' hunger strike inside the Maze that claimed 10 lives
in 1981, and Gerry Kelly, who led a mass breakout of 38 prisoners
there in 1983.
	   Meanwhile, at lower-security Magilligan prison near Londonderry,
another pro-British militant also won early parole from his
manslaughter conviction after brutally kicking a Catholic man to
death in 1995.
	   That convict had no formal links with either of the major
pro-British groups observing truces, the UDA or Ulster Volunteer
Force, but his crime was considered politically motivated under
terms of the accord.
	   April's accord specified that more than 400 IRA, UDA and UVF
prisoners should be freed by mid-2000 in reward for their
continuing cease-fires. The IRA called a cease-fire in July 1997,
while the UDA and UVF jointly called off their campaign of killing
Catholics in October 1994.
	   The agreement also allowed individual inmates convicted of
politically motivated offenses _ so noted because they were tried
in a no-jury court _ to apply for early paroles to an international
Sentences Review Commission.
	   Even as authorities began freeing those associated with
truce-observing groups, they were seeking convictions for those
opposed to the peace accord.
	   Two members of the outlawed Loyalist Volunteer Force were
charged Friday with murdering an imprisoned colleague in March.
	   Robin King, 32, and Ralph Phillips, 35, were charged with
torturing and slaying David Keys inside the Maze after accusing him
of passing information to police that had led to the arrest of
other Loyalist Volunteers.
	   The Loyalist Volunteers called their own truce in May in hopes
that their prisoners would become eligible for early release, but
the British government has rejected their claim.

Kusturica stands as main candidate for Golden Lion

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ As the competition at the film festival
here approaches its end, a movie by Yugoslav director Emir
Kusturica on Frida drew one of the longest applauses and stood as a
main candidate for the Golden Lion top award.
	   ``Black Cat, White Cat,'' a colorful, surrealistic tale set in a
Gypsy community along the Danube river, was filmed outside Belgrade
with non-professional actors.
	   A story about two families organizing a wedding, the movie is
full of eccentric shots that are typically Kusturica.
	   ``We can learn a lot from Gypsies,'' the director said Friday.
``They don't need weapons to be happy.''
	   Born in Sarajevo, Kusturica made a movie on the Yugoslav war in
1995, ``Underground,'' which earned him a Golden Palm at Cannes.
	   ``But there are no echoes of that tragedy'' in the new movie, he
said.
	   Also in competition Friday was ``Hurlyburly'' by American
director Anthony Drazan, with Chazz Palminteri, Kevin Spacey and

British gamblers betting on quick exit by Clinton

	   LONDON (AP) _ A London bookmaker is taking wagers about how long
U.S. President Bill Clinton can stay in office _ and gamblers think
they're onto a sure thing.
	   Every customer putting money on Clinton lately has bet he will
be out within six months, according to the IG Index bookies.
	   The bookmaker hopes Clinton _ the fabled ``Comeback Kid'' of
American politics _ can survive his sex-and-lies scandal so they
can make maximum profits, spokesman Paul Austin said Friday.
	   ``We want the president, from a purely selfish point of view, to
go on for a higher number of months,'' he said.
	   Other bookmakers are shying away from Clinton's dilemma, though
the fate of embattled British politicians would be fair enough
fodder for a bet.
	   ``If this was Tony Blair, we would be putting up odds and
changing them every five minutes,'' said William Hill betting chain
spokesman Graham Sharpe, referring to Britain's prime minister.
	   ``The problem we've got here is we're not at the center of
action. There are lots of people better informed on this than us,''
Sharpe said.
	   Rival bookie Ladbrokes said it takes wagers only on ``the
positive side of life.''
	   IG Index, which takes the Clinton bets, specializes in wagers on
stock market indexes _ like the Dow industrial average or London's
FT-SE 100.
	   It is offering ``spread betting'' on the president's staying
power.
	   Clinton is in the 20th month of a 48-month term, and gamblers
have two options: They can bet that he hangs on less than 26 months
or more than 30, with the payoffs _ or losses _ based on how long
he stays.
	   If he leaves this month, anybody who bet dlrs 10 that he will be
gone soon will win dlrs 60 _ dlrs 10 for each month short of the
spread. If Clinton leaves next month, the gambler would get dlrs
50, or dlrs 40 in November.
	   But if Clinton serves all 48 months, the gambler would lose dlrs
180 _ dlrs 10 for each month over 30 that Clinton stays.
	   One gambler put up 1,000 pounds (dlrs 1,700), risking a loss of
18,000 pounds (dlrs 30,600) if Clinton serves out his term, Austin
said.

Strategy issues to dominate in European central bankers' meeting

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from news conference &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Noting the world economy has ``clearly
worsened,'' European Central Bank president Wim Duisenberg on
Friday urged the 11 countries preparing to adopt a common currency
to cut back more on government spending to ensure stability.
	   Starting Jan. 1, the bank is to set financial policy for the 11
European Union members that are joining to launch the single
currency, called the euro.
	   Formulating that policy, though, has been made harder by
instability in the world economy caused by Russia's crisis, Asia's
recession and weakness in Latin America.
	   After a meeting of the bank's governing council, Duisenberg said
the focus was on ``recent economic, monetary and financial
developments.''
	   ``In particular, much attention was paid to the global ecomonic
and financial environment of the future euro area, which has
clearly worsened,'' he said.
	   But growth in Europe was still ``broadly on track'' and hasn't
been endangered by the turmoil, he said.
	   He noted that domestic demand is ``strong,'' and second quarter
growth continued to expand, ``albeit at a possibly more moderate
pace than in the first quarter.''
	   France this week cut its growth estimate for 1999 by 0.1 percent
to 2.7 percent, and Italy dramatically cut its forecast for this
year from 2.5 to 2 percent. Germany's economy grew a slight 0.1
percent in the second quarter.
	   Falling growth could cause the central bank early problems as
countries use reserves to fund their annual budgets. Under the
terms of monetary union, they are obliged to balance budgets or run
a surplus.
	   Duisenberg urged further budget cuts in 1999 to help ensure
currency stability.
	   No major decisions about monetary strategy were expected from
Friday's meeting; Duisenberg said the question was ``difficult.''
	   The problem is whether to base it on money supply data or
inflation data, with arguments over which is the more reliable tool
for tracking how the economy is performing. Financial markets are
keen for an answer.
	   ``There could be nothing worse than the bank having to say, in a
year or so, that they didn't choose the right way of doing it, and
having to change,'' hurting confidence in the new currency, said
Gerhard Greber, an economist at Frankfurt's Bank Julius Baer.
	   The ECB was set up in June. Its governing council comprises the
central bank chiefs of the 11 countries in the monetary merger:
Germany, France, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Austria, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium and Finland.
	   Four EU members are staying out of the currency union, at least
for now: Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece.

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Mountains of bird droppings
glistening on the rocks caught Captain Peter Duncan's eye.
Inspired, he claimed the stony outcrop off Haiti for the United
States.
	   That was 141 years ago, when ``guano,'' as the droppings are
politely called, was a popular fertilizer. Guano mining has
stopped, but a low-level dispute has simmered ever since.
	   Now, the quest for biodiversity has made the uninhabited island
of Navassa, declared by U.S. scientists to be ``a marvel of
biological treasures,'' fashionable again.
	   An expedition, organized by the Center for Marine Conservation
in Washington, last month announced the discovery of unique animal
and plant species on the two-square-mile (5-square-kilometer)
island.
	   That sparked a response from Haiti, which has claimed the ``Isle
de Navase,'' 40 miles (65 kilometers) off its southwestern
peninsula, since its independence from France in 1804.
	   Prominent Haitian scientists immediately formed the Navassa
Island Defense Group. ``Navassa island belongs to Haiti. It is only
fair that Haitian scientists be included in discovery
expeditions,'' said oceanographer Ernst Wilson, a group member.
	   The scientists plan an expedition this month to the island.
Haiti's Ministry of Environment also announced an expedition.
	   Haitian sensibilities were further injured by reports that
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt had warned that the U.S. Coast
Guard would shoot at any boats approaching the island.
	   Babbitt actually said that as a joke during a news conference in
Washington, where the discoveries were announced. His lighthearted
threat was aimed at possible U.S. ecotourists or divers eager to
explore Navassa's flourishing Coral Reefs.
	   Christopher Columbus discovered the island in 1504. But interest
came after phosphate- and nitrate-rich bird droppings were prized
as fertilizer and used to make gunpowder in the 19th century.
	   That brought a scramble to acquire uninhabited islands filled
with guano off South America and in the Caribbean. Disputes about
guano beds were one of the reasons for the Pacific War between
Chile and Peru, 1879-1883, in which Britain weighed in on Chile's
side, angering the United States and causing Washington to call the
first pan-American conference.
	   In 1856, Congress passed the U.S. Guano Act, which let any
uninhabited, guano-rich island be claimed as a U.S. territory,
causing numerous sovereignty disputes. Captain Duncan did just that
a year later, during the reign of Emperor Faustin Soulouque.
	   He sent an expedition to Navassa in 1858 to inform the
guano-mining company that he objected to the U.S. claim. Haiti sent
an official protest to Washington, which supported the U.S.
company.
	   In 1956, a resolution proposing that Haiti's claim to Navassa be
respected was presented to the U.S. Congress.
	   That went nowhere, but Haiti was undeterred. In 1981, the
government of former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier dispatched radio
amateurs there in an army helicopter. They planted a Haitian flag
in the ground and erected a pillar asserting Haitian sovereignty.
Then, for a couple of hours, they broadcast messages from ``Radio
Free Navassa.''
	   On Sept. 8, the Navassa Island Defense Group wrote to U.S.
Ambassador Timothy Michel Carney, inquiring on what grounds the
United States claimed Navassa.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. scientists plan more visits to the disputed
island. Their two-week expedition last month, the first by
scientists in three decades, yielded the discovery of 250 animal
and plants species.
	   They found 15 endemic species, including two lizards, Cyclura
nigerrima and Leicocephlus erimitus, previously thought to be
extinct.
	   ``We never dreamed that on a single visit the team would so
greatly increase our knowledge of the number of species,'' said
Roger McManus, president of the center. ``Uninhabited islands like
Navassa are the very best chance we have to understand and protect
the diversity of life in the Caribbean.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in introduction and 3rd item with Yeltsin confirmation
of Maslyukov. &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Thumbnails of Russia's new economic team _ the prime minister,
Central Bank chairman, and the deputy prime minister for economic
policy:
	   YEVGENY PRIMAKOV, prime minister: A former spymaster, the
68-year-old Middle East specialist has been Russia's foreign
minister since 1996. Primakov is known as a low-key but skillful
administrator and diplomat respected by hard-liners and liberals
alike. He has cool but cordial relations with the West, and has
pushed a foreign policy aimed at containing America's global
dominance. He has no experience running the economy and has rarely
expressed views on domestic matters.
	    &UR; ___
	   VIKTOR GERASHCHENKO, the new Central Bank chairman: A
bureaucratic holdover from the Soviet era, Gerashchenko, 60, was
head of the Soviet State Bank in 1991 and masterminded the currency
reform that cost many Russians their savings. Many economists also
blame Gerashchenko for fueling hyperinflation by printing rubles to
pay off state debts. Market reaction to his candidacy has generally
been negative.
	    &UR; ___
	   YURI MASLYUKOV, deputy prime minister for economic policy:
Maslyukov, 60, began his career as a defense industry engineer. In
1988, Mikhail Gorbachev named him chief of Gosplan, the huge Soviet
agency in charge of economic planning, and brought him into the
ruling Politburo in 1989. Unlike such senior Communists as Yeltsin,
Maslyukov remained in the party even after the failed
anti-Gorbachev coup and ensuing Soviet collapse. Last July, in an
effort to appease his hard-line opposition, Yeltsin made him trade
and industry minister.

Romania's Jews ask government to ban anti-Semitic publication
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The government has begun investigating
a virulently anti-Semitic weekly, state radio reported Friday, amid
calls by Romania's Jews that it be banned for inciting the ``mass
execution of Jews.''
	   Justice Minister Valeriu Stoica has asked the general prosecutor
to investigate the weekly, radio said. An editorial in the
influential Evenimentul Zilei daily recently condemned the weekly.
	   The Jewish Federation, which called for the ban, said the
government had known of its concerns for more than a year but had
done nothing.
	   Many of the articles in the xenophobic weekly called ``Attacking
the person'' are not signed. The weekly regularly labels
politicians of all parties ``dirty Jews,'' and there is a column
called `Swastika'
	   The rest of the tabloid is devoted to scurrilous and libelous
articles probing public people's private lives.
	   ``We say that there is a danger of xenophobic extremism, which
not only damages the Jewish population but the image of a
democratic Romania,'' said the statement from the Jewish community.
	   Some 14,000 Jews live in Romania. Before World War II there were
about 800,000. Half perished in the war, partly due to the policies
of pro-Hitler Marshal Ion Antonescu. Most of the rest emigrated to
Israel under communism.
	   The publisher of the weekly, Dumitru Dragomir, is head of
Romania's professional soccer league. He also owns the daily
Romanian Sport and several strip bars in Bucharest.

Iran promises to avenge deaths of diplomats in Afghanistan

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran vowed revenge Friday and demonstrators
called for holy war against the Taliban militia because of the
killing of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan.
	   ``Death to the Taliban! Shame on Pakistan!'' shouted protesters
in a crowd of several hundred outside Tehran University after
Friday prayers, witnesses said.
	   Former President Hashemi Rafsanjani told worshippers that Iran
would avenge the killing of nine diplomats by the Taliban, who are
widely believed to be backed by Pakistan.
	   ``I condole the martyrs' families and promise them that we will
get revenge for their blood,'' said Rafsanjani, who heads a
government policy-making body.
	   Some of the demonstrators called for holy war against the
Taliban militia, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan,
witnesses said on condition of anonymity.
	   The Taliban said Thursday it had found the bodies of nine
Iranian diplomats and admitted that they had been killed by the
religious army's own troops. The disclosure was made in a letter
from the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
	   The United Nations, Britain, Germany and Greece condemned the
killings Friday. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel issued a
statement accusing the Taliban of ``grossly violating human
rights.''
	   The British, German and Greek statements described the killings
as ``murders'' and said the killers should be brought to justice.
	   The diplomats vanished Aug. 8 during a battle in which the
Taliban seized the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   For weeks, Iran accused the Taliban of holding some 70 Iranians,
including 11 diplomats and a journalist, but the Taliban denied any
knowledge of the others' whereabouts.
	   Two other Iranian diplomats captured by the Taliban have escaped
from their captors, Iranian television reported Deputy Foreign
Minister Mohsen Aminzadeh as saying Friday.
	   Aminzadeh said one diplomat was injured but gave no further
details.
	   ``Efforts are underway to determine their exact whereabouts,''
he said, suggesting they were in Afghanistan or Pakistan.
	   The fate of the journalist, who works for Iran's Islamic
Republic News Agency, is not known.
	   Promises to avenge the diplomats' death also came from the
speaker of the Iranian parliament and the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps.
	   ``The revolutionary sons of Islamic Iran, by sacrificing their
own lives and through revolutionary wrath, shall give the
perpetrators of this crime what they justly deserve,'' the elite
fighting force said in a statement broadcast on Iranian television.
	   Some 70,000 Iranian soldiers _ backed by tanks and helicopter
gunships _ held three days of maneuvers near the Afghan border
earlier this month in a show of force.
	   Iran's army chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Ali Shahbazi, said more
maneuvers would be held on the border but did not give a date.
	   The U.S. State Department has expressed concern about rising
tensions between Iran and Afghanistan and has urged both sides to
exercise restraint, possibly seeking U.N. mediation.
	   But Rafsanjani warned the United States against interfering.
	   ``We reserve the right to protect and defend our national
interests and our nation. We keep this right and you will see that
we will act appropriately,'' he said.
	   Rafsanjani said Iran would act when it saw fit.
	   ``We definitely will punish these criminals but Iran will not
act in anger. We will have our plans, too,'' Rafsanjani said.

warehouse for compact discs, and confiscated 30,000 pirate CDs, the
Interior Ministry announced.
	   The detainees, Kiril Kirchev, 30, and Ivan Simeonov, 28, are
representatives of Puldin Music Ltd., a private Bulgarian recording
business. The two have police records for selling pirate CDs, a
ministry statement said.
	   Police in Varna, 500 kilometers (312 miles) northeast of Sofia,
arrested them after raiding a warehouse where the illegal copies
were wrapped for sale.
	   It was not immediately clear where the CDs were produced.
	   Western officials have recently praised Bulgaria's government
for imposing stringent controls on compact disc makers and traders
in an effort to crack down on copyright piracy, which prior
governments had tolerated.
	   Since enacting tougher legislation to protect copyright,
Bulgaria has seized about a half-million illegal compact discs and
started to scrutinize makers through a new system of licensing
requirements.
	   A government commission has allowed the reopening of only two of
the country's 11 compact disc production lines after sealing them
and putting them under 24-hour police guard in February.

Lombardi of Italy wins seventh leg of Tour of Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VALENCIA, Spain (AP) _ Italy's Giovanni Lombardi of Telekom won
the seventh leg of the Tour of Spain on Friday in a photo finish.
	   But Spain's Jose Maria Jimenez of Banesto held on as overall
leader, ahead of Roberto Heras, a fellow Spaniard riding for
Kelme-Costa Blanca, and Frenchman Laurent Jalabert of ONCE-Deutsche
Bank.
	   Lombardi covered 186 kilometers (116 miles) between Alicante and
Valencia in a time of 4 hours, three minutes and 49 seconds.
	   Officials who examined a photo of the finish gave second place
to Jeroen Blijlevens, a Dutchman riding for TVM, and third to
Germany's Marcel Wust of Festina. They were credited with the same
time as Lombardi.
	   The finish was in sharp contrast to a five-minute advantage
opened up earlier by a breakaway group of three riders _ Italians
Mariano Piccoli of Brescialat and Maurizio Frizzo of Cantina, and
Belgian Ludo Dierckxens of Lotto.
	   The cushion dwindled gradually, and the pack caught up with six
kilometers left to go in the race.
	   Saturday's eighth leg takes the riders to the Mediterranean
island of Mallorca for a 181.5 kilometer (113 mile) trek that
begins and ends in its capital city.

Former apartheid foreign minister denies involvement in London

bombing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Sixteen years after the London
offices of the ANC were bombed, shock waves continued hitting top
apartheid government officials Friday, with a former foreign
minister denying involvement.
	   Former Foreign Minister Pik Botha, appearing at an amnesty
hearing of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said he would
have objected to the attack if he had known about it beforehand,
and suggested he would have resigned if it had still been carried
out over his objections
	   The former head of the apartheid police, Gen. Johann Coetzee, is
among eight former security figures applying for amnesty for the
1982 attack. Coetzee testified Tuesday that the bombing was ordered
by the apartheid government to protest British opposition to
apartheid and to break the morale of the African National Congress.
	   Botha, who has not been directly implicated in the attack and is
not seeking amnesty for it, said he and then British Foreign
Minister Lord Carrington had been on excellent terms and that he
would not have wanted to jeopardise the relationship with such an
attack.
	   ``Only the ANC could gain from an incident like that,'' Botha
told the South African Press Association during a break in the
hearing. ``They were being ignored by the British press at the
time, but the blast gave them all the publicity they needed to
strengthen their position.''
	   The attack reportedly caused only one injury _ to an ANC
volunteer who cut his foot on broken glass after the bombing.
	   Botha may be called to give evidence at the hearing next week
about alleged foreign ministry involvement in the bombing.
	   He denied to SAPA that the explosives were transported to London
through the diplomatic bag, saying the Department of Defense had
its own means of delivery between South Africa and the military
attache's office in London.
	   The ANC, which at the time was waging a military-style campaign
against apartheid, went on to win the 1994 elections.
	   The Truth Commission, which has been investigating apartheid-era
atrocities, can grant amnesty to those who fully confess to
politically motivated crimes.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran won the World Wrestling Championships
Friday with its wrestlers claiming a total of six medals.
	   Despite the dismal 6-0 loss of Iran's 130 kilo champion Rasul
Khadem to Cuban Alexis Rodriguez, Iran was able to maintain its
lead with two wrestlers grabbing gold in other categories.
	   Russia claimed second place with three medals, beating the
United States on point difference.
	   Iran won three gold medals, two silver and one bronze while
Russia and the United States each won one gold and two bronze
medals.
	   Rodriguez astonished and silenced the capacity crowd in the
Azadi arena, completely dominating the match against Khadem, who
was tipped before the encounter to easily take gold.
	   The fans were compensated for Khadem's loss as two other
Iranians, Ali Reza Dabir and Ali Reza Heydari, defeated their
opponents to win gold.
	   Lincoln McIlravy of the United States won the bronze after
defeating Canada's D. Egali 4-1.
	   Throughout the four-day tournament, Iranian fans celebrated the
participation of the American wrestlers by cheering for them at
every opportunity.
	   A U.S. wrestling team came here in February to compete in a
locally organized competition in the first official visit by
Americans to Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   The return of the U.S. athletes is important to many Iranians,
who see it as further proof of the potential for improving
relations with the United States, long condemned by militant
Iranians as ``The Great Satan.''
	   On Thursday, and for the first time since the revolution, the
American flag was raised and the Star-Spangled Banner was played in
Iran after Sam Henson won the gold medal in the 54 kilo category.

Writers worried over increasing number of banished authors

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Alarmed by a growing number of exiled
novelists, playwrights and poets, delegates at an international
writers meeting pledged Friday to intensify the struggle for those
whom authorities have silenced by expulsion.
	   ``Governments and regimes are finding that a much better and
effective way of gagging writers than imprisonment is to expel
them,'' said Moris Farhi, head of the PEN committee of writers in
prison.
	   During the Soviet era, dissidents were sent to prisons and labor
camps, but now repression in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere
in the world is changing, Farhi said.
	   ``There's more harrassment, death threats and attacks on writers
and their families,'' said Farhi, a Turkish-born novelist and poet
who lives in England. ``We are very worried about it.''
	   Representing 70 countries, some 330 members of PEN, an
international writers association, wound up the week-long
conference by demanding the release of writers in prison and a halt
to harassment.
	   PEN says it has records of 600 cases of death threats, killings
or attacks against writers and journalists, of whom at least 11
have been killed this year.
	   Some 200 writers in Turkey are in jail facing charges of
antigovernment action, and large numbers have been jailed and
attacked in Vietnam, Iran and South America, PEN members said.
	   To combat the problems faced by the growing number of banished
authors, PEN plans to form a committee for exiled writers.
	   ``Exiled writers may escape imprisonment, torture and murder,
but they end up in countries where they are in a completely new,
strange environment,'' said Kalevi Haikara, a member of the
committee founding group.
	   ``In such surroundings and often difficult situations, it's
almost impossible for them to work. They have such great problems I
don't know how we're going to solve them,'' Haikara said.
	   PEN members fear that the practice of expelling writers will
increase.
	   ``It's going to get worse, because it's so much easier to banish
writers than to mistreat or imprison them,'' said Farhi. ``We have
to be prepared to meet that challenge.''
	   PEN, which was founded in 1921 to promote freedom of speech and
cooperation between writers, has 14,000 members in 94 countries.
The writers in exile committee will be formed at its next annual
meeting in Warsaw, Poland in June.

Military unrest reported in Lesotho

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement from army &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Several dozen mutinying soldiers were
holed up Friday at military headquarters and were surrounded by
loyal troops, a U.S. diplomat said.
	   The army, in a statement on state-controlled radio, tried to
reassure the this mountain kingdom's 2 million residents, known as
Basothos, that the government's stability was not threatened.
	   ``The king, the Basotho nation and the world at large should not
be worried about the present situation within the defense force,''
the announcement said.
	   Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili and his Cabinet carried out
their functions as normal on Friday, the South African Press
Association reported.
	   Gunshots were heard earlier in the day at the military
headquarters. It was unclear who fired or whether there were any
casualties, according to the U.S. deputy chief of mission, Raymond
Brown.
	   ``There was a mutiny by a small armed group _ maybe one or two
platoons of soldiers who have objected to the retirement of a
colonel whom they have an association with,'' Brown said in a
telephone interview. The colonel, identified only by his surname,
Motene, was forced to retire for unspecified reasons, Brown said.
	   The mutiny was occurring amid upheaval over general elections
last May which opposition parties have branded as fraudulent.
	   Brown said the mutineers' motives were unclear, but noted that
the 2,000-member Lesotho military has a history of dividing into
political factions.
	   ``It's conceivable that this activity may be associated with
that,'' Brown said, stressing that the situation remained confused.
	   Another diplomat said a senior dissident army officer and nine
of his followers were arrested Friday morning. Their identities
were not immediately known and it was unclear what link, if any,
they had with Motene.
	   The 10 resisted arrest and were put into a maximum security
prison, said Colette Mason, an official with the British Embassy in
Maseru, the capital.
	   King Letsie III had reportedly ordered the arrest of the senior
officer. The motive was unclear. Government offices were closed and
no one was answering the telephone there for further comment.
	   Lesotho, which is surrounded by South Africa, has a turbulent
past.
	   In early 1994, an army rebellion killed Deputy Prime Minister
Selometsi Baholo. The following August, King Letsie _ the current
king's late father _ dismissed the government, then restored it a
month later after mediation by southern African diplomats.
	   Supporters of the three main opposition parties claim the
election last May was rigged in favor of the ruling party, which
won 79 of 80 seats in the National Assembly.

	   ISTINIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Humanitarian workers trickled on
Friday into a western Kosovo town teeming with thousands of
refugees, many ill, wounded and shell-shocked after fleeing
villages under Serb siege.
	   Most refugees fled to Istinic, from areas to the north and south
targeted by a police offensive that ousted the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army from one of their last strongholds almost a week
ago. Dozens were wounded and several killed by mortar shells and
bullets.
	   Many had already spent weeks in other refugee pockets where they
fled earlier fighting in the six-month conflict that has killed
hundreds and left more than a quarter of a million homeless in
Kosovo. The province is 90 percent ethnic Albanian, who
overwhelmingly seek independence, but belongs to Serbia, the
dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation.
	   Terry Heselius of the Oregon-based Mercy Corps said little
humanitarian aid has reached the pocket of refugees in Istinic,
about 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of the provincial capital of
Pristina.
	   ``I've been here five years but this is the worst I've seen,''
he said while dozens of refugees crowded around him to tell tales
of fear and misery.
	   Humanitarian workers said supplies to arrive Friday and Saturday
will be meager due to the need to care for at least 50,000 more
refugees who have fled to hills and forests after the conflict
began in late February.
	   On Friday, the main political leader of Kosovo Albanians joined
a chorus of calls for a halt to Serb military actions in Kosovo
where the growing refugee flow has alarmed international refugee
officials.
	   Ibrahim Rugova described the situation in Kosovo as critical and
worsening, although he stopped short of his usual calls for Western
intervention to stop attacks by Serbian police and the Yugoslav
army.
	   In recent months, NATO has repeatedly threatened to use force
and laid extensive plans for punitive military action while the
offensive in Kosovo continued unabated.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, a senior NATO dilpomat said Friday that
the U.S. administration sees a growing readiness in the alliance
for military action against Serbia even without prior approval from
the United Nations.
	   The allies have been prevented from taking a more forceful
stance over Kosovo by divisions over whether U.N. blessing is
needed for military action to halt President Slobodan Milosevic's
crackdown on the rebellion by ethnic Albanians.
	   John Shattuck, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human
Rights, warned again Thursday that Kosovo is headed for a
humanitarian catastrophe as the harsh Balkan winter approaches.
	   On Friday, tractors and trailers loaded with hastily packed
belongings jammed farm fields for kilometers around Istinic.
Refugees cooked what little food they had on open fires.
	   In a crowded field outside the town, one boy in his early teens
lay on his family's meager pile of clothing with a bullet in his
groin. A relative said the boy was shot when police attacked his
village several days ago.
	   A senior Serb police officer, whose colleagues had circled the
refugee camp, said he escorted thousands of refugees back to their
villages in the last two days. Some reporters at the scene
estimated around 10,000 refugees in the village _ fewer than in
previous days.
	   The police officer, who refused to identify himself, said his
men were collecting a few weapons still with the refugees and then
guaranteeing their safety.
	   However, several refugees said police loaded only six buses with
men, women and children and refused to let others leave.
	   Others said they were afraid to leave the refugee camp for fear
of police violence.
	   In Belgrade, chief Yugoslav prosecutor Vukasin Jokanovic
declared that Serb troops had crushed the rebels and arrested ``a
large number.'' Jokanovic said many ``terrorists'' would soon face
trial for ``terrorism and conspiracy against the state.''
	   U.N. officials, including Undersecretary-General Olara Otunnu,
planned to visit the refugees Friday. They hope their presence will
discourage police from arresting men and boys suspected of links to
the KLA.

Muhammad Ali concludes visit to Havana

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Muhammad Ali and his wife, Lonnie, on Friday
concluded what they described as a nonpolitical trip to Cuba with a
call for the end of the U.S. economic embargo against the island
nation.
	   That isn't a contradiction, said Lonnie Ali, who speaks on
behalf of her husband, a former boxing heavyweight champion. She
said she doesn't see criticizing the embargo as a political act.
	   ``I think human suffering transcends barriers. I don't think
politics should ever be involved in that,'' she said in an
interview. ``You cannot deny someone health and assistance based on
politics. It's ridiculous.''
	   ``If Americans would come over here and watch these people here
or go to Iraq and watch those babies die in front of their eyes, I
don't think any of them would stand for that.''
	   The Alis, along with actor Ed Asner and his wife, Cindy, were in
Havana this week as part of a visit by officials from two U.S. aid
groups: Direct Relief of Santa Barbara, California, and the New
York-based Disarm Education Fund.
	   The two groups recently donated dlrs 1.2 million in medical
supplies to Cuba and were spending three days touring Cuban
hospitals and clinics. Ali and Asner also visited a Special
Olympics training center and met with Cuban athletes and actors.
	   The visit and the aid were approved by the U.S. government,
which maintains an economic embargo on the communist nation in an
attempt to force democratic changes. Humanitarian aid is allowed,
but Cuban officials say the sanctions still make it difficult to
obtain supplies.
	   Lonnie Ali said she was impressed by ``the ability of these
people to carry on and make progress in spite of having nothing.''
	   Muhammad Ali, who has speaking difficulties stemming from
Parkinson's disease, said little during his visit, but he shook
hands, kissed children, performed magic tricks and, at the training
center, took a few basketball shots, hitting the basket from almost
3-point range.
	   Asner, best known for his television role as Lou Grant in ``The
Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' said he was impressed with Cuba's medical
system, which provides free medical care to all citizens.
	   ``They're coping very well,'' he said. ``I'd say their program
is better than the HMO program we have in the States.''
	   Asner added, though, that they saw only parts of the medical
system that were part of the government tour. ``So we're not
experts on it, but it certainly bears further inquiry and
examination and observation.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin confirmed a new foreign
minister for Russia on Friday _ Igor Ivanov, a former deputy to
newly approved Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Ivanov, 52, has served in the ministry since 1973. A former
ambassador to Spain, he has held the post of first deputy foreign
minister since December 1993.
	   In his speech before the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament that approved him as prime minister, Primakov set out
the main goals of his new government's foreign policy.
	   ``Our foreign policy should be democratic and predictable,
defend our national interests and at the same time steer clear from
confrontation with other nations,'' Primakov said. ``We don't need
confrontation, a return to the Cold War.''
	   Primakov's first foreign policy test in his new job is likely to
be his attempt to persuade the Duma to ratify the U.S.-Russian
START II arms control treaty.
	   What they say about it damaging our security isn't true,''
Primakov told the Duma. ``I will ask lawmakers to look deeper into
that problem.

Swissair plane in near miss with KLM aircraft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Britain's Civil Aviation Authority saying three
planes involved in incident, possible Swissair explanation for
that, definition of near miss &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ A Swissair plane heading to New York from
Geneva with 151 people on board narrowly missed a KLM aircraft in
the skies southwest of Ireland on Friday, a spokesman for the Swiss
company said.
	   Swissair spokesman Erwin Schaerer said a collision with the KLM
plane was avoided thanks to electronic warning devices. He said
there were no injuries.
	   In London, the Civil Aviation Authority said it had launched an
investigation into the incident, which a spokeswoman said involved
three planes in two air misses.
	   One of the three aircraft flew ``into close proximity with the
other two,'' said the spokeswoman, who would not allow her name to
be used.
	   She said two MD-11s and a Boeing 767 were involved, but provided
no other details about the third plane.
	   Swissair said the agency might be confused about the number of
planes because the airline initially identified the KLM jet as a
Boeing jumbo.
	   The incident took place 450 miles (720 kms) west of Ireland at
1330 GMT in the Shanwick Oceanic Airspace, which stretches from
Ireland to the mid-Atlantic, the CAA spokeswoman said. The area
comes under the United Kingdom CAA's control.
	   The Swissair MD-11 is the same type of airliner that crashed in
Canada last week, killing all 229 on board. The route on which the
incident took place was also the same.
	   Schaerer, the Swissair spokesman, said Flight 114 was flying at
10,500 meters (34,650 feet) as the Dutch aircraft approached. He
didn't give the distance between the two aircraft.
	   Both aircraft had Traffic Collision Avoidance System equipment,
which made the Swissair airliner descend and the KLM aircraft rise,
Schaerer said. The equipment detects other aircraft ``a long way
ahead,'' he said without being more specific.
	   KLM spokesman Youssef Eddini said that his airline's Flight
KL0752 was en route from Curacao in the Dutch Antilles to
Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, and went on to land safely at
Schiphol.
	   ``We are talking to the crew and the captain to find about what
has happened exactly,'' Eddini said.
	   The CAA said that it had received two ``airprox'' reports from
pilots involved in the near miss. An airprox is when one aircraft
strays into what is considered the space of another.

Russian ruble continues recovery, stocks waver
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks ended lower in thin trading Friday
amid investors' worries over what kind of economic policies are
likely under the new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov.
	   However, the denouement of Russia's political crisis appeared to
buoy the ruble, which ended at 11.7 to the dollar _ up from more
than 13 on Thursday.
	   Primakov's approval as prime minister seemed to assuage the
markets' worries over possible political and social chaos, but it
raised concerns over the government's economic program, traders
said.
	   The stock market closed at 62.31 points, down 3.5 percent from
Thursday. Trading volume dropped to dlrs 2.2 million from dlrs 3.1
million Thursday.
	   ``The market was down because there may be political stability
but the economic reforms may move ahead much more slowly,'' said
Dmitry Kryukov, a trader at MFK Renaissance.
	   Primakov announced Friday that Yuri Maslyukov, the head of the
Duma's committee for economic policy and former head of the
Soviet-era planning agency Gosplan, will serve as first deputy
prime minister.
	   Later. the Duma voted to confirm Viktor Gerashchenko as Central
Bank chairman _ a post he held until he was ousted in 1994 after
the ruble collapsed and inflation soared.
	   ``These two appointments, Maslyukov and Gerashchenko, aren't
encouraging and aren't likely to boost investors' confidence,''
Kryukov said.
	   Meanwhile, Russia defaulted on a portion of its interest payment
on Paris Club debt due in August, Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail
Kasayanov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   In August Russia paid dlrs 115 million as interest on its
rescheduled Soviet debt, also called the Paris Club debt. But this
represented only a fraction of what Russia was supposed to pay.
	   ``The remainder will be paid as soon as the Russian payment
system is restored,'' he said, adding that improved tax and customs
duty collections will help solve the payment delay.
	   Recently, the Russian government has said repeatedly it will
increase its tax and custom collections. Earlier this week, the
government tightened control over the country's largest taxpayers,
including 14 oil companies and natural gas giant Gazprom.
	   Part of the delayed interest payment affected Germany, to which
Russia was supposed to pay 800 million German marks by Aug. 31. The
delay is believed to be the first by Russia on its sovereign debt
interest payments to an official creditor nation since the crisis
began, the Financial Times reported Friday.

Zimbabwe modifies plan for land seizures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details on status of farms struck from seizure list,
issue of compensation to white farmers &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Pressured by donor countries, the
government on Friday eased its plan to take farmland from whites
and give it to landless blacks.
	   In a dramatic gesture, President Robert Mugabe's administration
struck 512 farms off the list of 1,400 properties comprising 5
million hectares (12 million acres) it had targeted for
nationalization over five years. The amount of land the 512 farms
comprises was not immediately disclosed, but it was expected to be
significant.
	   Rural Development Minister John Nkomo told an aid conference of
representatives of some 40 nations that the government would heed
the demands of donor nations and institutions for transparency and
better economic management of the land redistribution plan.
	   Nkomo said there was no going back on land redistribution to
blacks in a nation where about 4,000 whites own a third of the
land. But Nkomo declared aid donors would be fully consulted during
a 24-month ``inception period'' when the government planned to
resettle landless blacks ``with an appropriate aptitude for
agriculture'' on 1 million hectares (2.4 million acres) of land.
	   After the close of the three-day meeting Friday, Agriculture
Minister Kumbirai Kangai said the government still wanted 5 million
hectares for resttlement. He said underutilized or derelict
properties would be confiscated to make up for the 512 reprieved
farms.
	   Most of the reprieved farms were targeted erroneously, he said.
In another sign of government softening of its land-seizure policy,
Kangai said the government would allow some white farmers who hand
over sections of their properties to keep a workable amount of land
for themselves.
	   Farmers facing seizures would be due full compensation according
to the law, Kangai said. But he added that if donors didn't provide
money for the government to compensate for seized land, it would
pay only for buildings and improvements on the land, and not the
land itself.
	   The government in the past has argued that whites don't deserve
compensation for the land itself because it had been taken from
blacks in the colonial era by mostly British settlers.
	   The government has this year acquired 118 farms whose owners did
not contest seizure, and resettlement there will start immediately,
said Zimbabwe Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge.
	   Western financial institutions who have pumped aid into Zimbabwe
have demanded guarantees that farm production and investor
confidence not be harmed by land seizures.
	   Aid donors insist land reform honors constitutional and
ownership rights, including compensation linked to the market value
of land, before they will provide aid.
	   Jos Schellar, representing Holland, said his nation was willing
to support the government's commitment to ``a step by step approach
that would be more efficient and cost effective.''
	   Since independence in 1980, some 70,000 black families have been
resettled on former white-owned farms, but the program has been
plagued by delays, mismanagement and corruption, with some
properties going to politicians and their cronies.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Friday
condemned the Taliban religious militia's slayings of nine Iranian
diplomats in northern Afghanistan and called for the safe return of
other missing Iranians.
	   Following threats by Iran to retaliate against the Taliban for
the deaths, Annan urged both Afghanistan and Iran to ``refrain from
any action which might be construed by others as provocative.''
	   Eleven Iranian diplomats vanished from the northern Afghan city
of Mazar-e-Sharif after the Taliban religious militia seized the
city from rival forces on Aug. 8.
	   After a month of denying any involvement in the disappearances,
the Taliban acknowledged responsibility for the deaths of nine of
the 11 in a letter to Annan on Thursday from the militia's supreme
leader, Mullah Omar.
	   There was no word on the fate of the other two diplomats.
	   ``The secretary-general strongly condemns these cruel murders
and violations of international law,'' spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
``He calls for an urgent investigation so that the perpetrators can
be brought to justice.''
	   The United Nations is consulting with Iran and Pakistan about
forming a mission to investigate the deaths. Iran had requested
such a mission, and Pakistan, which has ties to the Taliban, agreed
to it. The three players were looking into how such a mission would
be organized and its security guaranteed, Eckhard said.
	   Iran on Thursday asked the U.N. Security Council to convene an
urgent meeting on what it said was a war crime committed by
Afghanistan's Taliban leaders.
	   The council held an emergency briefing and in a statement
condemned ``these heinous acts and violations of international
law,'' council president Hans Dahlgren of Sweden said.
	   Though the Taliban has no representation at the United Nations,
Mullah Omar called for the world body to resolve the issue, saying
Iran was interfering in neighboring Afghanistan's internal matters
by backing the opposition. He warned that the Taliban wouldn't be
responsible for the consequences if Iran failed to do so.
	   Iran recently intensified military activities on the Afghan
border in what United States and other experts have said could be a
prelude to a military retaliation.
	   Last week, Iran conducted a massive exercise, with 70,000
troops, warplanes and tanks, on the border. Earlier Thursday,
Iran's army chief said fresh maneuvers would be held near the
frontier. He did not say when the new exercises would start.
	   The Taliban militia has vowed to respond to any Iranian military
strike.

Ukraine's parliament bans privatization of alcohol plants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's leftist-dominated parliament on
Friday banned privatization of plants producing alcoholic drinks,
vetoing a corresponding decree signed by President Leonid Kuchma
earlier this year.
	   Some 236 deputies in the country's 450-seat parliament voted
against privatization of alcohol plants, from which the government
hoped to raise 300 million hryvna (dlrs 120 million).
	   The ban, which affects the 73 of Ukraine's 168 still
un-privatized alcohol plants, signals a continuing feud between
Kuchma and parliament over privatization.
	   On Thursday, lawmakers rejected Kuchma's nominee to head the
state privatization agency, raising doubts over the government's
promises to speed the distribution of state property.
	   Ukraine has earned a meager 250 million hryvna (dlrs 99 million)
from privatization since the beginning of 1998, and the figure has
remained virtually unchanged since June.

Lombardi of Italy wins seventh leg of Tour of Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VALENCIA, Spain (AP) _ Italy's Giovanni Lombardi of Telekom won
the seventh leg of the Tour of Spain in a photo finish Friday.
	   But Spain's Jose Maria Jimenez of Banesto held on as overall
leader, ahead of Roberto Heras, a fellow Spaniard riding for
Kelme-Costa Blanca, and Frenchman Laurent Jalabert of ONCE-Deutsche
Bank.
	   Lombardi covered 186 kilometers (116 miles) between Alicante and
Valencia in a time of 4 hours, three minutes and 49 seconds.
	   Officials who examined a photo of the finish gave second place
to Jeroen Blijlevens, a Dutchman riding for TVM, and third to
Germany's Marcel Wust of Festina. They were credited with the same
time as Lombardi.
	   The finish was in sharp contrast to a five-minute advantage
opened up earlier by a breakaway group of three riders _ Italians
Mariano Piccoli of Brescialat and Maurizio Frizzo of Cantina, and
Belgian Ludo Dierckxens of Lotto.
	   The cushion dwindled gradually, and the pack caught up with six
kilometers left to go in the race.
	   Saturday's eighth leg takes the riders to the Mediterranean
island of Mallorca for a 181.5-kilometer (113-mile) trek that
begins and ends in its capital city.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A land mine explosion killed
a father and daughter Friday in central Bosnia-Herzegovina, police
said.
	   Resid Abazovic, 56, and his daughter Hajra died when they walked
through a minefield near Gornji Vakuf, about 60 kilometers (35
miles) west of Sarajevo, according to an official at local police
headquarters in nearby Travnik.
	   The daughter was known to be in her 20s, but her exact age was
unknown.
	   The minefield is in the Muslim-Croat federation, in an area that
separated Muslims and Croats during the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
	   Millions of land mines are strewn across Bosnia. Mine explosions
kill and injure dozens of people every month, and minefields render
stretches of land along the former front line of the war unusable.

Russian Orthodox patriarch voices support for Serbs in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Orthodox patriarch expressed support
Friday for Serbs in the province of Kosovo, saying they were
defending their patrimony from aggression by ethnic Albanians.
	   ``Sanctuaries of the Serb people, over a thousand Orthodox
monasteries are located in Kosovo,'' Patriarch Alexy II was quoted
as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``These are the history,
traditions and roots of the Serb people, and it is only natural
that the nation protects its riches.''
	   Alexy spoke during a meeting with Biljana Plavsic, president of
the Bosnian Serbs, who is visiting Moscow. Plavsic said that the
war raging in Kosovo represented an offensive against Orthodox
Christianity in Serbia, ITAR-Tass reported. But she said her
government would treat the problem only through diplomacy.
	   Russia supports broad autonomy for Kosovo, where more than 90
percent of the population is ethnic Albanian, but not its secession
from Serb-led Yugoslavia, a longtime ally. Moscow has adamantly
opposed any NATO plans to use force to end the fighting in Kosovo.

Strategy issues to dominate in European central bankers' meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional quotes about budget cuts, fall in
dollar &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Noting the world economy has ``clearly
worsened,'' European Central Bank president Wim Duisenberg on
Friday urged the 11 countries preparing to adopt a common currency
to cut back more on government spending to ensure stability.
	   Starting Jan. 1, the bank is to set financial policy for the 11
European Union members that are joining to launch the single
currency, called the euro.
	   Formulating that policy, though, has been made harder by
instability in the world economy caused by Russia's crisis, Asia's
recession and weakness in Latin America.
	   After a meeting of the bank's governing council, Duisenberg said
the focus was on ``recent economic, monetary and financial
developments.''
	   ``In particular, much attention was paid to the global economic
and financial environment of the future euro area, which has
clearly worsened,'' he said.
	   He said that the Asian and Russian turmoil would have a
``damping'' effect on the world economy, but added growth in Europe
was still ``broadly on track.''
	   Domestic demand is ``strong,'' he said, and second quarter
growth continued to expand, ``albeit at a possibly more moderate
pace than in the first quarter.''
	   France this week cut its growth estimate for 1999 by 0.1 percent
to 2.7 percent, and Italy dramatically cut its forecast for this
year from 2.5 to 2 percent. Germany's economy grew a slight 0.1
percent in the second quarter.
	   Falling growth could cause the central bank early problems as
countries use reserves to fund their annual budgets. Under the
terms of monetary union, they are obliged to balance budgets or run
a surplus.
	   Duisenberg urged further budget cuts in 1999 to help ensure
currency stability.
	   ``If governments merely adhere to previous deficit targets for
1999, the structural position of budgets in quite a number of
countries would effectively deteriorate,'' Duisenberg said.
	   Asked about the recent fall of the dollar, Duisenberg said it
``would be a matter for concern'' if it were to continue. ``So far
this is not the case,'' he added.
	   No major decisions about monetary strategy were expected from
Friday's meeting; Duisenberg said the discussions were ``deep and
fruitful,'' adding that the decision is ``rather more difficult
than anticipated.''
	   The problem is whether to base it on money supply data or
inflation data, with arguments over which is the more reliable tool
for tracking how the economy is performing. Financial markets are
keen for an answer.
	   ``There could be nothing worse than the bank having to say, in a
year or so, that they didn't choose the right way of doing it, and
having to change,'' hurting confidence in the new currency, said
Gerhard Greber, an economist at Frankfurt's Bank Julius Baer.
	   The ECB was set up in June. Its governing council comprises the
central bank chiefs of the 11 countries in the monetary merger:
Germany, France, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Austria, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium and Finland.
	   Four EU members are staying out of the currency union, at least
for now: Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece.

Albanian PM appeals for swift NATO action to halt Kosovo fighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Albania's prime minister Friday urged
NATO to use its military might quickly to force the warring sides
in Kosovo into peace talks.
	   ``It's high time that diplomatic efforts be supported by
deterrent operations,'' Fatos Nano said in an interview in Lisbon
where he was on an official visit.
	   ``NATO should start being active on the ground to guarantee a
cease-fire and, later, each step forward in the peace process,'' he
said.
	   Serbia's Kosovo province, which borders Albania, has a 90
percent ethnic Albanian population which seeks independence.
Serbian forces are seeking to crush the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army despite international appeals for a cease-fire.
	   NATO this week completed planning for military operations in and
around Kosovo aimed at forcing Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and the Kosovo secessionists to sit down and negotiate a
peaceful solution to their conflict.
	   Nano said NATO should take on a ``peacemaking and
peace-building'' role in Kosovo, forcing negotiations and then
securing creation of a democratic system.
	   ``Any step towards a pacific, negotiated solution would
definitely, indispensably need international mediation and
presence,'' he said.
	   Albania wants to see democratic institutions established in
Kosovo, with a local parliament, its own government, police and tax
collection, Nano said.
	   However, at least during a transition period, Kosovo would stay
within the Yugoslav federation which would be responsible for
international policy and national security.
	   Nano said he was against ``violent solutions to gain
independence.''
	   Six months of conflict in Kosovo have killed hundreds and left
more than a quarter of a million homeless.
	   Albania has already received 20,000 refugees from Kosovo and has
made preparations to receive more if necessary, Nano said.

More massacre sites found in Zimbabwe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Willagers in southwestern Zimbabwe have
found five grave sites of victims massacred by Zimbabwe troops
during a rebel uprising in the early 1980s, a human rights
organization said Friday.
	   Farmers clearing ground earlier this month for planting in
Inqama district found the first skeleton, the Roman Catholic
Justice and Peace Commission said. The site is near a former army
base used to combat the 1982-1986 uprising.
	   Commission head Mike Auret said two of the grave sites were
believed to contain at least six skeletons each. He said they were
located about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of the provincial
capital of Bulawayo. The total number of remains was unknown.
	   The army's Fifth Brigade, alleged to have killed thousands of
civilians during their campaign to crush the rebellion, was close
to one of the grave sites.
	   A 1997 report released by the commission and a group of
independent lawyers says about 2,000 civilians were slaughtered
over six weeks by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade. The
civilians were accused of harboring rebels of the minority Ndebele
tribe loyal to former opposition leader Joshua Nkomo.
	   Most Fifth Brigade soldiers belonged to President Robert
Mugabe's majority Shona tribe.
	   Mugabe has acknowledged civilians were killed during the
rebellion but said they were victims of war.
	   Auret said Mugabe has repeatedly ignored calls for open debate
on the massacres and has ignored appeals for compensation for
survivors who lost homes, land and loved ones.

<TEXT>
	   CAESAREA, Israel (AP) _ The conservators could see beyond the
centuries of grime. They said the faded splotches of color were
deer, foxes, horses and leopards leaping about a floral backdrop.
	   The experts are part of an international team that has come to
Israel to help restore a rare 150-meter-long Roman fresco uncovered
in King Herod's hippodrome in Caesarea, the ancient Roman seat of
government in Palestine.
	   Although ancient Roman amphitheaters and hippodromes were
typically decorated with frescoes, few have survived in open-air
environments such as the one in Caesarea, the conservators said
Friday.
	   They want to preserve the fresco in its original location _ an
entertainment complex where 25,000 spectators gathered 2,000 years
ago to watch gladiator battles, animal fights and chariot races.
	   In Roman times, the frescoes ran along the wall separating the
arena from the seats, in the same place where ads would be
plastered in modern-day arenas.
	   But conserving the artwork is proving to be difficult. The
Mediterranean, with its corrosive salt spray and wind, is less than
100 meters (yards) away.
	   ``All those factors are against conservation,'' said Marisa
Tabasso, the head of research for the Rome-based International
Center for the Study of the Preservation and the Restoration of
Cultural Property. ``But taking them (the frescoes) out is to
destroy them.''
	   Excavations in Caesarea, one of Israel's most important
archaeological sites, began in 1974. The hippodrome was found about
five years ago, in addition to offices thought to have been used by
the Roman secret police and the foundations of a seaside temple.
	   The original frescoes were painted by teams of artists around
170 A.D. Repair work from ancient times is visible. A geometric
pattern that mimics marble slabs was later painted over the
original.
	   The condition of the frescoes vary, with some parts well
preserved and others completely lost, said to Gianluigi Colalucci,
the conservator of the Sistine Chapel frescoes.
	   Additional portions of the fresco will become visible as the
work continues. A team of four has been working with sponges,
brushes, water and chemicals to remove the sediment of 2,000 years.
	   ``We do the best to protect it and exhibit not just for our eyes
but for the whole world,'' said Israeli archaeologist Yosef Porat.

Marion Jones wins 200-meter sprint in World Cup record time

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ American Marion Jones raced to
victory Friday in the women's 200-meter sprint, leading from start
to finish to set a new World Cup record with a time of 21.62
seconds.
	   Sprinter Obadele Thompson of Barbados also set a new World Cup
record, winning the men's 100 meters in 9.87 seconds _ just off the
world mark of 9.84. Seun Ogunkoya of Nigeria was second at 9.92,
with Britain's Dwain Chambers third at 10.03.
	   Jones' performance gave the American star the third-fastest time
ever in the women's 200, keeping her undefeated this year in
women's sprints and long jump competition. Only Florence
Griffith-Joyner of the United States, holder of the world record at
21.34, has run faster than Jones in the women's 200.
	   The winning time was a personal best for Jones, which was the
goal she set coming into the World Cup -- her first race at high
altitude. But after the race, Jones said she felt hindered by the
thin air at Johannesburg Stadium because she had not adjusted to
the city's 1,650-meter altitude.
	   ``The altitude made me feel a little sluggish,'' she admitted.
``To run 21.62 today felt unbelievable.''
	   Despite her concerns about sluggishness, Jones said she wasn't
surprised by her speedy time.
	   ``I'm looking forward to the 100 meters tomorrow. Any time I
step onto the track, I feel capable of setting a record,'' she
said.
	   The three-day, finals-only World Cup competition brings together
athletes from the United States, Africa, Europe, the Americas,
Oceania, Asia, and two European national squads to compete for team
honors. Britain and Germany compete in the men's field, while
Germany and Russia round out the women's competition.
	   After the first day's events, Africa topped the men's standings
with 39 points, followed by the Americas with 36 and the United
States with 31. In the women's field, Europe led with 43, Russia
stood at 38 and the United States had 36.
	   In the women's 400-meter hurdles, Nezha Bidouane of Morocco sped
by world record-holder and race favorite Kim Batten of the United
States in the final strides to win.
	   Bidouane's time of 52.96 seconds set a new World Cup record in
getting the win for the Africas team. Batten, the pre-race
favorite, clipped the last hurdle with her foot and faded to third
in 53.17, behind Deon Hemmings of Jamaica at 53.03.
	   ``I had a good end to my season and I knew that the altitude in
Johannesburg would suit me,'' Bidouane said.
	   Zambia's Samuel Matete also thrilled the partisan African crowd
at Johannesburg Stadium, holding on to win the men's 400 hurdles in
48.08. Al-Nubi Mubarak of Qatar, representing the Asian team,
finished second in 48.17 and Dinsdale Morgan of Jamaica was third
at 48.40 for the Americas team.
	   ``This is great,'' Matete said. ``My fourth time in South Africa
and I never lose here.''
	   Africa got another win from Kenyan Daniel Komen in the men's
5,000. He finished in 13:46.57.
	   World record-holder John Godina of the United States won the
men's shot put with a heave of 21.48 meters. Aleksandr Bagach of
the Ukraine finished second at 20.45, and Germany's Oliveri-Sven
Buder was third at 20.42.
	   Svetlana Masterkova of Russia, Olympic gold medalist at Atlanta,
ran to victory in the women's 1,500 in 4:09.41.
	   Germany's Nils Schumann claimed victory in the men's 800, with a
time of 1 minute, 48.66 seconds. Mark Everett of the United States
took second at 1:48.73, with Cuba's Norberto Tellez third at
1:48.92.
	   Germany also won the women's 4 x 400 relay, with the Americas
team in second and Russia in third. The winning foursome of Anke
Feller, Uta Rohlander, Ulrike Urbansky and Grit Breur finished in
3:24.2.
	   In the women's field events, the European team took first in the
triple jump and high jump. Monica Iagar-Dinescu cleared 1.98 meters
to win the high jump, while Olga Vasdeki won the triple jump with a
leap of 14.64.
	   Cuba's Ivan Pedroso leaped 8.37 meters to win the men's long
jump, while Joanna Stone of Australia claimed victory for Oceania
in the women's javelin with a throw of 69.85 meters.

Fujimori: Poland-Peru trade should increase 6 times
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland and Peru could dramatically
increase their annual trade of some dlrs 12 million by focusing on
things they have in common, such as fishing and mining, Peruvian
President Alberto Fujimori said Friday.
	   Fujimori, the first Peruvian president to visit Poland,
addressed a few dozen Polish and Peruvian businessmen at the close
of the First Polish-Peruvian Economic Forum. Together with his
Polish host, President Aleksander Kwasniewski, he witnessed the
signing of a cooperation agreement between the two countries'
chambers of commerce.
	   Fujimori said the two countries have strong economies and should
cooperate more in sectors that are complementary: fishing,
agriculture, industry and mining.
	   Fujimori said the estimated dlrs 12 million of annual trade is
``of small significance'' and does not reflect the potential of the
two countries' economies.
	   ``I think the trade exchange should be increased by at least
five or six times,'' he said.
	   Kwasniewski said Peru could profit from Poland's experience and
achievements in coal mining, shipbuilding, chemical and
pharmaceutical industry. He also supported the development of
tourism between the two countries.
	   Fujimori is to visit the former Nazi death camp of Auschwitz and
a historic salt mine of Wieliczka on Saturday. On Sunday, before
flying to Budapest, Hungary, he will visit the Renaissance Wawel
Castle in the southern city of Krakow.

Swedish striker set to join Premier League Gunners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Confirms signing, adds Wenger quotes

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger has hired Swedish
striker Fredrik Ljungberg in a 3 million pound (dlrs 4.95 million)
transfer from Halmstad.
	   Ljungberg, part of the Sweden team which beat England 2-1 in the
Euro 2000 qualifier at Stockholm last Saturday, completed the deal
after a medical at Highbury on Friday.
	   He is expected to make his debut when the Gunners take on
Manchester United in round six. He signed too late to qualify for
Saturday's match against Leicester.
	   Arsenal, defending FA Cup and Premier League-double champions,
has recruited the 21-year-old striker to replace England
international Ian Wright.
	   Wright, who had seven seasons at Arsenal, was sold to West Ham
in the off-season as the Gunners attempted to lure Dutch striker
Patrick Kluivert from AC Milan.
	   Another Dutch star, Dennis Bergkamp, and French international
Nicolas Anelka have assumed the attacking responsibilities in
Wright's absence but Arsenal has tied three of its first four games
and Wenger has been looking for extra strike force.
	   Wenger said he had been tracking Ljungberg for a while and
decided to sign him after his performance for Sweden against
England.
	   ``He's a player of intelligence and technique with pace and a
fighting desire _ and of course he is also young,'' Wenger said
Friday.
	   Ljungberg, rated by Swedish coach Tommy Soderberg as ``the
fastest runner with the ball in Europe'', has scored one goal in
five internationals for Sweden.
	   He will not be eligible for Arsenal for the first six matches of
its European Champions campaign after missing last month's UEFA
transfer deadline for the tournament.

Court: Colombian government must look out for its soldiers, police
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombia's armed forces allowed their
warriors to die like cannon fodder, a court has ruled in awarding a
first-of-its-kind payment to the family of a slain policeman.
	   This week's dlrs 50,000 (75 million pesos) judgment to the
survivors of Jesus Lidoro and the court's finding of ``grave
negligence'' could prove costly for Colombia's besieged security
forces.
	   Lidoro and 27 other officers in the lightly armed contingent
were slain by leftist rebels six years ago while guarding an oil
installation.
	   The payment ordered Monday, the first of its kind in 34 years of
civil war, could prompt similar suits and further pressure
Colombian officials who are scrambling to professionalize a
military that is fast losing ground to rebels.
	   Colombia's national police, a division of the armed forces, had
sought to get the complaint tossed out of court. But police chief
Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano said Thursday that he would not challenge
the ruling.
	   In recent years, Colombia's police and army have lost hundreds
of men in attacks by better-armed, more experienced rebels. Most of
the dead were poor conscripts sent to vulnerable, isolated outposts
with what critics say were outdated weapons and little training.
	   The rebels fund their insurgency through extortion, kidnapping
and ``war taxes'' on the drug trade. In a blistering August
offensive, they killed as many as 129 soldiers and police and took
143 prisoners, bringing their security force captives to more than
220.
	   Colombia's military is having trouble coping with guerrillas who
are attacking bases in columns of hundreds of fighters, and Defense
Minister Rodrigo Lloreda has announced plans to close down some of
the more remote outposts.
	   Judge Jesus Maria Carillo, one of 27 magistrates on the
administrative law court that decided the Lidoro case, said police
and soldiers must accept the risk of their profession.
	   But the government, too, has a responsibility to prepare them as
much as possible, he said.
	   ``It must give them adequate training, sufficient supplies and
logistical support so they don't become cannon fodder,'' Carillo
said.
	   That was not the case when, according to court documents, Lidoro
was one of 30 police officers taken by helicopter to guard a state
oil installation at Churuyaco, in the dense guerrilla-dominated
jungles along Colombia's southern border with Ecuador.
	   The police _ who were holed up in flimsy barracks cobbled
together from plastic sheets, cardboard boxes and tree trunks _
repeatedly asked for more secure housing, greater firepower and
reinforcements.
	   The pleas were ignored.
	   On November 7, 1992, about 200 guerrillas from the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's largest rebel group, fired
on the police post for two hours, killing all but two men inside.
	   Reinforcements arrived too late to do anything but collect the
corpses.

Libya releases video of alleged 1996 attack on Gadhafi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An Arab television company has broadcast video of
what it says was an assassination attempt against Moammar Gadhafi
by British intelligence agents in 1996.
	   The images were transmitted Thursday by the London-based Arab
satellite television channel ANN during an interview live with
Gadhafi from Tripoli.
	   The British government has denied using its foreign intelligence
service in any part of an assassination attempt or plot against
Gadhafi.
	   The footage, provided to Associated Press Television, shows
Gadhafi being greeted by crowds at a rally in Wadi Achatt, in the
southern province of Fezzan.
	   In the video, Gadhafi is shown being driven along in a jeep.
Then he is seen getting out of the vehicle to walk through the
crowds. An object flies from the crowd and lands at his feet.
Gadhafi and his bodyguards look down at the object, and move calmly
to a platform some meters (feet) away.
	   One frame of the video, frozen and examined closely, showed what
appeared to be a painting of a grenade imposed on the hand of the
alleged assailant. Other frames showed a grenade-shaped object
flying toward Gadhafi. It did not explode.
	   Gadhafi said the alleged assailant, who appeared to be in his
30's and had a mustache, was ``an agent of the British
intelligence'' and had confessed. During the interview, the Libyan
leader gave no further details about the identity or fate of the
man.
	   Gadhafi also said that former British intelligence officer David
Shayler had confirmed the attempt was supported and financed by
British intelligence.
	   But Gadhafi's version differed from that of Shayler. The Libyan
leader said the grenade was thrown toward him and did not explode.
Shayler has said a device was placed under a car in Gadhafi's
motorcade, but that it was the wrong car and the bomb killed
several bystanders.
	   Shayler has been detained in France since last month, pending an
extradition request from Britain.
	   In an earlier television interview on Aug. 28, Gadhafi compared
the assassination attempt and the U.S. bombing of Libya in 1986 to
the blowing up of an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
1988 that left 270 people dead. Libya says that 37 people were
killed in the U.S. air raid, which retaliated for a bomb blast in a
Berlin discotheque that killed two American servicemen.
	   ``How can we talk about Lockerbie and forget the massacre of
1986, and how do we talk about Lockerbie and forget the
assassination attempt that the British intelligence organized?'' he
asked.
	   He warned that Libya would pursue the perpetrators of the 1986
and 1996 attacks in the same way that the United States and Britain
had pursued the two suspects in the Lockerbie case. (beb-jbm-mb)

German extreme-right rally banned; another OKd
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Saturday rally OKd by court in Muenster &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROSTOCK, Germany (AP) _ City officials have banned a Sept. 19
election rally by an extreme-right party near a building that was
set ablaze in an anti-foreigner riot six years ago.
	   The National Democratic Party announced Friday it was seeking
legal steps to overturn the Thursday night order.
	   The party has said it expected 5,000 supporters for the rally,
its last major campaign event for Sept. 27 elections in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, an economically depressed state in
former communist East Germany. Danish media reports said Danish
neo-Nazis also planned to show up.
	   The order by Rostock officials cited fears of violence at the
rally and its venue _ in front of a building that used to house
many Vietnamese and was torched by rightist extremists in 1992.
	   In western Germany, meanwhile, a court on Friday lifted a ban on
another rally by the party set for Saturday in Muenster. The court
said the city had presented no sound constitutional reason for
banning the rally.
	   However, the court said the party would have to change its
planned route through the city center to avoid other planned
events.
	   Another extreme-right party, the German People's Union, shocked
many Germans in April by coming out of nowhere to win about 13
percent of the vote in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt.

Death toll expected to rise in Mexico's flooding

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ The sun finally broke through rain
clouds in southern Mexico on Friday, giving relief teams the first
chance in days to fly to flooded villages isolated by washed-out
roads and breakdowns in radio communications.
	   The death toll _ officially 39 in Chiapas state _ was expected
to rise as reports trickled in from remote areas. At least 50
communities had no means of communication.
	   The Tapachula airport bustled with activity. Crews unloaded
boxes of aid from a half-dozen military cargo planes. A dozen
helicopters stood ready to ferry the supplies to affected regions.
	   Though aid has been slow to reach flood victims desperate for
food and clean water, Chiapas Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen appealed
for calm and patience saying there would be enough aid.
	   Some 10,000 people have sought refuge in temporary shelters set
up across the southern state, Albores said late Thursday.
	   But the problem is not limited to those in the shelters,
President Ernesto Zedillo said late Thursday after flying over the
flooded region.
	   ``We are talking about a problem of half a million people,'' he
said. ``We are talking about a problem of a much greater magnitude
_ practically of all the habitants in the zone.''
	   The Red Cross appealed for donations. Political parties and
private groups published ads in Mexico City newspapers Friday
announcing where they were collecting food, medicine, water and
clothing for the victims.
	   Federal prosecutors said they would take emergency measures to
keep merchants in Chiapas from price-gouging and to guarantee
enough goods reach the state.
	   The shortage of drinking water raised concern about potential
epidemics. Health Ministry specialists flew to Tapachula from
across the country Friday.
	   Eight days of rain in southern Mexico wiped out roads and
bridges and sent homes tumbling downstream. The flooding was
believed to be the region's worst in at least half a century;
others called it Mexico's worst disaster since a 1985 earthquake
killed thousands in the capital.
	   Over the last week, storms pounded Mexico from both the Pacific
and the Gulf of Mexico, causing flooding along wide swaths of the
country.
	   A hot sun beat down through patches of clouds over Tapachula on
Friday, but the impact of the days of rain remained obvious. A
flight over the area revealed broad rivers merging into muddy
swamps, where rooftops peaked out. Fields were flooded and rivers
traversed roads.
	   A broad, muddy torrent raged across Chiapas' coastal highway
just south of Tonala. About 100 miles (160 kilometers) to the
south, a similar river cut the highway near Huixtla, 25 miles (40
kilometers) north of Tapachula and 40 miles (65 kilometers) from
Guatemala.
	   Little was known about the area in between.
	   Margarito Ordonez Pineda, coordinator at the Tonala office of
the health ministry, said 98 percent of the people in the region
live in the slice of land between the highway and the coast.
	   ``Everyone working here has relatives there. We're very
worried,'' he said. ``I'm 52 and I've never seen anything like
this. I've talked to older people and they haven't either.''

Oksana cleared in drunken driving case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEST HARTFORD, Connecticut (AP) _ A drunken driving charge
against Oksana Baiul was dismissed Friday by a judge who said the
figure skater had met the terms of her probation and completed an
alcohol education program.
	   Baiul, who did not appear in Superior Court, now has a clean
criminal record, according to her lawyer Daniel Blume.
	   To meet the terms of the alcohol education program, Baiul did 25
hours of community service, including appearances in charity ice
shows and at other events, Blume said.
	   ``Wherever she went, she carried the message that you shouldn't
drink and drive,'' Blume said.
	   The 20-year-old Baiul was charged with driving under the
influence of alcohol and reckless driving in January 1997 after
crashing her Mercedes into a tree. Blood tests showed her alcohol
level was .168, well above the .02 limit for drivers under 21.
	   She was allowed to enter the alcohol education program for
first-time offenders to get the DUI charge dismissed. She also
pleaded guilty to a traffic violation and was fined dlrs 90, Blume
said.
	   The Ukranian skater was living in a Simsbury mansion at the
time, near a rink where she and other world-class skaters trained.
	   Blume said he gave Baiul the good news as she was vacationing in
Russia.
	   ``She's very relieved that this chapter in her life is closed,''
Blume said. ``She always regretted the wrong message that her
conduct sent to her fans around the world.''
	   Blume said Baiul is training with a new coach and plans to get
back on the ice.

	   New Bridge Designed Centuries Ago
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The Norwegian highway department has found a
bridge designer with unbeatably impressive credentials: Leonardo da
Vinci, the original Renaissance Man.
	   The department aims to build a bridge that da Vinci designed
nearly five centuries ago for a Turkish sultan, who rejected the
plan in the belief that it wouldn't work.
	   ``This is the opposite of our usual projects,'' said Haakon
Haaversen, of the Norwegian Highway Department's Akershus County
office. ``Usually we have a place that needs a bridge, and we
design one to fit it. But now we have a bridge design and had to
search for a place that suits it.''
	   Leonardo designed the bridge in 1502 to cross the Golden Horn
inlet in Istanbul. With a length of 1,155 feet (352 meters), it
would have been the world's longest bridge, and Sultan Bajazet II
didn't believe it could be completed.
	   Vebjoern Sand, a Norwegian artist, saw a model of the bridge at
an exhibition in Stockholm, Sweden, and decided it had to be built.
In 1995, he contacted Norwegian highway authorities and political
leaders, and gained broad support.
	   ``The first time I saw the model it really excited me. It was so
beautiful,'' Sand said. He described it as ``the primordial bridge,
the perfect blend of art and function.''
	   ``This is a bridge that has never been built but has been an
inspiration to modern bridge designers,'' he said. ``It is the Mona
Lisa, the queen of bridges. To build Leonardo's bridge is to
realize both history and art.''
	   The highway department is studying two proposals for the bridge
_ a wooden version, costing about dlrs 466,000, and one of stone,
costing nearly three times as much.
	   A final decision is due in November.
	   ```While he had to rely on intuition for his designs, we used
modern techniques and computers to test the design,'' Gloersen
said. ``We can confirm that (Leonardo) was right. At least for the
scale we're working on.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Use the information from the story to answer the following true
and false questions:
	   _____ 1. In 1502, Leonardo da Vinci, a great artist and
scientist, designed a bridge for a Turkish sultan (ruler).
	   _____ 2. The sultan decided not to build Leonardo's bridge
because too many people were needed to do the work.
	   _____ 3. According to the article, Leonardo's sketches have
inspired (influenced) modern bridge designers.
	   _____ 4. The Norwegian Highway Department wants to use the
nearly 500-year-old design to construct a bridge in Aas Township.
	   _____ 5. Officials plan to replace an ugly highway with the
historic queen of bridges.
	   _____ 6. When Vebjoern Sand first saw the model, he thought that
the ancient bridge was both beautiful and useful.
	   _____ 7. Sand, a Norwegian artist, used Leonardo's design to
make a painting of the bridge.
	   _____ 8. It would cost over dlrs 1,000,000 to build a stone
bridge.
	   _____ 9. The highway department has decided to construct a
wooden version of Leonardo's design.
	   _____ 10. If the bridge had been built in 1502, it would have
been the longest bridge in the world.
	   _____ BONUS: After the structure is completed, government
leaders hope that citizens will want to learn more about history
and art.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MYSTERIOUS LADY:
	   Leonardo da Vinci's portrait Mona Lisa is one of the most famous
paintings in the world. Use an encyclopedia to find out when it was
painted, where it is hanging, and what it looks like. Have you ever
had your portrait painted?

Clarke leads but Woosnam closing in on third title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COVENTRY, England (AP) _ Darren Clarke's charge to the top of
the European rankings continued Friday at the 750,000 pound (dlrs
1.24 million) British Masters but his round was overshadowed by Ian
Woosnam's spectacular form reversal.
	   Clarke shot a 1-under 71 to finish 6-under at 138 for a share of
the lead with Spain's Carl Suneson, who fired back-to-back 3-under
rounds of 69.
	   But Woosnam's homeward-nine 28 was the highlight of the second
round on the par-72 Forest of Arden course.
	   The former World No. 1, who started the day at 3-over, staged a
spectacular comeback after slumping to 6-over after seven holes to
finish with a 66 and the 3-under total 141.
	   The two-time British Masters champion's second nine included
four consecutive birdies, an eagle and two further birdies.
	   ``At 6-over I nearly went off and rang my pilot to tell him to
get the plane ready for an early return home,'' Woosnam said.
	   ``I didn't play any different, but the putts started going in. I
don't think I've ever shot 28 for nine holes before in a
tournament,'' he added.
	   Clarke is still on track to unseat Lee Westwood as No. 1 on the
European tour. He was 5,500 (dlrs 9,000) behind Westwood going into
the tournament and a win would ensure him the No. 1 spot with just
four events remaining.
	   Westwood is 1-under at the tournament halfway mark after rounds
of 73 and 70, while Colin Montgomerie, five-time European No. 1, is
2-under after a second-round 72.
	   Clarke and Suneson are one stroke ahead of Argentina's Eduardo
Romero and Sweden's Jarmo Sandelin.
	   Spanish Ryder Cup player Ignacio Garrido should also have been
5-under but he was given a four-stroke penalty when stewards
discovered he had an extra club in his bag.
	   ``My caddie's been practising for the tour pre-qualifying next
week and left his five-iron in the bag by mistake. It's not very
pleasant but that's life. I'll be one behind tomorrow night,'' he
said.
	   Switzerland's Paolo Quirici, in second place at 4-under after
the first round, shot a 73 to finish 3-under with Woosnam and
Scotland's Sam Torrence.
	   Justin Rose missed his sixth successive cut since turning
professional.
	   The 18-year-old, who turned pro after his equal-fourth place the
British Open in July, shot a second-round 1-under-par 70 but it was
not enough to erase his first-round 80.
	   He turned in 34, needing to score 66 to make the cut, and had
two birdies on his second nine but bogeyed two of the last holes.
	   ``Every week so far I've had one decent score and one bad one.
It's definitely all mental _ I'm not a different golfer because I'm
a professional,'' he said.
	   He now has the German Masters to win at least 55,000 pounds
(dlrs 90,750) to qualify for an automatic tour card and avoid
qualifying school.

Opponent of U.S. sanctions says politics slow efforts to end Cuba
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANCUN, Mexico (AP) _ Although American companies are lobbying
harder to trade with Cuba, election-year politics are blocking
efforts to change U.S. policy toward the communist nation, a
leading opponent of U.S. sanctions said Friday.
	   November elections for the U.S. Congress and President Clinton's
current political woes have slowed efforts to ease the U.S. embargo
against Cuba, said J. Daniel O'Flaherty, vice president of the
private National Foreign Trade Council.
	   ``The American business community is now more public about
wanting to do business in Cuba,'' said O'Flaherty, who also heads
USA Engage, an organization of 660 American corporations that
oppose unilateral U.S. trade sanctions against foreign countries.
	   ``But things are going nowhere,'' O'Flaherty said. ``We're in an
election campaign. And the president is suffering under extremely
difficult conditions.''
	   O'Flaherty traveled here Friday to attend a gathering of U.S.
business executives interested in future business opportunities in
Cuba.
	   Alamar Associates, a Washington-based business consultancy, had
planned to lead the group on a visit Friday to Cuba, just a short
plane ride from Cancun. But after U.S. authorization was denied,
the meeting was hastily reorganized to be held entirely in Cancun
for two days beginning Thursday.
	   The U.S. trade embargo, in place for more than 35 years, bars
Americans from spending money in Cuba, but doesn't prohibit visits
outright. Alamar said the Cuban government had offered to pay all
the executives' costs in Cuba, as it did during a one-day meeting
organized by Alamar in March. The Treasury Department did not block
that trip.
	   But a leading Cuban exile group, the Miami-based Cuban American
National Foundation, denounced the plans for this week's meeting,
accusing Alamar of exploiting loopholes in the U.S. embargo.
	   The Treasury Department then rejected Alamar's request for a
license to bring the business group to Cuba, saying it would be
``inconsistent with current U.S. policy aimed at bringing about a
peaceful transition to democracy,'' a Treasury official said on
condition of anonymity.
	   Jones said U.S. officials rejected the license because his
company was unwilling to denounce Cuba to the media.
	   Carlos Fernandez de Cossio of Cuba's Foreign Relations Ministry,
who attended the meeting, bemoaned the ``absurdity of the situation
between our two countries.''
	   While a growing number of U.S. lawmakers, nonprofit
organizations and business executives are calling for an easing of
trade sanctions, ``there are things like attempts to sabotage this
conference,'' he said. ``What foreign policy objectives are being
met?''

Ford, General Motors to halt production to shrink inventories
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian subsidiaries of Ford
Motor Company and General Motors said on Friday they would halt
production in an effort to shrink their inventories of unsold
vehicles.
	   Ford said its assembly line in the Sao Paulo industrial suburb
of Sao Bernardo do Campo will shut down for 12 days starting Sept.
28. The plant produces 850 vehicles a day.
	   The plant's 6,500 workers will get paid leave during the 12 day
shutdown.
	   Ford will also stop production at its engine and gearbox plant
in the city of Taubate for the same period of time.
	   The automaker's press office said the production halt was an
effort ``to adjust production to demand.''
	   Ford refused to reveal the size of its stock of unsold vehicles.
	   Since last November, slumping sales and large inventories have
forced Ford to stop production for a total of 70 days on four
separate occasions.
	   In an effort to ``adjust production to the market,'' General
Motors' press office said the company's assembly line in the city
of Sao Jose dos Campos will also stop production for 12 days as of
Oct. 5. It would not give further details.
	   Italian automaker Fiat, which last July reduced its daily output
from 2,200 to 2,100 units, said it was studying measures to keep
its inventory low.
	   The company said it has a ``normal'' stock of approximately
25,000 unsold cars, mostly at its dealership network.
	   Volkswagen, the country's largest automaker, said it had no
plans to stop production.
	   The auto industry's sales started dropping sharply late last
year when the government introduced a series of austerity measures
to counter the effects of the Asian crisis.
	   A steep increase in excise taxes on industrial production was
followed by an equally sharp rise in annual interest rates, which
nearly doubled to 43.5 percent.
	   To boost auto sales, the government in late July reduced by 5
percentage points the excise tax on industrial production.
	   But the measure failed to have much an effect on sales.
	   Domestic auto sales during the first eight of the year plummeted
25 percent compared to the same period in 1997, while output
decreased 17 percent, according to the National Association of
Vehicle Manufacturers.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Mudslides caused by heavy rains killed
seven people Friday and left at least five others missing in
western Guatemala near Mexico.
	   San Marcos state Gov. Oscar Barrios Flores ordered about 90
families to evacuate the area near Tajumulco, a volcanic region a
dozen miles (18 kilometers) from the Mexican border. Guatemalan
firefighters and soldiers were sent in to search for the missing.
	   San Marcos residents have reported numerous homes damaged by
flood waters and the loss of harvests and livestock.
	   Across the border in the Mexican state of Chiapas, a week of
rain has flooded dozens of towns, killing at least 39 people and
cutting off roads and communication.

<SLUG> BC-Starr Report-Long Excerpts, ? Takes </SLUG>

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Excerpts from the report sent to Congress by Whitewater
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr:
	   ... The Office of the Independent Counsel (``OIC'' or
``Office'') hereby submits substantial and credible information
that President William Jefferson Clinton committed acts that may
constitute grounds for an impeachment.
	   ... The information reveals that President Clinton:
	   _ lied under oath at a civil deposition while he was a defendant
in a sexual harassment lawsuit;
	   _ lied under oath to a grand jury;
	   _ attempted to influence the testimony of a potential witness
who had direct knowledge of facts that would reveal the falsity of
his deposition testimony;
	   _ attempted to obstruct justice by facilitating a witness's plan
to refuse to comply with a subpoena;
	   _ attempted to obstruct justice by encouraging a witness to file
an affidavit that the President knew would be false, and then by
making use of that false affidavit at his own deposition;
	   _ lied to potential grand jury witnesses, knowing that they
would repeat those lies before the grand jury; and
	   _ engaged in a pattern of conduct that was inconsistent with his
constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws.
 &UR; Factual Background
	   ... One sharply disputed issue in the (Paula Corbin) Jones
litigation was the extent to which the President would be required
to disclose information about sexual relationships he may have had
with ``other women.'' ...
	   ... In an order dated December 11, 1997, for example, (United
States District Judge Susan) Wright said: ``The Court finds,
therefore, that the plaintiff is entitled to information regarding
any individuals with whom the President had sexual relations or
proposed or sought to have sexual relations and who were during the
relevant time frame state or federal employees.''
	   ... When asked to identify all women who were state or federal
employees and with whom he had had ``sexual relations'' since 1986,
the President answered under oath: ``None.'' ...
	   ... Under oath and in the presence of Judge Wright, the
President denied that he had engaged in a ``sexual affair,'' a
``sexual relationship,'' or ``sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky.
The President also stated that he had no specific memory of having
been alone with Ms. Lewinsky, that he remembered few details of any
gifts they might have exchanged, and indicated that no one except
his attorneys had kept him informed of Ms. Lewinsky's status as a
potential witness in the Jones case.
 &UR; The Investigation
	   On January 12, 1998, this Office received information that
Monica Lewinsky was attempting to influence the testimony of one of
the witnesses in the Jones litigation, and that Ms. Lewinsky
herself was prepared to provide false information under oath in
that lawsuit. ...
	   After gathering preliminary evidence to test the information's
reliability, the OIC presented the evidence to Attorney General
Janet Reno. ...
	   On the following day, Attorney General Reno petitioned the
Special Division of the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit, on an expedited basis, to expand the
jurisdiction of Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr. ...

Britain schedules emergency G-7 meeting over Russia for Monday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain announced Thursday that an emergency
meeting of officials from the Group of Seven will be held Monday to
allow the world's top industrial nations to discuss Russia's
economic crisis.
	   The emergency summit, called by Prime Minister Tony Blair, is
expected to consider an aid package to rescue the Russian economy.
Officials have already said any new aid would likely be dependent
on Russia continuing its free market reforms.
	   Officials from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank
and the European Commission will also be present at Monday's
meeting.
	   Britain holds the rotating presidency of the G-7 which groups
the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and
Britain. The group also meets as the G-8 with the inclusion of
Russia.

	   On January 28, 1998, after the allegations about the President's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky became public, the OIC filed a
Motion for Limited Intervention and a Stay of Discovery in Jones v.
Clinton. The OIC argued that the civil discovery process should be
halted because it was having a negative effect on the criminal
investigation. The OIC represented to the Court that numerous
individuals then under subpoena in Jones, including Monica
Lewinsky, were integral to the OIC's investigation, and that courts
routinely stayed discovery in such circumstances.
	   The next day Judge Wright responded to the OIC's motion. The
Court ruled that discovery would be permitted to continue, except
to the extent that it sought information about Monica Lewinsky. The
Court acknowledged that ``evidence concerning Monica Lewinsky might
be relevant to the issues in the Jones] case.'' It concluded,
however, that this evidence was not ``essential to the core issues
in this case,'' and that some of that evidence ``might even be
inadmissible.'' The Court found that the potential value of this
evidence was outweighed by the potential delay to the Jones case in
continuing to seek discovery about Ms. Lewinsky. The Court also was
concerned that the OIC's investigation ``could be impaired and
prejudiced were the Court to permit inquiry into the Lewinsky
matter by the parties in this civil case.''
	   On March 9, 1998, Judge Wright denied Ms. Jones's motion for
reconsideration of the decision regarding Monica Lewinsky. The
order states:
	   The Court readily acknowledges that evidence of the Lewinsky
matter might have been relevant to plaintiff's case and, as she
argues, that such evidence might possibly have helped her
establish, among other things, intent, absence of mistake, motive,
and habit on the part of the President. ... Nevertheless, whatever
relevance such evidence may otherwise have ... it simply is not
essential to the core issues in this case. ...
	   On April 1, 1998, Judge Wright granted President Clinton's
motion for summary judgment, concluding that even if the facts
alleged by Paula Jones were true, her claims failed as a matter of
law. Ms. Jones has filed an appeal, and as of the date of this
Referral, the matter remains under consideration by the United
States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.
	   After the dismissal of Ms. Jones's lawsuit, the criminal
investigation continued. It was (and is) the view of this Office
that any attempt to obstruct the proper functioning of the judicial
system, regardless of the perceived merits of the underlying case,
is a serious matter that warrants further inquiry. After careful
consideration of all the evidence, the OIC has concluded that the
evidence of wrongdoing is substantial and credible, and that the
wrongdoing is of sufficient gravity that it warrants referral to
Congress.
	   The Significance of the Evidence of Wrongdoing
	   It is not the role of this Office to determine whether the
President's actions warrant impeachment by the House and removal by
the Senate; those judgments are, of course, constitutionally
entrusted to the legislative branch. This Office is authorized,
rather, to conduct criminal investigations and to seek criminal
prosecutions for matters within its jurisdiction. In carrying out
its investigation, however, this Office also has a statutory duty
to disclose to Congress information that ``may constitute grounds
for an impeachment,'' a task that inevitably requires judgment
about the seriousness of the acts revealed by the evidence. ...
	   ... All Americans, including the President, are entitled to
enjoy a private family life, free from public or governmental
scrutiny. But the privacy concerns raised in this case are subject
to limits, three of which we briefly set forth here.
	   First. The first limit was imposed when the President was sued
in federal court for alleged sexual harassment. The evidence in
such litigation is often personal. At times, that evidence is
highly embarrassing for both plaintiff and defendant. ... Congress
and the Supreme Court have concluded that embarrassment-related
concerns must give way to the greater interest in allowing
aggrieved parties to pursue their claims. ... To excuse a party who
lied or concealed evidence on the ground that the evidence covered
only ``personal'' or ``private'' behavior would frustrate the goals
that Congress and the courts have sought to achieve in enacting and
interpreting the Nation's sexual harassment laws. That is
particularly true when the conduct that is being concealed _ sexual
relations in the workplace between a high official and a young
subordinate employee _ itself conflicts with those goals.
	   Second. The second limit was imposed when Judge Wright required
disclosure of the precise information that is in part the subject
of this Referral. ... The fact that Judge Wright later determined
that the evidence would not be admissible at trial, and still later
granted judgment in the President's favor, does not change the
President's legal duty at the time he testified. ... Perjury and
attempts to obstruct the gathering of evidence can never be an
acceptable response to a court order, regardless of the eventual
course or outcome of the litigation.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Friday
condemned the Taliban religious militia's slayings of nine Iranian
diplomats in northern Afghanistan and called for the safe return of
other missing Iranians.
	   Following threats by Iran to retaliate against the Taliban for
the deaths, Annan urged both Afghanistan and Iran to ``refrain from
any action which might be construed by others as provocative.''
	   Eleven Iranian diplomats vanished from the northern Afghan city
of Mazar-e-Sharif after the Taliban religious militia seized the
city from rival forces on Aug. 8.
	   After a month of denying any involvement in the disappearances,
the Taliban acknowledged responsibility for the deaths of nine of
the 11 in a letter to Annan on Thursday from the militia's supreme
leader, Mullah Omar.
	   There was no word on the fate of the other two diplomats.
	   ``The secretary-general strongly condemns these cruel murders
and violations of international law,'' spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
``He calls for an urgent investigation so that the perpetrators can
be brought to justice.''
	   The United Nations is consulting with Iran and Pakistan about
forming a mission to investigate the deaths. Iran had requested
such a mission, and Pakistan, which has ties to the Taliban, agreed
to it. The three players were looking into how such a mission would
be organized and its security guaranteed, Eckhard said.
	   Iran on Thursday asked the U.N. Security Council to convene an
urgent meeting on what it said was a war crime committed by
Afghanistan's Taliban leaders.
	   The council held an emergency briefing and in a statement
condemned ``these heinous acts and violations of international
law,'' council president Hans Dahlgren of Sweden said.
	   The United States also condemned the killing.
	   ``We join with other members of the U.N. Security Council in
calling for an urgent investigation into these crimes so that the
pereptrators can be brought to justice,'' State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said Friday.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran vowed revenge Friday and demonstrators
called for holy war against the Taliban militia because of the
killing of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan.
	   ``Death to the Taliban! Shame on Pakistan!'' shouted protesters
in a crowd of several hundred outside Tehran University after
Friday prayers, witnesses said.
	   Former President Hashemi Rafsanjani told worshippers that Iran
would avenge the killing of nine diplomats by the Taliban, who are
widely believed to be backed by Pakistan.
	   ``I condole the martyrs' families and promise them that we will
get revenge for their blood,'' said Rafsanjani, who heads a
government policy-making body.
	   Some of the demonstrators called for holy war against the
Taliban militia, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan,
witnesses said on condition of anonymity.
	   The Taliban said Thursday it had found the bodies of nine
Iranian diplomats and admitted that they had been killed by the
religious army's own troops. The disclosure was made in a letter
from the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
	   The United Nations, United States, Britain, Germany and Greece
condemned the killings Friday. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
issued a statement accusing the Taliban of ``grossly violating
human rights.''
	   ``We join with other members of the U.N. Security Council in
calling for an urgent investigation into these crimes so that the
pereptrators can be brought to justice,'' State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said.

FDA approves new rheumatoid arthritis drug
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Some 2 million Americans with rheumatoid
arthritis won the first new treatment against their crippling
disease in over a decade Friday, a drug that promises to relieve
their pain and stiffness and slow the erosion of their joints.
	   Arava, made by Hoechst Marion Roussel, is not a cure. But the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Arava on Friday as
comparable to today's standard therapy, methotrexate, giving
patients a long-needed alternative.
	   In addition, doctors say studying Arava has brought new
understanding in how to treat rheumatoid arthritis _ that patients
need powerful therapy in the disease's earliest stages to help
protect joints from irreparable damage.
	   The new studies suggest taking either methotrexate or Arava is
important for patients in the first one to three years of their
disease _ a window of time before they feel too bad, but when their
joints are undergoing a silent, serious attack, said Dr. Michael
Schiff of the Denver Arthritis Center. Yet many early rheumatoid
patients today take only anti-inflammatory painkillers.
	   ``That doesn't do anything more than make patients feel
better,'' said Schiff, who helped research Arava. ``We now realize
you need to do more than that, and can do more. ... The (joint)
damage occurs very early.''
	   But Arava must be used carefully by women of childbearing age,
the FDA cautioned. Those women must use effective birth control
while taking Arava because animal studies suggest the drug can
cause numerous birth defects.
	   And unlike most drugs that rapidly clear out of the body after
patients take their last dose, Arava can linger for six months.
Thus, women who wish to become pregnant must tell their doctors in
advance, so they can take medication to help flush out the drug
before conception.
	   Rheumatoid arthritis is not the type that plagues the elderly as
their joints essentially wear out. Instead, it is an autoimmune
disease _ the immune system goes awry and attacks patients' own
cartilage. It typically strikes between ages 25 and 50, and
afflicts mostly women.
	   The best treatment has been methotrexate, also a cancer drug.
But it causes troublesome side effects and its effectiveness wanes
over time, leaving patients with few options.
	   Arava is the first in a slew of new rheumatoid arthritis
medicines poised to hit the market in coming months. Next week, an
FDA advisory committee will consider a novel biologically
engineered treatment that promises few side effects.
	   But with Friday's approval, Arava beats the competition to
pharmacy shelves. It will be available by mid-October, with an
average wholesale price of dlrs 8 a day, Hoechst said.
	   Arava, known chemically as leflunomide, works by blocking the
overproduction of immune cells that are responsible for most
arthritis-caused inflammation.
	   In one study of 480 Americans with moderate disease, 41 percent
of Arava patients saw their arthritis improve, compared with 19
percent of patients taking dummy pills. That's about as much
improvement as patients got taking standard methotrexate.
	   Then Hoechst took X-rays of patients' hands and feet to track
the disease's progression by studying how it erodes bone and eats
away cartilage. Arava patients did worsen. But in a year of study,
placebo patients worsened four times more quickly than Arava
patients.
	   The FDA said methotrexate also slowed rheumatoid progression as
effectively as Arava.
	   Like methotrexate, Arava can cause such side effects as
diarrhea, hair loss and liver toxicity. Arava patients will need
regular liver monitoring, but any toxicity typically occurs soon
after patients begin taking the drug, the FDA said.

	   There has been speculation for months that Zeroual, a retired
general, might resign from office.
	   He underwent surgery in Switzerland in March for an arterial
blockage in one leg, and his top aide, Mohamed Bechine, has
maintained an increasingly public profile.
	   He made his announcement amid threats of a general strike by the
nation's main union.
	   The burly, low-profile Zeroual was appointed chief of state by
the nation's all-powerful military in January 1994 at one of the
most difficult periods in the young history of the former French
colony rich in oil and gas reserves.
	   He legitimized his leadership with the 1995 presidential
election, winning 61 percent of the vote.
	   Zeroual has fought a two-pronged battle since he began leading
the country, trying to put down an Islamic insurgency and rebuild
the nation's institutions, which collapsed after the army canceled
1992 legislative elections to thwart a likely victory by Muslim
fundamentalists.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed since violence
erupted.

<TEXT>
	   This Referral presents substantial and credible information that
President Clinton criminally obstructed the judicial process, first
in a sexual harassment lawsuit in which he was the defendant and
then in a grand jury investigation. ...
	   Physical evidence conclusively establishes that the President
and Ms. Lewinsky had a sexual relationship. After reaching an
immunity and cooperation agreement with the Office of the
Independent Counsel on July 28, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky turned over a
navy blue dress that she said she had worn during a sexual
encounter with the President on February 28, 1997. According to Ms.
Lewinsky, she noticed stains on the garment the next time she took
it from her closet. From their location, she surmised that the
stains were the President's semen.
	   Initial tests revealed that the stains are in fact semen. Based
on that result, the OIC asked the President for a blood sample.
After requesting and being given assurances that the OIC had an
evidentiary basis for making the request, the President agreed. ...
the FBI Laboratory concluded that the President was the source of
the DNA obtained from the dress. ... the genetic markers on the
semen, which match the President's DNA, are characteristic of one
out of 7.87 trillion Caucasians. ...
	   In the evaluation of experienced prosecutors and investigators,
Ms. Lewinsky has provided truthful information. ... Harming him,
she has testified, is ``the last thing in the world I want to do.''
...
	   Everyone in whom Ms. Lewinsky confided in detail believed she
was telling the truth about her relationship with the President.
Ms. Lewinsky told her psychologist, Dr. Irene Kassorla, about the
affair shortly after it began. ... Ms. Lewinsky showed no
indications of delusional thinking, according to Dr. Kassorla, and
Dr. Kassorla had no doubts whatsoever about the truth of what Ms.
Lewinsky told her. ...
	   Because of the fashion in which the investigation had unfolded,
in sum, a massive quantity of evidence was available to test and
verify Ms. Lewinsky's statements ... Ms. Lewinsky's statements have
been corroborated to a remarkable degree. ...
	   In the Jones deposition on January 17, 1998, the President
denied having had ``a sexual affair,'' ``sexual relations,'' or ``a
sexual relationship'' with Ms. Lewinsky. He noted that ``there are
no curtains on the Oval Office, there are no curtains on my private
office, there are no curtains or blinds that can close on the
windows in my private dining room'' ...
	   The President did not dispute his legal representative's
assertion that the President and Ms. Lewinsky had had ``absolutely
no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form,'' nor did he
dispute the implication that Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, in denying
``a sexual relationship,'' meant that there was ``absolutely no sex
of any kind in any manner, shape or form.'' ...
	   Testifying before the grand jury on August 17, 1998, seven
months after his Jones deposition, the President acknowledged
``inappropriate intimate contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky but maintained
that his January deposition testimony was accurate.
	   The President refused to answer questions about the precise
nature of his intimate contacts with Ms. Lewinsky, but he did
explain his earlier denials. As to his denial in the Jones
deposition that he and Ms. Lewinsky had had a ``sexual
relationship,'' the President maintained that there can be no
sexual relationship without sexual intercourse ... He stated that
``most ordinary Americans'' would embrace this distinction. ...
	   In the President's view, ``any person, reasonable person'' would
recognize that oral sex performed on the deponent falls outside the
definition. ... He did testify that direct contact with Ms.
Lewinsky's breasts or genitalia would fall within the definition,
and he denied having had any such contact. ...
	   Ms. Lewinsky contradicts the President on a key issue. According
to Ms. Lewinsky, the President touched her breasts and genitalia _
which means that his conduct met the Jones definition of sexual
relations even under his theory. On these matters, the evidence of
the President's perjury cannot be presented without specific,
explicit, and possibly offensive descriptions of sexual encounters.
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had 10 sexual
encounters, eight while she worked at the White House and two
thereafter. The sexual encounters generally occurred in or near the
private study off the Oval Office _ most often in the windowless
hallway outside the study. During many of their sexual encounters,
the President stood leaning against the doorway of the bathroom
across from the study, which, he told Ms. Lewinsky, eased his sore
back.
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified that her physical relationship with the
President included oral sex but not sexual intercourse. According
to Ms. Lewinsky, she performed oral sex on the President; he never
performed oral sex on her. ...
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, she performed oral sex on the
President on nine occasions. On all nine of those occasions, the
President fondled and kissed her bare breasts. He touched her
genitals, both through her underwear and directly, bringing her to
orgasm on two occasions. On one occasion, the President inserted a
cigar into her vagina. On another occasion, she and the President
had brief genital-to-genital contact. ...
	   Ms. Lewinsky grew emotionally attached to President Clinton. She
testified: ``I never expected to fall in love with the President. I
was surprised that I did.'' Ms. Lewinsky told him of her feelings.
At times, she believed that he loved her too. They were physically
affectionate: ``A lot of hugging, holding hands sometimes. He
always used to push the hair out of my face.'' She called him
``Handsome''; on occasion, he called her ``Sweetie,'' ``Baby,'' or
sometimes ``Dear.'' He told her that he enjoyed talking to her _
she recalled his saying that the two of them were ``emotive and
full of fire,'' and she made him feel young. He said he wished he
could spend more time with her. ...
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky's friend Neysa Erbland, President
Clinton once confided in Ms. Lewinsky that he was uncertain whether
he would remain married after he left the White House. He said in
essence, ``Who knows what will happen four years from now when I am
out of office?'' Ms. Lewinsky thought, according to Ms. Erbland,
that ``maybe she will be his wife.''

	   ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands (AP) _ Police were searching
Friday for three armed men who robbed a Western Union employee of
dlrs 40,000 U.S., an unusually large theft in the British Virgin
Islands.
	   Police said that while a driver waited, two gunmen robbed the
employee as he was about to enter the Bank of Nova Scotia in
Wickham's Bay to deposit the money.
	   Police were searching for the getaway vehicle, an old green
Cadillac with a black top.
	   One of the gunmen was described as a muscular, light-skinned man
who may be from St. Thomas or St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands,
based on his accent.

Zeroual announces early retirement from presidency; ADDS byline

 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES, combines previous &QL; 
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ President Liamine Zeroual, facing
increasing social strife and an Islamic insurgency that has defied
a brutal crackdown for more than six years, announced Friday that
he will cut short his mandate, calling early presidential
elections.
	   Zeroual, speaking in a nationwide television address, said he
would hold early elections for a new president before the end of
February 1999.
	   Zeroual, a retired general, was elected to the presidency in
November 1995 for a five year term that expires in the year 2000.
	   Zeroual, 57, was making his second nationwide address in just
over three weeks.
	   In the 40-minute speech, a retrospective of his time at the
helm, Zeroual said his decision is based on his wish to ``give the
opposition concrete reality.'' He said he would open discussions
``immediately'' with the various political parties.
	   There has been speculation for months that Zeroual, who has
suffered health problems, might resign from office.
	   There have been hints that he may be losing the favor of various
clans within the army that controls this North African nation from
the shadows.
	   Zeroual underwent surgery in Switzerland in March for an
arterial blockage in one leg. He made scant public appearances
since.
	   The top presidential aide, Mohamed Bechine, once a top security
officer, has maintained an increasingly public profile despite a
press campaign questioning his authority.
	   Zeroual made his announcement amid threats of a general strike
by the nation's main union, UGTA, unhappy about the loss of tens of
thousands of jobs as the nation slowly moves to privatize state-run
companies.
	   Zeroual has fought a two-pronged battle since he began leading
the country, trying to put down an Islamic insurgency and rebuild
the nation's institutions, which collapsed after the army canceled
1992 legislative elections to thwart a likely victory by Muslim
fundamentalists.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed since violence
erupted.
	   The burly, low-profile Zeroual was appointed chief of state by
the nation's all-powerful military in January 1994 at one of the
most difficult periods in the young history of the former French
colony rich in oil and gas reserves.
	   He legitimized his leadership with the 1995 presidential
election, winning 61 percent of the vote.

Starr report alleges 11 grounds for impeachment, strategy of
</HEADLINE>
deception &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional details from report, including Starr's
contention regarding sexual harassment, Clinton encouraging
Lewinsky to use Currie as cover story.other aspects of Whitewater
investigation &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN SOLOMON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr told
Congress he found 11 grounds for impeaching President Bill Clinton,
including perjury and obstruction of justice in concealing an
affair with Monica Lewinsky. In a dramatic report to Congress
released Friday, Starr said Clinton took actions ``inconsistent
with the president's constitutional duty to faithfully execute the
laws.''
	   The report, made public by a House vote, specifically accused
Clinton of obstruction of justice, witness tampering, abuse of his
presidential powers and perjury _ both in his grand jury appearance
last month and in his sworn deposition last January in the Paula
Jones lawsuit.
	   The evidence ``may constitute grounds for an impeachment,'' the
report declared, laying out a case that included graphic sexual
detail.
	   The White House countered even before the report was released,
sending a rebuttal to Congress that declared Starr's document
represented only prosecutors' conclusions and that Clinton's
conduct did not warrant impeachment. It denied each charge the
prosecutors were expected to lodge against the president.
	   The release of Starr's report marks the start of a dramatic and
likely lengthy impeachment battle in Congress, one Clinton vowed to
fight vigorously at a morning prayer breakfast Friday.
	   ``The president has pursued a strategy of deceiving the American
people and Congress since January 1998, delaying and impeding the
criminal investigation for seven months and deceiving the American
people and Congress in August 1998,'' the report said.
	   Among the 11 charges is that Clinton tried to obstruct justice
by helping Ms. Lewinsky obtain a job in New York at a time when she
would have been a damaging witness against him and that he tried to
obstruct justice by attempting to influence the testimony of his
Oval Office secretary, Betty Currie, the day after he testified in
the Jones lawsuit.
	   It also alleges that Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had an
understanding that they would lie under oath in the Jones case
about their relationship and that Clinton tried to obstruct justice
by suggesting that Ms. Lewinsky file an affidavit so that ``she
would not be deposed, she would not contradict his testimony and he
could attempt to avoid questions.''
	   Specifically, it charged Clinton coached Ms. Lewinsky, after she
was identified as a witness in the Jones suit, to use her
friendship with Mrs. Currie as a cover story to hide the true
reason for her visits to the Oval Office.
	   The report's introduction lays out the prosecutors' case against
the president: ``President Clinton lied under oath at a civil
deposition while he was a defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit;
lied under oath to a grand jury .... attempted to obstruct justice
by facilitating a witness' plan to refuse to comply with a subpoena
... lied to potential grand jury witnesses knowing that they would
repeat those lies before the grand jury; and engaged in a pattern
of conduct that was inconsistent with his constitutional duty to
faithfully execute the laws.''
	   In its 73-page rebuttal, the White House countered: ``We do not
believe the OIC (Office of Independent Counsel) can identify any
conduct remotely approaching'' what it requires to impeach a
president.
	   ``Instead from press reports, if true, it appears that the OIC
has dangerously overreached to describe in the most dramatic of
terms conduct that not only is not criminal but is actually proper
and lawful,'' the White House rebuttal added. It was written by
Clinton attorney David Kendall and White House Counsel Charles Ruff
and their associates.
	   The Starr report does not allege any impeachable offenses by
Clinton from other parts of his investigation, including the
Whitewater land deal, the release of classified FBI files or the
firing of White House travel office employees. But the report said
those aspects of the investigation were continuing.
	   Starr's report said that Ms. Lewinsky over time became
``emotionally attached to the president'' and quoted as her saying
``I never expected to fall in love with the president, I was
surprised that I did.''
	   The report said she told a friend that, in the report's
language, ``President Clinton once confided in Ms. Lewinsky that he
was uncertain he would remain married after he left the White
House'' and she thought that ``maybe she will be his wife.''
	   Starr rejected Clinton's contention that his relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky was a personal, not a legal, matter, saying there were
elements of sexual harassment in the relationship.
	   ``To excuse a party who lied or concealed evidence on the ground
that the evidence covered only 'personal' or 'private' behavior
would frustrate the goals that Congress and the courts have sought
to achieve in enacting and interpreting the nation's sexual
harassment laws,'' Starr wrote.
	   ``That is particularly true when the conduct that is being
concealed _ sexual relations in the workplace between a high
official and a young subordinate employee _ itself conflicts with
those goals.''
	   The Starr report discloses for the first time that DNA tests
conducted by the FBI almost indisputably determined that semen
found on one of Ms. Lewinsky's dresses matched a DNA sample
provided by Clinton, placing the odds that it wasn't his at 1 in
7.87 trillion.
	   And it lays out in graphic terms several sexual episodes between
Ms. Lewinsky and the president, alleging from Ms. Lewinsky's
account that they had oral sex as he talked several times on the
telephone to members of Congress, and that in one encounter an
unlit cigar was used as a prop. It also says they engaged in
explicit phone sex on 12 to 15 occasions.
	   Prosecutors said they were providing such graphic detail to
prove their case that Clinton lied before the grand jury when he
insisted he gave ``legally accurate'' testimony in January when he
claimed he did not have ``sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   ``It is unfortunate but it is essential,'' Starr wrote. ``The
president's defense to many of the allegations is based on a close
parsing of the definitions that were used to describe his conduct.
We have, after careful review, identified no manner of providing
the information that reveals the falsity of the president's
statements other than to describe his conduct with precision.''
	   Clinton's argument was based on the fact that the two never
engaged in intercourse and that the definition he was given did not
include oral sex. Prosecutors declare in the report that the
definition was clearly meant to encompass numerous types of sexual
contacts _ such as those he engaged in with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   Prosecutors also sought to prove that Clinton intended to lie
from the beginning when the Lewinsky story erupted, citing
testimony from political adviser Dick Morris.
	   Morris testified that Clinton summoned him the night the
controversy erupted and asked him to do an instant poll to see if
he could tell the truth about an affair. When Morris told the
president the polls showed he couldn't tell the truth and survive,
Morris claims the president told him ``well we'll just have to
win.''
	   It also argues the president intentionally gave false
information to his aides knowing that it would then be passed on to
the grand jury. As one example, it says Clinton told chief of staff
Erskine Bowles and deputy chief of staff John Podesta he
specifically did not have sex with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   Podesta was quoted as testifying that Clinton ``adamantly'' told
him on Jan. 23 he ``had not engaged in sex of any kind, shape or
manner with Ms. Lewinsky.''
	   The report cites evidence that Clinton's efforts to keep his
relationship secret started early.
	   In a handwritten statement that she prepared for the
prosecutors, Ms. Lewinsky _ referring to herself as ``Ms. L'' _
wrote, ``The president told Ms. L to deny a relationship if ever
asked about it. He also said something to the effect of 'If the two
people who are involved say it didn't happen _ it didn't happen.'''
	   Starr argued that efforts by Clinton and his aides to find Ms.
Lewinsky a job as she was emerging as a potential witness amounted
to criminal activity, drawing a parallel to an earlier White
House-inspired job search for Whitewater figure Webster Hubbell.
	   The report accuses Clinton of violating the public trust.
	   ``In view of the enormous trust and responsibility attendant to
his high office, the president has a manifest duty to ensure that
his conduct at all times complies with the law of the land,'' it
said. ``In sum, perjury and acts that obstruct justice by any
citizen _ whether in a criminal case, a grand jury investigation, a
congressional hearing, a civil trial, or civil discovery _ are
profoundly serious matters. When such acts are committed by the
president of the United States, we believe those acts 'may
constitute grounds for an impeachment.'''
	   The report alleges Clinton initiated sexual contacts with Ms.
Lewinsky in late 1995 and that the sexual relationship continued on
and off through May 1997. It says there was a ``termination of the
sexual relationship'' between June and October 1997.
	   Clinton remained in contact with Ms. Lewinsky after the sexual
relationship ended, according to prosecutors, in an effort to keep
her from becoming a damaging witness in the Jones case.
	   In his rebuttal, Clinton's lawyers said the president, even
after their sexual encounters stopped, remained in touch with Ms.
Lewinsky ``from feelings both of friendship and responsibility''
and to help her.
	   Starr's report said Ms. Lewinsky addressed the president as
``handsome'' on occasions and he called her ``sweetie, baby or
sometimes dear.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A volley of shots fired in a remote West Bank
cottage set off a violent chain reaction Friday that threatened to
cripple Washington's latest Mideast peace mission.
	   The bullets fired by Israeli troops in a raid of a Hamas hideout
killed two top fugitives sought for planning terror attacks. Vowing
retaliation, Islamic militants said they would detonate bombs in
the Jewish state. Hundreds of Hamas supporters took to the streets,
clamoring for revenge, and threw stones at Israeli soldiers.
	   Troops sprayed one group of protesters in the West Bank town of
El Bireh with rubber bullets, injuring five people.
	   The army also sealed the West Bank and Gaza Strip, fanning
Palestinian resentment already running high over the 17-month
stalemate in talks on an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   Despite the rising tensions, U.S. envoy Dennis Ross on Friday
pressed on with efforts to narrow the gaps between Israel and the
Palestinians. He met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai. Asked how the negotiations were
going, Mordechai said: ``Slowly, slowly.''
	   One of the main stumbling blocks is Israel's demand to
renegotiate an understanding on security cooperation worked out in
December by Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. officials.
	   The document serves, among other things, as a blueprint for a
Palestinian crackdown on Hamas. Netanyahu rejected the initial deal
as insufficient.
	   However, Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said after a
meeting with Ross earlier Friday that the Palestinians would not
agree to changes in the document.
	   Palestinian parliamentary minister Nabil Amr condemned
Thursday's killing of two top Hamas fugitives, brothers Imad and
Adel Awadallah and said it was ``suspiciously'' timed since it
coincided with Ross' visit.
	   ``This is an Israeli attempt to open the door to violence,'' Amr
told reporters as he left a Palestinian cabinet meeting Friday.
	   Amr also called on Hamas not to retaliate for the killings and
to hold only peaceful demonstrations that would not provoke
violence.

UNDATED: his wife.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified she and the President ``enjoyed talking
to each other and being with each other.'' ...
	   The longer conversations often occurred after their sexual
contact. Ms. Lewinsky testified: ``When I was working there at the
White House ... we'd start in the back in or near the private study
and we'd talk and that was where we were physically intimate, and
we'd usually end up, kind of the pillow talk of it, I guess ...
sitting in the Oval Office ... .''
	   ... Along with face-to-face meetings, according to Ms. Lewinsky,
she spoke on the telephone with the President approximately 50
times, often after 10 p.m. and sometimes well after midnight. The
President placed the calls himself or, during working hours, had
his secretary, Betty Currie, do so. ... On 10 to 15 occasions, she
and the President had phone sex. After phone sex late one night,
the President fell asleep mid-conversation.
	   ... By phone and in person, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she and
the President sometimes had arguments. ... During an argument on
December 6, 1997, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President said
that ``he had never been treated as poorly by anyone else as I
treated him,'' and added that ``he spent more time with me than
anyone else in the world, aside from his family, friends and staff.
...''
 &UR; F. Gifts
	   Ms. Lewinsky and the President exchanged numerous gifts. By her
estimate, she gave him about 30 items, and he gave her about 18.
... On November 20 _ five days after the intimate relationship
began, according to Ms. Lewinsky _ she gave him a necktie. ...
According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned the night she
gave him the tie, then sent her a photo of himself wearing it. ...
	   Ms. Lewinsky gave him, among other things, six neckties, an
antique paperweight showing the White House, a silver tabletop
holder for cigars or cigarettes, a pair of sunglasses, a casual
shirt, a mug emblazoned ``Santa Monica,'' a frog figurine, a letter
opener depicting a frog, several novels, a humorous book of
quotations, and several antique books. He gave her, among other
things, a hat pin, two brooches, a blanket, a marble bear figurine,
and a special edition of Walt Whitman's ``Leaves of Grass.''
	   Ms. Lewinsky construed it as a sign of affection when the
President wore a necktie or other item of clothing she had given
him. ...
 &UR; H. Secrecy
	   1. Mutual Understanding
	   Both Ms. Lewinsky and the President testified that they took
steps to maintain the secrecy of the relationship. ... In her
handwritten statement to this Office, Ms. Lewinsky wrote that ``the
President told Ms. L to deny a relationship, if ever asked about
it. He also said something to the effect of if the two people who
are involved say it didn't happen _ it didn't happen.'' ... She
told him that ``I would always deny it, I would always protect
him,'' and he responded approvingly.
	   In his grand jury testimony, the President confirmed his efforts
to keep their liaisons secret. He said ... '' ... I was embarrassed
about it. I knew it was wrong.'' ...
 &UR; 2. Cover Stories
	   For her visits to see the President, according to Ms. Lewinsky,
``There was always some sort of a cover.'' When visiting the
President while she worked at the White House, she generally
planned to tell anyone who asked (including Secret Service officers
and agents) that she was delivering papers to the President. ...
Later, after she left the White House and started working at the
Pentagon, Ms. Lewinsky relied on Ms. Currie to arrange times when
she could see the President. The cover story for those visits was
that Ms. Lewinsky was coming to see Ms. Currie, not the President.
...
	   In his grand jury testimony, the President acknowledged that he
and Ms. Lewinsky ``might have talked about what to do in a nonlegal
context'' to hide their relationship. ... But he also stated that
``I never asked Ms. Lewinsky to lie.''
 &UR; 3. Steps to Avoid Being Seen or Heard
	   After their first two sexual encounters during the November 1995
government shutdown, according to Ms. Lewinsky, her encounters with
the President generally occurred on weekends, when fewer people
were in the West Wing. ...
	   Out of concern about being seen, the sexual encounters most
often occurred in the windowless hallway outside the study.
According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President was concerned that the two
of them might be spotted through a White House window. ... Ms.
Lewinsky testified that, on December 28, 1997, ``when I was getting
my Christmas kiss'' in the doorway to the study, the President was
``looking out the window with his eyes wide open while he was
kissing me and then I got mad because it wasn't very romantic.'' He
responded, ``Well, I was just looking to see to make sure no one
was out there.''
	   Fear of discovery constrained their sexual encounters in several
respects, according to Ms. Lewinsky. ... On one occasion, according
to Ms. Lewinsky, the President put his hand over her mouth during a
sexual encounter to keep her quiet. Concerned that they might be
interrupted abruptly, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the two of them
never fully undressed. ...
 &UR; 4. Ms. Lewinsky's Notes and Letters
	   The President expressed concern about documents that might hint
at an improper relationship between them, according to Ms.
Lewinsky. He cautioned her about messages she sent.
	   ... In addition, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President
expressed concerns about official records that could establish
aspects of their relationship. She said that on two occasions she
asked the President if she could go upstairs to the Residence with
him. No, he said, because a record is kept of everyone who
accompanies him there.
	   The President testified before the grand jury: ``I remember
telling her she should be careful what she wrote, because a lot of
it was clearly inappropriate and would be embarrassing if somebody
else read it.''
 &UR; 5. Ms. Lewinsky's Evaluation of Their Secrecy Efforts
	   In two conversations recorded after she was subpoenaed in the
Jones case, Ms. Lewinsky expressed confidence that her relationship
with the President would never be discovered. ... ``If someone
looked in the study window, it's not me,'' she said. If someone
produced tapes of her telephone calls with the President, she would
say they were fakes.
	   In another recorded conversation, Ms. Lewinsky said she was
especially comforted by the fact that the President, like her,
would be swearing under oath that ``nothing happened.''
 &UR; II. 1995: Initial Sexual Encounters
	   Monica Lewinsky began her White House employment as an intern in
the Chief of Staff's office in July 1995. At White House functions
in the following months, she made eye contact with the President.
During the November 1995 government shutdown, the President invited
her to his private study, where they kissed. Later that evening,
they had a more intimate sexual encounter. They had another sexual
encounter two days later, and a third one on New Year's Eve. ...

 &UR; UNDATED: Year's Eve.

<TEXT>
	   As her internship was winding down, Ms. Lewinsky applied for a
paying job on the White House staff. She interviewed with Timothy
Keating, Special Assistant to the President and Staff Director for
Legislative Affairs. Ms. Lewinsky accepted a position dealing with
correspondence in the Office of Legislative Affairs on November 13,
1995, but did not start the job (and, thus, continued her
internship) until November 26. She remained a White House employee
until April 1996, when -- in her view, because of her intimate
relationship with the President -- she was dismissed from the White
House and transferred to the Pentagon.
 &UR; B. First Meetings with the President
	   The month after her White House internship began, Ms. Lewinsky
and the President began what she characterized as ``intense
flirting.'' At departure ceremonies and other events, she made eye
contact with him, shook hands, and introduced herself. When she ran
into the President in the West Wing basement and introduced herself
again, according to Ms. Lewinsky, he responded that he already knew
who she was. Ms. Lewinsky told her aunt that the President ``seemed
attracted to her or interested in her or something,'' and told a
visiting friend that ``she was attracted to (President Clinton),
she had a big crush on him, and I think she told me she at some
point had gotten his attention, that there was some mutual eye
contact and recognition, mutual acknowledgment.''
	   In the autumn of 1995, an impasse over the budget forced the
federal government to shut down for one week, from Tuesday,
November 14, to Monday, November 20. Only essential federal
employees were permitted to work during the furlough, and the White
House staff of 430 shrank to about 90 people for the week. White
House interns could continue working because of their unpaid
status, and they took on a wide range of additional duties.
	   During the shutdown, Ms. Lewinsky worked in Chief of Staff
Panetta's West Wing office, where she answered phones and ran
errands. The President came to Mr. Panetta's office frequently
because of the shutdown, and he sometimes talked with Ms. Lewinsky.
She characterized these encounters as ``continued flirtation.''
According to Ms. Lewinsky, a Senior Adviser to the Chief of Staff,
Barry Toiv, remarked to her that she was getting a great deal of
``face time'' with the President.
 &UR; November 15 Sexual Encounter
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified that Wednesday, November 15, 1995 -- the
second day of the government shutdown -- marked the beginning of
her sexual relationship with the President. On that date, she
entered the White House at 1:30 p.m., left sometime thereafter
(White House records do not show the time), reentered at 5:07 p.m.,
and departed at 12:18 a.m. on November 16. The President was in the
Oval Office or the Chief of Staff's office (where Ms. Lewinsky
worked during the furlough) for almost the identical period that
Ms. Lewinsky was in the White House that evening, from 5:01 p.m. on
November 15 to 12:35 a.m. on November 16.
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President made eye
contact when he came to the West Wing to see Mr. Panetta and Deputy
Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, then again later at an informal
birthday party for Jennifer Palmieri, Special Assistant to the
Chief of Staff. At one point, Ms. Lewinsky and the President talked
alone in the Chief of Staff's office. In the course of flirting
with him, she raised her jacket in the back and showed him the
straps of her thong underwear, which extended above her pants.
	   En route to the restroom at about 8 p.m., she passed George
Stephanopoulos's office. The President was inside alone, and he
beckoned her to enter. She told him that she had a crush on him. He
laughed, then asked if she would like to see his private office.
Through a connecting door in Mr. Stephanopoulos's office, they went
through the President's private dining room toward the study off
the Oval Office. Ms. Lewinsky testified: ``We talked briefly and
sort of acknowledged that there had been a chemistry that was there
before and that we were both attracted to each other and then he
asked me if he could kiss me.'' Ms. Lewinsky said yes. In the
windowless hallway adjacent to the study, they kissed. Before
returning to her desk, Ms. Lewinsky wrote down her name and
telephone number for the President.
	   At about 10 p.m., in Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, she was alone
in the Chief of Staff's office and the President approached. He
invited her to rendezvous again in Mr. Stephanopoulos's office in a
few minutes, and she agreed. (Asked if she knew why the President
wanted to meet with her, Ms. Lewinsky testified: ``I had an idea.''
They met in Mr. Stephanopoulos's office and went again to the area
of the private study. This time the lights in the study were off.
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President kissed. She
unbuttoned her jacket; either she unhooked her bra or he lifted her
bra up; and he touched her breasts with his hands and mouth. Ms.
Lewinsky testified: ``I believe he took a phone call ... and so we
moved from the hallway into the back office ... He put his hand
down my pants and stimulated me manually in the genital area.''
While the President continued talking on the phone (Ms. Lewinsky
understood that the caller was a Member of Congress or a Senator),
she performed oral sex on him. He finished his call, and, a moment
later, told Ms. Lewinsky to stop. In her recollection: ``I told him
that I wanted ... to complete that. And he said ... that he needed
to wait until he trusted me more. And then I think he made a joke
... that he hadn't had that in a long time.''
	   Both before and after their sexual contact during that
encounter, Ms. Lewinsky and the President talked. At one point
during the conversation, the President tugged on the pink intern
pass hanging from her neck and said that it might be a problem. Ms.
Lewinsky thought that he was talking about access -- interns were
not supposed to be in the West Wing without an escort -- and, in
addition, that he might have discerned some ``impropriety'' in a
sexual relationship with a White House intern.
	   White House records corroborate details of Ms. Lewinsky's
account. She testified that her November 15 encounters with the
President occurred at about 8 p.m. and 10 p.m., and that in each
case the two of them went from the Chief of Staff's office to the
Oval Office area. Records show that the President visited the Chief
of Staff's office for one minute at 8:12 p.m. and for two minutes
at 9:23 p.m., in each case returning to the Oval Office. She
recalled that the President took a telephone call during their
sexual encounter, and she believed that the caller was a Member of
Congress or a Senator. White House records show that after
returning to the Oval Office from the Chief of Staff's office, the
President talked to two Members of Congress: Rep. Jim Chapman from
9:25 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., and Rep. John Tanner from 9:31 p.m. to 9:35
p.m.
 &UR; D. November 17 Sexual Encounter
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had a second
sexual encounter two days later (still during the government
furlough), on Friday, November 17. She was at the White House until
8:56 p.m., then returned from 9:38 to 10:39 p.m. At 9:45 p.m., a
few minutes after Ms. Lewinsky's reentry, the President went from
the Oval Office to the Chief of Staff's office (where Ms. Lewinsky
worked during the furlough) for one minute, then returned to the
Oval Office for 30 minutes. From there, he went back to the Chief
of Staff's office until 10:34 p.m. (approximately when Ms. Lewinsky
left the White House), then went by the Oval Office and the Ground
Floor before retiring to the Residence at 10:40 p.m.
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified:
	   ``We were again working late because it was during the furlough
and Jennifer Palmieri ... had ordered pizza along with Ms. Currie
and Ms. (Nancy)Hernreich. And when the pizza came, I went down to
let them know that the pizza was there and it was at that point
when I walked into Ms. Currie's office that the President was
standing there with some other people discussing something.
	   And they all came back to the office and Mr. -- I think it was
Mr. Toiv, somebody accidentally knocked pizza on my jacket, so I
went to go use the restroom to wash it off and as I was coming out
of the restroom, the President was standing in Ms. Currie's doorway
and said, 'You can come out this way.' ''
	   Ms. Lewinsky and the President went into the area of the private
study, according to Ms. Lewinsky. There, either in the hallway or
the bathroom, she and the President kissed. After a few minutes, in
Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, she told him that she needed to get
back to her desk. The President suggested that she bring him some
slices of pizza.
	   A few minutes later, she returned to the Oval Office area with
pizza and told Ms. Currie that the President had requested it. Ms.
Lewinsky testified: ``(Ms. Currie) opened the door and said, 'Sir,
the girl's here with the pizza.' He told me to come in. Ms. Currie
went back into her office and then we went into the back study area
again.'' Several witnesses confirm that when Ms. Lewinsky delivered
pizza to the President that night, the two of them were briefly
alone.
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified that she and the President had a sexual
encounter during this visit. They kissed, and the President touched
Ms. Lewinsky's bare breasts with his hands and mouth. At some
point, Ms. Currie approached the door leading to the hallway, which
was ajar, and said that the President had a telephone call. Ms.
Lewinsky recalled that the caller was a Member of Congress with a
nickname. While the President was on the telephone, according to
Ms. Lewinsky, ``he unzipped his pants and exposed himself,'' and
she performed oral sex. Again, he stopped her before he ejaculated.
	   During this visit, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President told
her that he liked her smile and her energy. He also said: ``I'm
usually around on weekends, no one else is around, and you can come
and see me.''
	   Records corroborate Ms. Lewinsky's recollection that the
President took a call from a Member of Congress with a nickname.
While Ms. Lewinsky was at the White House that evening (9:38 to
10:39 p.m.), the President had one telephone conversation with a
Member of Congress: From 9:53 to 10:14 p.m., he spoke with Rep.
H.L. ``Sonny'' Callahan.
	   In his Jones deposition on January 17, 1998, President Clinton
-- who said he was unable to recall most of his encounters with Ms.
Lewinsky -- did remember her ``back there with a pizza'' during the
government shutdown. He said, however, that he did not believe that
the two of them were alone. Testifying before the grand jury on
August 17, 1998, the President said that his first ``real
conversation'' with Ms. Lewinsky occurred during the November 1995
furlough. He testified: ``One night she brought me some pizza. We
had some remarks.''
 &UR; E. December 31 Sexual Encounter
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had their third
sexual encounter on New Year's Eve. Ms. Lewinsky -- by then a
member of the staff of the Office of Legislative Affairs -- was at
the White House on Sunday, December 31, 1995, until 1:16 p.m.; her
time of arrival is not shown. The President was in the Oval Office
area from 12:11 p.m. until about the time that Ms. Lewinsky left,
1:15 p.m., when he went to the Residence.
	   Sometime between noon and 1 p.m., in Ms. Lewinsky's
recollection, she was in the pantry area of the President's private
dining room talking with a White House steward, Bayani Nelvis. She
told Mr. Nelvis that she had recently smoked her first cigar, and
he offered to give her one of the President's cigars. Just then,
the President came down the hallway from the Oval Office and saw
Ms. Lewinsky. The President dispatched Mr. Nelvis to deliver
something to Mr. Panetta.
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, she told the President that Mr.
Nelvis had promised her a cigar, and the President gave her one.
She told him her name -- she had the impression that he had
forgotten it in the six weeks since their furlough encounters
because, when passing her in the hallway, he had called her
``Kiddo.'' The President replied that he knew her name; in fact, he
added, having lost the phone number she had given him, he had tried
to find her in the phonebook.
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, they moved to the study. ``And then .
. . we were kissing and he lifted my sweater and exposed my breasts
and was fondling them with his hands and with his mouth.'' She
performed oral sex. Once again, he stopped her before he ejaculated
because, Ms. Lewinsky testified, ``he didn't know me well enough or
he didn't trust me yet.''
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, a Secret Service officer named Sandy
was on duty in the West Wing that day. Records show that Sandra
Verna was on duty outside the Oval Office from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.
 &UR; F. President's Account of 1995 Relationship
	   As noted, the President testified before the grand jury that on
November 17, 1995, Ms. Lewinsky delivered pizza and exchanged
``some remarks'' with him, but he never indicated that anything
sexual occurred then or at any other point in 1995. Testifying
under oath before the grand jury, the President said that he
engaged in ``conduct that was wrong'' involving ``inappropriate
intimate contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky ``on certain occasions in
early 1996 and once in early 1997.'' By implicitly denying any
sexual contact in 1995, the President indicated that he and Ms.
Lewinsky had no sexual involvement while she was an intern. In the
President's testimony, his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky ``began
as a friendship,'' then later ``came to include this conduct.''
 &UR; III. January-March 1996: Continued Sexual Encounters
	   President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had additional sexual
encounters near the Oval Office in 1996. After their sixth sexual
encounter, the President and Ms. Lewinsky had their first lengthy
conversation. On President's Day, February 19, the President
terminated their sexual relationship, then revived it on March 31.
 &UR; A. January 7 Sexual Encounter
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had another
sexual encounter on Sunday, January 7, 1996. Although White House
records do not indicate that Ms. Lewinsky was at the White House
that day, her testimony and other evidence indicate that she was
there.The President, according to White House records, was in the
Oval Office most of the afternoon, from 2:13 to 5:49 p.m.
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned her early
that afternoon. It was the first time he had called her at home. In
her recollection: ``I asked him what he was doing and he said he
was going to be going into the office soon. I said, oh, do you want
some company? And he said, oh, that would be great.'' Ms. Lewinsky
went to her office, and the President called to arrange their
rendezvous:
	   ``We made an arrangement that ... he would have the door to his
office open, and I would pass by the office with some papers and
then ... he would sort of stop me and invite me in. So, that was
exactly what happened. I passed by and that was actually when I saw
(Secret Service Uniformed Officer) Lew Fox who was on duty outside
the Oval Office, and stopped and spoke with Lew for a few minutes,
and then the President came out and said, oh, hey, Monica ... come
on in ... And so we spoke for about 10 minutes in the (Oval)
office. We sat on the sofas. Then we went into the back study and
we were intimate in the bathroom.
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified that during this bathroom encounter, she
and the President kissed, and he touched her bare breasts with his
hands and his mouth. The President ``was talking about performing
oral sex on me,'' according to Ms. Lewinsky. But she stopped him
because she was menstruating and he did not. Ms. Lewinsky did
perform oral sex on him.
	   Afterward, she and the President moved to the Oval Office and
talked. According to Ms. Lewinsky: ``He was chewing on a cigar. And
then he had the cigar in his hand and he was kind of looking at the
cigar in ... sort of a naughty way. And so ... I looked at the
cigar and I looked at him and I said, we can do that, too, some
time.''
	   Corroborating aspects of Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, records
show that Officer Fox was posted outside the Oval Office the
afternoon of January 7. Officer Fox (who is now retired) testified
that he recalled an incident with Ms. Lewinsky one weekend
afternoon when he was on duty by the Oval Office:
	   ``The President of the United States came out, and he asked me,
he says, ``Have you seen any young congressional staff members here
today?'' I said, ``No, sir.'' He said, ``Well, I'm expecting one.''
He says, ``Would you please let me know when they show up?'' And I
said, ``Yes, sir.''
	   Officer Fox construed the reference to ``congressional staff
members'' to mean White House staff who worked with Congress --
i.e., staff of the Legislative Affairs Office, where Ms. Lewinsky
worked.
	   Talking with a Secret Service agent posted in the hallway,
Officer Fox speculated on whom the President was expecting: ``I
described Ms. Lewinsky, without mentioning the name, in detail,
dark hair -- you know, I gave a general description of what she
looked like.'' Officer Fox had gotten to know Ms. Lewinsky during
her tenure at the White House, and other agents had told him that
she often spent time with the President.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with close, Dow at one point up 201, gain for the
week, percentage change in Dow for year and from July 17 record
high, Edits to conform; Pickup 11th graf pvs `Stocks already ...'
 &UR; By BRUCE MEYERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rose sharply in shaky U.S. trading
Friday, with the Dow industrials up almost 180 points.
	   Wall Street found encouragement in corporate profitability
pronouncements that overcame fears surrounding global economic
strife and unease over the fate of the Clinton administration on a
day when a prosecutor's report outlined possible grounds for
impeachment in graphic detail.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average leaped 179.96 points, or by 2.4
percent, to close at 7,795.50. It was the ninth-largest point gain
ever and came in trading that was heavy but below Thursday's
blistering pace.
	   Wall Street's gains interrupted a worldwide selling spree,
helping to cut losses in late trading on European markets but
coming too late to ease the pain in Asian exchanges. Tokyo's
blue-chip stocks had their biggest loss of the year.
	   Friday's rally was anything but smooth sailing.
	   The Dow, down 248.48 points Thursday, was off an additional
96.30 in the early going, then shot up to a gain of 117.40, before
giving up some of that ground. By late afternoon it was charging
higher again, rising as much as 201.33 in the final hour before
fading somewhat heading into the weekend.
	   The average of 30 big-name stocks got help from a surge by
American Express, which said it has not been hit hard by worldwide
market turmoil and was sticking with its earnings targets.
	   The technology-heavy Nasdaq index recorded its fourth-biggest
point gain ever, helped by encouraging earnings statements after
markets closed Thursday from Intel Corp. and Oracle Corp.
	   Still, traders remained on edge because of political and
economic crises.
	   Markets continued to be unsettled by economic problems that now
are plaguing Latin American financial markets after roiling Russia
and Asia.
	   There was some encouragement, however, as Brazilian shares rose
after the government raised interest rates sharply. Trading on the
Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest, was halted twice
in Thursday's frenzied session, when shares plummeted 15.8 percent.
	   In addition, Russia was moving to resolve some of the political
problems that have prevented the country from bailing out its
economy. The parliament overwhelmingly confirmed the appointment of
Yevgeny Primakov as prime minister.
	   Meantime, a Labor Department report of a sharper-than-expected
drop in U.S. wholesale prices last month raised expectations that
the Federal Reserve's next move would be to reduce short-term
interest rates to help offset the fallout from the global economic
crisis.
	   The unease worldwide has led to a buying binge for U.S. Treasury
bonds, a traditional haven for cash in times of unrest. There were
new sharp gains for government bonds early in the day, as global
stock markets were being battered, but those gains disappeared as
U.S. stocks recovered.

Defense gives Feyenoord 1-0 win over SC Heerenveen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A massed defense and a disastrous
Hans Vonk goalkeeping error Friday gave Feyenoord Rotterdam its
fourth straight victory and leadership of the Dutch premiership.
	   A bleak and defensive game saw both Feyenoord and SC Heerenveen
err on the side of caution, but the Rotterdammers' 1-0 win gives
them 12 points from four games.
	   The winner of Sunday's clash between the other two teams yet to
drop a point, Ajax Amsterdam and FC Utrecht, can draw level with
Feyenoord.
	   After 63 minutes Feyenoord's Brazilian forward Ronildo Tininho
Pereira de Freitas was presented with the ball on the edge of the
Heerenveen box after a defensive error.
	   Tininho's skidding shot looked harmless enough but Vonk fell
backwards and let the ball pass through his legs.
	   The game opened up but a well-organized Feyenoord defense
restricted Heerenveen to hopeful attempts from distance.

Ecuador's legislators vote themselves tax cut amid crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ With their country in a deep financial
crisis and the state coffers bare, Ecuador's Congress has voted to
slice the taxes they pay on their wages in half.
	   The 121-member Congress, which took office one month ago, voted
to reduce the tax rate for legislators from 16 to 8 percent,
Congressman Enrique Campusano told reporters Friday.
	   Legislators earn dlrs 4,545 (25 million Sucres) a month. A
police officer in Ecuador earns about dlrs 150 a month.
	   The decision sparked anger from Ecuadoreans who have been asked
to tighten their belts by President Jamil Mahuad to prevent their
small Andean nation from going bankrupt.
	   Finance Minister Fidel Jaramillo said Tuesday that Ecuador can
only make payments on 10 percent of its debt. Some government
employees have not been paid since July.
	   Ecuador's crisis has been caused by the global financial crisis,
a ballooning budget deficit and falling prices for its main export,
oil, economists say.

 &UR; Eds: Note sexually explicit language throughout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ...
 &UR; January 21 Sexual Encounter
	   On Sunday, January 21, 1996, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she and
the President had another sexual encounter. ...
	   On that day, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she saw the President in
a hallway by an elevator, and he invited her to the Oval Office.
...
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, she questioned the President about
his interest in her. ``I asked him why he doesn't ask me any
questions about myself, and ... is this just about sex ... or do
you have some interest in trying to get to know me as a person?''
	   The President laughed and said, according to Ms. Lewinsky, that
``he cherishes the time that he had with me.'' She considered it
``a little bit odd'' for him to speak of cherishing their time
together ``when I felt like he didn't really even know me yet.''
	   They continued talking as they went to the hallway by the study.
Then, with Ms. Lewinsky in mid-sentence, ``he just started kissing
me.'' He lifted her top and touched her breasts with his hands and
mouth. According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President ``unzipped his
pants and sort of exposed himself,'' and she performed oral sex.
	   At one point during the encounter, someone entered the Oval
Office. In Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, ``The President zipped up
real quickly and went out and came back in. ... I just remember
laughing because he had walked out there and he was visibly
aroused, and I just thought it was funny.'' ...
	   On Sunday, February 4, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the
President had their sixth sexual encounter and their first lengthy
and personal conversation. ...
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned her at her
desk and they planned their rendezvous. At her suggestion, they
bumped into each other in the hallway, ``because when it happened
accidentally, that seemed to work really well,'' then walked
together to the area of the private study.
	   There, according to Ms. Lewinsky, they kissed. She was wearing a
long dress that buttoned from the neck to the ankles. ``And he
unbuttoned my dress and he unhooked my bra, and sort of took the
dress off my shoulders and ... moved the bra. ... He was looking at
me and touching me and telling me how beautiful I was.'' He touched
her breasts with his hands and his mouth, and touched her genitals,
first through underwear and then directly. She performed oral sex
on him.
	   After their sexual encounter, the President and Ms. Lewinsky sat
and talked in the Oval Office for about 45 minutes. Ms. Lewinsky
thought the President might be responding to her suggestion during
their previous meeting about ``trying to get to know me.'' It was
during that conversation on February 4, according to Ms. Lewinsky,
that their friendship started to blossom. ...
	   After the break-up on February 19, 1996, according to Ms.
Lewinsky, ``there continued to sort of be this flirtation ... when
we'd see each other.'' After passing Ms. Lewinsky in a hallway one
night in late February or March, the President telephoned her at
home and said he was disappointed that, because she had already
left the White House for the evening, they could not get together.
Ms. Lewinsky testified that the call ``sort of implied to me that
he was interested in starting up again.'' ...
	   On Sunday, March 31, 1996, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she and
the President resumed their sexual contact. ...
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned her at her
desk and suggested that she come to the Oval Office on the pretext
of delivering papers to him. She went to the Oval Office and was
admitted by a plainclothes Secret Service agent. In her folder was
a gift for the President, a Hugo Boss necktie.
	   In the hallway by the study, the President and Ms. Lewinsky
kissed. On this occasion, according to Ms. Lewinsky, ``he focused
on me pretty exclusively,'' kissing her bare breasts and fondling
her genitals. At one point, the President inserted a cigar into Ms.
Lewinsky's vagina, then put the cigar in his mouth and said: ``It
tastes good.'' After they were finished, Ms. Lewinsky left the Oval
Office and walked through the Rose Garden. ...
	   Deeming her frequent visits to the Oval Office area a
``nuisance,'' one Secret Service Officer complained to Evelyn
Lieberman, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations. ...
	   Ms. Lieberman testified that, because Ms. Lewinsky was so
persistent in her efforts to be near the President, ``I decided to
get rid of her.'' ...
	   On Friday, April 5, 1996, Timothy Keating, Staff Director for
Legislative Affairs, informed Ms. Lewinsky that she would have to
leave her White House job. According to Mr. Keating, he told her
that she was not being fired, merely ``being given a different
opportunity.'' In fact, she could tell people it was a promotion if
she cared to do so. Upon hearing of her dismissal, Ms. Lewinsky
burst into tears and asked if there was any way for her to stay in
the White House, even without pay. No, Mr. Keating said. According
to Ms. Lewinsky, ``He told me I was too sexy to be working in the
East Wing and that this job at the Pentagon where I'd be writing
press releases was a sexier job.''
	   Ms. Lewinsky was devastated. She felt that she was being
transferred simply because of her relationship with the President.
And she feared that with the loss of her White House job, ``I was
never going to see the President again. I mean, my relationship
with him would be over.''
 &UR; Conversations with the President about Her Transfer
	   1. Easter Telephone Conversations and Sexual Encounter
	   On Easter Sunday, April 7, 1996, Ms. Lewinsky told the President
of her dismissal and they had a sexual encounter. ...
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned her at home
that day. After they spoke of the death of the Commerce Secretary
the previous week, she told him of her dismissal:

Malta renews application for EU membership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ Malta's new conservative government on
Friday reactivated its application for European Union membership,
making good on its campaign pledge to try to strengthen the island
nation's ties to Europe.
	   Foreign Minister Guido de Marco's letter to the EU ends Malta's
two-year-old suspension of its application.
	   Malta's previous socialist government had argued Malta was not
ready for the tough economic criteria of membership. The
Nationalists routed Labor in Sept. 5 parliamentary elections with a
promise to revive the nation's EU drive.
	   In his letter, de Marco reminded EU officials of earlier
declarations to include Malta in its next round of expansion.
	   The 15-member EU had agreed to start membership talks with Malta
in 1995. The next word on whether those talks can pick up where
they left off may come in December, when EU leaders meet in Vienna.

	   ``I had asked him ... if he was doing okay with Ron Brown's
death, and then after we talked about that for a little bit I told
him that my last day was Monday. And ... he seemed really upset and
sort of asked me to tell him what had happened. So I did and I was
crying and I asked him if I could come see him, and he said that
that was fine.''
	   At the White House, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she told Secret
Service Officer Muskett that she needed to deliver papers to the
President. Officer Muskett admitted her to the Oval Office. ...
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President seemed troubled about
her upcoming departure from the White House:
	   ``... He said, `Why do they have to take you away from me? I
trust you.' And then he told me _ he looked at me and he said, `I
promise you if I win in November I'll bring you back like that.'''
	   He also indicated that she could have any job she wanted after
the election. ...
	   When asked if he had promised to get Ms. Lewinsky another White
House job, the President told the grand jury:
	   ``What I told Ms. Lewinsky was that ... I would do my best to
see that the fact that she had been sent away from the Legislative
Affairs section did not keep her from getting a job in the White
House ... But I did not tell her I would order someone to hire her,
and I never did. ...''
	   ... After this Easter Sunday conversation, the President and Ms.
Lewinsky had a sexual encounter in the hallway, according to Ms.
Lewinsky. She testified that the President touched her breasts with
his mouth and hands. According to Ms. Lewinsky: ``I think he
unzipped (his pants) ... because it was sort of this running joke
that I could never unbutton his pants, that I just had trouble with
it.'' Ms. Lewinsky performed oral sex. The President did not
ejaculate in her presence.
	   During this encounter, someone called out from the Oval Office
that the President had a phone call. He ... took the call in the
study. The President indicated that Ms. Lewinsky should perform
oral sex while he talked on the phone, and she obliged. The
telephone conversation was about politics, and Ms. Lewinsky thought
the caller might be Dick Morris. White House records confirm that
the President had one telephone call during Ms. Lewinsky's visit:
from ``Mr. Richard Morris'' ....
	   A second interruption occurred a few minutes later, according to
Ms. Lewinsky. ...
	   ``Harold Ickes has a very distinct voice and ... I heard him
holler `Mr. President,' and the President looked at me and I looked
at him and he jetted out into the Oval Office. ...
	   ... The testimony of Secret Service Officer Muskett corroborates
Ms. Lewinsky's account. ...
	   At 5:30 p.m., two minutes after Ms. Lewinsky left the White
House, the President called the office of the person who had
decided to transfer Ms. Lewinsky, Evelyn Lieberman.
	   2. April 12-13: Telephone Conversations
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified that the President telephoned her the
following Friday, April 12, 1996 ....
	   ``(H)e had come to learn ... that Evelyn Lieberman had sort of
spearheaded the transfer, and that she thought he was paying too
much attention to me and I was paying too much attention to him and
that she didn't necessarily care what happened after the election
but everyone needed to be careful before the election.''
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President told her to give the
Pentagon a try, and, if she did not like it, he would get her a job
on the campaign. ...
	   V. April-December 1996: No Private Meetings
	   After Ms. Lewinsky began her Pentagon job on April 16, 1996, she
had no further physical contact with the President for the
remainder of the year. She and the President spoke by phone (and
had phone sex) but saw each other only at public functions. ...
	   C. Telephone Conversations
	   ... According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned her at
about 6:30 a.m. on July 19, the day he was leaving for the 1996
Olympics in Atlanta, and they had phone sex, after which the
President exclaimed, ``(G)ood morning!'' and then said: ``What a
way to start a day.'' A call log shows that the President called
the White House operator at 12:11 a.m. on July 19 and asked for a
wake-up call at 7 a.m., then at 6:40 a.m., the President called and
said he was already up. In Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, she and the
President also had phone sex on May 21, July 5 or 6, October 22,
and December 2, 1996. On those dates, Mrs. Clinton was in Denver
(May 21), Prague and Budapest (July 5-6), Las Vegas (October 22),
and en route to Bolivia (December 2).
	   Ms. Lewinsky repeatedly told the President that she disliked her
Pentagon job and wanted to return to the White House. ... Ms.
Lewinsky recounted one call:
	   ``... (The President) said, `I don't want to talk about your job
tonight. ... I want to talk about other things' _ which meant phone
sex. ...''
	   ... During a phone conversation on September 5, according to Ms.
Lewinsky, she told the President that she wanted to have
intercourse with him. He responded that he could not do so because
of the possible consequences. ...
	   D. Public Encounters
	   During this period, Ms. Lewinsky occasionally saw the President
in public. She testified:
	   ``I'm an insecure person ... and I was insecure about the
relationship at times and thought that he would come to forget me
easily ...''
	   ... On August 18, Ms. Lewinsky attended the President's 50th
birthday party at Radio City Music Hall. ... According to Ms.
Lewinsky, when the President reached past her at the rope line to
shake hands with another guest, she reached out and touched his
crotch in a ``playful'' fashion. ...

	   VI. Early 1997: Resumption of Sexual Encounters
	   In 1997, President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had further private
meetings, which now were arranged by Betty Currie, the President's
secretary. After the taping of the President's weekly radio address
on February 28, the President and Ms. Lewinsky had a sexual
encounter. On March 24, they had what proved to be their final
sexual encounter. ...
	   A. Resumption of Meetings with the President
	   ... According to Ms. Currie, Ms. Lewinsky would often call her
and say she wanted to see the President. ... Ms. Currie would ...
arrange the meeting. ...
	   According to Ms. Currie, Ms. Lewinsky and the President were
alone together in the Oval Office or the study for 15 to 20 minutes
on multiple occasions.
	   b. Intermediary for Gifts
	   Ms. Lewinsky also sent over a number of packages _ six or eight,
Ms. Currie estimated. ... Courier receipts show that Ms. Lewinsky
sent seven packages to the White House between October 7 and
December 8, 1997. ...
	   C. Secrecy
	   Ms. Currie testified that she suspected impropriety in the
President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. ...
	   Ms. Currie helped keep the relationship secret. When the
President wanted to talk with Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie would dial
the call herself rather than go through White House operators. ...
When Ms. Lewinsky phoned ... she did not log the call. ...
According to Secret Service uniformed officers, Ms. Currie
sometimes tried to persuade them to admit Ms. Lewinsky to the White
House compound without making a record of it. ...
	   2. Observations by Secret Service Officers
	   ... From radio traffic about the President's movements, several
officers observed that the President often would head for the Oval
Office within minutes of Ms. Lewinsky's entry to the complex ...
and some noted that he would return to the Residence a short time
after her departure. ...
	   D. February 28 Sexual Encounter
	   ... Wearing a navy blue dress from the Gap, Ms. Lewinsky
attended the radio address at the President's invitation (relayed
by Ms. Currie). ... Ms. Lewinsky had not been alone with the
President since she had worked at the White House. ... President
Clinton told her to see Ms. Currie after the photo was taken
because he wanted to give her something. ``So I waited a little
while for him and then Betty and the President and I went into the
back office,'' Ms. Lewinsky testified. (... Once they had passed
from the Oval Office toward the private study, Ms. Currie said,
``I'll be right back,'' and walked on to the back pantry or the
dining room, where, according to Ms. Currie, she waited for 15 to
20 minutes while the President and Ms. Lewinsky were in the study.
...
	   In the study, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President ``started
to say something to me and I was pestering him to kiss me, because
. . . it had been a long time since we had been alone.'' The
President told her to wait a moment, as he had presents for her. As
belated Christmas gifts, he gave her a hat pin and a special
edition of Walt Whitman's ``Leaves of Grass''. ...
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified that after the President gave her the
gifts, they had a sexual encounter:
	   ``We went back over by the bathroom in the hallway, and we
kissed. We were kissing and he unbuttoned my dress and fondled my
breasts with my bra on, and then took them out of my bra and was
kissing them and touching them with his hands and with his mouth.
	   ``And then I think I was touching him in his genital area
through his pants, and I think I unbuttoned his shirt and was
kissing his chest. ... I wanted to perform oral sex on him ... and
so I did. And then ... we moved into the bathroom.
	   ``And I continued to perform oral sex and then he pushed me away
... and then I stood up and I said ... `I care about you so much; .
. . I don't understand why you won't let me . . . make you come;
it's important to me.' ...
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified that she and the President hugged, and
``he said he didn't want to get addicted to me, and he didn't want
me to get addicted to him.'' ... Then, saying that ``I don't want
to disappoint you,'' the President consented. For the first time,
she performed oral sex through completion.
	   When Ms. Lewinsky next took the navy blue Gap dress from her
closet to wear it, she noticed stains near one hip and on the
chest. FBI Laboratory tests revealed that the stains are the
President's semen.
	   In his grand jury testimony, the President _ who, because the
OIC had asked him for a blood sample ... had reason to suspect that
Ms. Lewinsky's dress might bear traces of his semen _ indicated
that he and Ms. Lewinsky had had sexual contact on the day of the
radio address. He testified:
	   ``I was sick after it was over and I, I was pleased at that time
that it had been nearly a year since any inappropriate contact had
occurred with Ms. Lewinsky. I promised myself it wasn't going to
happen again. The facts are complicated about what did happen and
how it happened. But, nonetheless, I'm responsible for it.''
	   Later the President added, referring to the evening of the radio
address: ``I do believe that I was alone with her from 15 to 20
minutes. I do believe that things happened then which were
inappropriate.'' ...

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS quote in 5th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ President Liamine Zeroual, facing
increasing social strife and an Islamic insurgency that has defied
a brutal crackdown for more than six years, announced Friday that
he will cut short his mandate and call an early election.
	   Zeroual, speaking in a nationwide television address, said he
would hold early elections for a new president before the end of
February 1999.
	   Zeroual, a retired general who also serves as defense minister,
was elected to the presidency in November 1995 for a five year term
that expires in the year 2000.
	   Zeroual, 57, ailing, rarely seen in public and reportedly losing
favor among powerful military clans, was making his second
nationwide address in just over three weeks.
	   The 40-minute speech by Zeroual was devoted mainly to a review
of his accomplishments. He concluded with his decision to step down
early, saying it is based on his wish to make political pluralism a
``concrete reality.''
	   He said he would open discussions ``immediately'' with the
various political parties to prepare elections.

Defense gives Feyenoord 1-0 victory over SC Heerenveen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A massed defense and a disastrous
Hans Vonk goalkeeping error Friday gave Feyenoord Rotterdam its
fourth straight victory and leadership of the Dutch premiership.
	   A defensive game saw both Feyenoord and SC Heerenveen err on the
side of caution, but the Rotterdammers' 1-0 win gives them 12
points from four games.
	   The winner of Sunday's clash between the other two teams yet to
drop a point, Ajax Amsterdam and FC Utrecht, can draw level with
Feyenoord.
	   After 63 minutes, Feyenoord's Brazilian forward Ronildo Tininho
Pereira de Freitas was presented with the ball on the edge of the
Heerenveen box after a defensive error.
	   Tininho's skidding shot looked harmless enough but Vonk fell
backwards and let the ball pass through his legs.
	   The game opened up but a well-organized Feyenoord defense kept
Heerenveen from scoring.

Frankfurt holds Stuttgart to draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Visiting VfB Stuttgart, hoping to gain ground on
Bayern Munich Friday, instead struggled to a 1-1 draw with
Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga
	   Frankfurt, winless since returning to the Bundesliga this
season, was outplayed but knotted the match on Ansgar Brinkmann's
penalty conversion with a minute left.
	   ``What can you say? Whether it was a penalty or not, we were
always out of position,'' said Stuttgart striker Fredi Bobic.
	   With veteran Bernhard Winkler connecting for his league best
fourth and fifth goals, 1860 Munich also beat Moenchengladbach 3-1.
	   Second-place Stuttgart, coming off a 4-0 rout of defending
champion Kaiserslautern Wednesday, still trails Munich by two
points.
	   Munich, impressive thus far, puts an unblemished record of three
wins on the line Saturday when it travels to SC Freiburg.
	   Stuttgart, flat after the big win against Kaiserslautern, seized
a 71st minute lead when Krassiimir Balakov pounced on a defender's
failure to clear. His rising shot struck the crossbar and dropped
in.
	   It was the 100th Bundesliga match for the Bulgarian
international, long a key player for the team.
	   But Stuttgart's Dutch libero, Frank Verlaat, tangled up with
Thomas Epp inside the box, allowing harmless Frankfurt to salvage a
draw.
	   Frankfurt, a former Bundesliga powerhouse that tumbled into the
second division, hasn't given its fans at Waldstadium a win since
beating Werder Bremen on April 27, 1996.
	   1860 Munich moved points even with Stuttgart at seven points in
four rounds _ the second Bavarian team's best start since rejoining
the league in 1994.
	   Winkler's two headers came in the second and 84th minute, while
Marco Kurz also scored in the 23rd. Michael Klinkert shot
Moenchengladbach's consolation tally in the 56th.

 &UR; Eds: note sexually explicit content in 19th graf, Ms. Lewinsky
 &UR; UNDATED: Lewinsky anticipated. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   Ms. Lewinsky added that she was inclined ``to walk away from it
all,'' but acknowledged that ``I'm always saying this and then I
change my mind.''
	   ... Over the next three weeks, Ms. Lewinsky tried repeatedly,
without success, to talk with the President about her job quest. In
a draft of a letter to Ms. Currie, she wrote that the President
``said to me that he had told (Deputy Director of Personnel Marsha)
Scott I had gotten a bum deal, and I should get a good job in the
West Wing,'' but Ms. Scott did not seem eager to arrange for Ms.
Lewinsky's return. Ms. Lewinsky wrote:
	   ``I was surprised that she would question his judgment and not
just do what he asked of her. Is it possible that, in fact, he did
not tell her that? Does he really not want me back in the complex?
He has not responded to my note, nor has he called me. Do you know
what is going on? If so, are you able to share it with me?''
	   ... Ms. Lewinsky also drafted a note to the President pleading
for a brief meeting. ... Referring to her inability to get in touch
with him, she wrote: ``Please do not do this to me. I feel
disposable, used and insignificant. I understand your hands are
tied, but I want to talk to you and look at some options.''
	   ... ``Very frustrated'' over her inability to get in touch with
the President to discuss her job situation, Ms. Lewinsky wrote him
a peevish letter on July 3, 1997. Opening ``Dear Sir,'' the letter
took the President to task for breaking his promise to get her
another White House job. Ms. Lewinsky also obliquely threatened to
disclose their relationship. If she was not going to return to work
at the White House, she wrote, then she would ``need to explain to
my parents exactly why that wasn't happening.'' ... She wanted to
remind the President that she had ``left the White House like a
good girl in April of '96,'' whereas other people might have
threatened disclosure in order to retain the job.
	   Ms. Lewinsky also raised the possibility of a job outside
Washington. If returning to the White House was impossible, she
asked in this letter, could he get her a job at the United Nations
in New York? ...
	   Though not questioned about this particular letter, the
President testified that he believed Ms. Lewinsky might disclose
their intimate relationship once he stopped it. He testified:
	   ``After I terminated the improper contact with her, she wanted
to come in more than she did. She got angry when she didn't get in
sometimes. I knew that that might make her more likely to speak,
and I still did it because I had to limit the contact.''
	   ... On Friday, July 4, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky had what she
characterized as a ``very emotional'' visit with the President. ...
	   In Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, their meeting began
contentiously, with the President scolding her: ``It's illegal to
threaten the President of the United States.'' ...
	   There, the President was ``the most affectionate with me he'd
ever been,'' Ms. Lewinsky testified. He stroked her arm, toyed with
her hair, kissed her on the neck, praised her intellect and beauty.
In Ms. Lewinsky's recollection:
	   He remarked ... that he wished he had more time for me. And so I
said, well, maybe you will have more time in three years. And I was
... thinking just when he wasn't President, he was going to have
more time on his hands. And he said, well, I don't know, I might be
alone in three years. And then I said something about ... us sort
of being together. I think I kind of said, oh, I think we'd be a
good team, or something like that. And he ... jokingly said, well,
what are we going to do when I'm 75 and I have to pee 25 times a
day? And ... I told him that we'd deal with that. ...
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified that ``I left that day sort of
emotionally stunned,'' for ``I just knew he was in love with me.''
	   Just before leaving ... she informed him that Newsweek was
working on an article about Kathleen Willey, a former White House
volunteer who claimed that the President had sexually harassed her.
...
	   The President responded that the harassment allegation was
ludicrous, because he would never approach a small-breasted woman
like Ms. Willey.
	   ... The President wondered if Ms. Lewinsky had mentioned the
Willey call to Ms. Tripp, who in turn might have told (Newsweek
reporter Michael) Isikoff. Ms. Lewinsky acknowledged that she had
done so. Ms. Lewinsky testified: ``He was concerned about Linda,
and I reassured him. He asked me if I trusted her, and I said
yes.''
	   ... Ms. Lewinsky testified that she brought birthday gifts for
the President (his birthday is August 19):
	   ``I had set up in his back office, I had brought an apple square
and put a candle and had put his birthday presents out. And after
he came back in and I sang happy birthday and he got his presents,
I asked him ... if we could share a birthday kiss in honor of our
birthdays, because mine had been just a few weeks before. So, he
said that that was OK and we could kind of bend the rules that day.
And so ... we kissed.''
	   Ms. Lewinsky touched the President's genitals through his pants
and moved to perform oral sex, but the President rebuffed her. ...
``He said, I'm trying not to do this and I'm trying to be good. ...
He got visibly upset. And so ... I hugged him and I told him I was
sorry and not to be upset.'' Later, in a draft note to
``Handsome,'' Ms. Lewinsky referred to this visit: ``It was awful
when I saw you for your birthday in August. You were so distant
that I missed you as I was holding you in my arms.''

Swissair plane in near miss with KLM aircraft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW for AMs

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Two aircraft bound for New York took
evasive action over the Atlantic Ocean on Friday after a KLM flight
heading for the Netherlands found itself 45 miles (70 kms) off
course.
	   The two planes, a British Airways Boeing 767 and a Swissair
MD-11, changed course to avoid the risk of colliding with a third,
a KLM MD-11 flight, authorities said. All three planes later landed
safely and there were no reports of any injuries.
	   The Swissair MD-11 is the same type of airliner that crashed in
Canada last week, killing all 229 people on board. The route on
which the incident took place was also the same.
	   The two incidents took place within ten minutes of each other at
1330 GMT on Friday, 450 miles (720 kms) west of Ireland in the
Shanwick Oceanic Airspace, Robert Ferrugia, spokesman for Britain's
Civil Aviation Authority, said. The airspace stretches from the
west Irish coastline into the mid-Atlantic, Ferrugia said, and
comes under the United Kingdom CAA's control. The CAA gave no
futher details.
	   Swissair spokesman Erwin Schaerer said a collision between the
Swissair Geneva to New York flight and the KLM's Flight 0752 was
avoided thanks to electronic warning devices.
	   Schaerer said the Swissair Flight 114 was flying at 10,500
meters (34,650 feet) as the KLM aircraft, flying from Curacao in
the Dutch Antilles to Amsterdam, approached. He didn't give the
distance between the two aircraft.
	   Both aircraft had Traffic Collision Avoidance System equipment,
which made the Swissair airliner descend and the KLM aircraft rise,
Schaerer said. The equipment detects other aircraft ``a long way
ahead,'' he said without being more specific.
	   A second Swissair spokesman, Roland Breitler, said that
passengers on the flight ``would probably not even have noticed''
when the maneuver was carried out.
	   KLM spokesman Peter Wellhuner said that the incident had
happened because pilots on the Dutch flight ``thought they were on
a position that was about 45 miles (70 kms) away from the position
they actually were.''
	   ``There was not any danger,'' Wellhuner said. ``Even if there
was no warning, then the aircraft still should have passed each
other by a distance of 8-10 kms (5 - 6.2 miles).''
	   Wellhuner said that KLM had mounted an inquiry to investigate
why the aircraft's instruments apparently gave a false positional
reading to the pilot and crew.
	   The CAA said that it had received two ``airprox'' reports from
pilots involved in the near misses. An airprox is when one aircraft
strays into what is considered the space of another. The CAA did
not give a figure for what an airprox in the mid-Atlantic could
constitute.
	   British Airways declined to comment, but said that it understood
that one of its New York bound flights had been involved in the
incident.

Hingis rallies, returns to women's title match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Hingis-Novotna match; Changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Martina Hingis, on the verge of elimination, won
the final five games of the match to defeat Jana Novotna 3-6, 6-1,
6-4 Friday and move into the U.S. Open women's singles championship
match for second straight year.
	   Novotna, known for her collapses in big matches, again crumbled,
committing 20 unforced errors in the final set to only five by the
Swiss miss.
	   The top seed and defending champion, Hingis was two breaks down
in the final set when she began her dramatic climb into the final
of the year's final Grand Slam tournament. She will play the winner
of Friday's second semifinal between No. 2 Lindsay Davenport and
No. 5 Venus Williams in Saturday's final.
	   ``I was fighting for the No. 1 spot,'' said Hingis, who would
have dropped out of the top spot if she had lost today.
	   Novotna dictated play to begin the match, although she had as
much trouble as Hingis in holding serve. There were five
consecutive breaks of service in the opening set, though it was
obvious that the set was played at Novotna's pace.
	   ``Jana didn't miss anything,'' Hingis said. ``I haven't played
against anybody like her. But we're doubles partners, so I know her
weakness and she knows mine.''
	   After a timid first set, Hingis began showing the game that
rocketed her to No. 1 in the world. She was helped immensely by the
Czech, who began spraying the ball everywhere but on the court,
committing 17 unforced errors to only two for the 17-year-old
Hingis.
	   Novotna appeared to regain her edge in the final set, breaking
Hingis in the first and fifth games to take a 4-1 lead. All she had
to do was hold serve twice to advance to the final.
	   Instead, she again missed wide-open shots and hit easy shots
into the net.
	   Hingis broke Novotna at 30 in the sixth game. She finished by
winning 18 of the last 22 points in a bid to duplicate her
Australian Open victory.
	   ``I was always there,'' Hingis said. ``I lost some stupid games,
but I was hanging. I couldn't make the last two points until the
end.''
	   Davenport, 22, reached the semifinals at both the Australian
Open and French Open earlier this year, while Williams, 18, is
seeking to make her second straight trip to the final at Arthur
Ashe Stadium.
	   Pairings for the men's semifinals, which will be played on
``Super Saturday,'' were completed Thursday when No. 10 Carlos Moya
defeated Sweden's Magnus Larsson 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 and Australia's Mark
Philippoussis served 30 aces in outlasting Thomas Johansson of
Sweden 4-6, 6-3, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 7-6 (12-10).
	   The other semi sends top-seeded Pete Sampras against defending
men's champion Patrick Rafter in what could be the real battle for
the crown.
	   The tournament's first title was decided Thursday when Serena
Williams completed a Williams family Grand Slam of sorts when she
teamed with Max Mirnyi of Belarus to capture the mixed doubles,
defeating Lisa Raymond and Patrick Galbraith 6-2, 6-2.
	   Williams and Mirnyi also won the Wimbledon mixed doubles, while
Serena's older sister, Venus, won the mixed at the Australian and
French Opens with Justin Gimelstob.
	   Sandon Stolle of Australia and Cyril Suk of the Czech Republic
won the men's doubles today, defeating Mark Knowles of the Bahamas
and Daniel Nestor of Canada 6-4, 6-7
	   Hingis dominated the women's game a year ago, capturing three of
the four Grand Slam tournaments. This year has been different,
however. She hasn't won a title since the Italian Open in May.
	   ``I have the feeling I'm getting better again, so that gives me
a lot of confidence,'' Hingis said after beating eighth-seeded
Monica Seles in the quarterfinals. ``I just feel like I control the
game a little better again.''
	   Until Wimbledon, Novotna was best known for her losses, even
though she has been in the top four in the world for the past three
years. Wimbledon changed all that.
	   Davenport has been the best player on the Corel WTA Tour during
the hardcourt season this summer, winning three consecutive
tournaments in her native California. She also reached the
semifinals at the year's first two Grand Slam events, the
Australian and French Opens. Davenport was ousted in the quarters
at Wimbledon by Nathalie Tauziat, a loss she avenged in the Open.
	   ``I haven't lost a set,'' she said. ``I'm just happy to be in
the semifinals.''
	   Philippoussis slammed 11 aces in the final set in his victory
over Johansson, who had 20 aces and 15 double-faults. Philippoussis
hit one serve at 132 mph (212 kph), only to be outdone by the
Swede, whose 136 mph (219 kph) serve was the fastest of the
tournament.

Is Brazil going under?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ It's somehow fitting that the
question Brazilians are asking comes from pool-hall parlance. After
Russia, is this country the ``bola da vez'' _ the next ball to go?
	   Some investors have been betting against Brazil. As confidence
in the economy wanes, local stocks have plunged, dollars flow
abroad, the jobless rolls grow and the country spins toward
recession.
	   If Brazil _ the world's eighth-largest economy _ goes under,
much of Latin America could go with it. Then everyone loses,
including industrialized powers with investments and markets here.
	   ``We must go beyond market limits and talk to world leaders,''
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said. ``They must see that
clearer steps must be taken.''
	   On Thursday, the steady deterioration in Brazilian markets
turned to pure panic.
	   The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest, plummeted
15.8 percent, its biggest drop in eight years. Trading was twice
halted by a circuit-breaker in a vain attempt to stop the bleeding.
	   ``Foreign investors' orders are exclusively to sell,'' said
Fabio Lara, director at Sao Paulo brokerage Schahin Cury.
	   Nearly dlrs 2 billion fled the country on Thursday alone. Since
August, investors have pulled out dlrs 23 billion, and Brazil's
vital currency reserves have dwindled to dlrs 52 billion.
	   Asked if he planned to raise interest rates again, a week after
the last hike, Cardoso said no. While it might lure back investors
looking for a quick profit, higher interest rates would hurt local
businessmen, consumers and workers.
	   ``I can't sacrifice the country because of greed,'' he said.
Hours later, though, key interest rates went up again, to 49.75
percent from 29.75 percent.
	   Markets responded to the measure _ and rumors of a dlrs 30
billion bailout package in the works in Washington, D.C. On Friday,
the Sao Paulo market rebounded and closed up 13.3 percent.
	   Brazil is vulnerable because it has large deficits at home and
abroad, which makes it dependent on foreign financing. With money
suddenly scarce, investors fear Brazil won't be able to pay its
debts.
	   The problem is Cardoso doesn't have many options. This week he
slashed 4 billion reals, or about dlrs 3.4 billion, from the budget
for this year and set stingy targets for 1999.
	   With national elections barely three weeks away, it'll be hard
to make further cuts. The brakes already are on. Growth will likely
be a scrawny 1 percent, while unemployment officially is 8 percent
_ labor union statistics say it's twice that high.
	   The irony is that the economy was the centerpiece of Cardoso's
campaign. For four years he had slowly reformed Brazil's bloated
government, reducing spending, lowering trade barriers, and cutting
inflation from 50 percent a month in 1994 to about 2 percent a year
now.
	   For now, Brazilians accept unemployment as a tradeoff for a
stable currency. But as restlessness over stagnation grows, many
are questioning the premise. If Brazil played by market rules and
lost, maybe it was the wrong game to start with.

Killing of Hamas fugitives triggers violent chain reaction

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS writethru designator, UPDATES with Palestinian
Cabinet statement &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos JRL101-110
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A volley of shots fired in a remote West Bank
cottage set off a violent chain reaction Friday that threatened to
cripple Washington's latest Mideast peace mission.
	   The bullets fired by Israeli troops in a raid of a Hamas hideout
killed two top fugitives sought for planning terror attacks. Vowing
retaliation, Islamic militants said they would detonate bombs in
the Jewish state. Hundreds of Hamas supporters took to the streets,
clamoring for revenge, and threw stones at Israeli soldiers.
	   Troops sprayed one group of protesters in the West Bank town of
El Bireh with rubber bullets, injuring five people.
	   The army also sealed the West Bank and Gaza Strip, fanning
Palestinian resentment already running high over the 17-month
stalemate in talks on an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   Despite the rising tensions, U.S. envoy Dennis Ross on Friday
pressed on with efforts to narrow the gaps between Israel and the
Palestinians. He met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai. Asked how the negotiations were
going, Mordechai said: ``Slowly, slowly.''
	   The Palestinian Cabinet condemned the killing of the Awadallah
brothers and suggested it was timed to scuttle the Ross mission.
``There is no hope for progress if Israel continues with such
policies,'' said a statement issued after the weekly Cabinet
session.
	   The ministers also demanded that Israel accept all elements of a
U.S. proposal which was first presented in January and is the basis
of Ross' current mission. Under the plan, Israel would withdraw
from 13 percent of the West Bank and the Palestinians would work
more closely with he United States in fighting Islamic militants.
	   In a show of defiance, the Cabinet also announced that it
discussed peparations for a declaration of statehood in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he
would make the announcement on May 4, 1999, regardless of whether a
final peace agreement with Israel has been negotiated.
	   The United States has urged Arafat to reconsider, and the
Cabinet statement, coming at a time when Ross is in the region,
signaled that Palestinian positions have only hardened.

 &UR; Continuing Job Efforts

<TEXT>
	   ... Ms. Lewinsky told one friend:
	   ``So for now, there isn't any place for me to be detailed. ...
So it's over. I don't know what I will do now but I can't wait any
more and I can't go through all of this crap anymore. In some ways
I hope I never hear from him again because he'll just lead me on
because he doesn't have the balls to tell me the truth.''
	   ... Ms. Lewinsky expressed her escalating frustration in a note
to the President that she drafted (but did not send). She wrote:
	   ``I believe the time has finally come for me to throw in the
towel. My conversation with Marsha left me disappointed,
frustrated, sad and angry. I can't help but wonder if you knew she
wouldn't be able to detail me over there when I last saw you. Maybe
that would explain your coldness. The only explanation I can reason
for your not bringing me back is that you just plain didn't want to
enough or care about me enough.''
	   ... She continued: ``I just loved you -- wanted to spend time
with you, kiss you, listen to you laugh -- and I wanted you to love
me back.'' ...
	   Ms. Lewinsky continued trying to discuss her situation with the
President. On Friday, September 12, 1997, she arrived at the White
House without an appointment, called Ms. Currie, and had a long
wait at the gate. When Ms. Currie came to meet her, Ms. Lewinsky
was crying. Ms. Currie explained that sometimes the President's
hands are tied -- but, she said, she had gotten his authorization
to ask John Podesta, the Deputy Chief of Staff, to help Ms.
Lewinsky return to work at the White House.
	   J. Black Dog Gifts
	   Before the President had left for vacation, Ms. Lewinsky had
sent a note asking if he could bring her a T-shirt from the Black
Dog, a popular Vineyard restaurant. In early September, Ms. Currie
gave several Black Dog items to Ms. Lewinsky. In an email message
to Catherine Davis, Ms. Lewinsky wrote: ``Well, I found out from
Betty yesterday that he not only brought me a T-shirt, he got me 2
T-shirts, a hat and a dress!!!! Even though he's a big schmuck,
that is surprisingly sweet -- even that he remembered!''
	   K. ... Involvement of Chief of Staff
	   Ms. Lewinsky did not visit the White House the night of
September 30, but the President called her late the night of
September 30 or October 1. According to Ms. Lewinsky, he may have
mentioned during this call that he would get Erskine Bowles to help
her find a White House job.
	   ... The President asked Mr. Bowles to try to find Ms. Lewinsky a
job in the Old Executive Office Building. Mr. Bowles assigned his
deputy, John Podesta, to handle it.
	   L. News of Job Search Failure
	   On October 6, 1997, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she was told that
she would never work at the White House again. Ms. Tripp conveyed
the news, which she indicated had come from a friend on the White
House staff. Ms. Lewinsky testified:
	   Linda Tripp called me at work on October 6th and told me that
her friend Kate in the NSC (National Security Council)... had heard
rumors about me and that I would never work in the White House
again . ... (Kate's) advice to me was ``get out of town.''
	   For Ms. Lewinsky, who had previously considered moving to New
York, this call was the ``straw that broke the camel's back.'' She
was enraged.
	   When terminating their sexual relationship on May 24, the
President had told Ms. Lewinsky that he hoped they would remain
friends, for he could do a great deal for her.
	   ... In a recorded conversation later on October 6, Ms. Lewinsky
said she wanted two things from the President. The first was
contrition: He needed to ``acknowledge ... that he helped
(expletive) up my life.'' The second was a job, one that she could
obtain without much effort: ``I don't want to have to work for this
position. ... I just want it to be given to me.'' Ms. Lewinsky
decided to write the President a note proposing that the two of
them ``get together and work on some way that I can come out of
this situation not feeling the way I do.'' ...
	   In this letter, which was sent via courier on October 7, Ms.
Lewinsky said she understood that she would never be given a White
House job, and she asked for a prompt meeting to discuss her job
situation. She went on to advance a specific request:
	   I'd like to ask you to help me secure a position in NY beginning
1 December. I would be very grateful, and I am hoping this is a
solution for both of us. I want you to know that it has always been
and remains more important to me to have you in my life than to
come back. . . . Please don't let me down.
	   IX. October-November 1997:
	   United Nations' Job Offer
	   Having learned that she would not be able to return to the White
House, Ms. Lewinsky sought the President's help in finding a job in
New York City. The President offered to place her at the United
Nations. After initial enthusiasm, Ms. Lewinsky cooled on the idea
of working at the U.N., and she prodded the President to get her a
job in the private sector.
	   A. October 10: Telephone Conversation
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned her at
approximately 2:00 to 2:30 a.m. on Friday, October 10. They spent
much of the hour-and-a-half call arguing. ``He got so mad at me, he
must have been purple,'' she later recalled.
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President said: ``If I had known
what kind of person you really were, I wouldn't have gotten
involved with you.'' He reminded Ms. Lewinsky that she had earlier
promised, ``if you just want to stop doing this, I'll ... be no
trouble.'' Ms. Lewinsky said she challenged the President: ``Tell
me ... when I've caused you trouble.'' The President responded,
``I've never worried about you. I've never been worried you would
do something to hurt me.''

	   ... B. October 11 Meeting
	   At approximately 8:30 a.m. on Saturday, October 11, according to
Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie called and told her that the President
wished to see her.
	   ... Ms. Lewinsky met with the President in the study, and they
discussed her job search. Ms. Lewinsky told the President that she
wanted to pursue jobs in the private sector, and he told her to
prepare a list of New York companies that interested her. Ms.
Lewinsky asked the President whether Vernon Jordan, a well-known
Washington attorney who she knew was a close friend of the
President and had many business contacts, might help her find a
job. According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President was receptive to the
idea.
	   ... C. October 16-17: The ``Wish List''
	   On October 16, Ms. Lewinsky sent the President a packet, which
included what she called a ``wish list'' describing the types of
jobs that interested her in New York City. ... The most important
things to me are that I am engaged and interested in my work, I am
not someone's administrative executive assistant, and my salary can
provide me a comfortable living in NY.
	   ... In addition to the ``wish list,'' Ms. Lewinsky said she
enclosed in the packet a pair of sunglasses and ``a lot of things
in a little envelope,'' including some jokes, a card, and a
postcard. She said that she had written on the card: ``Wasn't I
right that my hugs are better in person than in cards?'' The
postcard featured a ``very erotic'' Egon Schiele painting. Ms.
Lewinsky also enclosed a note with her thoughts on education
reform.
	   ... D. The President Creates Options
	   At some point around this time in the fall of 1997, Ms. Currie
asked John Podesta, the Deputy Chief of Staff, to help Ms. Lewinsky
find a job in New York. Mr. Podesta testified that, during a
Presidential trip to Latin America, he approached then-U.N.
Ambassador William Richardson while aboard Air Force One and asked
the Ambassador to consider a former White House intern for a
position at the U.N. ...
	   ... E. The U.N. Interview and Job Offer
	   On Friday morning, October 31, Ambassador Richardson and two of
his assistants, Mona Sutphen and Rebecca Cooper, interviewed Ms.
Lewinsky at the Watergate. According to Ambassador Richardson, he
``listen(ed) while Mona and Rebecca were interviewing her.''
Neither Ambassador Richardson nor any of his staff made inquiries,
before or after the interview, about Ms. Lewinsky's prior work
performance.
	   ... According to his assistant, Ambassador Richardson made the
decision to hire Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Sutphen testified:
	   I said, are you sure; and he said, yeah, yeah, I'm sure, why.
And I said ... are you sure, though you don't want to talk to
anyone else ... And he said, no, no, I think it's fine; why don't
you go ahead and give her an offer?
	   ... Ms. Currie first testified that she had ``probably'' told
the President about Ms. Lewinsky's U.N. offer, then testified that
she had in fact told him, then testified that she could not
remember, though she acknowledged that the President was interested
in Ms. Lewinsky's getting a job.
	   When the President was asked in the Jones deposition whether he
knew that Ms. Lewinsky had received the offer of a job at the U.N.,
he testified: ``I know that she interviewed for one. I don't know
if she was offered one or not.''
 &UR; The U.N. Job Offer Declined
	   Ms. Lewinsky met with Vernon Jordan, who promised to help her
find a job in New York. ... Mr. Jordan did not meet with Ms.
Lewinsky again, nor did he contact anyone in New York City on her
behalf. Ms. Lewinsky became increasingly anxious about her
inability to see the President. ...
 &UR; Interrogatories Answered
	   On November 3, 1997, the President answered Paula Jones's Second
Set of Interrogatories. Two of those interrogatories asked the
President to list any woman other than his wife with whom he had
``had,'' ``proposed having,'' or ``sought to have'' sexual
relations during the time that he was Attorney General of Arkansas,
Governor of Arkansas, and President of the United States. President
Clinton objected to the scope and relevance of both interrogatories
and refused to answer them.
 &UR; First Vernon Jordan Meeting
	   In mid-October, the President had agreed to involve Vernon
Jordan in Ms. Lewinsky's job search. ... In Ms. Lewinsky's account,
Ms. Currie sought Mr. Jordan's aid at the President's direction.
Mr. Jordan likewise testified that, in his understanding, the
President was behind Ms. Currie's request.
	   Ms. Currie testified at various points that she contacted Mr.
Jordan on her own initiative; that the President ``probably''
talked with her about Ms. Lewinsky's New York job hunt; and that
she could not recall whether the President was involved. In his
Jones deposition, the President was asked whether he did anything
to facilitate a meeting between Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky. He
testified:
	   ``... My memory is that Vernon said something to me about her
coming in, Betty had called and asked if he (Mr. Jordan) would see
her (Ms. Lewinsky) ... I'm sure if he said something to me about it
I said something positive about it. I wouldn't have said anything
negative about it.
	   When pressed, the President testified that he did not think that
he was the ``precipitating force'' in arranging the meeting ...
	   At 8:50 a.m. on November 5, Mr. Jordan spoke with the President
by telephone for five minutes. Later that morning, Mr. Jordan and
Ms. Lewinsky met in his office for about twenty minutes. ...

Zeroual announces early retirement from presidency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout, quotes, new info, background &QL; 
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ President Liamine Zeroual, facing the
threat of a general strike and an Islamic insurgency that has
defied a brutal crackdown for more than six years, announced Friday
that he will cut short his mandate and call an early election.
	   Zeroual, speaking in a nationwide television address, said he
would hold early elections for a new president before the end of
February 1999.
	   Zeroual, 57, a retired general who also serves as defense
minister, was elected to the presidency in November 1995 -- the
nation's first pluralistic vote for president. His five-year term
expires in the year 2000.
	   There has been speculation for months that Zeroual might resign
from office, pushed out by the military elite which first put him
in power.
	   The president, who underwent surgery in Switzerland in March for
arterial blockage in the right leg, has rarely been seen in public.
He has reportedly lost favor with the powerful military clans that
run this North African nation from the shadows.
	   The top presidential aide, Mohamed Betchine, once a top security
officer, has maintained an increasingly public profile despite a
press campaign questioning his authority.
	   The Friday night address was, unusually, his second to the
nation in just over three weeks.
	   The 40-minute speech was devoted mainly to a review of his
accomplishments. He concluded with his decision to step down early,
saying it is based on his wish to make political pluralism a
``concrete reality.''
	   He said he would open discussions ``immediately'' with the
various political parties to prepare elections.
	   ``Given the principle of pluralism enshrined in the
Constitution, I believe the moment has come to make a concrete
reality of this essential principle of democracy, applying it to
the most important institution of the country,'' Zeroual said.
	   ``I am not a candidate in these elections.''
	   Zeroual made his announcement amid threats of a general strike
by the nation's main union, UGTA, unhappy about the loss of tens of
thousands of jobs as the nation slowly moves to privatize state-run
companies.
	   According to the UGTA, some 200,000 people have been let go from
their jobs in three years.
	   Union representatives failed to show up at a planned meeting
Thursday with government officials and have said they are planning
a general strike. Algeria's only significant union has worked
hand-in-hand with the government since 1992, so the strike threat
loomed as a rupture.
	   It also loomed as a threat, capable of further disrupting daily
life in this nation that has been wracked by violence since 1992
when the army canceled legislative elections the now-banned Islamic
Salvation Front was winning.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed since the start of
the Islamic insurgency and crackdown that followed.
	   Zeroual has fought a two-pronged battle since he began leading
the country, trying to put down the insurgency and to rebuild the
nation's institutions, which collapsed in shambles after the army
stepped in.
	   The burly, low-profile Zeroual was appointed chief of state by
the nation's all-powerful military in January 1994 at one of the
most difficult periods in the young history of the former French
colony rich in oil and gas reserves.
	   He legitimized his leadership with the 1995 presidential
election, winning 61 percent of the vote.
	   Zeroual then revamped the Constitution via a November 1996
referendum that gave more power to the presidency and banned
political parties with an overtly religious agenda.
	   He oversaw local and legislative elections that gave Algeria its
first multi-party parliament. But the parliament, which includes
fundamentalist parties with new names, is dominated by a
pro-Zeroual party, created shortly before the voting.

<TEXT>
	   ... On Thursday, November 13, while Ernesto Zedillo, the
President of Mexico, was in the White House, Ms. Lewinsky met very
briefly with President Clinton in the private study. Ms. Lewinsky's
visit, which she described in an email as a ``hysterical
escapade,'' was the culmination of days of phone calls and notes to
Ms. Currie and the President.
	   Over the course of the week that preceded November 13, Ms.
Lewinsky made several attempts to arrange a visit with the
President.
	   ... By courier, she sent the President another note:
	   ``I asked you three weeks ago to please be sensitive to what I
am going through right now and to keep in contact with me, and yet
I'm still left writing notes in vain. ...''
	   She added: ``...I need you right now not as president, but as a
man. PLEASE be my friend.''
	   That evening, November 12, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the
President called and invited her to the White House the following
day. In an email to a friend, Ms. Lewinsky wrote that she and the
President ``talked for almost an hour.'' ...
	   The following morning, November 13, Ms. Lewinsky ... called
repeatedly but suspected that Ms. Currie was not telling the
President of her calls. Around noon, Ms. Currie told Ms. Lewinsky
that the President had left to play golf. Ms. Lewinsky, in her own
words, ``went ballistic.''
	   ...
	   Ms. Currie eventually met her in the parking lot, and, in Ms.
Lewinsky's words, they made a ``bee-line'' into the White House,
sneaking up the back stairs to avoid other White House employees.
... Ms. Lewinsky left two small gifts for the President with Ms.
Currie, then waited alone for about half an hour in the Oval Office
study. ...
	   The President finally joined Ms. Lewinsky in the study, where
they were alone for only a minute or two. Ms. Lewinsky gave him an
antique paperweight in the shape of the White House. She also
showed him an email describing the effect of chewing Altoid mints
before performing oral sex. Ms. Lewinsky was chewing Altoids at the
time, but the President replied that he did not have enough time
for oral sex. They kissed, and the President rushed off for a State
Dinner with President Zedillo.
 &UR; November 14-December 4: Inability to See the President
	   After this brief November 13 meeting, Ms. Lewinsky did not see
the President again until the first week in December. Hoping to
arrange a longer rendezvous, she sent the President several notes,
as well as a cassette on which she recorded a message.
	   Along with her chagrin over not seeing the President, Ms.
Lewinsky was frustrated that her job search had apparently stalled.
A few days before Thanksgiving, she complained to Ms. Currie that
she had not heard from Mr. Jordan. Ms. Currie arranged for her to
speak with him ``before Thanksgiving,'' while Ms. Lewinsky was in
Los Angeles. Mr. Jordan told her to call him the following week to
arrange another meeting.
	   In draft letters to the President, which were recovered from her
Pentagon computer, Ms. Lewinsky reflected on the change in their
relationship: ``... our personal relationship changing has caused
me more pain. Do you realize that?'' ...
 &UR; December 5-18, 1997:
 &UR; The Witness List and Job Search
	   On Friday, December 5, Paula Jones's attorneys faxed a list of
their potential witnesses _ including Ms. Lewinsky _ to the
President's personal attorneys. The following day, President
Clinton saw Ms. Lewinsky in an unscheduled visit and then discussed
the Jones case with his attorneys and Deputy White House Counsel
Bruce Lindsey. A few days later, Ms. Lewinsky met with Mr. Jordan
at his office, and he arranged interviews for Ms. Lewinsky at three
companies. ...
 &UR; December 5: The Witness List
	   ... On the evening of December 5, she drafted an anguished
letter to the President. ``You want me out of your life,'' she
wrote. ... She had purchased several gifts for him, and, she wrote,
``I wanted to give them to you in person, but that is obviously not
going to happen.'' ...
	   ... She concluded the letter: ``I knew it would hurt to say
goodbye to you; I just never thought it would have to be on paper.
Take care.''
 &UR; December 6: The Northwest Gate Incident
 &UR; Initial Visit and Rejection
	   On the morning of Saturday, December 6, Ms. Lewinsky went to the
White House to deliver the letter and gifts to the President. ...
Ms. Lewinsky planned to leave the parcel with Ms. Currie, who had
told Ms. Lewinsky that the President would be ... unable to see
her.
	   Ms. Lewinsky arrived at the White House at approximately 10:00
a.m. ... When Ms. Currie learned that Ms. Lewinsky was at the
Northwest Gate, she sent word that the President ``already had a
guest in the Oval,'' so the officers should have Ms. Lewinsky wait
there for about 40 minutes.
	   While Ms. Lewinsky was waiting, one officer mentioned that
Eleanor Mondale was in the White House. Ms. Lewinsky correctly
surmised that the President was meeting with Ms. Mondale, rather
than his lawyers, and she was ``livid.'' She stormed away, called
and berated Ms. Currie from a pay phone, and then returned to her
Watergate apartment.
	   ... From her apartment, Ms. Lewinsky reached the President on
the phone. According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President was angry that
she had ``made a stink ... ''
	   Then, to Ms. Lewinsky's surprise, the President invited her to
visit him. ... Ms. Lewinsky was cleared to enter the White House at
12:52 p.m. and exited at 1:36 p.m.
	   3. ``Whatever Just Happened Didn't Happen''
	   Later that day (December 6), the uniformed Secret Service
officers at the Northwest Gate were told that no one would be fired
-- so long as they remained quiet. According to Sergeant Williams,
Ms. Currie said that, if the officers did not ``tell a lot of
people what had happened, then nothing would happen.''
	   The President told Captain Jeffrey Purdie, the Secret Service
watch commander for the uniformed division at the time, ``I hope
you use your discretion.'' ... ``Whatever just happened didn't
happen.''

	   ...Captain Purdie recommended to his supervisor, Deputy Chief
Charles O'Malley, that ``no paperwork be generated'' regarding the
Northwest Gate incident because ``Ms. Currie was satisfied with the
way things were handled.'' According to Captain Purdie, Deputy
Chief O'Malley agreed, and no record of the incident was made. ...
	   ... The President said that the disclosure of information that
day was ``inappropriate'' and ``a mistake,'' but he could not
recall whether he wanted a Secret Service officer fired or gave any
such orders. He thought that the officers ``were ... told not to
let it happen again, and I think that's the way it should have been
handled.'' When asked if he told Captain Purdie that he hoped that
he could count on his discretion, the President stated, ``I don't
remember anything I said to him in that regard.''
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President later indicated to her
that he had concerns about the discretion of the Secret Service
uniformed officers. On December 28 she asked how Paula Jones's
attorneys could have known enough to place her on the witness list.
The President replied that the source might be Linda Tripp or ``the
uniformed officers.'' ...
	   On Thursday, December 11, Ms. Lewinsky had her second meeting
with Mr. Jordan. Ms. Lewinsky testified that they discussed her job
search ...
	   At one point in the conversation, according to Ms. Lewinsky, Mr.
Jordan said, ``(Y)ou're a friend of the President.'' This prompted
Ms. Lewinsky to reveal that she ``didn't really look at him as the
President''; rather, she ``reacted to him more as a man and got
angry at him like a man and just a regular person.'' When Mr.
Jordan asked why Ms. Lewinsky got angry at the President, she
replied that she became upset ``when he doesn't call me enough or
see me enough.'' Ms. Lewinsky testified that Mr. Jordan advised her
to take her frustrations out on him rather than the President.
According to Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Jordan summed up the situation:
``You're in love, that's what your problem is.''...
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified that in the early-morning hours of
December 17, at roughly 2:00 or 2:30 a.m., she received a call from
the President. ...
	   ... Ms. Lewinsky's name had appeared on the witness list in the
Jones case. According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President said ``it
broke his heart'' to see her name on the witness list. The
President told her that she would not necessarily be subpoenaed; if
she were, he ``suggested she could sign an affidavit to try to
satisfy (Ms. Jones's) inquiry and not be deposed.''
	   The President told Ms. Lewinsky to contact Ms. Currie in the
event she were subpoenaed. He also reviewed one of their
established cover stories. He told Ms. Lewinsky that she ``should
say she visited the (White House) to see Ms. Currie and, on
occasion when working at the (White House), she brought him letters
when no one else was around.'' The President's advice ``was . . .
instantly familiar to (Ms. Lewinsky).'' She testified that the
President's use of this ``misleading'' story amounted to a
continuation of their pre-existing pattern. ...
	   In his grand jury appearance, the President was questioned about
the December 17 phone call. He testified that, although he could
not rule it out, he did not remember such a call. The President was
also asked whether ... he instructed her to say that she was coming
to bring letters. The President answered: ``I might well have said
that.''
	   But when asked whether he ever said anything along these lines
after Ms. Lewinsky had been identified on the witness list, the
President answered: ``I don't recall whether I might have done
something like that.'' He speculated that he might have suggested
this explanation in the context of a call from a reporter.
Nonetheless, he testified, in the context of the Jones case, ``I
never asked her to lie.'' ...
	   Ms. Lewinsky was served with a subpoena in the Jones case on
Friday, December 19. ... Mr. Jordan spoke with the President that
afternoon and again that evening. He told the President that he had
met with Ms. Lewinsky, that she had been subpoenaed, and that he
planned to obtain an attorney for her. On Sunday, December 28, the
President met with Ms. Lewinsky, who expressed concern about the
subpoena's demand for the gifts he had given her. Later that day,
Ms. Currie drove to Ms. Lewinsky's apartment and collected a box
containing some of the subpoenaed gifts. Ms. Currie took the box
home and hid it under her bed. ...
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified that, after being served with the
subpoena, she ``burst into tears,'' and then telephoned Mr. Jordan
from a pay phone at the Pentagon. ...
	   According to Mr. Jordan, when Ms. Lewinsky entered his office,
``(H)er emotional state was obviously one of dishevelment and she
was quite upset. She was crying.'' ...
	   ... according to Mr. Jordan, Ms. Lewinsky asked him about the
future of the Clintons' marriage. Because Ms. Lewinsky seemed
``mesmerized'' by President Clinton, he ``asked her directly had
there been any sexual relationship between (her) and the
President.'' ... Ms. Lewinsky said she had not had a sexual
relationship with the President.
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified, however, that at this time she assumed
that Mr. Jordan knew ``with a wink and a nod that (she) was having
a relationship with the President.'' She therefore interpreted Mr.
Jordan's questions as ``What are you going to say?'' rather than
``What are the (actual) answers ...?'' When the meeting ended, she
``asked (Mr. Jordan) if he would give the President a hug.''

Bordeaux wins fifth straight match; Lyon jumps into second place

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Bordeaux beat Montpellier 2-1 Friday to record its
fifth consecutive win at the start of the French first division and
open up an early four-point gap at the top.
	   In-form Marseille could only draw 1-1 at home to Rennes, while
Lyon lept to second place with a 2-1 win at rock-bottom Sochaux.
	   Defender Herve Alicarte opened the scoring for Bordeaux a minute
into the second half, and Kaba Diawara doubled the lead with a 70th
minute header after Ali Benarbia had dribbled past three
Montpellier defenders.
	   Laurent Robert pulled one back almost immediately for the away
team, but Silvain Wiltord made it 3-1 in the closing minutes.
	   Montpellier, which has now lost its last five visits to the Parc
Lescure, had the better of the first half.
	   Bordeaux goalkeeper Ulrich Rame kept his side level in the
opening stages with outstanding saves from Montpellier strikers
Robert and Ibrahima Bakayoko.
	   Lyon climbed to second place with a 2-1 at Sochaux.
	   Bernard Lacombe's team took the lead thanks to a 22nd minute
strike by Christophe Delmotte.
	   Sochaux levelled just before halftime with a Stephane Dedebant
penalty but Marco Grassi grabbed the points for Lyon 20 minutes
from the end.
	   In front of 46,000 spectators, Marseille looked to have snatched
three points against Rennes when Florian Maurice scored in the 73rd
minute, profiting from good work by Christophe Dugarry.
	   But two minutes from the end Jean-Luc Dogon scored with a header
direct from a rightwing corner.
	   Paris Saint-Germain's disappointing start to the season
continued with a 0-0 draw at lowly Nancy.
	   PSG, with Marco Simone in fine form, dominated play but rarely
penetrated the home defense.
	   There were no surprises at the Stade de la Meinau, where
Strasbourg and Metz, two teams that have scored only one goal
between them this season, shared a goalless draw.
	   In other matches Friday, Bastia beat Le Havre 2-0, while Nantes
won 3-2 at Toulouse.
	   Two matches were played Thursday, Monaco beating Lens 2-0 and
Lorient and Auxerre drawing 1-1.

<TEXT>
	   That evening, Mr. Jordan visited the President at the White
House. ... Mr. Jordan asked ... ``Mr. President, have you had
sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky?'' The President told Mr.
Jordan, ``No, never.'' ...
	   In his grand jury testimony, the President ... testified that
his memory of that meeting was somewhat vague:
	   I do not remember exactly what the nature of the conversation
was. I do remember that I told him that there was no sexual
relationship between me and Monica Lewinsky, which was true. ...
	   Mr. Jordan arranged for Ms. Lewinsky to meet with attorney
Francis Carter at 11:00 a.m. on Monday, December 22. On that
morning, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she called Mr. Jordan and asked
to meet ... Ms. Lewinsky also told Mr. Jordan that she was worried
that someone might have been eavesdropping on her telephone
conversations with the President. When Mr. Jordan asked why she
thought that would be of concern, Ms. Lewinsky said, ``Well, we've
had phone sex.'' ...
	   ... On December 11, 1997, the judge overseeing the Jones case ..
ruled that the President had to answer a written interrogatory
naming every state and federal employee since 1986 with whom he had
sexual relations or with whom he had proposed to have sexual
relations. On December 23, 1997, the President answered the
interrogatory: ``None.''
	   A day or two after Christmas, Ms. Lewinsky called Ms. Currie and
told her that the President had mentioned that he had presents for
her. Ms. Currie called back and told her to come to the White House
at 8:30 a.m. on Sunday, December 28.
	   That morning, Ms. Lewinsky met with the President in the Oval
Office. ... she, the President, and Ms. Currie played with Buddy,
the President's dog, and chatted. Then, the President took her to
the study and gave her several Christmas presents: a marble bear's
head, a Rockettes blanket, a Black Dog stuffed animal, a small box
of chocolates, a pair of joke sunglasses, and a pin with a New York
skyline on it.
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified that, during this visit, she and the
President had a ``passionate'' and ``physically intimate'' kiss.
...
	   At some point in the conversation, Ms. Lewinsky told the
President, ``Maybe I should put the gifts away outside my house
somewhere or give them to someone, maybe Betty.'' Ms. Lewinsky
recalled that the President responded either ``I don't know'' or
``Let me think about that.'' ...
	   She did note some hesitancy on the President's part:
	   ``He had hesitated very briefly right before I left that day in
kind of packaging ... all my stuff back up ... I don't think he
said anything that indicated this to me, but I thought to myself,
``I wonder if he's thinking he shouldn't give these to me to take
out.'' But he did. ...
	   In the grand jury, the President acknowledged ``talking with Ms.
Lewinsky about her testimony, or about the prospect that she might
have to give testimony. And she, she talked to me about that.'' He
maintained, however, that they did not discuss Ms. Lewinsky's
subpoena: ``She was upset. She _ well, she _ we _ she didn't _ we
didn't talk about a subpoena. But she was upset.'' In the
President's recollection, Ms. Lewinsky said she knew nothing about
sexual harassment; why did she have to testify? According to the
President, ``I explained to her that it was a political lawsuit.
They wanted to get whatever they could under oath that was damaging
to me.'' ...
	   In the afternoon of December 28, a few hours after Ms.
Lewinsky's White House visit, Ms. Currie drove to Ms. Lewinsky's
Watergate apartment and collected a box containing the President's
gifts. Ms. Currie then took the box home and hid it under her bed.
...
	   Ms. Lewinsky was concerned because the gifts were under
subpoena; she did not throw them away, however, because ``they
meant a lot to her.'' ... She felt that, because the gifts were
with Ms. Currie, they were within the President's control: ``Not
that the gifts were going to be in his possession, but that he
would understand whatever it was I gave to Betty and that that
might make him feel a little bit better.'' ...
	   According to Ms. Currie, Ms. Lewinsky said that she was
uncomfortable retaining the gifts herself because ``people were
asking questions'' about them. Ms. Currie said she drove to Ms.
Lewinsky's residence after work, collected the box, brought it
home, and put it under her bed. Written on the top of the box were
the words ``Please do not throw away!!!'' ...
	   The President testified that he never asked Ms. Currie to
collect a box of gifts from Ms. Lewinsky. ...
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified that in late December 1997 she realized
that she needed to ``come up with some sort of strategy as to what
to do if Linda Tripp divulged what she knew. On December 30, Ms.
Lewinsky telephoned Mr. Jordan's office and conveyed either
directly to him or through one of his secretaries that she was
concerned about the Jones case.
	   The following day, Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan had breakfast
together at the Park Hyatt Hotel. According to Ms. Lewinsky, she
told Mr. Jordan that a friend of hers, Linda Tripp, was involved in
the Jones case. She told Mr. Jordan: ``I used to trust Ms. Tripp,
but I didn't trust her any more.'' Ms. Lewinsky said that Ms. Tripp
might have seen some notes in her apartment. Mr. Jordan asked:
``Notes from the President to you?'' Ms. Lewinsky responded: ``No,
notes from me to the President.'' According to Ms. Lewinsky, Mr.
Jordan said: ``Go home and make sure they're not there.'' ...

	   When Ms. Lewinsky returned home to her apartment that day, she
discarded approximately 50 draft notes to the President. ...
	   On Sunday, January 4, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky called Ms. Currie at
home and told her that she wanted to drop off a gift for the
President. Ms. Currie invited Ms. Lewinsky to her home, and Ms.
Lewinsky gave her the package. The package contained a book
entitled The Presidents of the United States and a love note
inspired by the movie Titanic. ...
	   On January 7, Ms. Lewinsky signed the affidavit. On January 8,
she interviewed for a job in New York City. After the interview
went poorly, Mr. Jordan placed a phone call to the company's
chairman on her behalf, and Ms. Lewinsky was given a second
interview. The following week, after Ms. Lewinsky told Ms. Currie
that she would need a reference from the White House, the President
asked Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles to arrange one. ...
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified that she told the President that she was
troubled by potential questions about her transfer from the White
House to the Pentagon. She was concerned that ``people at the White
House who didn't like her'' might contradict her and ``get her in
trouble.'' The President, according to Ms. Lewinsky, advised her:
``You could always say that the people in Legislative Affairs got
it [the Pentagon job] for you or helped you get it.'' ...
	   She enclosed a letter telling the President that she wanted to
have sexual intercourse with him at least once. In their phone
conversation, Ms. Lewinsky told the President, ``I shouldn't have
written some of those things in the note.'' She testified that the
President agreed. ...
	   The President testified that he cautioned Ms. Lewinsky about
such messages: ``I remember telling her she should be careful what
she wrote, because a lot of it was clearly inappropriate and would
be embarrassing if somebody else read it. ...''
	   She and Mr. Jordan discussed the draft by telephone. Ms.
Lewinsky testified that having Mr. Jordan review the affidavit was
like getting it ``blessed'' by the President. Ms. Lewinsky
testified that she told Mr. Jordan that she was worried about a
sentence that implied that she had been alone with the President
and thus might incline Paula Jones's attorneys to question her. She
eventually deleted it. ...
	   The draft affidavit provided in part:
	   ``I have never had a sexual relationship with the President.''
...
	   Phone records for January 6 show that Mr. Jordan had a number of
contacts with Ms. Lewinsky, the President, and Mr. Carter. Less
than thirty minutes after Mr. Jordan spoke by phone to Ms.
Lewinsky, he talked with the President for thirteen minutes.
Immediately after this call, at 4:33 p.m., Mr. Jordan called Mr.
Carter. Less than an hour later, Mr. Jordan placed a four-minute
call to the main White House number. Over the course of the day,
Mr. Jordan called a White House number twice, Ms. Lewinsky three
times, and Mr. Carter four times. ...
	   According to Mr. Jordan, Ms. Lewinsky came to his office on
January 7 and showed him the signed affidavit. Over the course of
the day, Mr. Jordan placed three calls of significant duration to
the White House. He testified: ``I knew the President was concerned
about the affidavit and whether it was signed or not.'' When asked
whether the President understood that the affidavit denied a sexual
relationship, Mr. Jordan testified: ``I think that's a reasonable
assumption.'' According to Mr. Jordan, when he informed the
President that Ms. Lewinsky had signed the affidavit, the President
said, ``Fine, good.''
	   Ten days after this conversation, in the Jones deposition,
President Clinton was asked whether he knew that Ms. Lewinsky had
met with Vernon Jordan and talked about the Jones case. He
answered:
	   ``I knew he met with her. I think Betty suggested that he meet
with her. Anyway, he met with her. I, I thought that he talked to
her about something else. I didn't know that _ I thought he had
given her some advice about her move to New York.''
	   ``... I believe the meetings he had were meetings about her
moving to New York and getting a job.'' ...
 &UR; E. January 8: The Perelman Call
	   The day after she signed the affidavit, January 8, 1998, Ms.
Lewinsky interviewed in New York with Jaymie Durnan, senior vice
president and special assistant to the chairman at MacAndrews &AMP;
Forbes Holdings Inc. Mr. Durnan ... told her that he would pass on
her resume to Revlon, a MFH company. Ms. Lewinsky called Mr. Jordan
and reported that she felt that the interview had gone ``very
poorly.'' Mr. Jordan indicated in response that ``he'd call the
chairman.''
	   ... Mr. Perelman testified that, in the roughly twelve years
that Mr. Jordan had been on Revlon's Board of Directors, he did not
recall Mr. Jordan ever calling to recommend someone. ...
 &UR; F. January 9: ``Mission Accomplished''
	   On the morning of Friday, January 9, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky
interviewed with Allyn Seidman, Senior Vice President of MFH, and
... Ms. Seidman called her back that day and ``informally offered
her a position, and she informally accepted.''
	   ... Mr. Jordan testified that he also told the President
directly that ``Monica Lewinsky's going to work for Revlon,'' and
his response was, ``Thank you very much.''
 &UR; G. January 12: Pre-Trial Hearing in Jones Case
	   On January 12, 1998, Judge Wright held a hearing in the Jones
case. ... Ms. Jones' witness list named many women, among them Ms.
Lewinsky. ...

Is Brazil going under?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. official comment in grafs 12-13. &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ It's somehow fitting that the
question Brazilians are asking comes from pool-hall parlance. After
Russia, is this country the ``bola da vez'' _ the next ball to go?
	   Some investors have been betting against Brazil. As confidence
in the economy wanes, local stocks have plunged, dollars flow
abroad, the jobless rolls grow and the country spins toward
recession.
	   If Brazil _ the world's eighth-largest economy _ goes under,
much of Latin America could go with it. Then everyone loses,
including industrialized powers with investments and markets here.
	   ``We must go beyond market limits and talk to world leaders,''
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said. ``They must see that
clearer steps must be taken.''
	   On Thursday, the steady deterioration in Brazilian markets
turned to pure panic.
	   The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest, plummeted
15.8 percent, its biggest drop in eight years. Trading was twice
halted by a circuit-breaker in a vain attempt to stop the bleeding.
	   ``Foreign investors' orders are exclusively to sell,'' said
Fabio Lara, director at Sao Paulo brokerage Schahin Cury.
	   Nearly dlrs 2 billion fled the country on Thursday alone. Since
August, investors have pulled out dlrs 23 billion, and Brazil's
vital currency reserves have dwindled to dlrs 52 billion.
	   Asked if he planned to raise interest rates again, a week after
the last hike, Cardoso said no. While it might lure back investors
looking for a quick profit, higher interest rates would hurt local
businessmen, consumers and workers.
	   ``I can't sacrifice the country because of greed,'' he said.
Hours later, though, key interest rates went up again, to 49.75
percent from 29.75 percent.
	   Markets responded to the measure _ and rumors of a dlrs 30
billion bailout package in the works in Washington, D.C. On Friday,
the Sao Paulo market rebounded and closed up 13.3 percent.
	   U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Friday, ``We have been
in close contact with Brazilian officials as financial pressures
have intensified. I telephoned President Cardoso on Friday to
discuss recent developments in global financial markets and to
express U.S. support for Brazil's actions thus far to respond to
these pressures.''
	   He added, ``The financial stability and prosperity of Brazil is
of vital importance to the United States and to the global economy
more generally. We will remain in close touch with Brazilian
officials over the coming days and weeks.''

Hingis, Davenport reach U.S. Open final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Davenport defeating Williams &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Lindsay Davenport used power and poise to reach
her first Grand Slam final. Martina Hingis took advantage of an
opponent's third-set collapse to join her there.
	   Second-seeded Davenport clapped her left hand on her racket in
celebration after a 6-4, 6-4 victory over an error-ridden Venus
Williams in an all-American semifinal Friday at the U.S. Open.
	   Davenport was 0-3 in previous Grand Slam semis, including the
U.S. Open a year ago when she lost to Hingis.
	   Davenport needed just 72 minutes to win over Williams, who lost
beads from her hair on the court and lost her touch against an
opponent who simply was too steady. Williams had twice as many
errors as winners, 26-13.
	   ``Both of us play such high-risk games, that one of us could be
off on a certain day. I was a little more consistent today when it
counted,'' said Davenport, who has a 5-6 career mark against
Hingis. ``Obviously, I was very happy to get it over with in two
sets.''
	   Hingis won 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 over Jana Novotna, who thought a
Wimbledon title finally would drive away her demons but encountered
them again as she blew a big third-set lead.
	   Novotna was leading 4-1 in the final set, just six points from
winning the match and dethroning Hingis as No. 1 in the world, when
her game collapsed. She missed several easy shots and won just four
of the final 22 points.
	   After her 50th unforced error settled into the net on match
point, Novotna stood with hands on hips at the baseline in
disbelief. She had 20 unforced errors in the final set _ one more
than Hingis made in the entire match.
	   ``I made mistakes for different reasons,'' said Novotna, who has
talked repeatedly of how the Wimbledon victory boosted her
confidence. ``I can't explain it. You never know why it happens.''
	   Hingis' 76-week reign as No. 1 had been in danger. If she had
lost, either Novotna or Davenport could have replaced her as No. 1
by winning the U.S. Open.
	   ``I was fighting for my No. 1 spot. She didn't miss anything in
the first set,'' Hingis said. ``Because we're doubles partners, I
know her weaknesses and she knows mine. I lost some stupid games.''
	   Hingis had lost in the semifinals of the previous two Grand Slam
tournaments, losing to Monica Seles at the French Open and to
Novotna at Wimbledon. She thought of those losses during the
changeover before her third-set rally began.
	   ``I was down 4-1 and sitting in the chair, saying, `No way I
lose again in the semis. At least I've got to make the final,'''
Hingis said.
	   Hingis didn't play like the world's top player in the first set,
spraying balls long and wide while losing four straight service
games. Frustrated by her poor play, Hingis slammed her racket into
the net after losing one point and pounded the ball into the court
after another.
	   But the Swiss miss dominated in the second set, winning 12
points in a row midway through the set as she began coming to the
net more and dictating play.
	   Hingis' wildness returned in the third set, and Novotna took
advantage with breaks in the first and fifth games to go up 4-1.
The third-seeded Novotna made several acrobatic shoetop volleys and
delicate drop shots as she took the lead.
	   The score was 30-30 in the next game, putting Novotna just six
points from victory, when the collapse began. Included in the
Czech's misses was an easy forehand volley she hit about 10 feet
(three meters) long.
	   ``In the third set, I was up 4-1. From that moment on, I missed
too many approaches, too many volleys,'' Novotna said. ``You have
to continue playing well. I was missing too many balls.''
	   Novotna began the summer with a reputation as a choker, a top
player burdened by past failures.
	   Her biggest collapse was in the 1993 Wimbledon final, when she
led Steffi Graf 4-1 in the third set and blew an easy volley that
would have given her a 5-1 lead. After Novotna lost, she cried on
the Duchess of Kent's shoulder.
	   At the 1995 French Open, Novotna lost to Chanda Rubin after
having a match point and a 5-0 lead in the third set.
	   That reputation seemed to be receding into history after her
Wimbledon championship. But now the semifinals of the 1998 U.S.
Open will be added to her list of failures.
	   ``I was down two service breaks, but I knew I would be playing
with the wind,'' Hingis said, ``and I saw Jana wasn't in the best
shape and I was just trying to get the ball in the game.''

UN chief condemns slaying of Iranian diplomats

Pakistan for ordering the killings. Picks up 10th graf pvs &QL;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Friday
condemned the Taliban religious militia's slayings of nine Iranian
diplomats in northern Afghanistan and called for the safe return of
other missing Iranians.
	   Following threats by Iran to retaliate against the Taliban for
the deaths, Annan urged both Afghanistan and Iran to ``refrain from
any action which might be construed by others as provocative.''
	   Eleven Iranian diplomats vanished from the northern Afghan city
of Mazar-e-Sharif after the Taliban religious militia seized the
city from rival forces on Aug. 8.
	   After a month of denying any involvement in the disappearances,
the Taliban acknowledged responsibility for the deaths of nine of
the 11 in a letter to Annan on Thursday from the militia's supreme
leader, Mullah Omar.
	   There was no word on the fate of the other two diplomats.
	   ``The secretary-general strongly condemns these cruel murders
and violations of international law,'' spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
``He calls for an urgent investigation so that the perpetrators can
be brought to justice.''
	   The United Nations is consulting with Iran and Pakistan about
forming a mission to investigate the deaths. Iran had requested
such a mission, and Pakistan, which has ties to the Taliban, agreed
to it. The three players were looking into how such a mission would
be organized and its security guaranteed, Eckhard said.
	   Iran on Thursday asked the U.N. Security Council to convene an
urgent meeting on what it said was a war crime committed by
Afghanistan's Taliban leaders.
	   The council held an emergency briefing and in a statement
condemned ``these heinous acts and violations of international
law,'' council president Hans Dahlgren of Sweden said.
	   The government of Afghan leader Burhanuddin Rabbani, ousted from
Kabul by the Taliban in 1996, also condemned the killings and said
they were ordered by Pakistan's military intelligence service.
	   Afghanistan's foreign ministry appealed to the United Nations
and the international community ``for immediate and tangible steps
in thwarting actions by the Pakistani-backed Taliban from further
deteriorating the security of Afghanistan and of the region,'' a
statement from Afghanistan's U.N. mission said.

UNDATED: Ms. Lewinsky.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; I. January 13: Final Jordan Meeting &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, on Tuesday, January 13, she stopped
by Mr. Jordan's office. ... Ms. Lewinsky offered to show him a copy
of her signed affidavit in the Jones case, but he indicated that he
did not need to see it.
 &UR; J. January 13-14: Lewinsky-Tripp Conversation and Talking Points
	   In a face-to-face conversation on January 13, Ms. Lewinsky told
Linda Tripp: ``This is what my lawyer taught me. You really don't _
you don't very often say 'no' unless you really need to. The best
is, 'Well, not that I recall, not that I really remember. ...'''
...
	   Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp then discussed the situation:
	   Ms. Lewinsky: I don't think the way that man thinks, I don't
think he thinks of lying under oath. ...
	   Ms. Tripp: Yes, he is because he's the one who said, ``Deny,
deny, deny.'' Of course he knows.
	   ... Ms. Lewinsky: If _ if _ if I said, if somebody said to him,
``Is Monica lying under oath,'' he would say yes. But when he on
his own thinks about it, he doesn't think about it in those terms.
...
	   On January 14, Ms. Lewinsky gave Ms. Tripp a three-page document
regarding ``points to make in Ms. Tripp's affidavit.'' Ms. Lewinsky
testified that she wrote the document herself, although some of the
ideas may have been inspired by conversations with Ms. Tripp.
 &UR; K. January 15: The Isikoff Call
	   In the grand jury, Betty Currie testified that on Thursday,
January 15, 1998, she received a telephone call from Michael
Isikoff of Newsweek, who inquired about courier receipts reflecting
items sent by Ms. Lewinsky to the White House.
	   In a recorded conversation that day, January 15, Ms. Lewinsky
encouraged Ms. Tripp not to disclose her (Lewinsky's) relationship
with the President. Ms. Lewinsky tried to persuade Ms. Tripp to lie
by telling her that others planned to lie: ``... The story I've
signed . . . under oath is what someone else is saying under
oath.'' ... Ms. Lewinsky stated that she did not think the
President would ``slip up'' at his deposition because she was not a
``big issue'' like Gennifer Flowers and Paula Jones. ...
 &UR; XIV. January 17, 1998-Present: The Deposition and Afterward
	   The President was asked a number of questions about Ms. Lewinsky
during his January 17, 1998, deposition in the Jones case. In sworn
testimony, the President denied having a sexual affair or sexual
relations with her. ...
 &UR; A. January 17: The Deposition
	   ... The President testified under oath at a deposition in the
Jones case. Judge Susan Webber Wright ... accepted the following
definition of the term ``sexual relations'':
	   ``For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in
`sexual relations' when the person knowingly engages in or causes
... contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh or
buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the
sexual desire of any person. ... `Contact' means intentional
touching, either directly or through clothing.
	   ... Over the course of extensive questioning, the President
testified that he had seen Ms. Lewinsky ``on two or three
occasions'' during the government shutdown in the fall of 1995,
including one occasion when she brought pizza to him, and one or
two other occasions when she delivered documents to him. He could
not recall whether he had been alone with Ms. Lewinsky on such
occasions, although he acknowledged that it was possible.
	   President Clinton recalled that he received only a couple of
unremarkable personal messages from Ms. Lewinsky. ... He received
presents from her ``once or twice'' _ a book or two and a tie. ...
The President stated that he might have given Ms. Lewinsky a hat
pin, though he could not recall for certain.
	   The President testified that his last conversation with Ms.
Lewinsky had been before Christmas. ... He said it was also
possible that, during that encounter, he had joked with Ms.
Lewinsky that the plaintiff's attorneys were going to subpoena
``every woman I ever talked to'' and Ms. Lewinsky ``would
qualify.''
	   ... The President emphatically denied having had sexual
relations with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   ... (Deputy White House Counsel Bruce) Lindsey met with the
President in the Oval Office, where they discussed the deposition.
...
	   B. The President Meets with Ms. Currie
	   Soon after the deposition, the President called Ms. Currie and
asked her to come to the White House the next day. Ms. Currie
acknowledged that, ``It's rare for (the President) to ask me to
come in on Sunday.'' The President wanted to discuss Ms. Lewinsky's
White House visits.
	   At approximately 5:00 p.m. on Sunday, January 18, 1998, Ms.
Currie met with the President. The meeting took place at her desk
outside the Oval Office. According to Ms. Currie, the President
appeared ``concerned.'' He told Ms. Currie that, during his
deposition the previous day, he had been asked questions about
Monica Lewinsky. Ms. Currie testified: ``I think he said, 'There
are several things you may want to know.''' He proceeded to make a
series of statements, one right after the other:
	   ``You were always there when she was there, right?''
	   ``We were never really alone.''
	   ``Monica (Lewinsky) came on to me, and I never touched her,
right?''
	   ``You can see and hear everything, right?''
	   Ms. Currie testified that, based on his demeanor and the way he
made the statements, the President wanted her to agree with them.
	   Ms. Currie testified that she did, in fact, agree with the
President when he said, ``You were always there when she was there,
right?'' Before the grand jury, however, Ms. Currie acknowledged
the possibility that Ms. Lewinsky could have visited the President
when she was not at the White House.

	   With respect to whether the President was ``never really alone''
with Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie testified that there were several
occasions when the President and Ms. Lewinsky were either in the
Oval Office or in the study without anyone else present.
	   Ms. Currie explained that she did not consider the President and
Ms. Lewinsky to be ``alone'' on such occasions because she was at
her desk outside the Oval Office; accordingly, they were all
together in the same ``general area.'' Ms. Currie testified that
``the President, for all intents and purposes, is never alone.
There's always somebody around him.''
	   As to whether Ms. Lewinsky ``came on'' to him, Ms. Currie
testified that she ``would have no reason to know'' whether Ms.
Lewinsky ever ``came on'' to the President because Ms. Currie was
not present all the time. Finally, as to whether she ``could see
and hear everything,'' Ms. Currie testified that she should not
have agreed with the President. She testified that when the
President and Ms. Lewinsky were alone together in the study, while
Ms. Currie was at her desk, she could ``hear nothing.''
	   The President also made the following statement during their
January 18, 1998 meeting, according to Ms. Currie: ``(Monica
Lewinsky) wanted to have sex with me, but I told her I couldn't do
that.''
	   When the President was questioned about this meeting with Ms.
Currie in the grand jury, he testified that he recalled the
conversation, but he denied that he was ``trying to get Betty
Currie to say something that was untruthful.'' Rather, the
President testified that he asked a ``series of questions'' in an
effort to quickly ``refresh (his) memory.'' The President
explained: ``I wanted to establish . . . that Betty was there at
all other times in the complex, and I wanted to know what Betty's
memory was about what she heard, what she could hear ... and I was
trying to figure (it) out ... in a hurry because I knew something
was up.''
	   In his grand jury testimony, the President acknowledged that,
``in fairness,'' Ms. Currie ``may have felt some ambivalence about
how to react'' to his statements. The President maintained that he
was trying to establish that Ms. Currie was ``always there,'' and
could see and hear everything. At the same time, he acknowledged
that he had always tried to prevent Ms. Currie from learning about
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. ``I did what people do when
they do the wrong thing. I tried to do it where nobody else was
looking at it.'' ...
	   When questioned about his statement to Ms. Currie, ``you could
see and hear everything,'' the President responded:
	   ``My memory of that was that, that she had the ability to hear
what was going on if she came in the Oval Office from her office.
And a lot of times, you know, when I was in the Oval Office, she
just had the door open to her office. Then there was -- the door
was never completely closed to the hall. So, I think there was --
I'm not entirely sure what I meant by that, but I could have meant
that she generally would be able to hear conversations, even if she
couldn't see them. And I think that's what I meant.''
	   Finally, when asked about his statement to Ms. Currie that
``Monica came on to me and I never touched her,'' the President
refused to answer.
 &UR; C. January 18-19: Attempts to Reach Ms. Lewinsky
	   In the wake of her Sunday afternoon session, Ms. Currie paged
Ms. Lewinsky four times. She testified that the President ``may
have asked me to call (Ms. Lewinsky) to see what she knew or where
she was or what was happening.'' Later that evening, at 11:02 p.m.,
the President called Ms. Currie to ask whether she had spoken to
Ms. Lewinsky.
	   Over a two-hour span the next morning, Monday, January 19, 1998,
Ms. Currie made eight unsuccessful attempts to contact Ms.
Lewinsky, by either pager or telephone. After speaking with the
President to let him know that she was unable to reach Ms.
Lewinsky, Ms. Currie again paged her. The purpose of these calls,
according to Ms. Currie, was to tell Ms. Lewinsky that her name had
been mentioned in the President's deposition.
	   Mr. Jordan also tried unsuccessfully to reach Ms. Lewinsky that
morning. That afternoon, Mr. Jordan met with the President in the
Oval Office. Later, Ms. Lewinsky's attorney, Frank Carter, called
Mr. Jordan and told him that Ms. Lewinsky had obtained new counsel,
William Ginsburg and Nathaniel Speights. ...
 &UR; D. January 20-22: Lewinsky Story Breaks
	   After the publication of an article alleging a sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, President Clinton conferred with
his attorneys and issued a number of denials to his aides and to
the American public.
	   1. ``Clinton Accused''
	   On Wednesday, January 21, 1998, the Washington Post published a
story entitled ``Clinton Accused of Urging Aide to Lie; Starr
Probes Whether President Told Woman to Deny Alleged Affair to
Jones's Lawyers.'' The White House learned the essentials of the
Post story on the night of January 20, 1998.
	   President Clinton placed a number of phone calls that night and
the following morning. From 12:08 a.m. to 12:39 a.m., he spoke with
his personal attorney, Robert Bennett.
	   Immediately after his call to Mr. Bennett, President Clinton
called Deputy White House Counsel Bruce Lindsey ...
	   At 1:16 a.m., the President called Ms. Currie at home and spoke
to her for 20 minutes. Ms. Currie testified that the President was
concerned that her name was mentioned in the Post article. ...

	   A few hours later, at approximately 6:30 a.m., the President
called Mr. Jordan in New York City to tell him, according to Mr.
Jordan, that the Post story was untrue.
	   Responding to the Post story that day, the White House issued a
statement, personally approved by the President, declaring that he
was ``outraged by these allegations'' and that ``he has never had
an improper relationship with this woman.'' ...
 &UR; 2. Denials to Aides
	   According to Mr. Lindsey, the remainder of the morning was spent
in a series of meetings about the Lewinsky matter, including
preparing the President for anticipated Lewinsky-related questions
in three previously scheduled media interviews. At these meetings,
President Clinton denied the allegations to several of his top
aides.
	   The President met with Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, along with
his two deputies, John Podesta and Sylvia Matthews. According to
Mr. Bowles, the President told them, ``I want you to know I did not
have sexual relationships with this woman, Monica Lewinsky. I did
not ask anybody to lie. And when the facts come out, you'll
understand.'' The President made a similar denial that morning to
Harold Ickes, his former Deputy Chief of Staff. The President also
discussed the matter with Ms. Currie for a second time. According
to Ms. Currie, the President called her into the Oval Office and
gave a ``sort of a recapitulation of what we had talked about on
Sunday -- you know, 'I was never alone with her' -- that sort of
thing.'' ...
	   Later that day, the President summoned Sidney Blumenthal
(Assistant to the President)to the Oval Office. They spoke for
about 30 minutes. The President said to Mr. Blumenthal, ``I haven't
done anything wrong.'' Mr. Blumenthal testified that the President
told him, ``Monica Lewinsky came on to me and made a sexual demand
on me.'' The President said that he ``rebuffed her.'' The President
also told Mr. Blumenthal that Ms. Lewinsky had ``threatened him.
She said that she would tell people they'd had an affair, that she
was known as the stalker among her peers, and that she hated it and
if she had an affair or said she had an affair then she wouldn't be
the stalker any more.'' Mr. Blumenthal then asked the President
whether he and Ms. Lewinsky were alone when she threatened him. The
President responded, ``Well, I was within eyesight or earshot of
someone.''
	   According to Mr. Blumenthal, the President complained: ``I feel
like a character in a novel. I feel like somebody who is surrounded
by an oppressive force that is creating a lie about me and I can't
get the truth out. I feel like the character in the novel `Darkness
at Noon.''' Thereafter, in the course of a meeting about the
progress of the President's State of the Union address, the
President made a second denial of the allegations to Mr. Podesta.
Mr. Podesta testified:
	   ``He said to me that he had never had sex with her, and that --
and that he never asked -- you know, he repeated the denial, but he
was extremely explicit in saying he never had sex with her ...
Well, I think he said -- he said that -- there was some spate of,
you know, what sex acts were counted, and he said that he had never
had sex with her in any way whatsoever -- that they had not had
oral sex.''
	   The President was asked during his grand jury appearance whether
he recalled denying a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky to his
senior aides and advisors, including Mr. Bowles, Mr. Podesta, Mr.
Blumenthal, Mr. Ickes, and Mr. Jordan. The President did not recall
specific details but did remember the following:
	   ``I met with certain people, and (to) a few of them I said I
didn't have sex with Monica Lewinsky, or I didn't have an affair
with her or something like that. I had a very careful thing I said,
and I tried not to say anything else ... I remember that I issued a
number of denials to people that I thought needed to hear them, but
I tried to be careful and to be accurate.
	   ``And I believe, sir, that -- you'll have to ask them what they
thought. But I was using those terms in the normal way people use
them.''
	   The President testified that he had said ``things that were true
about this relationship. That I used -- in the language I used, I
said, there's nothing going on between us. That was true. I said I
did not have sex with her as I defined it. That was true.'' The
President qualified this answer, however: ``I said things that were
true. They may have been misleading, and if they were I have to
take responsibility for it, and I'm sorry.''
 &UR; 3. Initial Denials to the American Public
	   On the afternoon of January 21, the President made his first of
a series of previously scheduled media appearances. In an interview
on National Public Radio's ``All Things Considered,'' the following
colloquy took place:
	   Q: Mr. President, ... Many Americans woke up to the news today
that the Whitewater independent counsel is investigating an
allegation that you ... encouraged a young woman to lie to lawyers
in the Paula Jones civil suit. Is there any truth to that
allegation?
	   WJC: No, sir, there's not. It's just not true.
	   Q: Is there any truth to the allegation of an affair between you
and the young woman?
	   WJC: No. That's not true either ... The charges are not true.
And I haven't asked anybody to lie.
	   That evening, the President appeared on the PBS program ``The
News Hour with Jim Lehrer.'' He was asked again whether the
allegation of an affair with a White House intern was true. The
President replied, ``That is not true. That is not true. I did not
ask anyone to tell anything other than the truth. There is no
improper relationship. And I intend to cooperate with this inquiry.
But that is not true.''

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombia's armed forces allowed their
warriors to die like cannon fodder, a court has ruled in awarding a
first-of-its-kind payment to the family of a slain policeman.
	   This week's dlrs 50,000 (75 million pesos) judgment to the
survivors of Jesus Lidoro and the court's finding of ``grave
negligence'' could prove costly for Colombia's besieged security
forces.
	   Lidoro and 27 other officers in the lightly armed contingent
were slain by leftist rebels six years ago while guarding an oil
installation.
	   The payment ordered Monday, the first of its kind in 34 years of
civil war, could prompt similar suits and further pressure
Colombian officials who are scrambling to professionalize a
military that is fast losing ground to rebels.
	   Colombia's national police, a division of the armed forces, had
sought to get the complaint tossed out of court. But police chief
Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano said Thursday that he would not challenge
the ruling.
	   Gene Feidell of the Washington, D.C.-based National Institute
for Military Justice called the court decision ``astonishing,''
explaining that the U.S. military and most militaries worldwide are
legally immune from civil lawsuits over combat deaths.

 &UR; Eds: Note language in graf 4, ``Amidst the ...''

<TEXT>
	   The following morning, on January 22, 1998, the President again
denied he had done anything improper. Speaking at a televised White
House photo opportunity with Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat, the President stated: ``The allegations are false, and I
would never ask anybody to do anything other than tell the truth.
That is false.'' ...
	   The President also gave an interview to Roll Call that day. He
stated: ``The relationship was not improper, and I think that's
important enough to say ...''
	   At each of these interviews, the President pledged he would
cooperate fully with the investigation. ...
 &UR; 4. ``We Just Have To Win''
	   Amidst the flurry of press activity on January 21, 1998, the
President's former political consultant, Dick Morris, read the Post
story and called the President. According to Mr. Morris, he told
the President, ``You poor son of a bitch. I've just read what's
going on.'' The President responded, Mr. Morris recalled, ``Oh,
God. This is just awful. ... I didn't do what they said I did, but
I did do something. I mean, with this girl, I didn't do what they
said, but I did ... do something ... And I may have done enough so
that I don't know if I can prove my innocence ... There may be
gifts. I gave her gifts, ... and there may be messages on her phone
answering machine.''
	   Mr. Morris assured the President, ``there's a great capacity for
forgiveness in this country and you should consider tapping into
it.'' The President said, ``But what about the legal thing? You
know, the legal thing? You know, Starr and perjury and all. ... You
know, ever since the election, I've tried to shut myself down. I've
tried to shut my body down, sexually, I mean. ... But sometimes I
slipped up and with this girl I just slipped up.''
	   ...
	   Mr. Morris telephoned the President later that evening with the
poll results, which showed that the voters were ``willing to
forgive (the President) for adultery, but not for perjury or
obstruction of justice.'' When Mr. Morris explained that the poll
results suggested that the President should not go public with a
confession or explanation, he replied, ``Well, we just have to win,
then.''
	   The President had a follow-up conversation with Mr. Morris
during the evening of January 22, 1998, when Mr. Morris was
considering holding a press conference to ``blast Monica Lewinsky
'out of the water.''' The President told Mr. Morris to ``be
careful.'' According to Mr. Morris, the President warned him not to
``be too hard on (Ms. Lewinsky) because there's some slight chance
that she may not be cooperating with Starr and we don't want to
alienate her by anything we're going to put out.''
	   Meanwhile, in California, the President's good friend and
Hollywood producer, Harry Thomason, had seen the President's
interview with Jim Lehrer on televison. Mr. Thomason, who had
occasionally advised the President on matters relating to the
media, traveled to Washington, D.C., and met with him the next day.
Mr. Thomason told the President that ``the press seemed to be
saying that (the President's comments were) weak'' and that he, Mr.
Thomason, ``thought his response wasn't as strong as it could have
been.'' Mr. Thomason recommended that the President ``should
explain it so there's no doubt in anybody's mind that nothing
happened.'' The President agreed: ``You know, you're right. I
should be more forceful than that.''
	   In the ensuing days, the President, through his Cabinet, issued
a number of firm denials. On January 23, 1998, the President
started a Cabinet meeting by saying the allegations were untrue.
Afterward, several Cabinet members appeared outside the White
House. Madeline Albright, Secretary of State, said: ``I believe
that the allegations are completely untrue.'' The others agreed.
``I'll second that, definitely,'' Commerce Secretary William Daley
said. Secretary of Education Richard Riley and Secretary of Health
and Human Services Donna Shalala concurred.
	   The next day, Ann Lewis, White House Communications Director,
publicly announced that ``those of us who have wanted to go out and
speak on behalf of the president'' had been given the green light
by the President's legal team. She reported that the President
answered the allegations ``directly'' by denying any improper
relationship. She believed that, in issuing his public denials, the
President was not ``splitting hairs, defining what is a sexual
relationship, talking about 'is' rather than was. You know, I
always thought, perhaps I was naive, since I've come to Washington,
when you said a sexual relationship, everybody knew what that
meant.'' Ms. Lewis expressly said that the term includes ``oral
sex.''
	   On Monday, January 26, 1998, in remarks in the Roosevelt Room in
the White House, President Clinton gave his last public statement
for several months on the Lewinsky matter. At an event promoting
after-school health care, the President denied the allegations in
the strongest terms: ``I want to say one thing to the American
people. I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say this again: I
did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I
never told anybody to lie, not a single time. Never. These
allegations are false.''

Supermarket chain lays off workers after two months of boycotts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ A supermarket chain
hit by a boycott since July announced Friday it will lay of 73
employees at its six stories in the U.S. territory.
	   ``This is a very sad day for Pueblo and we regret the workforce
reduction, but there was no other business alternative,'' said
Fernando J. Bonilla, vice president and general counsel for Xtra
Super Food Centers, parent company of Pueblo.
	   A boycott was launched against the chain in mid-July after a
government report suggested Pueblo had raised prices on many items.
A consumer group accused the chain of raising prices at the
beginning of hurricane season.
	   Bonilla said the boycott was a factor in the slumping sales as
well as increased competition from other retail outlets such as
Cost-U-Less and Kmart. Bonilla said Pueblo had about 100,000 fewer
customers visit during the last 28-week period compared with the
prior year.
	   Despite the layoffs, Bonilla said the chain has no plans to
close its operations in the territory, where it has done business
for 30 years.

 &UR; BEGINNING OF GROUNDS SECTION &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   There is Substantial and Credible Information that President
Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an
Impeachment
	   ... The Office of Independent Counsel hereby submits substantial
and credible information ... supporting the following eleven
possible grounds for impeachment:
	   1. President Clinton lied under oath in his civil case when he
denied a sexual affair, a sexual relationship, or sexual relations
with Monica Lewinsky.
	   2. President Clinton lied under oath to the grand jury about his
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   3. In his civil deposition, to support his false statement about
the sexual relationship, President Clinton also lied under oath
about being alone with Ms. Lewinsky and about the many gifts
exchanged between Ms. Lewinsky and him.
	   4. President Clinton lied under oath in his civil deposition
about his discussions with Ms. Lewinsky concerning her involvement
in the Jones case.
	   5. During the Jones case, the President obstructed justice and
had an understanding with Ms. Lewinsky to jointly conceal the truth
about their relationship by concealing gifts subpoenaed by Ms.
Jones's attorneys.
	   6. During the Jones case, the President obstructed justice and
had an understanding with Ms. Lewinsky to jointly conceal the truth
of their relationship from the judicial process. ...
	   7. President Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice by helping
Ms. Lewinsky obtain a job in New York at a time when she would have
been a witness harmful to him were she to tell the truth in the
Jones case.
	   8. President Clinton lied under oath in his civil deposition
about his discussions with Vernon Jordan concerning Ms. Lewinsky's
involvement in the Jones case.
	   9. The President improperly tampered with a potential witness by
attempting to corruptly influence the testimony of his personal
secretary, Betty Currie, in the days after his civil deposition.
	   10. President Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice during the
grand jury investigation by refusing to testify for seven months
and lying to senior White House aides with knowledge that they
would relay the President's false statements to the grand jury _
and did thereby deceive, obstruct, and impede the grand jury.
	   11. President Clinton abused his constitutional authority by (i)
lying to the public and the Congress in January 1998 about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky; (ii) promising at that time to
cooperate fully with the grand jury investigation; (iii) later
refusing six invitations to testify voluntarily to the grand jury;
(iv) invoking Executive Privilege; (v) lying to the grand jury in
August 1998; and (vi) lying again to the public and Congress on
August 17, 1998 _ all as part of an effort to hinder, impede, and
deflect possible inquiry by the Congress of the United States.
	   ...
	   I. There is substantial and credible information that President
Clinton lied under oath as a defendant in Jones v. Clinton
regarding his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
	   He denied that he had a ``sexual relationship'' ... a ``sexual
affair'' ... ``sexual relations'' with Monica Lewinsky. ...
	   He denied that he engaged in or caused contact with the
genitalia of ``any person'' with an intent to arouse or gratify.
...
	   He denied that he made contact with Monica Lewinsky's breasts or
genitalia with an intent to arouse or gratify.
	   On May 6, 1994, former Arkansas state employee Paula Corbin
Jones filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against President
Clinton claiming that he had sexually harassed her on May 8, 1991,
by requesting her to perform oral sex on him ....
	   Ms. Jones's attorneys said they intended to call ... Monica
Lewinsky as a witness ....
	   On January 17, 1998, Ms. Jones's lawyers deposed President
Clinton under oath. ...
	   The term ``sexual relations'' was defined:
	   ... A person engages in ``sexual relations'' when the person
knowingly engages in or causes ... contact with the genitalia,
anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an
intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person. ...
``Contact'' means intentional touching, either directly or through
clothing.
	   Monica Lewinsky's Testimony
	   Monica Lewinsky testified under oath before the grand jury that,
beginning in November 1995, when she was a 22-year-old White House
intern, she had a lengthy relationship with the President that
included substantial sexual activity. ...
	   (i) Wednesday, November 15, 1995
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified that she had her first sexual contact
with the President ... while she was an intern .... She performed
oral sex on the President in the hallway outside the Oval Office
study. ... The President directly touched and kissed Ms. Lewinsky's
bare breasts. ... The President put his hand down Ms. Lewinsky's
pants and directly stimulated her genitalia. ...
	   (ii) Friday, November 17, 1995
	   ... She performed oral sex on the President in the private
bathroom outside the Oval Office study. ... The President also
fondled Ms. Lewinsky's bare breasts with his hands and kissed her
breasts.
	   (iii) Sunday, December 31, 1995
	   ... The President lifted Ms. Lewinsky's sweater, fondled her
bare breasts with his hands, and kissed her breasts. She stated
that she performed oral sex on the President ....
	   (iv) Sunday, January 7, 1996
	   Monica Lewinsky testified that she performed oral sex on the
President .... He fondled her bare breasts with his hands and
mouth. ... The President stated that he wanted to perform oral sex
on Ms. Lewinsky, but she stopped him for a physical reason.

   (v) Sunday, January 21, 1996

<TEXT>
	   ... The President lifted Ms. Lewinsky's top and fondled her bare
breasts. The President unzipped his pants and exposed his genitals,
and she performed oral sex on him ....
	   (vi) Sunday, February 4, 1996
	   ... The President had called Ms. Lewinsky. ... The President
partially removed Ms. Lewinsky's dress and bra and touched her bare
breasts with his mouth and hands. He also directly touched her
genitalia. Ms. Lewinsky performed oral sex on the President.
	   (vii) Sunday, March 31, 1996
	   ... The President arranged this encounter ... fondled her
genitalia directly by pulling her underwear out of the way. ... The
President inserted a cigar into Ms. Lewinsky's vagina.
	   (viii) Sunday, April 7, 1996
	   ... The President touched Ms. Lewinsky's breasts. ... Ms.
Lewinsky also performed oral sex on him. ...
	   (xi) Two Subsequent Meetings
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified that she met with President Clinton in
the Oval Office study on the morning of Saturday, August 16, 1997.
They kissed, and Ms. Lewinsky touched the President's genitals
through his clothing, but he rebuffed her efforts to perform oral
sex. No other sexual acts occurred during this encounter.
	   On Sunday, December 28, 1997, three weeks before the President's
civil deposition in the Jones case, the President and Ms. Lewinsky
met in the Oval Office. In addition to discussing a number of
issues that are analyzed below, they engaged in ``passionate''
kissing _ she said. ... No other sexual contact occurred.
	   3. Phone Sex
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified that she and the President engaged in
``phone sex'' approximately fifteen times. The President initiated
each phone sex encounter by telephoning Ms. Lewinsky.
	   4. Physical Evidence
	   Ms. Lewinsky produced ... a dress she wore during the encounter
on February 28, 1997, which she believed might be stained with the
President's semen. At the request of the OIC, the FBI Laboratory
examined the dress and found semen stains. At that point, the OIC
requested a DNA sample from the President. On August 3, 1998 ... a
White House physician drew blood from the President in the presence
of a senior OIC attorney and a FBI special agent. Through the most
sensitive DNA testing, RFLP testing, the FBI Laboratory determined
conclusively that the semen on Ms. Lewinsky's dress was, in fact,
the President's. The chance that the semen is not the President's
is one in 7.87 trillion.
	   5. Testimony of Ms. Lewinsky's Friends, Family Members, and
Counselors ...
	   (i) Catherine Allday Davis
	   Catherine Allday Davis, a college friend of Monica Lewinsky's,
testified that Ms. Lewinsky told her in late 1995 or early 1996
about Ms. Lewinsky's sexual relationship with the President.
According to Ms. Davis, Ms. Lewinsky told her that the relationship
included mutual kissing and hugging, as well as oral sex performed
by Ms. Lewinsky on the President. She also stated that the
President touched Monica ``on her breasts and on her vagina.'' ...
	   (vi) Dr. Irene Kassorla
	   Dr. Irene Kassorla counseled Ms. Lewinsky from 1992 through
1997. Ms. Lewinsky told her of the sexual relationship with the
President. ... The President was in charge of scheduling their
sexual encounters and ``became Lewinsky's life.''
	   (vii) Linda Tripp
	   ... Ms. Lewinsky told a co-worker, Linda Tripp, that she had a
sexual relationship with President Clinton. Ms. Tripp stated that
Ms. Lewinsky first told her about the relationship in September or
October 1996. Ms. Lewinsky told Ms. Tripp that the first sexual
encounter with the President had occurred on November 15, 1995,
when Ms. Lewinsky performed oral sex on him. ...
	   (x) Kathleen Estep
	   Kathleen Estep, a counselor for Ms. Lewinsky, met with Ms.
Lewinsky on three occasions in November 1996. Based on her limited
interaction with Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Estep stated that she considered
Ms. Lewinsky to be credible. During their second session, Ms.
Lewinsky told Ms. Estep about her sexual relationship with
President Clinton ....
	   6. Summary
	   The detailed testimony of Ms. Lewinsky ... and the evidence of
the President's semen on Ms. Lewinsky's dress establish that Ms.
Lewinsky and the President engaged in substantial sexual activity
between November 15, 1995, and December 28, 1997.
	   The President's denials -- semantic and factual -- do not
withstand scrutiny. ...
	   As discussed above, Ms. Lewinsky testified credibly that the
President touched and kissed her bare breasts on nine occasions,
and that he stimulated her genitals on four occasions. She also
testified about a cigar incident .... In addition, a deleted
computer file from Ms. Lewinsky's home computer contained an
apparent draft letter to the President that explicitly referred to
an incident in which the President's ``mouth was on her breast''
and implicitly referred to direct contact with her genitalia. ...
	   Ms. Lewinsky had no apparent motive to lie to her friends,
family members, and counselors. ... And Ms. Lewinsky's statements
to some that she did not have intercourse with the President, even
though she wanted to do so, enhances the credibility of her
statements. ...
	   By contrast, the President's testimony strains credulity. ...
The President's claim seems to be that he maintained a hands-off
policy in ongoing sexual encounters with Ms. Lewinsky. ...
	   The President also had strong personal, political, and legal
motives to lie in the Jones deposition. ...
	   At the time of his civil deposition, the President also could
have presumed that he could lie under oath without risk because _
as he knew _ Ms. Lewinsky had already filed a false affidavit
denying a sexual relationship with the President. Indeed, they had
an understanding that each would lie under oath. ...
	   In sum, based on all of the evidence and considering the
President's various responses, there is substantial and credible
information that the President lied under oath in his civil
deposition and his interrogatory answer in denying a sexual
relationship, a sexual affair, or sexual relations with Ms.
Lewinsky. ...

Mexican officials mixed on Texas waste dump
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With photo M0102 &QL; 
 &UR; By PAIGE BIERMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's foreign secretary said Friday she
continues to oppose a U.S. company's plans to build a toxic waste
dump in Texas just 20 miles (30 kilometers) from the Mexican
border, but said no formal diplomatic protest was likely.
	   Critics have said the dump's proposed location _ in an area
largely populated by Hispanics _ represents ``environmental
racism,'' and claim it poses a health risk to Mexican citizens on
the other side of the border.
	   ``This case is not closed,'' said Foreign Secretary Rosario
Green, who has come under increasing fire from environmental groups
and opposition legislators who say she has bowed to U.S. interests
concerning the dump.
	   Green's office has sent 14 letters to U.S. federal and state
government offices opposing the construction of the dump near the
small West Texas town of Sierra Blanca.
	   But she said the Mexican government cannot protest the dump
before international courts, as critics have demanded, because the
project has not yet been approved. And she doubted the scientific
basis for opposition to the dump.
	   ``The populations who are protesting this project today are
doing so because of their fear,'' Green told a press conference.
	   ``We in the government need have something more than fear to
formally protest this, '' she said. ``I have to depend on the
studies of experts and scientists... and if they say there is no
risk I have no reason to doubt these conclusions.''
	   Mexico's nuclear safety commission ruled last week that the
proposed dump presents no threat to Mexico. Critics say the dump is
located on potentially dangerous geological fault lines.
	   Green's comments come one day after she was slammed during an
appearance before congress for not fighting harder against the
project, which will house waste generated by nuclear power plants,
industry, medical labs and universities in Maine and Vermont.
	   ``How can Mexican authorities support their U.S. counterparts by
arguing that this toxic dump is of low risk?'' Senator Jorge
Calderon of the Democratic Revolution Party said during Green's
annual address to Congress Thursday night. ``How can our government
officials become defenders of foreign interests?''
	   The U.S. senate last week voted to approve waste shipments to
the proposed plant near Sierra Blanca, Texas, 90 miles (145
kilometers) southeast of El Paso.
	   The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, responsible
for licensing of the waste site, isn't expected to vote on
licensing of the Sierra Blanca location until later in the fall.
	   Activists from both sides of the U.S. border are planning to
march to Washington D.C. Oct. 5 to protest outside the White House
and demand that U.S. President Bill Clinton veto the project.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Note sexually explicit content in grafs 6, There still ...; 9,
 &UR; UNDATED: Ms. Lewinsky. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ... During the investigation, the OIC (Office of the Independent
Counsel) gathered a substantial body of information that
established that the President and Monica Lewinsky did, in fact,
have a sexual relationship. ...
	   ... The President was largely aware of that extensive body of
evidence before he testified to the grand jury on August 17, 1998.
...
	   As a result, the President had three apparent choices ... First,
the President could adhere to his previous testimony in his civil
case, as well as in his public statements, and deny any sexual
relationship. But he knew ... that the contrary evidence was
overwhelming, particularly if his semen were in fact on Ms.
Lewinsky's dress. Second, the President could admit a sexual
relationship, which would cause him also to simultaneously admit
that he lied under oath in the Jones case. Third, the President
could invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled
self-incrimination.
	   Confronting those three options, the President attempted to
avoid them altogether. The President admitted to an ``inappropriate
intimate'' relationship, but he maintained that he had not
committed perjury in the Jones case when he denied having a sexual
relationship, sexual affair or sexual relations with her. ...
	   During his grand jury testimony, the President was asked whether
Monica Lewinsky performed oral sex on him and, if so, whether he
had committed perjury in his civil deposition. ... The President
refused to say whether he had oral sex. Instead, the President said
that the undefined terms ``sexual affair,'' ``sexual relationship''
and ``sexual relations'' necessarily require sexual intercourse,
that he had not engaged in intercourse with Ms. Lewinsky and that
he therefore had not committed perjury ...
	   ... There still was the question of his contact with Ms.
Lewinsky's breasts and genitalia, which the President conceded
would fall within the Jones definition of sexual relations. The
President denied that he had engaged in such activity and said, in
effect, that Monica Lewinsky was lying:
	   Q: The question is, if Monica Lewinsky says that while you were
in the Oval Office area you touched her breasts, would she be
lying?
	   A: That is not my recollection. My recollection is that I did
not have sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky and I'm staying on my
former statement about that. ...
	   ... Q: OK. If Monica Lewinsky says that while you were in the
Oval Office area you touched her genitalia, would she be lying? And
that calls for a yes, no, or reverting to your former statement.
	   A: I will revert to my former statement on that.
	   ... In the foregoing testimony to the grand jury, the President
lied under oath three times.
	   1. The President testified that he believed oral sex was not
covered by any of the terms and definitions for sexual activity
used at the Jones deposition. That testimony is not credible. ...
	   2. ... The President made a second false statement to the grand
jury. The President's grand jury testimony contradicts Ms.
Lewinsky's grand jury testimony on the question of whether the
President touched Ms. Lewinsky's breasts or genitalia. ... There
can be no contention that one of them has a lack of memory or is
mistaken. ... Either Monica Lewinsky lied to the grand jury or
President Clinton lied to the grand jury. Under any rational view
of the evidence, the President lied to the grand jury.
	   First, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony about these encounters is
detailed and specific. She described with precision nine incidents
of sexual activity in which the President touched and kissed her
breasts and four incidents involving contacts with her genitalia.
	   Second, Ms. Lewinsky has stated repeatedly that she does not
want to hurt the President by her testimony. ...
	   Third, the testimony of many of her friends, family members and
counselors corroborate her testimony in important detail. ... Ms.
Lewinsky had no motive to lie to these individuals. ... Indeed, she
pointed out to many of them that she was upset that sexual
intercourse had not occurred. ...
	   Fourth, a computer file obtained from Ms. Lewinsky's home
computer contained a draft letter that ... explicitly refers to
``watching your mouth on my breast'' and implicitly refers to
direct contact with Ms. Lewinsky's genitalia. ...
	   Fifth, as noted above, the President's ``hands-off'' scenario _
in which he would have received oral sex on nine occasions from Ms.
Lewinsky but never made direct contact with Ms. Lewinsky's breasts
or genitalia _ is implausible. As Ms. Lewinsky herself testified,
it suggests that she and the President had some kind of ``service
contract _ that all I did was perform oral sex on him and that
that's all this relationship was.'' ... The nature of the
relationship, including the sexual relationship, was far more than
that.
	   Sixth, ... the President clearly sought to deny any acts that
would show that he committed perjury in his civil case. ... To do
that, the President had to deny touching Ms. Lewinsky's breasts or
genitalia _ no matter how implausible his testimony to that effect
might be. ...
	   3. Finally, the President made a third false statement to the
grand jury about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He
contended that the intimate contact did not begin until 1996. Ms.
Lewinsky has testified that it began November 15, 1995, during the
government shutdown _ testimony corroborated by statements she made
to friends at the time. ...
	   ... Ms. Lewinsky testified that, at that first encounter, the
President tugged at her intern pass. He said that ``this'' may be a
problem; Ms. Lewinsky interpreted that statement to reflect his
awareness that there would be a problem with her obtaining access
to the West Wing.

Moe says retirement may not be permanent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Maybe former Olympic downhill ski
champion Tommy Moe isn't finished with the Olympics and World Cup
racing.
	   Moe, surprise gold medalist in downhill in the 1994 Winter Games
but slowed by injuries since then, announced his retirement
recently and said he planned to compete this winter in the
made-for-TV King of the Mountain series of five downhills involving
two-man teams. On Friday, however, he said he might be back for the
2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City.
	   ``Hey, all those other professional athletes in basketball and
hockey make millions and they can compete in the Olympics. Maybe
I'll be back in '02,'' said Moe, who was in town for the U.S. Ski
and Snowboard Association convention. ``That's a good downhill
they'll have at Snowbasin'' near Ogden.
	   Moe said he had done some dryland training _ ``that's a natural
part of what I do'' _ and he planned to be skiing next month near
his home in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
	   ``I was on the ski team at 16 and I had all that training and
travel for 12 years, so now it's nice to be doing some
more-relaxing skiing,'' he said.
	   He'll miss the big-time races such as Austria's fabled
Hahnenkamm, Moe said, ``but I don't have the hunger anymore.'' So
maybe he won't have it in 2002 and won't be back.
	   ``I'm not ruling it out. Maybe a year of King of the Mountain
races _ AJ Kitt's going to be my teammate _ and I'll be ready to go
again next year.''
	   He electrified the opening day of the '94 Olympics when he
overtook Finnish hero Kjetil Andre Aamodt to win the downhill gold
medal by .04 seconds. Four days later, Moe celebrated his 24th
birthday by winning the silver medal in super-G, but a torn knee
ligament in 1995 on the Olympic hill in Kvitfjell, and a torn thumb
tendon in '97 hobbled his attempts to revive the magic of that
Olympic season.

	   First, Monica Lewinsky testified before the grand jury that she
was alone with the President on numerous occasions ... Ms. Lewinsky
confirmed that she and the President were alone during sexual
activity.
	   Second, Betty Currie testified that President Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky were alone together in the Oval Office area a number of
times. ...
	   Third, six current or former members of the Secret Service
testified that the President and Ms. Lewinsky were alone in the
Oval Office area ...
	   ... 3. The President's Grand Jury Testimony
	   On August 17, 1998, the President testified to the grand jury
and began his testimony by reading a statement admitting that he
had been alone with Ms. Lewinsky:
	   When I was alone with Ms. Lewinsky on certain occasions in early
1996 and once in early 1997, I engaged in conduct that was wrong.
	   The President acknowledged being alone with Ms. Lewinsky on
multiple occasions, although he could not pinpoint the precise
number. ... he acknowledged that he would have to have been an
``exhibitionist'' for him not to have been alone with Ms. Lewinsky
when they were having sexual encounters.
	   4. Summary
	   Substantial and credible information demonstrates that the
President made ... false statements under oath in his civil
deposition regarding whether he had been alone with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   ... the President lied when he said ``I don't recall'' in
response to the question whether he had ever been alone with Ms.
Lewinsky. The President admitted to the grand jury that he had been
alone with Ms. Lewinsky. ...
	   ... the President ... had a general recollection that Ms.
Lewinsky may have brought him ``papers to sign'' on certain
occasions ... ``bringing papers'' was one of the sham ``cover
stories'' that the President and Ms. Lewinsky had originally
crafted to conceal their sexual relationship. ...
	   ... B. There is substantial and credible information that the
President lied under oath in his civil deposition about gifts he
exchanged with Monica Lewinsky. ...
	   ... 1. The President's Civil Deposition Testimony About His
Gifts to Monica Lewinsky
	   During the President's deposition in the Jones case, Ms. Jones's
attorneys asked several questions about whether he had given gifts
to Monica Lewinsky.
	   Q: Well, have you ever given any gifts to Monica Lewinsky?
	   WJC: I don't recall. Do you know what they were?
	   Q: A hat pin?
	   WJC: I don't, I don't remember. But I certainly, I could have.
...
	   ... 2. Evidence that Contradicts the President's Civil
Deposition Testimony
	   ... (ii) The evidence ... demonstrates that the President gave
Ms. Lewinsky a hat pin as a belated Christmas gift on February 28,
1997. ... In her meeting with the President on December 28, 1997,
according to Ms. Lewinsky, ``I mentioned that I had been concerned
about the hat pin being on the subpoena and he said that that had
sort of concerned him also and asked me if I had told anyone that
he had given me this hat pin and I said no.''
	   ... 6. Summary
	   The President stated in his civil deposition that he could not
recall whether he had ever given any gifts to Ms. Lewinsky; that he
could not remember whether he had given her a hat pin although
``certainly, I could have''; and that he had received a gift from
Ms. Lewinsky only ``once or twice.'' In fact, the evidence
demonstrates that they exchanged numerous gifts of various kinds at
many points over a lengthy period of time ...
	   ... IV. There is substantial and credible information that the
President lied under oath during his civil deposition concerning
conversations he had with Monica Lewinsky about her involvement in
the Jones case. ...
	   ... A. Conversations with Ms. Lewinsky Regarding the Possibility
of Her Testifying in the Jones Case
	   1. President Clinton's Testimony in His Deposition ...
	   ... Q: Have you ever talked to Monica Lewinsky about the
possibility that she might be asked to testify in this lawsuit?
	   (videotape indicates an approximately 14-second pause before
answer)
	   WJC: I'm not sure, and let me tell you why I'm not sure. It
seems to me the, the, the -- I want to be as accurate as I can
here. Seems to me the last time she was there to see Betty before
Christmas we were joking about how you-all (Ms. Jones's attorneys),
with the help of the Rutherford Institute, were going to call every
woman I'd ever talked to ... and ask them that, and so I said you
(Ms. Lewinsky) would qualify, or something like that. ...
	   Q: What, if anything, did Monica Lewinsky say in response?
	   WJC: Nothing that I remember. Whatever she said, I don't
remember. Probably just some predictable thing.
	   2. Evidence that Contradicts the President's Civil Deposition
Testimony
	   (i) Ms. Lewinsky's Testimony
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified that she spoke three times to President
Clinton about the prospect of testifying in the Jones lawsuit --
once (December 17, 1997) after she was on the witness list and
twice more (December 28, 1997, and January 5, 1998) after she had
been subpoenaed.
	   a. December 17, 1997, Call. Ms. Lewinsky testified that
President Clinton called her at about 2:00 a.m. on December 17,
1997. ... he told Ms. Lewinsky that she was on the witness list in
the Jones case. According to Ms. Lewinsky, ``he told me that it
didn't necessarily mean that I would be subpoenaed, but that that
was a possibility, and if I were to be subpoenaed, that I should
contact Betty and let Betty know that I had received the
subpoena.'' Ms. Lewinsky said that the President told her that she
might be able to sign an affidavit to avoid being deposed.
According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President also told her, ``You know,
you can always say you were coming to see Betty or that you were
bringing me letters.'' Ms. Lewinsky took that statement to be a
reminder of the false ``cover stories'' that they had used earlier
in the relationship.

UNDATED: the relationship.

<TEXT>
	   b. December 28, 1997, Visit. Ms. Lewinsky was subpoenaed on
December 19. At her request, Vernon Jordan told the President that
Ms. Lewinsky had been subpoenaed. She then met with President
Clinton nine days later on December 28, less than three weeks
before the President was deposed.
	   According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President discussed the
Jones lawsuit and how the Jones lawyers might have learned about
her. Ms. Lewinsky said they also discussed the subpoena's
requirement that she produce gifts she had received from the
President, including specifically a ``hat pin.''
	   Because of their mutual concern about the subpoena, Ms. Lewinsky
testified that she asked the President if she should put the gifts
away somewhere. The President responded ``I don't know'' or ``Hmm''
or ``Let me think about it.'' Later that day, according to Ms.
Lewinsky, Ms. Currie called to pick up the gifts, which she then
stored under her bed in her home in Virginia.
	   ... Ms. Lewinsky also testified that she spoke to the President
by telephone on January 5, 1998, and they continued to discuss her
role in the Jones case. Ms. Lewinsky expressed concern that, if she
were deposed, she might have a difficult time explaining the
circumstances of her transfer from the White House to the Pentagon.
According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President suggested that she answer
by explaining that people in the White House Legislative Affairs
office had helped her get the Pentagon job _ which Ms. Lewinsky
understood to be a misleading answer because she in fact had been
transferred as a result of her being around the Oval Office too
much.
 &UR; (ii) The President's Grand Jury Testimony
	   When the President testified to the grand jury, the President
admitted that Ms. Lewinsky visited him on December 28, 1997, and
that during that visit, they discussed her involvement in the Jones
case:
	   ... There is substantial and credible information that President
Clinton lied under oath in his civil deposition in answering ``I'm
not sure'' when asked whether he had talked to Ms. Lewinsky about
the prospect of her testifying. In fact, he had talked to Ms.
Lewinsky about it on three occasions in the month preceding his
civil deposition, as Ms. Lewinsky's testimony makes clear.
	   The President's motive to lie in his civil deposition on this
point is evident. Had he admitted talking to Ms. Lewinsky about the
possibility that she might be asked to testify, that would have
raised the specter of witness tampering. ...
	   Vernon Jordan testified that he had told the President about the
subpoena on December 19, 1997, after he had talked to Ms. Lewinsky.
...
	   ... The President's motive to lie in his civil deposition on the
subpoena issue is evident. Had he admitted talking to Ms. Lewinsky
after her subpoena, that would have raised the specter of witness
tampering, which could have triggered legal and public scrutiny of
the President.
	   There is substantial and credible information that President
Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice by engaging in a pattern of
activity to conceal evidence regarding his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky ... The pattern included:
	   (i) concealment of gifts that the President had given Ms.
Lewinsky and that were subpoenaed from Ms. Lewinsky in the Jones
case; and
	   (ii) concealment of a note sent by Ms. Lewinsky to the President
on January 5, 1998.
	   From the beginning, President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky hoped
and expected that their relationship would remain secret. They took
active steps, when necessary, to conceal the relationship. The
President testified that ``I hoped that this relationship would
never become public.''
	   ... Ms. Lewinsky testified that in the early morning of December
17, at roughly 2:00 or 2:30 a.m., she received a call from the
President. Among other subjects, the President mentioned that he
had Christmas presents for her.
	   ... The subpoena required her to testify at a deposition on
January 23, 1998. The subpoena also required Ms. Lewinsky to
produce ``each and every gift including, but not limited to, any
and all dresses, accessories, and jewelry, and/or hat pins given to
you by, or on behalf of, Defendant Clinton.'' After being served
with the subpoena, Ms. Lewinsky became concerned because the list
of gifts included the hat pin, which ``screamed out at me because
that was the first gift that the President had given me.''
	   Later that same day, December 19, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky met with
Vernon Jordan and told him of her concern about the gifts,
including the hat pin. During that meeting, Ms. Lewinsky asked Mr.
Jordan to inform the President that she had been subpoenaed.
	   ... Shortly after Christmas, Ms. Lewinsky called Ms. Currie and
said that the President had mentioned that he had presents for her.
Ms. Currie called back and told her to come to the White House at
8:30 a.m. on Sunday, December 28, 1997. ... Ms. Lewinsky and the
President met in the Oval Office ... According to Ms. Lewinsky, she
and the President discussed the possibility of moving some of the
gifts out of her possession:
	   At some point I said to him, ``Well, you know, should I _ maybe
I should put the gifts away outside my house somewhere or give them
to someone, maybe Betty.'' And he sort of said _ I think he
responded, ``I don't know'' or ``Let me think about that.'' And we
left that topic.''
	   ... On the 28th, the President also gave Ms. Lewinsky several
Christmas gifts. When asked why the President gave her more gifts
on December 28 when he understood she was under an obligation to
produce gifts in response to the subpoena, Ms. Lewinsky stated:

Libyan letter details questions about incarceration, witnesses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Libya has asked the U.N. chief to clarify
where two suspects in the 1988 Pan Am Lockerbie bombing would serve
their sentences if convicted and the circumstances surrounding how
witnesses would be brought to testify, a source said Friday.
	   The Libyan concerns about a proposal to try the two suspects
were contained in a letter presented to Secretary-General Kofi
Annan by the Libyan foreign minister, Omar al-Muntasser, at a
summit last week of the Nonaligned Movement in Durban, South
Africa.
	   Annan passed along the letter to his legal advisers, who were
conferring about how to address Libyan questions. Among the
concerns was where the men would serve their sentences and
questions surrounding the testimony of witnesses, said a diplomatic
source familiar with the letter. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   A U.S.-British proposal, made last month in a bid to bring
justice to the 10-year-old case, calls for the two suspects to be
tried at a court in the Netherlands by Scottish judges according to
Scottish law.
	   A suitcase bomb exploded on board Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people on board and on the ground.
	   The proposal, which was backed by a Security Council resolution,
calls for the men to be imprisoned in Britain if convicted. The
Tripoli government has said it wants the men imprisoned in Libya if
convicted.
	   Earlier this week, Annan told reporters that Al-Muntasser had
confirmed to him that they were prepared to comply with the
council's decision.
	   ``But the details, the fine print _ there are certain things in
the fine print _ they would want some clarification on,'' he said.
	   The proposal called on Annan to provide the Libyans with any
clarifications they needed and to assist in the transfer of the two
suspects for trial.
	   The Security Council has agreed to suspend economic sanctions
imposed on Libya once it turns over the two men.

Clinton worries, perplexes Asians, Europeans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to add reax from Saturday British papers in graf 9-10 &QL; 
 &UR; By BRYAN BRUMLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Asians worried that the U.S. presidential crisis
could further destabilize the world economy. Russians had woes of
their own. And some Frenchmen wondered why a leader might lose his
office over a fling.
	   From Auckland to Amsterdam, commentators and common folks
gloomily watched the political drama surrounding U.S. President
Bill Clinton unfold on television, on the Internet and in the
press, as Congress voted to release the report by independent
prosecutor Kenneth Starr.
	   ``There is no doubt that a weakened presidency, its energy to
deal with global issues sapped, is bad news for the world,'' said
an editorial in Singapore's Straits Times newspaper.
	   ``Even if Clinton survives, his presidency is already dead,''
wrote the Washington correspondent of the Italian daily La
Repubblica. ``The forecasts for autumn aren't good: tempest over
Washington, rain on all of us.''
	   In Australia, Clinton's troubles knocked that country's national
election campaign off the front pages of newspapers, and were the
lead item of television and radio bulletins.
	   ``Two dark vans that drove (the report) to the Capitol were akin
to hearses arriving to take away the corpse of the Clinton
presidency,'' wrote the U.S. correspondent of The Sydney Morning
Herald.
	   Some stood by the American president, despite the erosion of
political support for Clinton in the United states.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he still regarded Clinton
as a ``very close friend and ally,'' and his office said he
intended to travel to the United Nations and meet with the U.S.
president there as planned later this month.
	   But British newspapers were less supportive in their Saturday
editions, which devoted numerous pages to the Starr report.
``Clinton's Sex Files,'' the tabloid, The Mirror, said in a
front-page headline. The Express, another tabloid, ran an inside
story about Hillary Clinton under the headline: ``I'm with you all
the way...you vile creep.''
	   A Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid, The Sun, declared in an
editorial that Clinton was ``unfit to be president'' and he ``must
go.''
	   Across Asia, Europe and the Middle East, papers and people
expressed disbelief that Clinton's extramarital sexual relations
with Monica Lewinsky, and attempts to cover them up, should have so
weakened what many regard as a politically successful president.
	   In Tokyo, housewife Ayako Sugi called it ``a personal matter. So
long as he can do the job right, that's OK. I don't know if he
should resign. Things are going well in the America.''
	   ``I don't want a world recession,'' she said. ``And that could
happen if he does get impeached, given how bad things are
already.''
	   Those sentiments were echoed in Paris.
	   ``We always like to know who is with who, but we don't think it
is in any way related to his job and his public life,'' said Jean
Loup Demignieux, international director of France Television.
	   ``It's not a very French approach,'' said Emmanuel Delhomme, a
Paris bookseller. ``We're at the opposite of all that ... because
if tomorrow we had to do the same thing to our politicians, the
parliament would be empty.''
	   French newspapers were less forgiving.
	   ``The Clinton affair creates a climate of crisis in the world,''
the daily Le Monde said in a front-page headline. Le Figaro called
the matter ``a sad affair of sex in bad taste which goes beyond
anything one could have imagined.''
	   In France, as in many other countries, the intimate lives of
politicians are not newspaper fodder. Early on in the
Clinton-Lewinsky affair, many French people considered the issue a
private one. Former French President Francois Mitterrand had a
wife, a lover and out of wedlock daughter born before he became
president _ an open secret.
	   In China, where the private lives of the secretive Communist
Party leaders are off-limits, government-controlled reports on the
scandal have been matter-of-fact.
	   Despite the official silence, Chinese leaders and foreign policy
experts expresed concern that the crisis might imperil the
rapprochement Clinton and President Jiang Zemin symbolized in their
recent summit in Beijing.
	   ``China is very concerned. Many people here consider that steady
bilateral relations need a strong president,'' said Jin Canrong, an
America expert at the government-backed Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.
	   Russian media carried scant word of the events in Washington,
concentrating instead on the ongoing political and economic crisis
at home.
	   Likewise in Malaysia, papers focused on the government's own sex
scandal involving its sacked deputy prime minister, and frantic
preparations for Friday night's opening ceremonies of the 16th
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur.
	   And in Indonesia, many people questioned in downtown Jakarta
said they were unaware of the Washington scandal, which their
newspapers mostly ignored Friday, devoting attention instead to
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years.

UNDATED: Lewinsky stated

<TEXT>
	   ``You know, I can't answer what the President was thinking, but
to me, it was _ there was never a question in my mind and I _ from
everything he said to me, I never questioned him, that we were
never going to do anything but keep this private, so that meant
deny it and that meant do _ take whatever appropriate steps needed
to be taken, you know, for that to happen ... So by turning over
all these gifts, it would at least prompt (the Jones attorneys) to
want to question me about what kind of friendship I had with the
President and they would want to speculate and they'd leak it and
my name would be trashed and he (the President) would be in
trouble.''
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified that a few hours after their meeting on
December 28, 1997, Ms. Currie called her. According to Ms.
Lewinsky, Ms. Currie said: ``I understand you have something to
give me.'' Or, ``The President said you have something to give me''
_ Something along those lines.''
	   Ms. Currie testified that Ms. Lewinsky, not Ms. Currie, placed
the call and raised the subject of transferring the gifts ...
	   According to both Ms. Currie and Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie drove
to Ms. Lewinsky's home later on December 28 for only the second
time in her life. Ms. Lewinsky gave her a sealed box that contained
several gifts Ms. Lewinsky had received from the President,
including the hat pin and one of the gifts he had given her that
very morning ...
	   When Ms. Currie later produced the box to the OIC in response to
a subpoena, the box contained a hat pin, two brooches, an inscribed
official copy of the 1996 State of the Union Address, a photograph
of the President in the Oval Office, an inscribed photograph of the
President and Ms. Lewinsky, a sun dress, two t-shirts, and a
baseball cap with a Black Dog logo.
	   ... The President denied that he had asked Betty Currie to pick
up a box of gifts from Ms. Lewinsky ...
	   ... As to whether she had talked to the President about the
gifts, for example, Ms. Currie initially said she had not, but then
said that Ms. Lewinsky (who said that Ms. Currie had talked to the
President) ``may remember better than I. I don't remember.''
	   ... Ms. Lewinsky stated that if Ms. Currie had not called, Ms.
Lewinsky simply would have kept the gifts (and perhaps thrown them
away). ...
	   ... Even if Ms. Lewinsky is mistaken and she did call Ms. Currie
first, the evidence still leads clearly to the conclusion that the
President orchestrated this transfer.
	   First, it is unlikely that Ms. Lewinsky would have involved Ms.
Currie in this matter unless the President had indicated his assent
...
	   Second, it also is unlikely that Ms. Currie would have driven to
Ms. Lewinsky's home, retrieved the gifts from Ms. Lewinsky, and
stored them under her bed at home without being asked to do so by
the President -- at least, without checking with him. ...
	   ... Even if the President did not orchestrate the transfer to
Ms. Currie, there is still substantial evidence that he encouraged
the concealment and non-production of the gifts by Ms. Lewinsky.
...
	   The President gave Ms. Lewinsky new gifts on December 28, 1997.
Given his desire to conceal the relationship, it makes no sense
that the President would have given Ms. Lewinsky more gifts on the
28th unless he and Ms. Lewinsky understood that she would not
produce all of her gifts in response to her subpoena.
	   ... The President had a motive to orchestrate the concealment of
gifts, whether accomplished through Ms. Currie indirectly or
through Ms. Lewinsky directly. The President knew that Ms. Lewinsky
was concerned about the subpoena. Both of them were concerned that
the gifts might raise questions about the relationship. ...
	   The concealment of the gifts also ensured that the President
could provide false and misleading statements about the gifts under
oath at his deposition ...
	   ... On December 16, 1997, the President was served by Ms.
Jones's attorneys with a request for production of documents,
including documents relating to ``Monica Lewisky'' ...
	   On January 4, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky left a book for the President
with Ms. Currie. Ms. Lewinsky had enclosed in the book a romantic
note that she had written, inspired by a recent viewing of the
movie Titanic. In the note, Ms. Lewinsky told the President that
she wanted to have sexual intercourse with him, at least once.
	   On January 5, in the course of discussing her affidavit and
possible testimony in a phone conversation with the President, Ms.
Lewinsky says she told the President, ``I shouldn't have written
some of those things in the note.'' According to Ms. Lewinsky, the
President said that he agreed and that she should not write those
kinds of things on paper. ...
	   ... President Clinton testified that he did not recall a
romantic note enclosed in the book or when he had received it. ...
Based on Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, there is substantial and
credible information that the President concealed or destroyed this
note ...
	   ... There is substantial and credible information that ....
President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had an understanding that they
would lie under oath in the Jones case about their relationship;
and .... President Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice by
suggesting that Ms. Lewinsky file an affidavit so that she would
not be deposed. ...
	   Ms. Lewinsky has stated that the President never explicitly told
her to lie. Instead, as she explained, they both understood from
their conversations that they would continue their pattern of
covering up and lying about the relationship. In that regard, the
President never said they must now tell the truth under oath; to
the contrary, as Ms. Lewinsky stated:

UNDATED: Lewinsky stated.
</HEADLINE>
   (I)t wasn't as if the President called me and said, ``You know,
Monica, you're on the witness list, this is going to be really hard
for us, we're going to have to tell the truth and be humiliated in
front of the entire world about what we've done,'' which I would
have fought him on probably. That was different. And by him not
calling me and saying that, you know, I knew what that meant. ...

<TEXT>
	   Two days before the President's deposition, his lawyer, Robert
Bennett, obtained a copy of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit from Mr.
Carter. ...
	   Later, Mr. Bennett read Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit denying a
``sexual relationship'' to the President and asked him: ``Is that a
true and accurate statement as far as you know it?'' The President
answered: ``That is absolutely true.'' ...
	   The President told the grand jury: ``(D)id I hope (Ms. Lewinsky
would) be able to get out of testifying on an affidavit?
Absolutely. Did I want her to execute a false affidavit? No, I did
not.'' ...
	   ... The President also maintained that Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit,
as it ultimately was filed denying a ``sexual relationship,'' was
not necessarily inaccurate. He testified that, depending on Ms.
Lewinsky's state of mind, her statement denying a sexual
relationship could have been true.
	   I believe at the time that she filled out this affidavit, if she
believed that the definition of sexual relationship was two people
having intercourse, then this is accurate. And I believe that is
the definition that most ordinary Americans would give it. ...
	   ... Ms. Lewinsky testified that, as part of their mutual
concealment efforts, she and President Clinton formulated ``cover
stories'' to explain Ms. Lewinsky's presence in the West Wing and
Oval Office. When Ms. Lewinsky worked at the White House, she and
the President agreed that Ms. Lewinsky would tell people that she
was coming to the Oval Office to deliver papers or to have papers
signed, when in truth she was going to the Oval Office to have a
sexual encounter with the President.
	   While employed at the White House, Ms. Lewinsky used this cover
story on several occasions. It worked: Several Secret Service
officers testified that they understood that Ms. Lewinsky was at
the Oval Office to deliver or to pick up papers. In fact, however,
Ms. Lewinsky stated that her White House job never required her to
deliver papers or obtain the President's signature, although she
carried papers as a prop.
	   After she was transferred to the Pentagon, Ms. Lewinsky
testified that she and the President formulated a second ``cover
story'': that Ms. Lewinsky was going to the White House to visit
Betty Currie rather than the President. Ms. Lewinsky testified that
she and the President discussed how ``Betty always needed to be the
one to clear me in so that, you know, I could always say I was
coming to see Betty.'' Ms. Lewinsky testified that she met with the
President privately on ten occasions after she left her job at the
White House. Ms. Currie signed her in for each of those private
visits.
	   Ms. Lewinsky has stated that her true purpose in visiting the
White House on these occasions was to see President Clinton, not
Ms. Currie. ...
	   ML: ``Several occasions throughout the entire relationship. Yes.
It was the pattern of the relationship, to sort of conceal it.''
...
	   President Clinton used those same deceptive cover stories during
his deposition in the Jones case. In the civil deposition, when
asked if he had met with Ms. Lewinsky ``several times'' while she
worked at the White House, the President responded that he had seen
her on two or three occasions during the government shutdown, ``and
then when she worked at the White House, I think there was one or
two other times when she brought some documents to me.'' ...
	   The President testified that before he knew that Ms. Lewinsky
was a witness in the Jones case, he ``might well'' have told Ms.
Lewinsky that she could offer the cover stories if questioned about
her presence in the West Wing and Oval Office:
	   Q: ``Did you ever say anything like that, `you can always say
that you were coming to see Betty or bringing me letters?' Was that
part of any kind of a, anything you said to her or a cover story,
before you had any idea she was going to be part of Paula Jones?
	   WJC: ``I might well have said that.''
	   Q: ``Okay.''
	   WJC: ``Because I certainly didn't want this to come out, if I
could help it. And I was concerned about that. I was embarrassed
about it. I knew it was wrong.'' ...
	   There is substantial and credible information that the President
and Ms. Lewinsky reached an understanding that both of them would
lie under oath when asked whether they had a sexual relationship (a
conspiracy to obstruct justice or to commit perjury, in criminal
law terms). Indeed, a tacit or express agreement to make false
statements would have been an essential part of their December and
January discussions, lest one of the two testify truthfully in the
Jones case and thereby incriminate the other as a perjurer.
	   There also is substantial and credible information that
President Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice by suggesting that
Ms. Lewinsky file an affidavit to avoid her deposition, which would
``lock in'' her testimony under oath, and to attempt to avoid
questions at his own deposition _ all to impede the gathering of
discoverable evidence in the Jones v. Clinton litigation. ...
	   There is substantial and credible information that President
Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice by helping Ms. Lewinsky
obtain a job in New York at a time when she would have been a
witness against him were she to tell the truth during the Jones
case.

UNDATED: Jones case.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The President had an incentive to keep Ms. Lewinsky from
jeopardizing the secrecy of the relationship. That incentive grew
once the Supreme Court unanimously decided in May 1997 that the
case and discovery process were to go forward.
	   At various times during the Jones discovery process, the
President and those working on his behalf devoted substantial time
and attention to help Ms. Lewinsky obtain a job in the private
sector. ...
	   On October 1, the President was served with interrogatories
asking about his sexual relationships with women other than Mrs.
Clinton. On October 7, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky couriered a letter
expressing dissatisfaction with her job search to the President. In
response, Ms. Lewinsky said she received a late-night call from
President Clinton on October 9, 1997. She said that the President
told her he would start helping her find a job in New York.
	   The following Saturday, October 11, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky met with
President Clinton alone in the Oval Office dining room from 9:36
a.m. until about 10:54 a.m. In that meeting, she furnished the
President a list of New York jobs in which she was interested. Ms.
Lewinsky mentioned to the President that she would need a reference
from someone in the White House; the President said he would take
care of it. ...
	   On November 5, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky met Mr. Jordan in his law
office. Mr. Jordan told Ms. Lewinsky that she came ``highly
recommended.'' Ms. Lewinsky explained that she hoped to move to New
York, and went over her list of possible employers. Mr. Jordan
telephoned President Clinton shortly after the meeting. ...
	   The effort to obtain a job for Ms. Lewinsky then intensified. On
December 7, President Clinton met with Mr. Jordan at the White
House. Ms. Lewinsky met with Mr. Jordan on December 11 to discuss
specific job contacts in New York. Mr. Jordan gave her the names of
some of his business contacts. He then made calls to contacts at
MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes (the parent corporation of Revlon), American
Express, and Young &AMP; Rubicam.
	   Mr. Jordan also telephoned President Clinton to keep him
informed of the efforts to help Ms. Lewinsky. Mr. Jordan testified
that President Clinton was aware that people were trying to get
jobs for her, that Mr. Podesta was trying to help her, that Bill
Richardson was trying to help her, but that she wanted to work in
the private sector. ...
	   On December 17, 1997, according to Ms. Lewinsky, President
Clinton called her in the early morning and told her that she was
on the witness list, and they discussed their cover stories. ...
	   On Sunday, December 28, 1997, Monica Lewinsky and the President
met in the Oval Office. During that meeting, the President and Ms.
Lewinsky discussed both her move to New York and her involvement in
the Jones suit. ...
	   On January 8, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky interviewed in New York with
MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes, a company recommended by Vernon Jordan. The
interview went poorly. Mr. Jordan then called Ronald Perelman, the
Chairman of the Board at MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes. Mr. Perelman said Ms.
Lewinsky should not worry, and that someone would call her back for
another interview. Mr. Jordan relayed this message to Ms. Lewinsky,
and someone called back that day.
	   Ms. Lewinsky interviewed again the next morning, and a few hours
later received an informal offer for a position. She told Mr.
Jordan of the offer, and Mr. Jordan then notified President Clinton
with the news: ``Mission accomplished.''
 &UR; B. Summary
	   When a party in a lawsuit (or investigation) provides job or
financial assistance to a witness, a question arises as to possible
witness tampering. The critical question centers on the intent of
the party providing the assistance. ...
	   One can draw inferences about the party's intent from
circumstantial evidence. In this case, the President assisted Ms.
Lewinsky in her job search in late 1997, at a time when she would
have become a witness harmful to him in the Jones case were she to
testify truthfully. The President did not act half-heartedly. His
assistance led to the involvement of the Ambassador to the United
Nations, one of the country's leading business figures (Ronald
Perelman, head of Revlon's parent company), and one of the
country's leading attorneys (Vernon Jordan). ...
	   There is substantial and credible information that the President
assisted Ms. Lewinsky in her job search motivated at least in part
by his desire to keep her ``on the team'' in the Jones litigation.
 &UR; VIII. There is substantial and credible information that the
President lied under oath in describing his conversations with
Vernon Jordan about Ms. Lewinsky.
	   President Clinton was asked during his civil deposition whether
he had talked to Mr. Jordan about Ms. Lewinsky's involvement in the
Jones case. The President stated that ... he did not recall whether
Mr. Jordan had talked to Ms. Lewinsky about her involvement in the
Jones case. The testimony was false. ...
 &UR; A. President's Testimony in the Jones Case
	   The President was questioned in his civil deposition about his
conversations with Vernon Jordan regarding Ms. Lewinsky and her
role in the Jones case. ...
	   Q. Has it ever been reported to you that Vernon Jordan met with
Monica Lewinsky and talked about this case?
	   WJC: ... I thought he had given her some advice about her move
to New York. Seems like that's what Betty said.

UNDATED: Betty said.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; B. Evidence That Contradicts the President's Civil Deposition
Testimony &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   Vernon Jordan testified that his conversations with the
President about Ms. Lewinsky's subpoena were, in fact, ``a
continuing dialogue.'' ...
	   ``I said to the President, `Monica Lewinsky called me up. She's
upset. She's gotten a subpoena ... and I will try to get her a
lawyer.'''
	   Later on December 19 ... according to Mr. Jordan, the President
``thanked me for my efforts to get her a job and thanked me for
getting her a lawyer.''
	   According to Mr. Jordan, on January 7, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky showed
him a copy of her signed affidavit denying any sexual relationship
with the President. He testified that he told the President about
the affidavit. ...
	   The President himself testified in the grand jury that he talked
to Mr. Jordan about Ms. Lewinsky's involvement in the case.
 &UR; C. Summary
	   In his civil deposition, the President stated that he had talked
to Vernon Jordan about Ms. Lewinsky's job. But ... the President
did talk to Mr. Jordan about Ms. Lewinsky's involvement in the
Jones case. ... Given their several communications in the weeks
before the deposition, it is not credible that the President forgot
the subject of their conversations during his civil deposition. His
statements ``seems like that's what Betty said'' and ``I didn't
know that'' were more than mere omissions; they were affirmative
misstatements.
 &UR; IX. There is substantial and credible information that President
Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice by attempting to influence
the testimony of Betty Currie.
	   In a meeting with Betty Currie on the day after his deposition
and in a separate conversation a few days later, President Clinton
made statements to her that he knew were false.
 &UR; A. Evidence
	   ... 2. Sunday, January 18, 1998, Meeting with Ms. Currie
	   Shortly after 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, January 17, 1998, two and a
half hours after he returned from the deposition, President Clinton
called Ms. Currie at home and asked her to come to the White House
the next day. ...
	   At about 5:00 p.m. on Sunday, January 18, Ms. Currie went to
meet with President Clinton at the White House. ...
	   According to Ms. Currie, the President then said to her in
succession:
	   ``You were always there when she was there, right? We were never
really alone.''
	   ``You could see and hear everything.''
	   ``Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?''...
	   ``She wanted to have sex with me, and I can't do that.''
	   Ms. Currie indicated that these remarks were ``more like
statements than questions.'' Ms. Currie concluded that the
President wanted her to agree with him. ...
 &UR; B. The President's Grand Jury Testimony
	   The President was asked why he might have said to Ms. Currie ...
``We were never alone together, right?'' and ``You could see and
hear everything.'' The President testified:
	   ``What I was trying to determine was whether my recollection was
right and that she was always in the office complex when Monica was
there, and whether she thought she could hear any conversations we
had, or did she hear any. ... I was trying to understand what the
facts were.
	   Later, the President stated that he was referring to a larger
area than simply the room where he and Ms. Lewinsky were located.
He also testified that his statements to Ms. Currie were intended
to cover a limited range of dates:
	   WJC: ... I meant that she was always in the Oval Office complex,
in that complex, while Monica was there. And I believe that this
was part of a series of questions I asked her to try to quickly
refresh my memory. So, I wasn't trying to get her to say something
that wasn't so. And, in fact, I think she would recall that I told
her to just relax, go in the grand jury and tell the truth when she
had been called as a witness. ...
	   ... I was never, ever trying to get Betty Currie to claim that
on the occasions when Monica Lewinsky was there when she wasn't
anywhere around, that she was. I would never have done that to her,
and I don't think she thought about that. I don't think she thought
I was referring to that. ...
	   ... The President was also asked about his comment to Ms. Currie
that Ms. Lewinsky had ``come on'' to him, but that he had ``never
touched her'' ...
	   ... Q: What was your purpose in making these statements to Mrs.
Currie, if it weren't for the purpose to try to suggest to her what
she should say if ever asked?
	   WJC: ... I was trying to figure out what the facts were. I was
trying to remember. I was trying to remember every time I had seen
Ms. Lewinsky.
	   ... I knew this was all going to come out. ... I did not know
(at the time) that the Office of Independent Counsel was involved.
And I was trying to get the facts and try to think of the best
defense we could construct in the face of what I thought was going
to be a media onslaught. ...
	   ... C. Summary
	   The President referred to Ms. Currie on multiple occasions in
his civil deposition when describing his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. ... The President thus could foresee that Ms. Currie
either might be deposed or questioned or might need to prepare an
affidavit.
	   The President called her shortly after the deposition and met
with Ms. Currie the next day. ...
	   The statements the President made to her ... were false, but
consistent with the testimony that the President provided under
oath at his deposition. ...
	   ... The content of the President's statements and the context in
which those statements were made provide substantial and credible
information that President Clinton sought improperly to influence
Ms. Currie's testimony. Such actions constitute an obstruction of
justice and improper influence on a witness.

	   X. There is substantial and credible information that President
Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice during the federal grand
jury investigation. While refusing to testify for seven months, he
simultaneously lied to potential grand jury witnesses knowing that
they would relay the falsehoods to the grand jury.
	   ... Rather than lie to the grand jury himself, the President
lied about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky to senior aides, and
those aides then conveyed the President's false story to the grand
jury.
	   In this case, the President lied to, among others, three current
senior aides _ John Podesta, Erskine Bowles, and Sidney Blumenthal
_ and one former senior aide, Harold Ickes. ... The President, by
his own later admission, was aware that his aides were likely to
convey the President's version of events to the grand jury.
	   Each aide then testified to the nature of the relationship
between Monica Lewinsky and the President based on those statements
-- without knowing that they were calculated falsehoods by the
President designed to perpetuate the false statements that the
President made during his deposition in the Jones case.
	   The aides' testimony provided the grand jury a false account of
the relationship between the President and Ms. Lewinsky. Their
testimony thus had the potential to affect the investigation --
including decisions by the OIC and grand jury about how to conduct
the investigation (for example, whether to subpoena Secret Service
agents) and whether to indict particular individuals.
	   A. The Testimony of Current and Former Aides
	   1. John Podesta
	   John Podesta, Deputy Chief of Staff, ... described a meeting
with the President, Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, and Deputy Chief
of Staff Sylvia Matthews, in the morning of January 21, 1998.
During that meeting, the President stated: ``Erskine, I want you to
know that this story is not true.'' Mr. Podesta further recalled
that the President said ``that he had not had a sexual relationship
with her, and that he never asked anybody to lie.''
	   Several days later, on January 23, 1998, the President more
adamantly told Mr. Podesta that he had not engaged in sex of any
``kind, shape or manner'' with Ms. Lewinsky. ...
	   ... Mr. Podesta recalled that the President ``volunteered'' to
provide information about Ms. Lewinsky to him even though Mr.
Podesta had not asked for these details.
	   2. Erskine Bowles
	   Mr. Bowles, the White House Chief of Staff, confirmed Mr.
Podesta's account of the President's January 21, 1998, statement in
which the President denied having a sexual relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. ...
	   3. Sidney Blumenthal
	   Sidney Blumenthal, an Assistant to the President, similarly
testified that the President made statements to him denying the
Lewinsky allegations shortly after the first media report.
	   Mr. Blumenthal stated that he spoke to Mrs. Clinton on the
afternoon of January 21, 1998, and to the President early that
evening. ...
	   I said to the President, ``What have you done wrong?'' And he
said, ``Nothing. I haven't done anything wrong.''
	   ...He said, ``Monica Lewinsky came at me and made a sexual
demand on me.'' He rebuffed her. He said, ``I've gone down that
road before, I've caused pain for a lot of people and I'm not going
to do that again.''
	   She threatened him. She said that she would tell people they'd
had an affair, that she was known as the stalker among her peers,
and that she hated it and if she had an affair or said she had an
affair then she wouldn't be the stalker any more. ...
	   ... Mr. Blumenthal repeated to the grand jury the false
statements that the President made to him.
	   4. Harold Ickes
	   Mr. Ickes, a former Deputy Chief of Staff, also related to the
grand jury a conversation that he had with the President on the
morning of January 26, 1998, during which the President denied the
Lewinsky allegations.
	   Regarding that conversation, Mr. Ickes testified: ``The two
things that I recall, the two things that he again repeated in
public ... he had not had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
and that he had done nothing _ now I'm paraphrasing _ had done
nothing to ask anybody to change their story or suborn perjury or
obstruct justice.''
	   Mr. Ickes recalled that the President probably volunteered this
information. Mr. Ickes repeated the President's false statements to
the grand jury.
 &UR; B. The President's Grand Jury Testimony
	   The President admitted to the grand jury that, after the
allegations were publicly reported, he made ``misleading''
statements to particular aides whom he knew would likely be called
to testify before the grand jury. The President testified as
follows:
	   Q: Do you recall denying any sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky to the following people: Harry Thomasson, Erskine Bowles,
Harold Ickes, Mr. Podesta, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Jordan, Ms. Betty
Currie? Do you recall denying any sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky to those individuals?
	   WJC: I recall telling a number of those people that I didn't
have, either I didn't have an affair with Monica Lewinsky or didn't
have sex with her. And I believe, sir, that _ you'll have to ask
them what they thought. But I was using those terms in the normal
way people use them. You'll have to ask them what they thought I
was saying. ...
	   Q: ... After January 21st when the Post article broke and said
that Judge Starr was looking into this, you knew that they might be
witnesses. You knew that they might be called into a grand jury,
didn't you?

	   WJC: That's right. I think I was quite careful what I said after
that. I may have said something to all these people to that effect,
but I'll also _ whenever anybody asked me any details, I said,
look, I don't want you to be a witness or I turn you into a witness
or give you information that would get you in trouble. I just
wouldn't talk. I, by and large, didn't talk to people about this.
	   ...
	   Q: You've told us now that you were being careful, but that it
might have been misleading. Is that correct?
	   WJC: It might have been. ... So, what I was trying to do was to
give them something they could _ that would be true, even if
misleading in the context of this deposition, and keep them out of
trouble ... .
 &UR; C. Summary
	   The President made the following misleading statements to his
aides:
	   The President told Mr. Podesta that he had not engaged in sex
``in any way whatsoever'' with Ms. Lewinsky, ``including oral
sex.''
	   The President told Mr. Podesta, Mr. Bowles, and Mr. Ickes that
he did not have a ``sexual relationship'' with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   The President told Mr. Podesta that ``when (Ms. Lewinsky) came
by, she came by to see Betty (Currie).''
	   The President told Mr. Blumenthal that Ms. Lewinsky ``came on to
him and that he had told her he couldn't have sexual relations with
her and that she threatened him.''
	   The President told Mr. Blumenthal that he couldn't remember
making any calls to Ms. Lewinsky other than once when he left a
message on her answering machine. ...
	   For all of these reasons, there is substantial and credible
information that the President improperly tampered with witnesses
during the grand jury investigation.
	   XI. There is substantial and credible information that President
Clinton's actions since January 17, 1998, regarding his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky have been inconsistent with the
President's constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws.
	   Before, during, and after his January 17, 1998, civil
deposition, the President attempted to conceal the truth about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky from the judicial process in the
Jones case. Furthermore, the President has since lied under oath to
the grand jury and facilitated the provision of false information
to the grand jury by others. ...
	   The President promised in January 1998 to cooperate fully with
the grand jury investigation and to provide ``more rather than
less, sooner rather than later.'' ...
	   After being subpoenaed in July, the President made false
statements to the grand jury on August 17, 1998. That night, the
President again made false statements to the American people and
Congress, contending that his answers in his civil deposition had
been ``legally accurate.'' The President then made an implicit plea
for Congress to take no action: ``Our country has been distracted
by this matter for too long.'' ...
	   C. The President repeatedly and unlawfully invoked the Executive
Privilege to conceal evidence of his personal misconduct from the
grand jury.
	   When the allegations about Ms. Lewinsky first arose, the
President informed the American people that he would cooperate
fully. ...
	   Such cooperation did not occur. ...
	   ...
	   D. The President refused six invitations to testify to the grand
jury, thereby delaying expeditious resolution of this matter, and
then refused to answer relevant questions before the grand jury
when he testified in August 1998.
	   ... In a Rose Garden ceremony on July 31, 1998, the President
stated to the country: ``I'm looking forward to the opportunity ...
of testifying. I will do so completely and truthfully.''
	   At the outset of his grand jury appearance, the President
similarly stated: ``I will answer each question as accurately and
fully as I can.'' The President then read a prepared statement in
which he admitted ``inappropriate intimate contact'' with Ms.
Lewinsky. Despite his statement that he would answer each question,
the President refused to answer specific questions about that
contact (other than to indicate that it was not intercourse and did
not involve the direct touching of Ms. Lewinsky's breasts or
genitals).
	   E. The President misled the American people and the Congress in
his public statement on August 17, 1998, when he stated that his
answers at his civil deposition in January had been ``legally
accurate.'' ... The President's statements in his civil deposition
were not ``legally accurate,'' and he could not reasonably have
thought they were. They were deliberate falsehoods designed to
conceal the truth of the President's sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky. ...
	   F. Summary
	   In this case, the President made and caused to be made false
statements to the American people about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. He also made false statements about whether he had lied
under oath or otherwise obstructed justice in his civil case. By
publicly and emphatically stating in January 1998 that ``I did not
have sexual relations with that woman'' and these ``allegations are
false,'' the President also effectively delayed a possible
congressional inquiry, and then he further delayed it by asserting
Executive Privilege and refusing to testify for six months during
the Independent Counsel investigation. This represents substantial
and credible information that may constitute grounds for an
impeachment.
	   Conclusion
	   This Referral is respectfully submitted on the Ninth day of
September, 1998.
	   Kenneth W. Starr
	   Independent Counsel

In unprecedented step, Brazilian team offer fans money back if they
</HEADLINE>
lose

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Sports fans regularly grumble they
should get their ticket refunded after a poor match.
	   On Friday, Flamengo soccer club announced that their fans would
indeed get just that if they lose on Sunday.
	   ``If we lose our next match supporters will be paid back the
cost of the ticket,'' said Flamengo spokesman Altair Bafa. The game
is against Portugesa in the national league.
	   The pledge is unprecedented in Brazil's soccer history,
according to Bafa, who said the team is ``desperate'' to fill up
the famous Maracana stadium in where they play in Rio.
	   Only 792 paying fans watched Flamengo's last home game against
Argentinian team Boca Juniors in the Mercosul Cup. Their stadium
has a capacity of nearly 100,000.
	   ``This was our smallest crowd in our 103-year history. We have
not won for eight games. We need our supporters to cheer us on
again,'' said Bafa.
	   Flamengo, captained by Romario, is arguably the biggest club in
Brazil. They are in 17th place in the first division after ten
games.

Ruling party wins most seats in local elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The ruling People's National Party won
more than twice as many seats as its main opposition in local
government elections Thursday that were marked mostly by voter
apathy.
	   In partial results, the People's National Party won 84 electoral
divisions while the opposition Jamaica Labour Party won 36. Final
results were not available in another 21 divisions, the Jamaica
Gleaner newspaper reported Friday in its electronic edition.
	   The New Democratic Movement, a political party organized in
1996, boycotted the vote.
	   One poll worker was slightly injured when a policeman's shotgun
went off accidentally and a pellet ricocheted off a building and
hit her. And a Labour candidate, Nicolayan Robinson, 33, of
Flankers, was arrested by police and accused of trying to buy
votes, the Gleaner reported.
	   But unlike general elections in Jamaica, which are marked by
rabid participation that sometimes spills over into violence, most
voters yawned Thursday. Many voting stations reported very light
turnout and some predicted less than 30 percent of registered
voters would actually cast ballots.
	   The election itself was years overdue.
	   Local government elections are supposed to be held every three
years but the vote has been postponed several times as the
political parties considered electoral reform measures.
	   The last previous vote for the local offices took place in 1990.

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Divers Friday recovered the cockpit
voice recorder from Swissair Flight 111 _ an important find that
could help investigators learn why the jet plummeted into the
Atlantic.
	   Together with the flight data recorder, which records the
flight's mechanical data and was retrieved earlier this week, the
devices may shed some light onto the cause of the wreck that killed
all 229 people aboard.
	   The voice box was found 180 feet (55 meters) below the ocean
surface around 7 p.m. (2200 GMT) Friday near where the data
recorder had been found four days earlier, transportation officials
said.
	   Although investigators already have a transcript of the
conversation between the Swissair pilots and air controllers, the
cockpit voice recorder may have picked up additional conversation
between the two pilots, or irregular noises in the aircraft.
	   Stored in a box of fresh water to preserve it, the voice box was
sent to Ottawa Friday for analysis. Its condition was not
immediately known, transportation board officials said.
	   Investigators have said the full transcripts of the tape would
not be released to protect the privacy of the pilots.
	   Divers had been searching simultaneously for the box as well as
for remains of victims of the Geneva-bound MD-11 Friday.
	   Late Thursday, divers recovered remains of passengers from the
ocean floor. The 22 divers, who can spend only 30 minutes at a time
combing the Atlantic floor, carried the remains to the surface in
bags.
	   It was the first time remains had been recovered from the ocean
floor. Until now, body parts had been only found floating on the
surface of the Atlantic or washed up on the shore.
	   Out of respect for the families of the victims, authorities
wouldn't say how many passengers may have been represented among
the recovered remains. Rick Town, commander of the Canadian navy
supply ship Preserver, said even a guess was impossible.
	   So far, only four victims have been identified out of the
remains that have been recovered.
	   Flight 111, which originated in New York, lost contact with air
controllers six minutes before it crashed into the Atlantic on
Sept. 2.
	   Divers said they had been focusing their search on the victims,
although the voice recorder box was also a top priority.
	   ``People come first,'' said Stan Ferguson, superintendent of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police, just hours before the voice box was
found. ``To overlook the recovery of human remains is not right.''

cronyism have flourished in Romania. In this moral confusion, some
Romanians cherish the memory of the bloody Vlad.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Summoned to ``defend the rule of law,''
Congress broke the seal on Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's case
against President Clinton on Friday, then began poring over a
report blending evidence of impeachable offenses with descriptions
of sex. ``This could be a make or break weekend for the
president,'' said Republican Rep. Peter King as lawmakers flew off
for a weekend of campaigning _ and a sampling of public opinion _
in their congressional districts. Starr said the grounds for
impeaching Clinton included perjury and obstruction of justice in
concealing an affair with Monica Lewinsky. Several pages were
devoted to a detailed description of sexual encounters that Ms.
Lewinsky reported having with the president. Congress moved quickly
to disseminate the material as widely as possible, posting it on
the Internet within two hours of a 363-63 House vote to release it.
(CLINTON-INVESTIGATION)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In a rare show of accord, Russia's fractious
parliament Friday confirmed Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov after
he called for Russians to unite and conquer the worse economic
crisis since the Soviet collapse. ``We need unity to come out of
this very grave crisis,'' Primakov told the hushed State Duma, the
lower chamber of parliament, before he was approved by a 317-63
vote. Assuming one of the world's toughest and most thankless jobs,
Primakov warned he had no easy solution for an economy shattered by
a plummeting currency, stagnant industry, restive regions and a
broke government. ``Don't expect quick results. I'm no magician,''
Primakov warned the legislators. (RUSSIA-POLITICS)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Warning that Cambodia faces disaster
from anarchy in the streets, King Norodom Sihanouk and the head of
the army pressured opposition leaders Friday to accept the victory
of strongman Hun Sen in recent parliamentary elections. The
warnings came after a pro-Hun Sen mob _ many appearing to be police
and soldiers in plainclothes _ fired guns, threw rocks and swung
clubs at vastly outnumbered opposition demonstrators calling for
Hun Sen's ouster. One man was killed and several injured. The
pressure from the king and army cuts off potential support for the
opposition from two key institutions even as backing appears to be
growing in the streets, fueled by disgust with the violence Hun Sen
has unleashed this week to crush protest. Gen. Ke Kim Yan said in a
televised address that the general staff would not break ranks and
said that the country faced ``new, ever-lasting disaster,'' which
he blamed on the opposition. The army would protect public
institutions, he said. (CAMBODIA)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A volley of shots fired in a remote West Bank
cottage set off a violent chain reaction Friday that threatened to
cripple Washington's latest Mideast peace mission. The bullets
fired by Israeli troops in a raid of a Hamas hideout killed two top
fugitives sought for planning terror attacks. Vowing retaliation,
Islamic militants said they would detonate bombs in the Jewish
state. Hundreds of Hamas supporters took to the streets, clamoring
for revenge, and threw stones at Israeli soldiers. Troops sprayed
one group of protesters in the West Bank town of El Bireh with
rubber bullets, injuring five people. The army also sealed the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, fanning Palestinian resentment already running
high over the 17-month stalemate in talks on an Israeli troop
pullback in the West Bank. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ African and U.N. leaders scrambled
Friday to stop Congo's 6-week civil war, while Rwanda renewed its
threat to deploy troops to prevent the persecution of ethnic
Tutsis. Leaders from seven countries embroiled in Congo's war met
for a second day in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa to
negotiate a cease-fire and the withdrawal of foreign troops. Their
prospects for success were dim: Rebels said they would not be bound
by any pact agreed by the ministers because they were barred from
the negotiations. Rwanda complained about the exclusion of the
rebels from the meeting, which was to end Friday, and threatened to
step into the conflict. (CONGO-PEACE TALKS)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rallied into the weekend Friday as
Kenneth Starr's charges against President Bill Clinton were
released to the public for the first time. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 179.96 points _ or by 2.4 percent _ to 7,795.50
despite opening the day with a 96-point slide. The Nasdaq composite
index rose 3.5 percent to lead the broad market advance as
technology shares drew a boost from some encouraging business
updates by Intel and Oracle. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Prices charged by producers such as factories
and farms fell 0.4 percent in August, pulled down by deflation in
gasoline, automobiles and vegetables. The seasonally adjusted
decline in the Producer Price Index, reported Friday by the Labor
Department, was the largest since January and exceeded analysts'
expectation for a slight 0.1 percent drop. ``Inflation is dead and
deflationary pressures intensify,'' said economist Cheryl R. Katz
of Merrill Lynch. World economic turmoil _ by sapping global demand
for manufactured goods and commodities _ is putting pressure on
producers but benefiting buyers through lower prices. The presence
of deflation for many goods could give the Federal Reserve leeway
to reduce short-term interest rates later this year to offset the
negative impact of the global crisis. (US-ECONOMY)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ On the London Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest
market, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed
with a loss of 0.4 percent after being down 1.8 percent at midday.
Key market indexes were off by 0.2 percent in Frankfurt, Germany,
and down 0.3 percent Paris, both well above the day's lows. The
damage was heavier on big Asian markets, which had closed before
trading began in New York. (WORLD MARKETS)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Noting the world economy has ``clearly
worsened,'' European Central Bank president Wim Duisenberg on
Friday urged the 11 countries preparing to adopt a common currency
to cut back more on government spending to ensure stability.
Starting Jan. 1, the bank is to set financial policy for the 11
European Union members that are joining to launch the single
currency, called the euro. Formulating that policy, though, has
been made harder by instability in the world economy caused by
Russia's crisis, Asia's recession and weakness in Latin America.
After a meeting of the bank's governing council, Duisenberg said
the focus was on ``recent economic, monetary and financial
developments.'' (GERMANY-EUROPE'S BANK)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks ended lower in thin trading Friday
amid investors' worries over what kind of economic policies are
likely under the new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov. However, the
denouement of Russia's political crisis appeared to buoy the ruble,
which ended at 11.7 to the dollar _ up from more than 13 on
Thursday. Primakov's approval as prime minister seemed to assuage
the markets' worries over possible political and social chaos, but
it raised concerns over the government's economic program, traders
said. The stock market closed at 62.31 points, down 3.5 percent
from Thursday. Trading volume dropped to dlrs 2.2 million from dlrs
3.1 million Thursday. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Microsoft Corp. urged a judge Friday to throw
out the government's landmark lawsuit and attacked what it saw as
weak points in the complaint. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson didn't indicate when he might rule on Microsoft's request
to dismiss the lawsuit, or at least important parts of it. The
Justice Department and the 20 states suing Microsoft repeated
allegations that Microsoft moved illegally by, among other actions,
bundling its Internet browser free with its popular Windows
software to hurt Netscape Communications, which makes a competing
browser. The government also has accused Microsoft of offering
exclusionary contracts to Internet companies to distribute its
browser and of refusing to allow computer makers to remove easy
access to the browser. (US-MICROSOFT)

	   SNAGOV, Romania (AP) _ Mother Melania, nervous about talking to
a reporter as she waits for the priest's rowboat to return, says
she wishes God would strike her dumb so her nun's tongue wouldn't
run away with her.
	   Here on Dracula's island, the medieval notion seems fitting.
	   On the islet, a short boat ride across the murky waters of Lake
Snagov, is a medieval monastery that houses the tomb of Vlad the
Impaler, the 16th-century warrior prince who inspired Bram Stoker's
1897 novel Dracula.
	   Since the 1989 execution of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and the
fall of Communism, corruption and cronyism have flourished in
Romania. In this moral confusion, some Romanians cherish the memory
of the bloody Vlad.
	   Ceausescu, who ruled Romania with an iron fist for 25 years, was
compared by his critics to Vlad, who impaled his victims on stakes
when they erred or crossed him and spread fear wherever he went.
	   Ceausescu built one of his several homes just across the water
from the island, the apricot and cream Mediterranean-style palace
rising above the reeds and weeping willows.
	   But he never set foot on the island.
	   Dozens of villas surround the 600-hectare (1,500-acre) lake 40
kilometers (25 miles) north of Bucharest, a former holiday home for
the Communist bigwigs and playground for the newly rich of today.
	   ``Where are you, oh Impaler Prince, to grab them all and
separate them into nutters and bastards?'' reads a line from a
verse by 19th-century poet Mihai Eminescu. It has become a common
phrase among contemporary Romanians.
	   At least with Vlad, you knew where you stood.
	   ``Vlad the Impaler was tough but fair,'' said Mother Melania,
swaddled in black and trembling as she awaits the return of her
superior, the Rev. Emil Poenaru, who had a doctor's appointment.
She's afraid her boss will think she took money for an interview.
	   Mother Melania and Poenaru are the only residents of the islet,
which the deteriorating 11th-century monastery shares with a couple
of cottages, a bell tower and a corn field.
	   Vlad, whose castles are in Translavania where he fought
marauding Turks, came here for a bit of peace and to squirrel away
the country's treasure in the monastery via an underground tunnel.
	   A gaudy picture of Vlad marks the site of his underground tomb
in the monastery.
	   Poenaru has been the overseer of the island and its buildings
for the past 17 years. An attempted restoration of the monastery
has been progressing slowly because of a lack of funds.
	   Pop star Michael Jackson stayed in Ceausescu's palace and
visited Dracula's island in 1996, but he didn't donate any money
for the restoration.
	   ``The rich never carry money around with them,'' explains Mother
Melania, who has lived on the island for more than a decade.
	   Workmen seem in no hurry to repair the monastery, a neglected
jewel in Romania's national heritage. They mutter that Poenaru is
``of the devil'' (a mean person). Devil is ``drac'' in Romanian.
	   In his black robes, Poenaru comes across as a charismatic
Orthodox cleric, weary with trying to get funds for the
restoration.
	   ``The restoration work has been going on for eight years,'' says
Poenaru, sipping a Turkish coffee and puffing on a low-tar
cigarette. ``Everything depends on the state budget and that has
been cut.''
	   The monastery makes a little money from selling Korean-made
diamante crucifixes and postcards. Tourists probably would make
donations, but boats rarely stop here anymore.
	   To set the record on Dracula straight, Poenaru explains
patiently: ``Justice is not done with the sword, but with God's
word.''

Ceausescu Villas: Want to sleep in a dictator's bed?

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Want to sleep in a dictator's bed?
Swim in a mosaic-lined swimming pool? A spot of hunting before
breakfast?
	   Romania's cash-strapped government is lining up a luxury package
for foreign tourists with cash to spare and a taste for something
off the beaten track, a chance to stay at palaces and villas
belonging to late Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu.
	   A night at one of Ceausescu's abodes likely will cost dlrs 3,000
(26,760,000 lei) to dlrs 4,000 (35,680,000 lei), says Mihai Nica,
the government commercial director of the houses.
	   ``Guests will get a really special reception,'' he says. ``They
will be able to relax and at the same time think this belonged to
Ceausescu, who was a dictator.''
	   The tours, which will include hunting and excursions at some of
the villas, will likely start next spring. Palaces in Bucharest,
the upscale resort of Snagov and two villas in Transylvania are
among those that may be included.
	   Ceausescu, who was executed during the 1989 anti-Communist
revolt, kept luxury villas and palaces in almost every county. Many
are near woods so the former dictator could indulge his passion for
hunting.
	   Nica says the government will use the funds for the upkeep of
the palaces and the dozens of government guest houses used for
foreign dignitaries.

	   PARRAS de la FUENTE, Mexico (AP) _ Only hours from the
dust-blown Texas border, this 400-year-old town seems a mirage in
the heart of the Coahuila desert.
	   Cacti give way to lush wild grapevines, and underground streams
in the Sierra Madre mountains gush to the surface: The perfect
combination for the wine that flows from the oldest winery in the
Americas.
	   Few travelers go out of their way to visit northeastern Mexico,
known mostly for the factories, or ``maquiladoras,'' glaring
against a wasteland of windswept sand near the U.S.-Mexico border.
	   But just 240 miles (390 kilometers) from Laredo, Texas, Parras
de la Fuente, or ``grapevines of the fountain,'' defies change,
aging like a fine wine.
	   Parras is a living homage to the succulent purple grape that
grows wild here. Painted grapevines line the doorways of some of
the 400-year-old homes along its cobblestone streets. Sculpted
grapes edge the stone fountain across from the 332-year-old San
Ignacio Loyola Church.
	   And the biggest event of the year is the crowning of the queen
of the annual Grape Fair.
	   Residents sell homemade wine for a few dollars from their homes,
but the best is found at the San Lorenzo Hacienda, also called Casa
Madero. Descendants of Mexican revolutionary hero Francisco Madero,
who was born here, run the winery today.
	   Workers no longer mash grapes with bare feet while a harpist
plays, as they did 75 years ago. Today a high-tech French machine
squashes the grapes and spits out the skin, stems and seeds. But
that hasn't replaced the colonial charm of the former hacienda.
	   Free tours of the winery run daily from morning to dusk. The
tours are in Spanish, but an English-speaking employee is always on
hand.
	   Over a walkway hangs a canopy of grapes used to make wine for
the town's 25 churches. On a nearby wall is a tiled mural of the
Virgin of Wine. Next to the hacienda's chapel, a small store sells
Casa Madero wine and brandy.
	   In 1568, Spanish conquistadors looking for gold, and priests on
a mission to convert Mexico's indigenous people to Christianity,
came to the valley of the Tlaxcaltecas.
	   Drawn by the wild grapes and fresh spring water, they settled 10
years later. Among them was Spanish Capt. Don Francisco de
Urdiqola, who started the first vineyards in 1593 at his El Rosario
Hacienda, today the town's shopping center.
	   In 1597, King Philip II issued a land grant to Don Lorenzo
Garcia to start the first official winery for the New World,
establishing San Lorenzo Hacienda.
	   But in 1699 the King of Spain, alarmed by competition from the
rapidly growing winery, banned production in the Americas except by
the church. The ban lasted until Mexico's independence in 1810. Don
Evaristo Madero, grandfather of ex-president Madero, bought the
winery in 1893.
	   Each year, descendants of early Tlaxcalan settlers bear torches
and descend from the hills in the night and converge at the
hacienda to celebrate its heritage. The colorful ceremony is part
of the week-long Grape Fair in early August.
	   Travelers may stay at the winery and awaken to the bittersweet
scent of wine. The rooms, decorated with traditional and
contemporary Mexican art, surround a garden.
	   Paintings from the 16th century and a stone fireplace with
grapevines adorn the dining room that looks onto an enormous lawn
with a 400-yard (365-meter) stone walkway leading to a swimming
pool.
	   Guests are served regional dishes such as machaca, a tasty dried
meat served with scrambled eggs or in a spicy soup, and the
award-winning San Lorenzo white wine. Another Parras specialty are
sweets made of sugar, nuts and milk.
	   The ex-hacienda charges dlrs 135 (1,350 pesos) a night per
couple, which includes three meals, wine and brandy. The six hotels
in Parras, a 15-minute drive, range from dlrs 5 (50 pesos) to dlrs
40 (400 pesos) a night. The modern Hotel Rincon del Montero, a few
miles (kilometers) outside, is a resort with golf, tennis, swimming
and horse riding and charges dlrs 45 (450 pesos) a night for two.
	   The best swimming in town is at the three ponds built by the
Spaniards to store the fresh spring water that surfaces here from
the nearby Sierra Madre mountains. La Luz pond today is lined by
palm trees and umbrella tables.
	   Overlooking the town is the simple 130-year-old Santa Madero
Church atop the plug of an extinct volcano. The climb offers a
great view of the Sierra Madre mountains rising on one side and the
timeless town below where sun-toasted farmers on burros meander
down the street selling cream in tin milk cans.

	   IF YOU GO ...
	   TRAVEL: Parras is about 318 miles (511 kilometers) south of
Laredo, Texas. It is an easy drive from the border with modern
highways. Continental and Aeromexico offer flights to Torreon,
Coahuila, the closest city with a growing artist community. From
there, it is a comfortable hour-and-a-half bus ride. Parras Package
tours are available through OK Tours in San Antonio, Texas, at
1-800-270-0132, or (210) 222-8880.
	   ___
	   CLIMATE: Parras' temperatures are mild year-round, with the
hottest period between May and July, hovering in the 80s (28 C). It
is a dry heat. A light summer shower usually accompany the late
afternoons.
	   ___
	   LODGING: Hotels in the center of Parras are the best deal. Hotel
Posada Santa Isabel with simple, comfortable rooms set around a
quiet garden runs about dlrs 18 (180 pesos) a night. The modern
Hotel Rincon del Montero, a few miles (kilometers) outside, is a
resort with golf, tennis, swimming and horse riding and charges
dlrs 44 (440 pesos) a night for two. The Casa Madero winery charges
dlrs 136 dollars, (1,365 pesos) to stay at the ex-hacienda. That
includes three meals, wine and brandy.
	   ___
	   TRANSPORTATION: Parking is easy if you bring your own car. If
not, taxis in old American cars from the 1960s and '70s abound and
charge about dlrs 2.5 (25 pesos) to go just about anywhere. Local
buses also are available. Fare is a few cents (2 pesos).
	   ___
	   CURRENCY: Some business will accept American dollars but to get
the best price and avoid hassles use Mexican pesos. The recent rate
hovers around 9 pesos to the dollar.
	   ___
	   SHOPPING: Culinary items are definitely the thing to buy here.
At the San Lorenzo Hacienda, or Casa Madero, wines and brandies run
from dlrs 6 (60 pesos) to dlrs 15 (150 pesos) a bottle. More
economical bottles are sold in town at small outlets or from
private homes. Another specialty is homemade candy made from sugar,
milk and nuts found at numerous candy shops throughout Parras.
	   ___
	   RESTAURANTS: This is cattle country so most local fare involves
some kind of red meat and typically runs about dlrs 2.5 to dlrs 4.5
(25 to 45 pesos). A delicious filet mignon marinated in lime juice
costs about dlrs 6 (60 pesos). Everything can be found from
hamburgers to traditional Mexican enchiladas and tacos.
	   ___
	   INFORMATION: For more information, call the helpful,
English-speaking staff at the Coahuila state tourism office (52-84)

Foreigners swarm to salt flats despite torrid heat

	   BADWATER, California (AP) _ Don't let the name of this place
fool you. There's no water here, good or bad.
	   Maybe during the winter, but with less than 2 inches (5
centimeters) of rainfall a year and temperatures up to 128 F (53 C)
in summer, Death Valley is the lowest, hottest, driest area in
North America.
	   Yet tourists are drawn to Death Valley National Park like ants
to chocolate.
	   The only noise that breaks the silence in this vast valley, 140
miles (225 kilometers) long and four to 16 miles (6 to 26
kilometers) wide, is the crunch of visitors' shoes on the fine salt
crystals left by evaporation.
	   All around, mountains tower above the salt flats. Of course,
when you're standing at the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere
_ 282 feet (86 meters) below sea level _ everything seems tall.
	   Look across the flats to Telescope Peak, the highest point in
the park at more than 11,000 feet (3,352 meters). Normally
snow-covered in winter, the mountain range is bare now but offers
some welcome shade from the blistering sun.
	   Despite the torrid heat, July and August are just as popular
with foreign visitors as the winter months.
	   U.S. tourists tend to avoid Death Valley in the summer, but
foreigners come precisely for the heat, says park ranger Brenda
Henson.
	   ``They want to experience the heat in Death Valley,'' she says.
``They think this is neat. I think it's kind of crazy.''
	   They descend to the valley floor packed in rental cars, maps and
water bottles in tow, from all over the globe. But they're mainly
from Europe.
	   ``We come here because we can tell all our friends and family
that we've been to the hottest place in the world,'' says Bernard
Givelet of Paris, whose children are furiously fanning themselves
with folded newspapers.
	   According to park rangers, an average of 1.3 million visitors
enter the park each year. From June through August, 90 percent of
them are foreigners. In the past two years, summer tourism has been
significantly higher than the monthly average for the year.
	   According to Art Horton, meteorologist from the National Weather
Service, the average high in July was 115.2 F (46.2 C) and the low
was 87 F (30 C). For August, the average high was 113.4 C (45.2 C)
and the low 85 F (29.4 C).
	   But winter weather is delightful. Last December, the numbers
were 65 F (18.3 C) and 38 F (3.3 C) and in January, 66 F (18 C) and
39 F (3.8 C).
	   The hottest days since 1961 when weather data was first recorded
were June 30, 1994, and July 14, 1972, when temperatures hit 128 F
(53.3 C). The coldest day was Jan. 30, 1988, when it was zero F (18
below zero C).
	   At the Furnace Creek Ranch Resort, Japanese tourists spill from
a sightseeing bus, unwind and settle in for the evening. It is 7
p.m. and the thermometer reads 115 F (46 C).
	   ``They want to see for themselves just how hot it is,'' says
Hiro Muriyama, a guide for Japan-based Sunflower Tours, whose group
was busy snapping photos of themselves in front of the thermometer.
``But once they get here, they want to know when they are
leaving.''
	   Park ranger Mark Neuweld says in the intense heat most people
limit their activity. But, in the early 1990s one man died,
presumably of heat stroke, while attempting to hike across the
bottom of Death Valley.
	   Ranger Charlie Callagan says about once a week they have a
visitor suffer symptoms of heat exhaustion.
	   ``We always say to bring plenty of water to drink, and drink
it,'' he says. ``Our staff has been trained to recognize the signs
of heat exhaustion. It is fairly common to see someone come in with
their face flushed red and with nausea.''
	   Many of the foreign tourists are visiting more than one park
during their trip. They may start off in Las Vegas and then drive
to the Grand Canyon, Zion National Park and on to Los Angeles,
Callagan says.
	   Down the road about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from the Furnace
Creek Ranch is the Furnace Creek Inn, an upscale, Spanish
villa-type hotel set in the midst of striking green palm trees.
``This is one of our busiest times of the year,'' says Furnace
manager Toni Jepson. ``They just keep coming and coming.''
	   Located in the center of the park, Furnace Creek serves as the
hub for Death Valley.
	   The Furnace Creek Ranch offers bungalow-style rooms. Next door
is the 49er Cafe, with the atmosphere of a 19th century saloon,
plus a more formal steak house. A general store stocks a selection
of munchies and souvenirs.
	   The Furnace Creek Inn sits on a bluff overlooking the salt
flats. The mission-style structure offers a fine-dining restaurant
and even massage service.

	   Furnace Creek is also home to the Death Valley Visitor Center,
which is open year-round.
	   Next door, the Borax Museum offers tourists a glimpse of the
wagons and tools used in the late 1800s to mine borax, the mineral
that is used as a flux, a cleansing agent, water softener,
preservative or fireproofing agent. The wagons and its 20-mule team
were made famous by the television series ``Death Valley Days.''
	   Just up Highway 178 from Badwater is the Devils Golf Course.
Devoid of grass and sand traps, these pockmarked mounds of salt
shaped by driving winds have plenty of holes.
	   Those brave enough to play golf on grass in the heat can tee off
at the Furnace Creek Golf Course, the lowest course in the world at
214 feet (65 meters) below sea level.
	   About five minutes from Furnace Creek is Zabriskie Point, which
offers breathtaking sunrise and sunset shots of the Amargosa
Mountains.
	   Then there's Artists Drive, a winding, one-way road that twists
through rocks splashed with red, green and yellow, like an artist's
palette.
	   Many head north to Scotty's Castle, about an hour's drive from
Furnace Creek.
	   Built in the 1920s by Chicago millionaire Albert Johnson, the
Spanish-style castle, replete with a guard tower, was named after
Walter Scott, Johnson's friend and longtime Death Valley character.
Guided tours of the castle are available.
	   Scattered around the north end of the park are more than a
half-dozen ghost towns, thrown up and then abandoned by miners.
	   Racetrack Valley, 28 miles (45 kilometers) of desert back
country, features the mystery of moving rocks, stones that wind and
erosion force to track along the cracked playa surface.
	   Heading west through the valley, Highway 190 leads through
Stovepipe Wells. A resort much smaller than Furnace Creek, it
offers a hotel, a general store and a ranger station.
	   About a mile (1.6 kilometers) farther are the sand dunes, their
wind-swept crests evoking images of the Sahara.
	   On your way out of the park on the western end, stop and grab a
bite at Panamint Springs before tackling the 5,000-foot
(1,524-meter) climb up Father Crawley Point.

Catskill Game Farm, a venerable showcase of exotic animals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL GORMLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CATSKILL, New York (AP) _ Perhaps the most striking thing about
the venerable Catskill Game Farm is what it isn't.
	   It isn't a multimillion dollar complex of faux Africa tours on
air-conditioned buses.
	   It doesn't have garish amusement park rides. It isn't
infiltrated by college kids in cartoon character suits.
	   The Catskill Game Farm is as earthy as the dusty path families
have walked for generations in the open-air animal showcase.
Neither seems to have changed much over the years.
	   In this first summer of Disney's dlrs 800 million Animal
Kingdom, the family owned game farm, now in its 65th year, echoes a
familiar primal call.
	   ``We want to keep that wholesome family feeling. We're trying to
take the Brady Bunch into the '90s,'' laughed Kathie Schulz, owner
of the game farm started by her father, Roland Lindmann, who died
in January at 91.
	   A colleague and close friend of television icon Marlen Perkins
of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom fame, Lindmann established the
game farm during Franklin Roosevelt's first term. He then spent
much of his life acquiring and caring for animals, even providing
animals to Paramount studios for movies.
	   ``My father carved the place out of the mountainside,'' said
Mrs. Schulz. ``We want to keep that family tradition ... we have
generation after generation returning, that's what you hear all
day.''
	   The game farm allows people to observe the behavior of 2,000
giraffes, water buffaloes, chimpanzees, lions, camels and more,
including snakes.
	   About 200,000 people make the picturesque trip through winding
Catskill roads each year to see up close the smooth skin of a pygmy
hippo, the techniclored plumage of exotic parrots, the soft hooves
of baby goats.
	   You hear the bray of Asian donkeys, the roar of lions, the
screech of monkeys.
	   Smaller crowds spread over an immense compound mean
up-to-the-fence looks at the huge rhinoceros and the small
pot-bellied pigs as well as zebras and other animals of almost
every stripe.
	   A child's 10,000th viewing of the Lion King video can't prepare
him or her for the close view of regal, golden lions at the game
farm. They lounge across a pit from spectators.
	   Another pit provides a moat for a huge rhino. A fence and deep
concrete ditch separate patrons from the mammoth mammal, but the
sheer immensity of the prehistoric-looking beast makes you grateful
for its severely limited leaping ability.
	   Few sites, however, seem to enchant patrons as much as the
petting and feeding areas. Baby sheep and pigs climb all over each
other to get to a warm bottle of milk. At a dollar a pop, the
bottles pay off in a memorable hands-on experience.
	   Crackers purchased at many spots along the way may be fed to
most of the animals through or over chain-link fences.
	   All this, a bear or elephant act, and a refreshingly limited
array of carnival rides (95 cents a twirl) comes with admission
prices that make the trip affordable.
	   General admission is dlrs 13.50, kids 4-11 years old cost dlrs
9.50 and tots 3 and younger are free. A family of four could buy
lunch at one of the food stands for about dlrs 15, but several
picnic areas mean the cost of the day can be cut with a little
planning and a big cooler.
	   Mrs. Schulz' daughter, Serena, is the game farm's public
relations director and her son, 14-year-old Christopher, has an eye
to becoming the next generation's owner.
	   ``He lives and breathes the game farm,'' Mrs. Schulz says, with
a smile.
	    &UR; ___

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ With their country in a deep financial
crisis and state coffers bare, Ecuador's Congress has voted to
slice taxes they pay on their wages in half.
	   The 121-member Congress, which took office one month ago, voted
to reduce the tax rate for legislators from 16 to 8 percent,
Congressman Enrique Campusano told reporters Friday.
	   Legislators earn dlrs 4,545 (25 million Sucres) a month. A
police officer in Ecuador earns about dlrs 150 a month.
	   The decision sparked anger from Ecuadoreans who have been asked
to tighten their belts by President Jamil Mahuad to prevent their
small Andean nation from going bankrupt.
	   Ecuador's crisis has been caused by the global financial crisis,
a ballooning budget deficit and falling prices for its main export,
oil, economists say.

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ As heavy rain subsided, relief teams
Friday flew to flooded southern Mexican villages which are isolated
by washed-out roads and breakdowns in radio communications.
	   The death toll _ officially 39 in Chiapas state _ was expected
to rise as reports trickled in from remote areas. At least 50
communities had no means of communication.
	   Though aid has been slow to reach flood victims desperate for
food and clean water, Chiapas Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen appealed
for calm and patience saying there would be enough aid.
	   Some 10,000 people have sought refuge in temporary shelters set
up across the southern state, Albores said late Thursday.
	   Eight days of rain in southern Mexico have wiped out roads and
bridges and sent homes tumbling downstream. The flooding was
believed to be the region's worst in at least half a century;
others called it Mexico's worst disaster since a 1985 earthquake
killed thousands in the capital.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Mudslides caused by heavy rains killed
seven people Friday and left at least five others missing in
western Guatemala near Mexico.
	   San Marcos state Gov. Oscar Barrios Flores ordered about 90
families to evacuate the area near Tajumulco, a volcanic region a
dozen miles from the Mexican border. Guatemalan firefighters and
soldiers were sent in to search for the missing.
	   San Marcos residents have reported numerous homes damaged by
flood waters and the loss of harvests and livestock.
	   ___
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian subsidiaries of Ford Motor
Company and General Motors said Friday they would halt production
to shrink inventories of unsold vehicles.
	   Ford said that its assembly line here will shut down for 12 days
starting Sept.28, with its 6,500 workers getting paid leave. The
plant produces 850 vehicles a day.
	   The automaker's press office said the production halt was an
effort ``to adjust production to demand.'' It refused to reveal the
size of its stock of unsold vehicles.
	   Since last November, slumping sales and large inventories have
forced Ford to stop production for a total of 70 days on four
separate occasions.
	   Domestic auto sales during the first eight of the year plummeted
25 percent compared to the same period in 1997, while output
decreased 17 percent, according to the National Association of
Vehicle Manufacturers.
	   ___
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ President Leonel
Fernandez has called a special cabinet meeting for Monday after
dozens of civilians, including a priest, were killed by police,
presidential aide Temistocles Montas said Friday.
	   On Thursday, the Senate had passed a resolution calling on the
President to make every effort to keep the sudden outbreak of this
week's violence from spreading.
	   The death of the Catholic priest was caused by the ``negligence
and malpractice'' of police who fired at him while searching for a
suspect, a police report published this week said.

Friend takes one-stroke lead after two rounds of Canadian Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OAKVILLE, Ontario (AP) _ The inner peace that Bob Friend first
experienced in May in the Byron Nelson Classic returned Friday in
the Canadian Open as he handled tough wind and wicked pin
placements for a 5-under-par 67 and a one-stroke lead.
	   Friend recovered from consecutive bogeys on his back nine to
finish two trips around Glen Abbey Golf Club in 8-under 136, one
stroke ahead of Billy Andrade.
	   ``The last few days have been good,'' Friend said. ``I've been
very relaxed and my mind has been very quiet over the ball.
Hopefully, it will continue.''
	   Chris DiMarco and Robert Damron, both looking for their first
PGA Tour victory, played without a bogey in the second round and
were at 6-under 138. DiMarco made eagle on the par-5 18th for a
7-under 65, the best score of the tournament, while Damron had a
67.
	   Ernie Els, trying to recover from a lost summer of back problems
by getting into the top 30 on the money list, went out in 40 and
missed the cut after 5-over 77, his worst round of the year. Els is
in jeopardy of missing the Tour Championship for the first time
since he joined the PGA Tour in 1994.
	   ``It just did not go my way,'' he said. ``This is tough to
swallow. I just wasn't patient enough.''
	   First-round leader Chris Smith followed a 66 with a 77 and was
at 143.
	   In his return to the PGA Tour after four years of wondering
whether he had the game to compete at the top level, Friend is
100th on the money list and appears to be in good shape to keep his
card.
	   ``My goal all year was to keep my card and not go back to that
torture test,'' he said, referring to qualifying school. ``For me,
the best way I could do it was to be very process-oriented _ work
on how to be relaxed, have fun, pick out a target and not worry
about the results.''
	   While he got away from that by missing the cut in nine of his
last 12 tournaments, he somehow kept his cool on a warm, blustery
day that again made the Abbey rock hard. Friend made birdies on all
four of the par-5s and got as low as 9-under before the two bogeys.
	   After missing the green on the downwind sixth hole for his first
bogey, he put his tee shot on the par-3 seventh on the left side of
a green that slopes severely to the front and is divided by a
ridge. He three-putted from 50 feet (15 meters), which wasn't too
surprising.
	   ``Everybody in the world will three-putt from back there,'' said
Hal Sutton, who did just that in his round of 69 that left him four
strokes back at 140.
	   ``Some of those pins were bordering on unfair,'' Damron said,
singling out the seventh hole and No. 6, where the pin was tucked 8
feet (2.4 meters) behind a bunker on a downslope. ``In fact, they
were unfair. But I parred them both, so I guess they were OK.''
	   It's the first time Friend has led a tournament at the halfway
point, although he has a history of dramatic finishes.
	   Andrade, struggling through his worst year since his rookie
season in 1988, remembers how nervous he felt the first couple of
times he went into a weekend in contention.
	   ``If you make it a big deal, you'll struggle,'' Andrade said.
``But if you realize it's just another round of golf, you'll be
fine. The more times you're leading a tournament, eventually you'll
pull through.''
	   That could work to Andrade's favor, since he can't remember the
last time he had a realistic chance to win.
	   ``I haven't been in the position I'm in for a long time,'' he
said. ``But I've been there before.''
	   He stayed there Friday by also making birdies on all the par-5s,
and hanging onto his round when his driving left him down the
stretch. Over a stretch of four holes, the only fairway Andrade
came close to hitting was No. 6, when his tee shot hit the bottom
of a tree and ricocheted into the fairway.
	   ``I was fortunate enough to make some birdies and hang in
there,'' he said.
	   That will be the chore facing Friend this weekend.

What does future hold for movie star whale?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos ICE102-104 &QL; 
 &UR; By BRAD CAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEIMAEY, Iceland (AP) _ When Keiko the whale lived in a concrete
pool in Oregon, one of his favorite pastimes was watching TV _
especially wrestling matches.
	   He also loved mugging for children who squeezed into an
underwater viewing area to catch a glimpse of the whale who starred
in the 1993 movie ``Free Willy.''
	   But after nearly two decades surrounded by adoring crowds, Keiko
now finds himself in an isolated sea pen, with only a handful of
trainers and the sights, sounds and smells of the sea for company.
	   Will this pampered orca successfully make the transition from
couch potato to creature of the wild? And will a country that views
killer whales as commonplace now market this one as a tourist
attraction?
	   Tune in later.
	   A day after his much-ballyhooed return to his native waters,
Keiko seemed to be adjusting Friday to his new home _ a
250-foot-long (75-meter-long), 30-foot-wide (9-meter-wide) pen in a
bay surrounded by towering volcanic cliffs.
	   Keiko swam gracefully around the netted enclosure and, on a cue
from a trainer, leapt partially out of the water and fell backward
with a big splash.
	   ``He's looking very confident. He's not tentative at all about
his new home,'' said Diane Hammond, spokeswoman for the Free Willy
Keiko Foundation, which owns the whale and arranged his move to
Iceland.
	   When Friday's training session ended, Keiko glided over to the
side where photographers sat snapping his picture. He lingered for
several minutes, curiously eyeing the photographers, before
swimming off.
	   Keiko's seeming affinity for humans gives ammunition to critics
who say the goal of eventually releasing him to the open ocean is a
potentially cruel experiment.
	   ``This is an animal that has spent his entire life in the
company of human beings. I would think he's an extremely bad
candidate for return to the wild,'' said Fred Jacobs, spokesman for
the Busch Entertainment Corp., which operates Sea World theme
parks.
	   Dr. Lanny Cornell, Keiko's chief veterinarian, concedes the
whale did seem to enjoy watching the crowds at the Oregon Coast
Aquarium, as well as TV shows that featured lots of action. Keiko
was able to watch TV by looking through an underwater window of an
office that had a large-screen TV.
	   But, Cornell is still convinced Keiko will be happy once he's
shed most of the human trappings in his life.
	   ``What he misses by not being able to see people at the
underwater windows, he's going to more than make up by seeing
dolphins and whales and millions of birds overhead every day,'' he
said.
	   Prospects also are good that Keiko will gain a new friend when a
pod of whales passes by, Cornell said.
	   There's no doubt Keiko no longer will be able to enjoy the
company of children.
	   In his new setting, he will be visible to children only by two
telescopes set up across the bay. Children also could see Keiko
from an excursion boat, but for security reasons no boats will be
allowed to come within 100 feet (30 meters) of the pen.

Swissair wins praise for its handling of crash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARE NULLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ When Flight 111 crashed into the northern Atlantic
last week, Swissair helped get journalists to the crash area, put
its top executives on television and made caring for victims'
families a priority.
	   The response contrasted with that of TWA two summers ago, when
its Flight 800 crashed off Long Island. The American airline was
criticized at the time for being insensitive to families, for
giving top priority to investigating a terrorist attack and for
being secretive with the press.
	   ``Swissair dealt with this much better than TWA,'' said Richard
George of the New York-based Public Relations Society of America.
	   The airline made quick and open communications with the media a
top priority _ second only to caring for relatives of the crash's
229 victims.
	   The airline arranged for rapid transport, police protection and
cash payments for families wanting to grieve at the site of the
accident near the Canadian village of Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia.
	   But it also chartered planes to ensure that journalists could
reach the area and used its public relations firm to help smooth
things on the ground.
	   Swissair and manufacturers Boeing have already been served with
a dlrs 50 million lawsuit by former boxing champion Jake LaMotta,
who lost his son. The lawsuit claims the companies should have
known about wiring problems on the MD-11 aircraft _ a possible
cause of the accident _ and did little to correct them.
	   In any case, Swissair is well insured. Investors are therefore
not unduly worried and the company's shares have remained
relatively stable.
	   ``The fact they handled everything so professionally helped
restore consumer and investor confidence,'' said Janet Kinzler,
European airline analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in London.
	   As soon as news of the crash broke, the company's top management
appeared on live news conferences beamed around the world.
	   ``We have an emergency plan, of which communications are a very
important part,'' said Swissair spokesman Peter Gutknecht. ``The
basis is to say everything we know as quickly as possible, and only
give out the facts.''
	   Jeffrey Katz, the American CEO of Swissair, traveled to Halifax
to be on the spot.
	   Philippe Bruggisser, chief of the parent SAir Group, made
repeated appearances on television, wearing a black ribbon on his
lapel and choking back his emotions.
	   At Swissair's Zurich headquarters, 12 people worked around the
clock in the press department to field thousands of inquiries. In
New York, the public relations firm Hill &AMP; Knowlton helped with the
overload of queries coming into Swissair's U.S. offices. The firm
has a regular contract with Swissair.
	   In recent months, Swissair had trained more than 200 counselors
to help relatives. The effort was part of a family assistance plan
submitted to U.S. authorities in June to comply with legislation
passed to correct the TWA mistakes.

Ruling party wins most seats in local elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The ruling People's National Party won
more than twice as many seats as its main opposition in local
government elections Thursday that were marked mostly by voter
apathy.
	   In partial results, the People's National Party won 84 electoral
divisions while the opposition Jamaica Labour Party won 36. Final
results were not available in another 21 divisions, the Jamaica
Gleaner newspaper reported Friday in its electronic edition.
	   The New Democratic Movement, a political party organized in
1996, boycotted the vote.
	   One poll worker was slightly injured when a policeman's shotgun
went off accidentally and a pellet ricocheted off a building and
hit her. And a Labour candidate, Nicolayan Robinson, 33, of
Flankers, was arrested by police and accused of trying to buy
votes, the Gleaner reported.
	   But unlike general elections in Jamaica, which are marked by
rabid participation that sometimes spills over into violence, most
voters yawned Thursday. Many voting stations reported very light
turnout and some predicted less than 30 percent of registered
voters would actually cast ballots.
	   The election itself was years overdue.
	   Local government elections are supposed to be held every three
years but the vote has been postponed several times as the
political parties considered electoral reform measures.
	   The last previous vote for the local offices took place in 1990.

Death toll in Mexico flooding rises to more than 100

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ The skies have cleared, but the clean
up has just begun as authorities begin counting the dead from the
worst flooding to hit southern Mexico in two generations.
	   The sun finally broke through rain clouds on Friday, giving
relief teams the first chance in days to fly to flooded villages.
The death toll in Chiapas state rose to more than 100, 20,000
people have been forced from their homes and nearly 500,000 are cut
off by washed-out roads and downed bridges, Interior Secretary
Francisco Labastida said in Mexico City.
	   ``A situation this serious, this severe has not occured in
Chiapas in almost 50 years,'' said Labastida, who is in charge of
domestic security. At least 50 Chiapas communities had no means of
communication.
	   In Pijijiapan, one of the worst-hit towns, Guadalupe Saucedo
Vidal sat outside a cemetery waiting to bury the decaying, yellowed
body of her daughter-in-law.
	   Eleven of the elderly woman's relatives, including her husband,
are missing and the body of another was recently found. Her
2-year-old granddaughter, Elda, is the only one she has left,
Saucedo said.
	   The woman's home washed away early Wednesday, leaving behind
nothing.
	   ``It sounded like a train when the roar came at 1 o'clock.
Everything went under,'' she said.
	   Eight days of rain _ from storms in the Pacific and the Gulf of
Mexico _ caused flooding believed to be the region's worst in at
least half a century; others called it Mexico's worst disaster
since a 1985 earthquake killed thousands in the capital.
	   More than a dozen people were reported dead in the states of
Nayarit, Jalisco, Sinaloa, Guanajuato and Oaxaca.
	   With Chiapas' road system broken by surging rivers and
mudslides, the government sent aid into Guatemala to be carried
back north by truck.
	   The Tapachula airport bustled with activity. Crews unloaded
boxes of aid from a half-dozen military cargo planes. A dozen
helicopters stood ready to ferry the supplies to affected regions.
	   Some 10,000 people have sought refuge in temporary shelters set
up across the southern state.
	   But the problem is not limited to those in shelters, President
Ernesto Zedillo said.
	   ``We are talking about a problem of half a million people,'' he
said late Thursday after flying over the region. ``We are talking
about a problem of a much greater magnitude _ practically of all
the habitants in the zone.''
	   The Red Cross appealed for volunteers and donations. Political
parties and private groups collected food, medicine, water and
clothing in Mexico City.
	   Federal prosecutors said they would take emergency measures to
keep merchants in Chiapas from price-gouging and to guarantee
enough goods reach the state.
	   The shortage of drinking water raised concern about potential
epidemics. Health Ministry specialists flew to Tapachula from
across the country Friday.
	   To the north in the state of Guerrero, storms continued to soak
mountain communities Friday. More than 10,000 people were affected
by flooding, Guerrero state authorities said.
	   In Guatemala, 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Tapachula,
mudslides killed seven people and left five others missing in San
Marcos state Friday. The government ordered nearly 90 families to
evacuate the area near Tajumulco.
	   A hot sun beat down through patches of clouds over Tapachula on
Friday, but the impact of the days of rain remained obvious. A
flight over the area revealed broad rivers merging into muddy
swamps, where rooftops peaked out. Fields were flooded and rivers
traversed roads.
	   Friday's improving weather allowed air force helicopters to fly
Huixtla, Mapastepec, Tonala and Pijijiapan, the government news
agency Notimex reported.
	   At least 18 deaths have been confirmed in Pijijiapan, some 90
miles (145 kilometers) north of Tapachula. With phone service
spotty, families were desperate for news from the town.
	   Little was known about a 100-mile (160-mile) stretch of
coastline between Tonala and Huixtla, the area including
Pijijiapan, because swollen rivers have cut the region's highway.
	   Just south of Tonala, army crews worked to divert the course of
a river in order to rebuild a fallen bridge. Civilians climbed onto
military tractors to cross the river and continue on to Pijijiapan
on foot or bicycle.
	   Miguel Ponce Rodriguez left work in Puebla state to reach his
wife and three children in Pijijiapan. He waited to cross the river
Friday, prepared to make the last 40 miles on a child-sized orange
bike.
	   ``I'm very dejected. I feel very bad,'' he said, on the verge of
tears.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Divers on Friday recovered the
cockpit voice recorder from Swissair Flight 111 _ an important find
that could help investigators learn why the jet plummeted into the
Atlantic nine days ago.
	   Together with the flight data recorder, which records the
flight's mechanical data and was retrieved Sunday, the devices may
shed some light onto the cause of the wreck that killed all 229
people aboard.
	   The voice box was found 180 feet (55 meters) below the ocean
surface around 7 p.m. (2200 GMT) Friday, near the spot where the
data recorder had been found five days earlier, transportation
officials said.
	   Although investigators already have a transcript of the
conversation between the Swissair pilots and air traffic
controllers, the cockpit voice recorder may have picked up
additional conversation between the two pilots, or irregular noises
in the aircraft.
	   Stored in a box of fresh water to help preserve it, the voice
box was sent to Ottawa on Friday for analysis. Its condition was
not immediately known, transportation board officials said.
	   Investigators have said the full transcripts of the tape would
not be released to protect the privacy of the pilots.
	   Divers had been searching simultaneously for the box and for
remains of victims of the Geneva-bound MD-11, when the discovery
was made.
	   Late Thursday, divers recovered remains of passengers from the
bottom of the ocean floor. The 22 divers, who can spend just 30
minutes combing the Atlantic floor at any one time, carried the
remains to the surface in bags.
	   It was the first time remains had been recovered from the ocean
floor. Until then, body parts had been only found floating on the
surface of the Atlantic or washed up on the shore.
	   Out of respect for the families of the victims, authorities
wouldn't say how many passengers may have been represented among
the recovered remains. Rick Town, commander of the Canadian navy
supply ship Preserver, said even a guess was impossible.
	   So far, only four victims have been identified out of the
remains recovered so far. The cause of the crash has not been
determined.
	   Flight 111, which originated in New York, lost contact with air
traffic controllers six minutes before it crashed into the Atlantic
on Sept. 2.
	   Divers said they had been focusing their search on the victims,
although the voice recorder box was also a top priority.
	   ``People come first,'' said Stan Ferguson, superintendent of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police, just hours before the voice box was
found. ``To overlook the recovery of human remains is not right.''
	   Swiss police Friday sent Canadian authorities the results of
blood tests taken from the family members of flight victims to help
identify remains. The blood tests will help in the construction of
DNA profiles.
	   The police also gathered information relating to victims'
personal belongings, documents and fingerprints.
	   The USS Grapple, which helped with the undersea recovery of
wreckage of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island in 1996, began
preparations to lift the mangled jet from the ocean depths, perhaps
early next week.
	   Military spokesmen said the fuselage and other parts will not be
hoisted until the human remains have been retrieved.
	   Memorial services for victims were held Friday in Geneva,
Zurich, New York City and at the United Nations.
	   ``The tragedy of Halifax has just sadly reminded of the
fragility of our life and the absurdity of our frantic
lifestyles,'' Swiss President Flavio Cotti said at the service in
Geneva.
	   The U.N. service honored eight workers and one former employee
who were killed in the crash.
	   ``We share your grief all the more because the deaths of these
nine exceptional people on a flight so familiar to many of us that
we called it the U.N. airbus, come as a deep blow to their other
family, too _ that which we call the United Nations family,''
Secretary-General Kofi Annan told families of the victims at a
service at the United Nations.
	   At the end of the one-hour service, Annan presented a folded
blue U.N. flag to each family. One woman kissed her flag and hugged
it tightly as she cried.
	   In New York, about 1,000 people solemnly gathered in homage to
the victims of the crash.
	   ``We commemorate this day for these persons we loved and lost.
... We recollect the sound of a voice, the touch of a hand, the
uniqueness of a smile,'' said the Very Rev. Harry H. Prichett, Jr.,
of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. ``We're here to share the
pain that pierced the life left behind.''
	   The attendees, some with small children in tow and all clutching
white roses, barely stirred. Occasionally, a handkerchief was
raised to wipe a tear.
	   The memorial service, at Lincoln Center, also was addressed by
representatives of the victims' families and the Swiss government
and other clergy.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix style on slug. Stands for
 &UR; Clinton strategy: Express sorrow, hit hard &QL; 
 &UR; With US-Clinton-Starr Report &QL; 
 &UR; By RON FOURNIER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Political Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton promised over breakfast
that he would wage a ``vigorous defense'' against impeachment. By
lunchtime, he was dominating airwaves with a report accusing
prosecutors of ``dangerously overreaching.''
	   Ahead on TV and on the Internet, too, the president and his
backers were lightning quick Friday in challenging Independent
Counsel Kenneth's Starr's report of possibly impeachable offenses.
Their rebuttal landed at Capitol Hill offices and on the Internet
an hour before Congress unsealed Starr's report.
	   Hit quick. Hit hard. Hit often. It's an old Clinton strategy
that he hopes will carry him through the most perilous chapter of
his bumpy political career.
	   The president is trying to avoid a stampede of Democratic
desertions, raise questions about Starr's report and trap
Republicans in partisan games.
	   ``We're going to engage and get our information out, based on
the facts,'' said presidential adviser Doug Sosnik. ``When we've
had a chance to fully read and digest the report we plan on
fighting it.''
	   One great unknown, aides say, is how the public will react to
the sordid details of the Monica Lewinsky affair. Polls have
indicated for months that voters don't care much about the
president's sex life, but advisers worry that Americans really
consider the dirty details more relevant than they admit.
	   Clinton supporters hope to turn any such revulsion against
Starr, calling the report a salacious summary by a prying
prosecutor. ``The amount of lurid, graphic detail here far exceeds
any legitimate justification,'' Clinton attorney David Kendall told
reporters.
	   Supporters also will say the sexual narrative underscores a key
White House argument: This is all about sex, not impeachment.
	   Any White House strategy starts with Clinton, who must now show
Americans that he is deeply sorry and on the road to repentance.
	   In an emotional speech over breakfast with religious leaders,
Clinton apologized to Ms. Lewinsky for the first time Friday. ``I
have sinned,'' he said. ``I have repented.'' He promised to seek
pastoral support and the help of others.
	   Close friends have told the president that psychological
counseling would be an appropriate step. One confidant said Clinton
does not intend to do that.
	   The second most critical figure in White House strategy is
Hillary Rodham Clinton. The first lady has told advisers she is in
no mood to go before TV cameras, in part because she doesn't think
such a public show of support is necessary to her husband's
political survival.
	   Some Clinton advisers disagree. They hope to stabilize the
political landscape this weekend, and persuade Mrs. Clinton to go
public as early as next week.
	   First, they must take the sting out of Starr's report. That
started with the pre-emptive strike by Kendall, who issued a
rebuttal before seeing Starr's report. At every point, he tried to
minimize the sweeping and detailed case by Starr.
	   He said the allegations were old news: Clinton has already
admitted that he had sex with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   He said it was overblown: Lying about an affair and trying to
keep it secret makes Clinton an adulterer, not a criminal.
	   And he said impeachment was serious business: A lurid affair
``is not a high crime or misdemeanor.''
	   After getting the report, lawyers and advisers scoured the
document for any sign that Starr had overstated his case _ a tactic
Clinton has used over the years to survive controversies.
	   One possible soft spot: While Starr alleges that the effort to
find a job for Ms. Lewinsky amounted to obstruction of justice, his
report says she approached Clinton for help in finding a job _ as
opposed to Clinton coming to her with a job proposal. Aides planned
to mine the report for weak spots Friday night, and release another
response Saturday.
	   All this ammunition was passed along during conference calls
between the White House and surrogates across the country who will
defend Clinton on TV and radio all weekend. Even if the onslaught
doesn't change anybody's opinion of the president, supporters hope
the information overload muddies the water enough to buy Clinton
time.
	   On Capitol Hill, presidential aides and senior Democrats still
siding with Clinton are telling House Democrats that it's in their
political interest to give the president the benefit of the doubt.
Their argument: If Clinton is weakened or removed by scandal, the
Democratic Party will suffer at the ballot box in November. Fewer
senators are up for re-election, so they're tougher sells.
	   Vice President Al Gore has put two of his top aides at Clinton's
service, ordering them to help shore up support among Democrats.
	   Republicans are another target. Trying to make GOP leaders look
partisan, the White House sought a sneak preview of the report and
said Republicans unfairly rejected the request.
	   The White House was trying to line up senior Democratic
lawmakers to make the argument this weekend that while Clinton's
actions are disgusting and deserving of censure or reprimand,
impeachment is not warranted.
	   Clinton plans to hire two or three new aides to help handle his
defense in Congress.
	   Press secretary Mike McCurry said the new staff ``would help the
president with our basic strategy, which is to make the strongest
possible case that there has not been an impeachable offense
here.''

 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ It was the most humiliating day of Bill
Clinton's presidency.
	   The stained blue dress. Telephone sex. Oval Office intimacies.
All that and more, spelled out in lurid detail in a report alleging
11 grounds for impeaching the president, including perjury and
obstruction of justice.
	   After nine months of intense investigation, Clinton's future now
rests with an anxious Congress facing re-election in just 54 days.
Lawmakers have not confronted the explosive idea of presidential
impeachment in 24 years _ indeed, it has arisen only twice in
history _ and there is no certain roadmap for them to follow. The
most likely scenario calls for public hearings next year.
	   The most immediate test will come Monday when lawmakers return
to town after a weekend of talking with constituents back home. The
White House will be watching closely to see if prominent Democrats
follow the lead of Sens. Joseph Lieberman and Daniel Patrick
Moynihan to denounce Clinton's conduct.
	   ``These are not issues that Congress has ever had to face
before,'' said Columbia University historian Alan Brinkley. I'm
sure that not any member of Congress is eager to discuss them.'' He
said that throughout the nation's presidential history, ``I can't
think of a day that would be more personally humiliating than this
salacious description of these tawdry acts.''
	   For all the talk since January, the report adds graphic
descriptions that may make Americans recoil and question Starr's
aggressiveness. Starr argues the detail was necessary because
Clinton had denied having an affair.
	   Dr. Debra English, a doctor at a health clinic in Warrenton,
Georgia, had the report on the Internet and was disturbed by the
release of the seamy details.
	   ``I just hate to see the presidency laughed at like this, made a
joke of,'' said English, a Republican who thinks Clinton should
resign. ``But it's pretty disgusting. We already know he had sex,
he admitted it, but you don't have to have this picture in your
mind. ...''
	   Polls show Americans thought all along that Clinton had an
affair and lied about it. And they want to put the matter to rest.
But Starr's report will force the nation to grapple again with the
subject.
	   ``The public now has no choice but to make up its mind,'' said
Republican pollster Frank Luntz.
	   ``It's no longer hypothetical. It's no longer up for debate. The
only thing open for debate now is how the president will be held
accountable.''
	   Democrats are nervous about polls suggesting that Clinton's
behavior has demoralized Democratic voters and that they will stay
home on Nov. 3. Republicans increasingly hope Clinton will lead his
party to the biggest electoral disaster since 1974 when Republicans
were vanquished after Richard Nixon's forced resignation.
	   ``This is the quintessential political seesaw,'' Luntz said.
``Only one end can remain up. It will be either congressional
Democrats or the president, but both can't survive.''
	   The White House struck back at Starr's report with a rebuttal
arguing that the whole case was about sex and that Clinton had
apologized for that. The administration theme is that the president
broke his marriage vows, not his presidential vows. The graphic
details in Starr's report were intended to ``humiliate the
president and force him from office,'' the report said. The White
House insisted Clinton would not resign.
	   Hillary Rodham Clinton, humiliated by her husband, stood at his
side and praised his work at a fund-raising dinner Thursday night
and was alongside him again at three public appearances on Friday.
The message seemed to be that if she can forgive him, why can't the
rest of the country?
	   Historian Brinkley said the talk of resignation and impeachment
``creates a momentum that is hard to stop. I don't think in the end
Congress is going to have the stomach to impeach and convict him.
But certainly there will be hearings and testimony that will be a
very painful thing for the president and probably for everybody
watching it.''

Hingis, Davenport reach U.S. Open final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs to UPDATE with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Lindsay Davenport never was a child tennis star,
a can't-miss kid like Venus Williams or Martina Hingis. Now, after
beating Williams in the semifinals, she takes on Hingis with a
chance for a U.S. Open championship.
	   The second-seeded Davenport used power and poise to reach her
first Grand Slam final. Top-seeded Hingis joined her there by
taking advantage of an opponent's third-set collapse.
	   Saturday's final between the world's top two players will be a
chance for Davenport, who has a 5-6 career record against
Switzerland's Hingis, to make up for all the times she was
overlooked as a youngster.
	   ``No one ever said anything about me,'' Davenport said. ``I was
never a prodigy, I was never going to be any good.''
	   Davenport clapped her left hand on her racket to celebrate her
6-4, 6-4 win over an error-ridden Williams in an all-American
semifinal Friday. Davenport was 0-3 in previous Grand Slam semis,
including a loss to Hingis at the U.S. Open a year ago.
	   ``It was relief, it was happiness, it was joy obviously getting
to my first final. Really just almost like you can't believe it,''
she said. ``No one ever said when I was growing up I was ever going
to be any good or get to a Grand Slam final. I think I've proven a
lot of people wrong.''
	   Davenport needed just 72 minutes to win over Williams, who lost
beads from her hair on the court and lost her touch against an
opponent who simply was too steady. Williams had twice as many
errors as winners, 26-13.
	   Williams, a losing finalist to Hingis at the U.S. Open last
year, had seven dresses designed for her run through the tournament
_ one for each round, including the final.
	   ``I think I'm deeply saddened that I didn't have the opportunity
to wear my seventh dress,'' she said of the red, white and blue
outfit. ``I'm actually going to put that one in a coffin and bury
it.''
	   Williams had lost the first set of her quarterfinal match
against Spain's Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario on Wednesday night, then
turned up the power as she rallied to victory. But that didn't work
against the equally powerful Davenport.
	   Hingis won 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 over Jana Novotna, who thought a
Wimbledon title finally would drive away her demons but encountered
them again as she blew a big third-set lead.
	   The Czech Republic's Novotna was leading 4-1 in the final set,
just six points from winning the match and dethroning Hingis as No.
1 in the world, when her game collapsed. She missed several easy
shots and won just four of the final 22 points.
	   After her 50th unforced error settled into the net on match
point, Novotna stood with hands on hips at the baseline in
disbelief. She had 20 unforced errors in the final set _ one more
than Hingis made in the entire match.
	   ``I made mistakes for different reasons,'' said Novotna, who has
talked repeatedly of how the Wimbledon victory boosted her
confidence. ``I can't explain it. You never know why it happens.''
	   Hingis' 76-week reign as No. 1 had been in danger. If she had
lost, either Novotna or Davenport would have replaced her as No. 1
by winning the U.S. Open.
	   ``I was fighting for my No. 1 spot. She didn't miss anything in
the first set,'' Hingis said. ``Because we're doubles partners, I
know her weaknesses and she knows mine. I lost some stupid games.''
	   Hingis had lost in the semifinals of the previous two Grand Slam
tournaments, losing to Monica Seles at the French Open and to
Novotna at Wimbledon. She thought of those losses during the
changeover before her third-set rally began.
	   ``I was down 4-1 and sitting in the chair, saying, `No way I
lose again in the semis. At least I've got to make the final,'''
Hingis said.
	   Hingis didn't play like the world's top player in the first set,
spraying balls long and wide while losing four straight service
games. Frustrated by her poor play, Hingis slammed her racket into
the net after losing one point and pounded the ball into the court
after another.
	   But Hingis dominated in the second set, winning 12 points in a
row midway through the set as she began coming to the net more and
dictating play.
	   Hingis' wildness returned in the third set, and Novotna took
advantage with breaks in the first and fifth games to go up 4-1.
The third-seeded Novotna made several acrobatic shoetop volleys and
delicate drop shots as she took the lead.
	   The score was 30-30 in the next game, putting Novotna just six
points from victory, when the collapse began. Included in Novotna's
misses was an easy forehand volley she hit about 10 feet (three
meters) long.
	   ``In the third set, I was up 4-1. From that moment on, I missed
too many approaches, too many volleys,'' Novotna said. ``You have
to continue playing well. I was missing too many balls.''
	   Novotna began the summer with a reputation as a choker, a top
player burdened by past failures.
	   Her biggest collapse was in the 1993 Wimbledon final, when she
led Steffi Graf 4-1 in the third set and blew an easy volley that
would have given her a 5-1 lead. After Novotna lost, she cried on
the Duchess of Kent's shoulder.
	   At the 1995 French Open, Novotna lost to Chanda Rubin after
having a match point and a 5-0 lead in the third set.
	   That reputation seemed to be receding into history after her
Wimbledon championship. But now the semifinals of the 1998 U.S.
Open will be added to her list of failures.
	   ``I was down two service breaks, but I knew I would be playing
with the wind,'' Hingis said, ``and I saw Jana wasn't in the best
shape and I was just trying to get the ball in the game.''

Stolle and Suk take men's doubles title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The men's doubles title at the U.S. Open went to
a duo with good tennis genes who got help from some basic mistakes
by their foes.
	   Sandon Stolle and Cyril Suk defeated Mark Knowles of the Bahamas
and Daniel Nestor of Canada, 4-6, 7-6 (10-8), 6-4.
	   Stolle, the son of former Australian star Fred Stolle, and Suk,
brother of one-time Czech standout Helena Sukova, held off match
points in the second-set tiebreaker. On one of the match points, a
Knowles volley was just wide.
	   ``I crossed and he missed a reflex volley by maybe an inch and a
half,'' Stolle said.
	   Then Nestor touched the net while hitting a shot that would have
set up another match point for his team.
	   ``I think that was the biggest point,'' Stolle said. ``He never
hit the net before ever, so we got a lucky break.''
	   ``I knew I hit the net,'' Nestor said. ``I was shocked that I
hit it. I didn't know I was that close to the net.''
	   Fred Stolle won doubles titles at all four Grand Slam
tournaments, including three of four in 1965. Helena Sukova won 10
Grand Slam doubles tournaments, five in mixed and five in women's.
Suk has teamed with his sister to win a French and two Wimbledon
mixed doubles titles.
	   --- &QC; 
	    &UR; MCENROES TOGETHER AGAIN: John and Pat McEnroe are scheduled to
be part of the U.S. Team in the Nations Senior Cup next February in
Punta del Este, Uruguay.
	   Eight nations are set to compete, with John McEnroe's old
nemesis, Bjorn Borg, scheduled to play for the Swedish team with
Mats Wilander and Joakim Nystrom
	   The McEnroes will be teamed with Mel Purcell,
	   Other teams scheduled to play include France, with Yannick Noah;
Spain, with Emilio Sanchez; Argentina; Brazil; Uruguay; and a
special South American team with former French Open champion Andres

Summerhays takes first-round lead in Comfort Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Bruce Summerhays had nine birdies in an
8-under-par 64 Friday and held a one-stroke lead over four golfers
after the first round of the Senior PGA Tour's Comfort Classic at
the Brickyard Crossing.
	   Summerhays had a 31 on the back nine, which included his only
bogey but six of the birdies.
	   The 64 was one stroke off J.C. Snead's year-old course record
and left Summerhays one stroke in front of Terry Dill, Simon
Hobday, George Archer and Bobby Stroble.
	   Stroble had two eagles and two birdies to tie the course record
with a 30 on the back nine.
	   Hale Irwin, the senior tour's money leader who has traded
victories with Gil Morgan much of the season, was one of five
players who were at 66. That group included Hubert Green, who used
a 5-iron to ace No. 7, a 173-yard (158-meter) par-3. Morgan and
four others shot 67s. In all, 23 players were within four shots of
the lead.
	   ``I think people like to see birdies,'' Summerhays said. ``The
fairways were fast, the greens are not hard, and the wind was
negligible. It was a perfect day for great scores.''
	   Summerhays birdied three of the first five holes, and added
another on 10 before a ``fat 7-iron'' cost him a bogey at 11. But
he birdied Nos. 12, 13 and 15, and finished with birdies on the
last two holes. It was his lowest round of the year.
	   ``It was one of those days that come, well, once in a year,''
Summerhays said. ``When you have greens like these where you have
to place the ball, I like that. It's more of a challenge. You have
to get your putting going.''
	   Defending champion David Graham struggled to a painful 75, then
hinted at withdrawing as he did last week when he strained a chest
muscle at the Emerald Coast Classic.
	   ``I feel terrible,'' Graham said. ``Quite frankly, I shouldn't
be here, and I may leave yet. It's really affecting my game.''
	   Dana Quigley, the winner of the Emerald Coast Classic, was eight
shots back at 72.
	   Of the 78 players who teed off Friday, 48 had sub-par rounds,
prompting Irwin to say, ``If you didn't birdie every hole out
there, you felt like you were behind.''

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A referee is suing Brazilian
soccer star Bebeto after he allegedly insulted him during a match,
according to a news report Friday.
	   Alvaro Quelhas claimed the striker called him a ``thief'' after
he awarded a penalty against his side, Botafogo, last March, said
the news agency Sport Press.
	   Botafogo lost the game, part of an annual regional Rio
tournament, against Flamengo 3-0.
	   ``I can't let this pass,'' Quelhas reportedly said. He is suing
for US dlrs 24,000 (39,000 Brazilian reals), the agency said.
Bebeto denies the accusation.

Bosnia's second post-war national election crucial to peace plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ An election crucial to
democracy building begins Saturday two years after the end of
Bosnia-Herzegovina's war, with voters choosing between hard-line
candidates and moderates favored by Western powers.
	   The two-day election is the second for national leaders since
the 1995 Dayton peace agreement halted the 3 1-2-year war and set
up two ethnic-based entities _ a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat
federation _ with the goal of slowly forcing a democratic evolution
in the former Yugoslav republic.
	   Western allies led by the United States and European Union, who
run the country now under the Dayton plan, hope ethnic-driven
political parties that waged the war will lose support this weekend
and fade away.
	   But ethnic separatist sentiments remain strong among Bosnian
Serbs and Bosnian Croats, and the outcome of major races involving
their candidates were uncertain as campaigning ended Thursday.
	   A total of 83 candidates, parties and coalitions are on the
complicated ballots, with voters only choosing leaders in the
entity in which they registered. More than 2.7 million of Bosnia's
4.3 million people are registered.
	   More than 30,000 NATO-led troops, mostly from the United States
and Europe, impose security in Bosnia as international officials in
charge try to use Dayton to force the country toward European
integration.
	   Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic, one of the nation's
three-member presidency under the Dayton accord setup, was expected
to easily win re-election.
	   The races for the Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat members of the
presidency looked much tighter, with the results certain to
influence how much further progress is made in adopting the Dayton
requirements.
	   International officials complain the Bosnian Serb member of the
presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik, has obstructed efforts to implement
the peace plan and openly oppose his re-election. Krajisnik was a
close aide to Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader who
is now the No. 1 war crimes suspect in the country.
	   Because the three-member presidency has often failed to agree on
policy issues, due to lingering hatred and mistrust, the European
overseer of Bosnia _ High Representative Carlos Westendorp _ has
been given what amounts to absolute power to force decisions on the
panel.
	   That has brought measures aimed at moving Bosnia toward
operating as a single nation, something Krajisnik and his fervently
Serbian nationalist party and allies oppose.
	   To them, the Bosnian Serb republic is a separate entity in
Bosnia with stronger ties to Yugoslavia than the Muslim-Croat
federation.
	   Krajisnik's main opponent is Zivko Radisic of the moderate
Harmony coalition, which has adopted a pro-Dayton stance to gain
support from Western powers.
	   The race for the Bosnian Croat seat on the presidency is between
incumbent Kresimir Zubak, a moderate who broke away from the
hard-line Croatian Democratic Union of his opponent, Ante Jelavic.
	   Voters also will choose a national parliament, along with
separate parliaments in each entity. In the Bosnian Serb republic,
voters will also select a new republic president, with former
hard-liner Biljana Plavsic running for re-election against
Krajisnik ally Nikola Poplasen.

German fined for operating illegal Yukon tour group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WHITEHORSE (AP) _ A German citizen charged with operating an
illegal touring company in the Yukon has been fined Canadian dlrs
1,500.
	   Wolfgang Richard Bublitz, 38, of Schopfheim, Germany, was picked
up by the police last month for conducting adventure tours in the
territory without authorization.
	   After receiving a tip, Mounties found Bublitz at a campsite on
the Teslin River last month with a group of Germans.
	   This was Bublitz's third trip as a guide, his lawyer, Scott
Niblock, said during the trial earlier this week.
	   During the trial, Bublitz admitted to collecting money for plane
tickets, food and guiding supplies for German tourists interested
in the territory.
	   However, Niblock said Bublitz was not working for a profit and
was only interested in showing fellow Germans the beauty of the
Yukon.
	   Upon payment of the fine, Bublitz's passport will be returned
and he will be deported.

England's Rolph sets Commonwealth record in heats as swimming

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ England's Sue Rolph stunned
herself with a Commonwealth 100-meter freestyle record in the
opening event of the swimming program at the Games pool Saturday.
	   Rolph, who held the record jointly with compatriot Karen
Pickering at 55.79 seconds, clocked 55.65 in her heat.
	   ``I nearly had a heart attack when I looked up the board,''
Rolph said. ``I love it when that happens, to go so fast and you're
not expecting it.''
	   The English swimmer said she was confident of going even faster
in Saturday night's final, where her main opposition will come from
Australia's Sarah Ryan (56.57) and Susie O'Neill (56.61).
	   But on the form of the heat, where she defeated O'Neill
head-to-head, Rolph declared, ``there's definitely more to come.''
	   ``I feel brill (brilliant), and I always swim faster at night,''
Rolph said.
	   Pickering also qualified for the night's first final, finishing
second behind Ryan in their heat with 56.91.
	   Australian stars Ian Thorpe and Michael Klim, both world
champions at different disciplines, tangled with New Zealand's
Olympic gold medalist Danyon Loader later Saturday in the 200 meter
freestyle heats, to be followed in the evening with the final.
	   And the first medal of the Games would go to the cyclists in the
men's team 184-kilometer Road Race, 12 laps around Kuala Lumpur in
the early morning heat which was around 27 Celsius (80.6
Fahrenheit). Later it would rise to 33 Celsius (91.4 F).
	   Other swimming finals at the National Aquatics Center Saturday
were the men's 100 breaststroke, involving Australian defending
champion Phil Rogers, the women's 400 individual medley and the
women's 4 x 200 freestyle relay.
	   Gymnastics was another sport to start Saturday with the men's
team title being decided in the Putra stadium.
	   Athletics events at the 100,000-capacity National stadium at
Bukat Jalil don't start until Wednesday.
	   Some 5,000 athletes from 70 nations are competing here, easily a
record and well up on the 3,200 at the last games in Victoria,
Canada, in 1994.
	   The number of sports has been increased from 10 to 16 with men's
and women's field hockey, squash, tenpin bowling and women's
netball joining rugby and cricket as newcomers.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian sailor who had barricaded himself inside
the torpedo compartment of a nuclear-powered submarine after
gunning down eight crew members was killed by Russian soldiers
early Saturday, a Russian news agency reported.
	   ``There was no way to preserve Alexander Kuzminykh's life,''
Federal Security Service officials in Murmansk were quoted by the
Interfax news agency as saying.
	   The 19-year-old Kuzminykh, who was drafted into the navy last
year, went on a shooting spree overnight Thursday on the vessel in
Severomorsk, near the northern city of Murmansk, the Defense
Ministry said Friday.
	   He stole a machine gun and shot the crew members to death before
barricading himself in the vessel's torpedo section at a northern
port, officials said.
	   The submarine belonged to the Bars class, a fleet submarine
normally armed with nuclear cruise missiles and torpedoes, navy
officials said.
	   There were no missiles on board the docked submarine. Still, the
torpedo compartment where Kuzminykh was holed up did contain
conventional explosives, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The account gave no word on what might have prompted his
actions. However, the Interfax news agency said Kuzminykh had been
in detention on disciplinary charges when he seized the weapon.
	   The commander of the Russian navy, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, flew
to the port to handle the situation.
	   Kuzminykh's family members, including his mother and a brother,
were flown to the site, news reports said.
	   Officials had tried to contact the sailor and appealed to him to
surrender, but he did not respond to their calls.
	   There has been a rash of mass killings in the Russian armed
forces, which are plagued by brutal living conditions. The military
is chronically short of money because of the country's economic
problems and hazing of servicemen is a major problem.

India and Pakistan rivalry plays out in Canada
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY COZIER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The captains of the India and Pakistan cricket
teams expect the rivalry between the two politically hostile
neighbors will be as fervent as ever when the third annual Sahara
Cup series of five one-day internationals starts here Saturday.
	   ``The rivalry is definitely intense,'' Pakistan captain Aamir
Sohail said Friday. ``Any time you're playing for your country, you
expect 100 per cent from everyone on the team but when we play
India I suppose it becomes even more intense because the crowds
always get so involved.''
	   The series is played in Canada because historical differences
prevented India and Pakistan from playing in each other's country
for 10 years prior to three one-day internationals in Pakistan last
October.
	   Live television coverage of the first two Sahara Cups beamed
back to India and Pakistan rated huge viewing figures among the
cricket-mad public.
	   Pakistan won the first series in 1996 3-2, India the second last
year 4-1.
	   This year, both countries had to field two teams at the same
time, one to play in Toronto and the other at the Commonwealth
Games in Malaysia.
	   ``The (Indian Cricket) Board decided to send two teams (to the
Sahara Cup and to the Commonwealth Games) and I think they have
done a good job,'' said Indian captain Mohammad Azahruddin.
	   The board sent Sachin Tendulkar, rated the game's best batsman,
Ajay Jadeja, a quick-scoring batsman and livewire fielder, and Anil
Kumble, the experienced leg-spin bowler, to Malaysia instead of
Toronto.
	   Pakistan has faced additional troubles. Two players on the
Pakistan team _ Salim Malik and Ijaz Ahmed _ were named in a report
on game fixing commissioned by the Pakistan Cricket Board.
	   Pakistan team officials deflected questioning on the issue at
Friday's press conference and insisted it had not shaken morale.
	   ``The players are here, they are not guilty and have not been
charged,'' said coach Javed Miandad.

Hollway prepares for Olympic challenge

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sandy Hollway has not been to a Summer
Olympics since 1972 in Munich, where on one day he saw disaster and
triumph on the largest scale.
	   Hollway is now the chief executive of the Sydney Organizing
Committee for the Olympic Games, in charge of the global event that
starts two years from Tuesday. With favorable report cards from the
International Olympic Committee and construction ahead of schedule,
Hollway believes organizers are in good shape.
	   Tickets, budgets, transportation, security, accommodation,
technology, staffing _ all must be handled well for a successful
games, but there is also Olympic spirit, which can't be measured on
spreadsheets.
	   ``I was working in Germany in 1972 and I went down there the day
after the decision had been made to continue the games after the
hostage crisis,'' Hollway said. ``It was a touch-and-go thing but
the spirit was tremendous.
	   ``I think there was a feeling of the Olympic movement not being
daunted or cowered by terrorism, that it would go on, that it would
rise above that. The spirit of the games was one of sorrow but it
wasn't one of doom and gloom. Overall, one had the sense of the
resilience of the event.''
	   Terrorists broke into the Olympic Village and took Israeli
athletes hostage during the Munich Games. Eleven athletes, three
terrorists and one police officer were killed.
	   Hollway, who took over in March 1997, is the third chief
executive of the Sydney committee, which got off to a rocky start.
As a former government bureaucrat he also has respect for minutia.
	   ``We believe we're traveling very well in our preparations, but
we believe there's no room for complacency,'' Hollway said. ``From
where we sit there's still a very large job to be done.''
	   The committee released its ticket policy in late August and
received a warm reception. The prices range from dlrs 5.80 to dlrs
798, with the most expensive tickets for opening and closing
ceremonies.
	   Of the 9.6 million tickets, 7.2 million will be available to
Australians. Starting in mid-1999, 5 million tickets will be on
sale through the mail.
	   Studies have indicated a drop off in public support for the
Olympics, but Hollway says that was to be expected.
	   ``We are going through a cycle very similar to other Olympics,''
where there is an enthusiastic reaction to winning the bid, then
turmoil and a slow curve back to enthusiasm, Hollway said.
	   ``We need to start reviving the same passion that was there when
the bid was won,'' he said. ``We're very comfortable with where the
public view stands now but we need to lift that to remind people of
the magic of the event, the drama of the sport, get them hungry
again for the event.''
	   The committee is most happy with the work on venues for the 28
Olympic sports, with many ahead of schedule.
	   The IOC has also praised security planning and a transportation
system using road, rail and ferry services to move half a million
people into the Homebush Bay Olympic Park.
	   Nonetheless, there still are many potential problems.
	   The Olympic budget has increased by dlrs 87 million to dlrs 1.5
billion in the past year. But the Sydney committee has denied
claims that the Asian economic crisis will affect the scale of the
event and restrict sources of sponsorship.
	   Hollway is aware of other potential problems, too. In Atlanta,
technology and transportation were chaotic at times, and then there
was the fatal bombing.
	   ``The things that keep me awake at night are the things about
the project that have never been done in Australia before,'' he
said. ``We've never before had a project where we've had to run 28
competition venues simultaneously, where we've had to run over 600
sporting sessions, where we've had to install and operate all the
information and other technologies across all these venues so that
simultaneously people anywhere can get the information.''
	   Many pundits believe the games face trouble from within. Sydney
committee president Michael Knight is also the New South Wales
government's Olympics minister, but a state election is due in the
next six months.
	   If Knight's Labor Party is defeated he is expected to be removed
from his presidency. Hollway dismisses the view that a change of
government will destabilize his committee's hierarchy.
	   ``If there were a change we would only be 18 months out from the
games and that's only a dash to the line,'' Hollway said. ``The
plans would be laid, the staff would be geared up and we have a
very bipartisan backing.''
	   Hollway is part-bureaucrat , part-dreamer, believing the
Olympics can still be done properly and still be fun, despite the
Atlanta experience.
	   He has ``a perception of the Olympics as a very special, almost
magical kind of event.''
	   ``It is unique, it tugs at the heartstrings and brings a lump to
the throat more than any other event,'' he said. ``It's still
wonderfully compacted into time and space _ one city, 16 days.''

 &UR; With Olympics-Sydney-Two Years to Go &QL;

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Michael Knight's perpetual grin was
stretching so wide it looked like his head was about to split open.
	   Always upbeat, Knight looked ecstatic when International Olympic
Committee chief Juan Antonio Samaranch proclaimed Sydney's Main
Olympic Stadium for the 2000 Games to be the best he's ever seen.
	   Although Samaranch has been known to exaggerate, they're still
delighted about the praise down at the headquarters for the Sydney
Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games.
	   And on the surface they have plenty to be pleased about. With
Tuesday marking two years to go before the opening ceremony,
Olympic construction is ahead of schedule with 55 percent of work
completed.
	   ``Of our 22 permanent brand-new venues that we started two years
ago we are very well advanced,'' said Bob Leece, deputy director
general of the Olympic Coordination Authority. ``Atlanta had a lot
of the infrastructure in place and we have had to create that.''
	   The main stadium, which will seat 110,000 fans at the opening
and closing ceremonies, track and field events and soccer finals,
is due to be finished in mid-1999.
	   Already completed are the venues for aquatics, baseball, boxing,
fencing, soccer, handball, field hockey, judo, modern pentathlon,
rowing, sailing, table tennis, taekwondo, tennis, volleyball,
weightlifting and wrestling.
	   IOC coordination commission chairman Jacques Rogge and his team
met with officials of the Sydney committee and inspected venues
over three days in April. It was the sixth commission visit since
Sydney was awarded the games.
	   ``We are extremely pleased, everything is going very well,''
Rogge said.
	   The infrastructure will be put to the test from this month right
through to just before the start of the Olympics.
	   The Sydney committee has scheduled 42 test events, starting with
a yachting regatta featuring six Olympic champions, to be run this
month on the corresponding days of the events in 2000.
	   The sailing, at inner-city Ruschutters Bay, will give a good
indication of the potential problems for 2000. The neighborhood has
daily traffic jams and the bay itself is small.
	   During the Sydney marathon earlier this month, the committee got
a lesson in how mistakes can ruin an event.
	   About 900 competitors, including Japan's Olympic squad, were
held at the start of the race for an hour because not enough
streets had been closed off.
	   The committee was not involved in the event, but with two years
to go they should have been watching closely.

Rolph sets Commonwealth record, Thorpe fastest in 200

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ English swimmer Sue Rolph
conquered a 4-year-old Commonwealth record in stunning fashion
Saturday, leading qualifying in the 100-meter freestyle at the
Commonwealth Games.
	   ``I nearly had a heart attack when I looked up the board,''
Rolph said. ``I love it when that happens, to go so fast and you're
not expecting it.''
	   Rolph, who held the record jointly with compatriot Karen
Pickering at 55.79 seconds, clocked 55.65 in her heat.
	   Rolph said she was confident of going even faster in Saturday
night's final, where her main opposition will come from Australia's
Sarah Ryan (56.57) and Susie O'Neill (56.61).
	   But on the form of the heat, where she defeated O'Neill
head-to-head, Rolph declared, ``There's definitely more to come.''
	   Pickering, who held the games record from 1994 and set her
Commonwealth record that same year, also qualified for the night's
first final, finishing second behind Ryan in their heat in 56.91.
	   World 400-meter freestyle champion Ian Thorpe led qualifying for
the 200 meters and said the longest-standing men's mark might come
under threat later.
	   ``It could take close to a world record to win tonight,'' Thorpe
said after finishing in one minute, 48.51 seconds.
	   Thorpe holds the Commonwealth mark at 1:47.24. Italian Giorgio
Lamberti set the world record of 1:46.69 in 1989.
	   Olympic 1,500-meter silver medalist Daniel Kowalski (1:49.86)
won heat 4 ahead of world champion Michael Klim (1:50.24).
	   Klim will have to win from out wide after impressive swims by
New Zealand's Danyon Loader, the Olympic champion, South African
Ryk Neethling and Kiwi Trent Bray put Klim back to sixth among the
finalists.
	   ``Loader had a good swim today so it's going to be difficult for
us (Australians) to sweep the medals,'' said Thorpe.
	   Australian Simon Cowley was the fastest through to the final in
the men's 100-meter breaststroke, clocking one minute, 2.35
seconds. He finished ahead of England's Darren Mew and South
African Brett Peterson with Australian Phil Rogers, the defending
champion, fourth fastest and teammate Ryan Mitchell fifth.
	   Canada's Joanne Malar was easily fastest in the women's
400-meter individual medley heats. She won the second of two heats
in 4:46.88, more than four seconds ahead of next fastest qualifier,
Australian Jennifer Reilly.

Hopes raised for squash entering Athens Summer Olympics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Now that squash has entered the
Commonwealth Games, hopes have been raised that the racket sport
might gain a place on the Olympic program by the 2004 games in
Athens.
	   The World Squash Federation was encouraged by International
Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch's visit to the
squash courts at Kuala Lumpur on Friday.
	   ``Samaranch was impressed with the entries here,'' said WSF
President Susie Simcock.
	   For squash's debut in the Commonwealth Games, 27 teams turned
up.
	   ``We are in negotiations with the organizers of the 2004
Olympics to consider squash,'' she said. But squash won't be
included in the 2004 Sydney Olympics because the program has
already been decided.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WIRED ON WHEELS: The Australian men's cycling team was wired
for sound in the 184-kilometer road race Saturday.
	   Four of the six riders wore earpieces to allow coach Shayne
Bannan to keep in touch by radio.
	   Team captain Neil Stephens, Stuart O'Grady, Jay Sweet and Matt
White all had receivers taped to their ears. Since only four were
available, Scott McGrory and Peter Rogers rode without them.
	   ``It's not so much for me giving an opinion on tactics, but more
to give them information on what's happening _ how far people are
ahead, what is happening, that sort of thing,'' Banan said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; AQUATIC DON: He's the Godfather of Australian swimming,
protecting his dependents and keeping outsiders at bay, and now he
appears to have won official recognition.
	   Australian coach Don Talbot's accreditation card simply records
him as ``Don,'' with no surname listed.
	   ``They asked me what I wanted to be known as and I said Don. I
didn't think this would happen,'' Talbot said after Saturday's
opening swim session.
	   He said world 1,500-meter champion Grant Hackett is going around
with an accreditation identifying him as ``Hacky.''
	   ``I've heard someone put down `as above' on their accreditation
form, and now they've got that on it,'' Talbot said.
	   ``That'd be a good one: `as above,''' said Talbot, looking
skyward.
	   --- &QC; 
	    &UR; WELL WATCHED: Hundreds of millions of people around the world
watched the spectacular opening ceremony of the 16th Commonwealth
Games on live telecasts to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Britain,
South Africa and Sri Lanka.
	   The ceremony, capped by a dazzling fireworks display, was
carried into homes elsewhere in Asia by the Hong Kong-based
satellite TV network STAR, said a Malaysian broadcast official.
	   It is estimated that the games, which run until Sept. 21, will
be watched by some 500 million viewers worldwide.
	   There are 4,208 athletes and 2,460 sports officials from 70
countries. About 2,000 journalists and broadcasters are covering
the games.
	   --- &QC; 
	    &UR; COOL GAMES: Badminton players will just have to make allowances
for a draft being caused by the air conditioning at some of the
courts.
	   The air conditioning at the badminton would not be switched off
despite complaints by some players, team managers decided at a
meeting, the Sun newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Team managers put the issue to a vote and most favored keeping
the air conditioning on, said tournament referee Gary Walters.

Ruling party mobs clash with opposition in 6th day of unrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A mob of ruling party supporters
wielding clubs and chains beat and chased opposition protesters
calling for the ouster of strongman Hun Sen in the sixth straight
day of street violence Saturday.
	   There were no immediate reports of shootings or new killings to
add to the four confirmed deaths since Monday, though belief on the
streets is that many more _ including Buddhist monks _ have been
slain.
	   The new clashes follow warnings by King Norodom Sihanouk and the
powerful head of the army to pressure opposition leaders to accept
Hun Sen's victory in disputed parliamentary elections and stop
``anarchy'' in the streets.
	   Hun Sen staged a major show of force by his ruling Cambodian
People's Party, assembling as many as 5,000 men, most of them
trucked in from his strongholds in the region around Phnom Penh.
	   It came a day before a massive peaceful rally called by the
opposition in Phnom Penh that could turn into a major showdown for
power. The Hun Sen-controlled authorities have branded it illegal.
	   About 3,000 of the pro-Hun Sen crowd marched from the
Independence Monument to the opposition rallying point about six
blocks away, an intersection where the U.S. Embassy and the home of
Prince Norodom Ranariddh converge.
	   They chanted over loudspeakers wheeled around in pedicabs for
the arrests of the opposition leaders _ Ranariddh, the king's son,
and his ally, Sam Rainsy _ calling them ``traitors.''
	   Riot police and soldiers, who had served as Hun Sen's shock
troops in his crackdown until he shifted to plainclothes mobs
Friday, allowed them to assemble freely. Every man carried a club
or other weapon.
	   About 200 opposition supporters, braving intimidation by elite
police units with Kalashnikov rifles and dirt bikes, shouted
insults at the vastly larger pro-Hun Sen crowd as it came into
view.
	   The pro-Hun Sen leaders held their men in check for 10 minutes,
then turned them loose. The opposition backers scattered and threw
stones. They were hunted through the streets.
	   A pedicab driver was badly beaten and ran for refuge to the U.S.
Embassy. Police and the Hun Sen crowds have fired hundreds of
rounds near the embassy over the past few days.
	   Hun Sen cracked down on weeks of relatively peaceful protests
against his 13-year rule after grenades were thrown at his home
Monday. He was not there and no one was hurt.
	   There were no arrests or claims of responsibility, but Hun Sen
blamed Sam Rainsy and ordered his arrest. Sam Rainsy has sought
refuge in the local U.N. offices and called the charges a
``ridiculous pretext.''
	   The following day, riot police using clubs, electric batons,
rifle butts and water cannon brutally cleared hundreds of people,
mostly women and children, out of a protest camp known as Democracy
Square.
	   Cambodians were horrified and infuriated Wednesday when police
shot, beat and used water cannon Wednesday against several Buddhist
monks at a protest near the U.S. Embassy. A spontaneous opposition
march the next day drew more than 6,000 people despite fears of
violence.
	   The violence has been the worst since Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh
as co-prime minister in a coup last year. He made progress toward
regaining international legitimacy and aid by holding the
elections, but appears to be losing it at home.
	   The opposition alleges Hun Sen won the elections by massive
fraud and have threatened to boycott the National Assembly when it
meets for the first time Sept. 24, denying Hun Sen the two-thirds
majority support needed to form a new government.
