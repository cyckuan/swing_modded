<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince and
First Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz held private
talks Sunday with visiting Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister
Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah on bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Saad, who arrived in Riyadh earlier in the day for a brief work
visit, was accompanied by a large group of high-level Kuwaiti
officials, among whom are cabinet ministers and military
officials, the Kuwait News Agency reported..
</P>
<P>
Saad's visit comes at a time when the Iraqi crisis still
remains as a major security concern for Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said earlier February that Iraq
is capable of attacking Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, both accused by
Baghdad of harboring air bases used by United States and British
planes to patrol the no-fly zone in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti officials and Saudi newspapers have lodged strong
condemnations against Iraq, terming Baghdad's threats as
"dangerous and flagrant" and reflecting again "hostile intentions
of the Iraqi regime" against its two neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Indian PM's Visit to Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi here on Sunday voiced Tehran's welcome
to the visit of Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that Iran hopes such an initiative will be a step
toward constructive talks between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that continuation of such a "praiseworthy
move" will ease the danger of nuclear and conventional arms race
and strengthen peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also hoped that Vajpayee's visit to Pakistan
will strengthen bonds between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee arrived in Pakistan on Saturday for a ground-breaking
Pakistani visit of an Indian leader during the past decade in an
effort to defuse tension between the two neighbors caused by their
race of nuclear tests last year.
</P>
<P>
Both Islamabad and New Delhi expect the summit meeting in
Lahore, Pakistan, on Sunday will help ease their tense relations
marked by half a century of enmity and distrust ever since their
seperation in 1947.
</P>
<P>
The two arch-rival countries have been entangled in fierce,
occasionally bloody, disputes over Kashmir, which they both claim
ownership.
</P>
<P>
India, and then Pakistan, conducted several nuclear tests last
year, triggering international fears of nuclear arms races in the
region.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee returned here Sunday evening after concluding his
two-day historic visit to Lahore, Pakistan, the first ever by an
Indian Prime Minister in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
He crossed the Indo-Pakistan border Saturday by bus and was
warmly received at Wagah, the other side of the border, by his
Pakistan counterpart Nawaz Sharif before they flew together to
Lahore, the second biggest city of Pakistan, by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers held talks on the whole range of
subjects including the most thorny issue of Kashmir and both sides
agreed to intensify their efforts to resolve all bilateral issues
and refrain from intervention and interference in each other's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Lahore Declaration and an eight-point Memorandum of
Understanding, both of which have shown the results of their
"substantive" and "constructive" talks, were signed by the two
leaders and their foreign secretaries respectively Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee has extended an invitation to Sharif and his wife to
visit India at their convenient time this year so as to further
enhance their interactions.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued at the end of the visit said that
India and Pakistan Sunday decided that their foreign ministers
would meet periodically to discuss nuclear related issues and
other matters of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
The ruling BJP Sunday said that Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee's bus journey to Pakistan Saturday would go down in
history as one of the "significant breakthroughs" in Indo-Pakistan
relations in the past fifty years, giving a big boost to bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
Describing Vajpayee's bus ride to Lahore as a "bold
initiative", the party spokesman, Krishan Lal Sharma, said "it
will take some time to settle core issues like Kashmir and nuclear
policy", but indicated that the two countries would sort out all
issues and bilateral dialogue will continue till the disputes are
resolved.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAHORE, PAKISTAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said here Sunday that the Pak-India summit talks have been
"substantive and wide-ranging", and results of these talks are of
wider and far-reaching positive impact.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that the objectives of peace, progress and
prosperity in South Asia can be achieved provided there is the
will and commitment," he said at a joint press conference with his
Indian counterpart Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
The process of dialogue will help promote cause of peace and
stability and advancement through cooperation, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
Reading out the statement at the end of the two-day summit
talks between the two leaders, he said that two important
documents have been signed which "reflect an earnest desire on our
part to turn a new leaf in the chapter of Pakistan-India
relations."
</P>
<P>
Preceding the joint press conference, Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif and Premier Atal Behari Vajpayee inked the Lahore
Declaration while the foreign secretaries of Pakistan and India,
Shamshad Ahmad and K. Raghunath, signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU).
</P>
<P>
Sharif said, he was happy to note Vajpayee has shared with him
"the vision of a prosperous and progressive South Asia at peace
with itself and contributing to global peace and prosperity."
</P>
<P>
He said, "we must bring peace to South Asia. We must bring
prosperity to our peoples."
</P>
<P>
Sharif said, he would like a Pak-India relationship that is
free of tensions and based on mutual trust and confidence. "Should
we achieve this, there is no limit to cooperation between our two
countries," the prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
In his statement read out on the occasion, Vajpayee said that
"Jammu and Kashmir is one of the issues we are discussing within
the framework of our composite dialogue. We will negotiate with
sincerity on this and on all other issues."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said, the signing of the two important documents
reflects the areas of understanding that were established in the
course of his visit and the forward looking agenda Sharif and he
had been working on.
</P>
<P>
"We must now implement our various understandings in good
faith," the Indian prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said, his visit is over, "it was brief but substantive."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said that both India and Pakistan were left with no
option but to promote peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
A dangerous game of war and weaponry would no more be helpful
in resolving the problems, said Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
He said that both the countries had to wage a war against
ignorance, disease and poverty.
</P>
<P>
Peace was needed to overcome this problem, said Vajpayee,
adding that for this purpose, confidence measures were needed.
</P>
<P>
"We have to work together to usher in a new era of trust and
confidence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee invited Sharif to visit India at their earliest
convenience and "to give a chance to repay the many courtesies and
kindness that I have received."

<P>
ABUJA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The first results for Nigerian
National Assembly election announced Sunday showed balanced
winning between the People's Democratic Party (PDP) and the
alliance of the All People's Party and the Alliance for Democracy
(AD).
</P>
<P>
With roughly half the results for the 109-member Senate and
360-member House of Representatives, the PDP has secured 26 seats
in the Senate and 97 in the House while the alliance won 22 and 88
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Among the winners was Lola Abiola-Edewor, eldest daughter of
the late Bashorun Abiola, presumed winner of the 1993 presidential
election, annulment of which plunged Nigeria into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Abiola-Edewor won a House seat to represent the poverty-ridden
Lagos ward of Apapa under the platform of the Alliance for
Democracy.
</P>
<P>
A very low turn-out was recorded in Saturday's National
Assembly election in most polling stations all over the country,
poll officials said, explaining that it was because of inadequate
mobilization of voters and voter-apathy.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission
(INEC) said Sunday that turn-out in some states was less than 20
percent of the registered voters.
</P>
<P>
The House and Senate will take over the handling of legislation
from the military officers who have ruled the most populous
African country for all but 10 years since Nigeria's independent
in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar who assumed
power after the unexpected death of military dictator Sani Abacha
last June has repeatedly vowed to hand over the power to the
elected government on May 29.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Peaceful Settlement of Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi here on Sunday called for a peaceful settlement of the
Kosovo crisis as the belligerent parties in Kosovo have not
reached an agreement in their peace talks in France.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Islamic Republic News Agency, Kharrazi voiced
support for the international community to bring peace to Kosovo
and called for necessary measures from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that an atmosphere should be created for a
peaceful settlement by the belligerent parties in Kosovo to ensure
safe return of Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern about the situation of Muslims in the Balkan
and stressed that Belgrade should ensure the basic rights and
legitimate freedoms of the Albanian residents in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister said that Iran, as the chairman of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), has been striving to
solve the Kosovo crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has informed French officials during his
recent visit to France about the concern of Iran and other OIC
members over the situation of Kosovo Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Despite pressure from the United States and Europe, Serb and
ethnic Albanian negotiators, starting talks on February 6, failed
to strike a deal before the Saturday deadline, which was now
extended to next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides ran into deadlock over the deployment of a NATO
force in Kosovo, among other bargaining issues. Ethnic Albanians,
who make up over 90 percent of the autonomy-seeking Yugoslav
province, insists the pledge of NATO involvement before any
agreement could be signed, a no-no to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has threatened
to launch air strikes on Belgrade if the peace talks in
Rambouillet, near Paris, failed to bring an end, at least a
temporal one, to the year-old fighting in Kosovo which had claimed
2,000 lives and left thousands displaced.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Heads for Morocco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid left here for Morocco on Sunday for a five-day
visit centering on the Arab-Israel talks and the Iraqi crisis,
among other issues.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before departure, Abdel-Meguid said that
he will hold talks with Moroccan Prime Minister Abderrahmane
El-Youssoufi and Foreign Minister Abdel-Latif al-Filali on the
latest developments of the situation in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks will also touch upon the future of Jerusalem
as Moroccan King Hassan II presides over al Kuds (Jerusalem)
Committee under the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel have been
stalled since December due to Israel's failure to carry out signed
agreements and its early general elections due in May.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between Syria and Lebanon, on the one hand,
and Israel, on the other, came to a halt in early 1996 due to
disputes over the future of the Golan Heights captured by Israel
from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said he will also discuss with Moroccan leaders
the Lockerbie crisis between Libya, and the United States and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Mediated recently by Saudi Arabia and South Africa, positive
results have reportedly been achieved over the Libya-West
Lockerbie crisis, in which two Libyans are accused of blowing up
the Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing
270 people.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain demand the two suspects be jailed in
Scotland if convicted. Libya has reportedly agreed to satisfy the
demand.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League chief said he will attend a four-day conference
on Jerusalem due on Tuesday under the auspices of King Hassan II.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Arab Jerusalem as the capital of
their future independent state. But Israel, which occupied the
whole city in the 1967 war, has said that Jerusalem is its
"eternal and undivided capital" and taken steps to judaize the
city, also holy to Muslims and Christians.

The Mozambican leader is expected to hold talks with Chiluba at
State House on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican president's visit to Zambia is part of a peace
initiative now being spearheaded by Chiluba, under the direction
of the Southern African Development Community, over the civil war
raging in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) of president
Laurent Kabila.

He is yet to meet Sam Nujoma of Namibia and Jose Eduardo Dos
Santos of Angola as well as Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Pasteur
Bizimungu of Rwanda and the rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in the DRC broke out last August after Kabila
sacked ethnic Tutsi from his government and this prompted them to
join hands with other disaffected elements who quickly launched a

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Get Tough on Illegal Foreign Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The government of
Tanzania has said it will not tolerate foreigners residing in the
country who engage in activities beyond what their residence
permits have specified.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Home Affairs, Ali Ameir Mohamed, told the media
over the weekend that all foreigners should refrain from engaging
in activities contrary to what their residence permits allow them
to do, otherwise they will face legal punishment.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed was commenting on reports that some Pakistani
nationals, who sought refugee status in Tanzania but were somewhat
granted residence permit class "C", are allegedly doing business
in Dar es Salaam. Tanzanian immigration laws do not allow class
"C" holders to work.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that he is aware of the presence of the
Pakistani nationals who fled from other African countries in the
middle of 1990s to escape war fires.
</P>
<P>
He explained that on certain humanitarian grounds, the
government of former President Ali Hassan Mwinyi who ruled
Tanzania during 1985-1995, permitted them to stay under the
umbrella of religious organizations instead of going to refugee
camps.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Immigration Department issued the
refugees residence permit class "C", but later some of them
married Asians with Tanzanian passports and then started business
ventures.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was unfortunate some of these foreigners,
assisted by local people, have managed to do whatever they wanted
through official channel or by dubious means under the nose of
responsible authorities.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the ministry said that several Pakistani nationals
and other foreigners of Asian origin were frequently summoned by
the Central Police Station and one of them is to be deported.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Privatization Program Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Only three percent of 230
state-owned enterprises sold since the privatization program in
July 1992 have not performed well, a senior official of Zambia
Privatization Agency (ZPA) said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of ZPA, Valentine Chitalu, told the 3rd
regional meeting of the Southern Africa Enterprise Network which
ended in Lusaka Sunday, that the reasons for failure of these
companies were many and varied, but one of the most significant
was their indebtedness from the time they were parastatals.
</P>
<P>
"This has led to new investors failing to realize meaningful
returns on their capital due to demands of debt servicing. The
ultimate has been decisions that have seen the closure of some
companies," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the privatization program in Zambia records low
failure rate compared with other countries.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- An anti-drug operation by
Kenyan police to wipe out bhang farms in Mt. Kenyan Forest
completed Sunday, with three suspects held and 153 acres of bhang
cleared.
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with forest guards, the administration police
officers overcame many difficulties, especially the
inaccessibility in some parts due to lack of area support, an
available source said .
</P>

The officers asked for the residents to back them in tracing
the farms as growers have retreated into the thick and harsh
terrain of the forest covering an area of 48,000 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the operation, some 153 acres of the crop in
different farms had been cleared and three suspects held. Several
bags of ready bhang were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The suspects, who confessed to be mere laborers working for
Nairobi- based tycoons, are due to appear in court soon.

MOSCOW, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Health Minister
Vladimir Starodubov said here Sunday that his country is facing
syphilis and AIDS epidemics.
</P>
<P>
Despite a decline in the incidence of syphilis in 1998 for the
first time in a decade, Starodubov said hospitals reported a huge
number -- 300,000 -- of syphilis patients, an indication that "the
epidemic continues," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Russia also registered a slight drop last year in the rate of
growth of HIV-positive cases, but the rate "remains one of the
highest in the world," Starodubov said, adding that over 90
percent of infected people are intravenous drug users.
</P>
<P>
According to th Health Ministry, Russia has approximately
10,000 registered HIV-positive cases recorded from 1987, when the
first HIV-positive case appeared in the Soviet Union, through the
end of 1998.

<HEADLINE> 7 U.S. B-52s Arrive Britain for Possible Kosovo Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Seven B-52 bombers arrived in
Britain Sunday from the United States as part of a build-up of
warplanes in Europe for possible air strikes against Yugoslavia,
the British Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The B-52s flew from Louisiana and landed at RAF Fairford air
base in Gloucestershire in the afternoon, a Defense Ministry
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Some other airtankers are also scheduled to arrive Britain in
the coming days, the spokesman told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The bombers were sent to Britain with air-launched cruise
missiles. They would play a part in a strike force of over 400
U.S. and NATO warplanes that are preparing for action should peace
talks in France over Kosovo province fail.
</P>
<P>
NATO has repeatedly threatened to launch air strikes against
Yugoslav targets if Belgrade is held responsible for failure to
reach a peace deal between the Serbs and Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for agreement had previously been set at 1100 GMT
Saturday, but was later extended until 1400 GMT Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The United States sent six B-52 bombers to Britain last October
during a similar crisis over Kosovo, but had to pull back the
aircraft one month later after a deal was reached with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denies Advising Arafat over Declaring State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on Sunday denied Egypt has ever advised Palestinian
National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat over the timing of his
declaration of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with some visiting foreign
leaders, Moussa said his country has not imposed any opinion on
Arafat in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as "not true" the reports alleging Egypt has
recommended that Arafat backtrack on the declaration of the
Palestinian state on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Arafat announced he will declare an independent
Palestinian state on May 4 regardless of the results of the peace
talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state, however, is opposed to the possible move,
denouncing it as a unilateral action and threatening to take tough
actions against the step, including annexation of parts of the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is concerned with the negotiations between Arab
countries, including Syria and Lebanon, and Israel, the
Palestinian track in particular, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the Palestinian state is "a main issue in the
Egyptian policy and diplomacy," he said, adding that detailed
discussions are going on in this regard between Egypt and other
countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moussa stressed that it is Arafat who has the
authority to make a decision over the declaration of the
Palestinian state and its date.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the Palestinian state will close the
Palestinian track in the Middle East peace process, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa has said earlier that there will be no comprehensive
peace in the Middle East without a Palestinian state, warning that
the conflict between Arab countries and Israel will "remain open"
if the Palestinians do not have their own state as the Palestinian
issue is the core of the conflict in the past half century.

<HEADLINE> New U.S. House Speaker Promises to Work With Democrats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- New U.S. House Speaker
Dennis Hastert Sunday promised a no-nonsense, hardworking Congress
where Republicans will try to work with Democrats, even on such
normally partisan issues as increasing the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
"The American people want Congress to work, and they don't want
it to work exclusively on a Republican way or exclusively on a
Democratic way," Hastert, a Republican lawmaker, said on "Fox News
Sunday."
</P>
<P>
Hastert and other Republican leaders are expected to meet
President Bill Clinton Next Tuesday. Both sides are trying to show
they can lay aside partisan differences and work for the country's
good. That's been a common theme for Hastert since he succeeded
former Speaker Newt Gingrich in January this year.
</P>
<P>
Hastert said middle ground could be found on the question of
increasing the minimum wage, strongly supported by Democrats but
opposed by most Republicans who warn of its effects on small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Congress should improve the quality of life for entry-level
workers without threatening their jobs, Hastert said. "There needs
to be a balance, and I think we can come to that balance."
</P>
<P>
Hastert said the two parties will differ over how to spend
education dollars -- Democrats want more money for teachers and
school construction, and Republicans want to shift more power to
the states and local level -- but he said his party won't pursue
its earlier goal of abolishing the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
On tax cuts, Hastert said disputes between the Republican
demand for an across-the-board cut and the White House support for
more limited reductions could be narrowed.
</P>
<P>
"My mantra is that we get our work done on time," Hastert said,
promising to finish work on this year's budget bill by mid-April
as required by law. Last year, no budget bill was passed because
of differences within the Republican party.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Calls for Dialog Among Arab Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein on Sunday called for dialog among Arab countries while
chairing a meeting of senior officials, Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leadership present at the meeting expressed
willingness to dialog with Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, on the bases of the points Saddam made in his letter of
February 1 to the Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdul Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has threatened to retaliate Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and
Turkey for harboring U.S. and British warplanes patroling the two
no-fly zones set up by the United States and its western allies in
northern and southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Saddam said in the letter that Iraq was ready to "open a new
page in the Arab relations and to form a unified Arab position"
toward U.S.-British "aggression," the sanctions imposed on Iraq
and all other issues in Arab world.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Saddam complained the Arab foreign ministers
meeting held in Cairo last month for failing to denounce
U.S.-British attacks on Iraq in its final communique, which
instead accused Iraq of threatening its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi delegation, seeking in vain Arab support for its
confrontation with the United Nations arms inspectors and a
unilateral lift of U.N. sanctions, walked out of the meeting after
demands were refused.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched four nights of air strikes
against Iraq in mid-December for what they said the Iraqi failure
to fully cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors in charge of
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq following its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, which led to the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi FM Condemns Killing of Top Shiite Cleric </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf Sunday condemned the
assassination of his country's top Shiite cleric Ayatollah
Mohammed Sadiq al-Sader.
</P>
<P>
"The killing is an ugly crime. Sader is one of the best
clerics in Iraq and his death is a heavy loss for the country,"
Sahhaf told reporters at the Beirut International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Grand Ayatollah Sader and his two sons were gunned down on
Friday night in his native town of Najaf by unidentified
gunmen. No one has claimed responsibility for the murder.
</P>
<P>
The cleric, who was appointed by the government as Grand
Ayatollah in 1992, enjoyed high respect among Shiite Muslims who
account for 65 percent of Iraq's 22 million population.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and most of Iraq's senior
officials belong to the minority Sunni Muslims.
</P>
<P>
In a move seen as an attempt to distance himself from the
Saddam regime and establish himself as an independent religious
leader, Sader issued an edict six months ago calling on the
Shiites to attend weekly Friday prayers in mosques although the
secular government disapproves of big crowds.
</P>
<P>
Sader's assassination adds to the list of several Shiite
clerics killed in mysterious circumstances in Iraq in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials accused "foreign conspiracies" of the
assassination, but exiled opposition groups said the Iraqi
government has carried out the murder.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf arrived here on Sunday on a two-day official visit,
during which he will meet Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and
Prime Minister Salim Hoss for talks on bilateral ties and regional
affairs.

<HEADLINE> 7 People Arrested Over Omagh Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Seven men were questioned
Sunday in connection with the Omagh bombing that killed 29 people
and left nearly 300 injured last August.
</P>
<P>
Five men were arrested early in the morning in the borderside
town of Dundalk, County Louth, in the Irish Republic and two more
were seized in County Armagh in Northern Ireland, according to a
BBC report.
</P>
<P>
Police sources on both sides of the border said all the arrests
were significant in the hunt for the gang that bombed Omagh town.
The atrocity remains one of Northern Ireland's worst terrorist
offenses.
</P>
<P>
The hardline republican Real IRA claimed responsibility for the
car bombing but no one has yet been charged.
</P>
<P>
There are few details about the arrests north of the border.
However, sources indicated at least two people were seized in the
republican stronghold of south Armagh.
</P>
<P>
Irish anti-terrorist legislation permits suspects to be kept in
custody for up to 48 hours before they are either charged or
released.
</P>
<P>
The Dundalk area is believed to be one of the main bases for
the Real IRA breakaway group that bombed Omagh and later declared
a permanent cease-fire.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Attack Iraqi Sites in No-fly Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes on Monday
attacked Iraqi air defense sites in no-fly zones in northern and
southern Iraq after being targeted by Iraqi radar, the U.S.
military said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. F-15 fighter jets based at Incirlik, Turkey, dropped 11
laser-guided bombs on multiple Iraqi anti-aircraft guns and radar
sites near the city of Mosul in northern Iraq after they were
targeted and fired upon by the Iraqis, the U.S. European Command
said in Germany.
</P>
<P>
"They (U.S. planes) were targeted and fired upon. They then
attacked the sites," said Capt. Mike Blass, a spokesman at
European Command headquarters in Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at about 11:15 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Iraqi
time (0815 to 1030 GMT). Blass said several F-15s were involved in
the attacks, but he did not know the exact number.
</P>
<P>
In the southern no-fly zone, U.S. fighter jets also attacked
Iraq air defense targets, the U.S. Central Command said in Tampa,
Florida. No details of the attack were immediately available.
</P>
<P>
These attacks were the latest of dozens of such incidents
involving U.S. and British warplanes and Iraqi air defenses in
last two months. Baghdad has vowed to challenge invasion by
Western warplanes into its air space as it no longer recognizes
the no-fly zones imposed by U.S. and Britain since the Gulf War in
1991.

<HEADLINE> Russian General: NATO Caused Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian defense
official said Monday that the activities of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization caused the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The North Atlantic Alliance is at the origin of the Kosovo
developments," said Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head of the
International Military Cooperation Department, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
"NATO creates a crisis situation; brings it to a head; then
imposes on a country an agreement which encourages separatism and
provides an excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of a
sovereign country; and then sends in NATO troops," Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
"This strategy has been tested in Bosnia and Herzegovina and is
now being applied in Kosovo," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Ivashov noted encouraging signs of change in the
positions on the Kosovo issue of certain NATO member-nations such
as France, Germany and Greece, which are against using force.
</P>
<P>
"Still, the United States is trying to maintain its dominant
position in NATO by involving European member-nations in an
anti-Serbian attack and launching a protracted military operation
which the European countries cannot carry out without financial
and other support from the United States," Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
"In essence, the United States is trying to impose complicity
in blood-letting on its European partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain has lost much of its influence in Europe as a result of
its participation in the Desert Fox operation against Iraq,
Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
In the Rambouillet talks, the policy of double standards and
the drive to violate Yugoslavia's sovereignty at all costs is very
visible, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia does not have much of a choice, Ivashov said. "If
Belgrade refuses to sign an agreement, NATO will strike at Serbian
positions. If the Kosovo Albanians (refuse to sign), NATO will
send its troops into the region."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Monday in St. Petersburg that Russia will consider having its own
military presence in Kosovo if Yugoslavs ask for it.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Moscow's opposition to NATO military strikes
against Yugoslavia and insists on a political settlement of all
disputes between Belgrade and the Kosovo Albanians.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Hopes to Settle Peace Treaty Talks With Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi on Monday expressed the hope to reach an agreement on peace
treaty negotiations with Russian President Boris Yeltsin when
Yeltsin visits Japan later this year.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to reach a final agreement with President Yeltsin,"
Obuchi said in a 30-minute meeting with Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi urged Russia to accept Japan's proposal for resolving a
long-standing territorial dispute that has prevented the countries
from signing a peace treaty, Japanese Foreign Ministry officials
said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a political decision that has given thorough
consideration to the Russian side's circumstances," Obuchi was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ivanov handed Obuchi a letter from Yeltsin,
in which the president said he hopes to continue ''constructive
and fruitful'' dialogue during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also expressed his resolve to solve the territorial row,
saying that he has "a strong determination to search for a
solution that is acceptable to both sides" based on previous
agreements between the two countries, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi told Ivanov that he is looking forward to having Yeltsin
visit Japan as early as this spring.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov did not offer a schedule for Yeltsin's visit, but said
that a visit to Japan is high on the list of Yeltsin's priorities
and that the president is already preparing for it.
</P>
<P>
The territorial dispute centers on four Russian-held islands
located off Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido. They
were seized by Soviet troops at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which has long called for the return of the islands, has
maintained a position that the territorial dispute should be
solved before the two countries conclude a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Russia has reportedly proposed that the two countries sign a "
treaty of peace and friendship" while shelving the territorial
issue for future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
When meeting Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura on
Sunday, Ivanov rejected Tokyo's demand that the territorial row be
resolved before they sign a peace treaty by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister arrived here Saturday for a four-
day visit.

<HEADLINE> SDF Action Abroad Needs Neighbors' Approval: Opposition Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan's opposition leader Naoto
Kan said Monday Japan should follow Germany's example in NATO and
allow any future deployment of its Self-Defense Forces (SDF) on
combat operations only after consulting neighboring countries like
China and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan, Kan,
head of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) said, "The approval of
these countries is actually an assumption before we ever think of
dispatching SDF forces overseas on combat missions."
</P>
<P>
Kan said German armed forces can only be deployed outside the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) area of operation
based on an understanding with countries like Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated, however, the DPJ's opposition to SDF deployment
overseas in situations not covered by the updated Japan-U.S.
defense cooperation guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Self-Defense Forces should never be engaged in direct
military attack and that they should not even be assisting or
cooperating with military forces that are attacking other nations,
Kan said, noting that such actions are banned by the Japanese
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Kan challenged Liberal Party leader Ichiro Ozawa to "come out
openly to advocate a change in the Constitution" instead of
resorting to legal reinterpretation in an attempt to enable the
deployment of the SDF abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party formed a coalition with the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party last month after agreeing to revise a 1992 law to
allow the SDF to participate in U.N. peacekeeping forces overseas
on the condition that such operations were backed by U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Japan's U.N. peacekeeping cooperation law stipulates that SDF
troops are allowed to perform only limited non-combat duties, such
as aiding refugees and building roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
Additional legislation will be required to allow the SDF to
join in peacekeeping forces which perform tasks that could result
in combat.

<HEADLINE> General Chi's Visit, New Phase of Relations: Pak FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz said Monday discussions with General Chi Haotian, vice
chairman of China's Central Military Commission, will not only
further strengthen the Pak-China ties but will "start a new phase
of relationship."
</P>
<P>
Aziz made the remarks during a talk with General Chi, who is
also state councilor and minister of national defense, at the
Chaklala Air Base before his departure for the southern port city
of Karachi on the second leg of his five-day visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"For us, your visit to Pakistan is a memorable event of great
historical importance," because it took place at a time when many
changes and strategic transformations have taken place in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"So the reaffirmation of our strong ties both in the defense
and economic fields at this particular time is even of greater
importance to us," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
General Chi said he held cordial talks with Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif and the three services chiefs. He deeply felt that
the common interest of the two countries was being watched
closely.
</P>
<P>
"When we go home, we will do our best to develop the friendly
relations further," General Chi said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his pleasure over frequent exchange of visits by
the leaders of Pakistan and China just like the exchange of views
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Thanking the foreign minister for the excellent arrangements
made for his visit, Chi said he and his entourage experienced
sentiments of love and affection of the people of Pakistan for the
people of China.
</P>
<P>
General Chi arrived here on February 19 on a five-day official
and goodwill visit at the invitation of the Pakistani government
and its armed forces. They left here for the southern port city of
Karachi Monday afternoon by a special aircraft provided by the
Pakistani government.

<HEADLINE> Joyner-Kersee to Lose Heptathlon World Record in New Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Jackie Joyner-Kersee of the
United States will see her world heptathlon record disappear at
the end of this year due to a technical change to the women's
javelin.
</P>
<P>
From April 1 a new javelin with a slightly different center of
gravity will be used in women's competitions so that the implement
will land more consistently on its tip.
</P>
<P>
As the javelin is one of the seven disciplines used in the
heptathlon the International Amateur Athletic Association (IAAF)
has decided to erase Joyner-Kersee's mark of 7,291 points set at
the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
</P>
<P>
IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said on Monday Joyner-Kersee's
record would be wiped from the record books on December 31. The
world record from January 1, 2000, will be this year's best
performance recorded with the new javelin.
</P>
<P>
A similar change was made to the men's javelin in 1986 but
while East German Uwe Hohn's world record of 104.80 meters was
erased, Briton Daley Thompson's then world decathlon record of 8,
847 was allowed to stand.
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee, 36, retired last year after a career during
which she won two Olympic heptathlon titles as well the 1988 long
jump gold medal.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Announce Stimulus Package: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will soon
announce a new economic package to accelerate the recovering pace
of the country's economy, Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said the new economic stimulus, to be announced by the
Finance Ministry shortly, would focus on two major policy issues,
one aiming to ease the unemployment problem and the other
emphasizing on solving the social impact caused by the ongoing
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the package was to stimulate domestic
spending through government expenditures, which would be funded by
foreign loans, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
A tax reduction plan would also be included in the package to
help ease taxpayers' burden and increase their purchasing power,
which would be, in turn, help spur the economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister also said the economic recovery will
depend not only on the government measures, but also on the
increasing confidence among businesses and investors.
</P>
<P>
Foreign creditors are expected to be ready to provide the new
loans to the government in late March, he added.

<HEADLINE> British Bank to Take Over Ailing Seoul Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Financial
Supervisory Commission (FSC) announced on Monday that Britain's
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) will take over
ailing Seoul Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under a memorandum of understanding signed by the FSC and HSBC,
the British bank agreed to acquire an initial 70 percent stake in
Seoul Bank for some 700 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government decided to maintain a 30 percent
stake in the bank and receive additional warrants equivalent to 19
percent of the shares outstanding on the closing date.
</P>
<P>
The HSBC is expected to change Seoul Bank's name after
completing the transaction.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum ended a lengthy process of reviving two troubled
domestic banks -- Korea First Bank and Seoul Bank -- through sell-
off to foreign banks, a step which was taken in accordance with an
agreement South Korea signed with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) for a bailout loan of 58 billion U.S. dollars after the
country was gripped by a financial crisis in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
FSC Chairman Lee Hun-jai told a press conference that the FSC
decided to sell a stake in Seoul Bank to the HSBC. "Since
NewBridge-GE Capital of the U.S. took over the Korea First Bank,
the government thought it better for Seoul Bank to be sold to
European banking concerns," he added.
</P>
<P>
It will provide an opportunity for the domestic financial
sector to secure foreign capital and gain exposure to the advanced
banking skills of both the U.S. and Britain, Lee noted.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier injected a rescue fund of 1.5 trillion
won (1.23 billion dollars) into Seoul Bank, which was teetering
on the edge of insolvency following a series of corporate
failures amid the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Seoul Bank had total assets of 31.8 trillion won (26.15 billion
dollars) and paid-in-capital of 1.6 trillion won (1.3 billion
dollars) at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which opened in Inchon, South Korea, 102 years ago,
has 290 domestic branches and four overseas offices with 4,817
employees.

deeds be increased from 50,000 baht (1,389 U.S. dollars) a case to
200,000 baht (5,556 dollars).
</P>
<P>
If a good citizen becomes disabled, he or she, according to the
proposal, will receive monthly allowances from the government
amounting to half of that paid to a civil servant for the rest of
his or her life.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed to encourage more people to do good deeds and
to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the country or other
people in distress in the wake of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The existing law, in force for 45 years, does not protect those
becoming disabled because of their good deeds and give only 50,000
baht if a good Samaritan dies of his or her sacrifice.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian Defense Minister
Habib Ben Yahia arrived here Monday for a three-day visit on
military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Habib reasserted Tunisia's respect for Kuwait's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia is closely following up the issue of Kuwaiti prisoners
of war (POWs), he said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait claims that over 600 Kuwaiti and third country POWs are
still held in Iraqi jails since Iraq's invasion and occupation of
Kuwait in 1990-1991, an allegation that was denied by Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian official hoped that his visit to Kuwait would open
a wider horizon for exchanging expertise in the military fields
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kuwait's Deputy Prime Minister and Defense
Minister Sheikh Salem, who greeted Habib at the airport, said that
he would discuss with his Tunisian counterpart a number of issues
of common concern in the military spheres.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait hopes to benefit from Tunisia's maritime experience, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Goes Off on Saparua Island, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A homemade bomb blew off on
southeastern Saparua Island in Maluku province, Indonesia, Monday
as security officers were deployed in the area to anticipate
riots.
</P>
<P>
A source at the riot control command post in Ambon, capital of
Maluku province, told Antara News Agency that one person was
killed and another was injured in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Two helicopters carrying chief of the military resort on the
islands of Ambon and Lease Lt. Col. Aris Martanto and chief of the
local police Lt. Col. Afrizal Asyari failed to land at the area
where the bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
Both Aris and Afrizal confirmed the bomb blast upon their
arrival at the Merdeka square from a visit to Saparua Island.
</P>
<P>
In the latest outbreak of violence in Maluku, at least 11
people were killed and 43 others wounded on February 14. The
violence hit two islands of Haruku and Saparua. It was reported
that the clash was between Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
Ambon was rocked by days of clashes between Muslims and
Christians in January.
</P>
<P>
Most of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim. Maluku is a
pre-dominantly Christian province.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) chief of general affairs Lt.
Gen. Sugiono Monday said the ABRI plans to set up a special strike
force to deal with mass rioting in the future.
</P>
<P>
The special force could be deployed anywhere in the country,
Sugiono told reporters in Malang, East Java.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is currently not only facing economic crisis but also
political crisis marked by mass and violent riots disturbing the
national security situation as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Visits Hainan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, said that
local legislatures must draft laws and regulations suited to their
unique situations so as to benefit reform, opening-up, economic
growth and social progress.
</P>
<P>
He said successful principles and policies must be integrated
into laws and regulations in time.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks during a recent fact-finding tour of Hainan,
China's southernmost island province, shortly after the end of the
Chinese Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial People's Congress briefed the NPC chairman on
local efforts to improve law enforcement and supervision
mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top law-maker expressed hope that the local
congress will actively deliberate and draft local laws and
regulations, while at the same time strengthening supervision and
earnestly summarizing successful experience.
</P>
<P>
Li and provincial leaders visited a number of laid-off workers
and toured key construction projects in Wanning and Haikou between
February 20-22.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the home of Xie Huafang, a laid-off work who
opened a small shop, Li said that laid-off workers must alter
their view that state-owned enterprises are their sole source of
employment.
</P>
<P>
He urged the local government to encourage laid-off workers to
seek jobs on their own and at the same time open new channels for
employment.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China (CPC) and Government will most
certainly provide assistance to people in need, said Li, adding
that "the success of our cause depends on the full support of the
people."
</P>
<P>
Li praised provincial authorities for drafting innovative plans
for sustainable economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Hainan enjoys unique advantages for developing tropical
agriculture, tourism, offshore oil undertaking and related
petrochemical projects, said Li.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that adhering to the current mode of economic
development will enable Hainan to realize sustainable, rapid and
healthy economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He advised local authorities to fully consider the marketing
for developing tropical agriculture, and noted the need for the
simultaneous development of the processing of farm produce.
</P>
<P>
Li emphasized the need to protect water resources, the
ecological system and forests during the course of agricultural
development.

<HEADLINE> Nawaz-Vajpayee Summit Has No Hidden Content: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
Monday categorically denied that there is any hidden content to
the wide-ranging discussion between Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
and his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no objective to assume things and to believe
that concessions have been made. No concessions have been made.
There was no question of that," Foreign Office spokesman Tariq
Altaf said here at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Altaf said the fundamental thing was that Vajpayee himself
acknowledged that "Jammu and Kashmir is a dispute which needs to
be resolved."
</P>
<P>
The summit between Sharif and Vajpayee is "an important
milestone in the Indo-Pak bilateral relations," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
It is for the whole world to determine that "an advancement has
been made. You cannot go on making commitments and signing
documents," he said while referring to three documents signed in
Lahore -- the Lahore Declaration, a Memorandum of Understanding
and a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
The Lahore Declaration signed by the two prime ministers and
issued at the end of Vajpayee's two-day visit clearly stated both
countries agreed to resolve all outstanding issues including Jammu
and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"That an environment of peace and security is in the supreme
national interest of both sides and that the resolution of all
outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, is essential for
this purpose," said the Lahore Declaration.
</P>
<P>
Altaf made it clear that whatever "we have agreed to, is wholly
in consonance with our supreme national interests."
</P>
<P>
Both sides have made commitments which are clearly stated in
the three documents, he added.
</P>
<P>
"There is no other agreement, no other understanding," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, had not given up on the third party
mediation. However, once the "dialogue was taken to its limits
without any results, third party involvement would be required to
settle the core issue of Kashmir," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome third party mediation," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Kashmir is central and fundamental to the peace and security"
in South Asia, he said, adding that this is on top of the agenda
and Jammu and Kashmir is internationally recognized as a disputed
territory.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kenya's Livestock Industry Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ended in December 1996, the project had yielded fruitful
results. Kenya has a cattle population of over 13 million head, of
which more than 3.2 million are dairy cattle. Cattle milk
production increased from 2. 15 billion liters in 1992 to 2.39
million liters in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Mudavadi once declared proudly that Kenya
is largely self-sufficient in meat and milk.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry would continue to promote the role of the
small- scale milk farmers who account for more than 80 percent of
the sector's milk output besides over 70 percent of beef and other
meats.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the livestock sector has closely collaborated with
the International Livestock Research Institute in research on
embryo transfer technology to improve cattle productivity and
breed the herds suited to local surroundings.
</P>
<P>
Embryo transfer work has been conducted on a semi-arid
commercial cattle ranch 50 kilometers southwest of capital Nairobi
and such technology has been employed to improve Kenya's native
cattle. On average, a cow can give birth to 12 genetically
superior calves per year.
</P>
<P>
So far, Kenyan farmers can use embryo transfer expertise to
increase the rate of genetic improvement in their own herds, said
the ASK.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Agricultural Ministry, together with
Farm-Africa, a company specializing in goat husbandry, is
launching a community-based livestock improvement project
involving 1,020 families in Meru and Tharaka-Nithi districts in
Eastern Province of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
By introducing the crossbreeding of local goats with the
milking goats imported from Britain, the project is aimed at
reducing poverty by increasing milk consumption and family
incomes.
</P>
<P>
The livestock sector now makes up for more than 10 percent of
Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP), over 30 percent of
agricultural commodity value and 10 percent of the export
earnings. Employing half the rural labor force, it becomes one
of the major pillars of the country's agricultural sector along
with tea, coffee, maize and horticulture.
</P>
<P>
However, Mudavadi admitted that the pressing problems in
Kenya's livestock industry were poor rural infrastructure,
unavailability of credit facility, high cost of inputs such as
feeds and poor marketing.
</P>
<P>
With the liberalization of the livestock industry in the
country, he added, his ministry on its part was in the process of
developing a strategy for agricultural sector investment which
embraced the concept of partnership and collaborative approach.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural ministry would continue to provide service in
the sector to attract the private investors as the government is
pursuing a balanced policy based on public, private and
beneficiary participation.
</P>
<P>
Committed to encouraging cooperatives, farmer's organizations
and individuals to offer better services to small-scale livestock
farmers, the Kenyan government is determined to see that the
country's cattle industry will embark on the road of sustainable
development.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Killed in U.S.-British Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi civilian was killed
and several others injured Monday when U.S.-British warplanes
bombed civilian targets and some military sites, an Iraqi military
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying
that 10 formations of U.S.-British warplanes from Saudi and
Kuwaiti bases violated Iraq's southern airspace at 10:35
a.m. local time (0735 GMT) Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
"The hostile formations implemented 12 sorties from Kuwaiti
airspace and 20 sorties from Saudi airspace over areas of
Dhi-Qar, Basra and Misan provinces," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired at the planes which shelled
some civil installations, killing one civilian and wounding some
others, he added.
</P>
<P>
At 10:36 a.m. local time (0736 GMT), a group of warplanes
coming from Turkish airspace and supported by early warning
planes violated Iraq's northern airspace, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that these planes flew over areas in Dohuk and Neineva
provinces and shelled some military sites in the region, wounding
two people. Iraqi air defense units fired at the planes, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed two no-fly zones in
southern and northern Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War with the
claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite
Muslims in the south from "Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain launched four nights of air
strikes against Iraq in mid-December to retaliate what they
claimed Iraq's failure to fully cooperate with United Nations arms
inspectors in charge of eliminating Iraq's banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
After those attacks, Iraq announced that it does not not
recognize the no-fly zones and would fire at U.S. and British
jets patrolling the zones.
</P>
<P>
Since then, clashes between Iraqi air defense units and
U.S.-British warplanes have almost become daily occurrence, and
in the past two months, dozens of civilians have been killed in
several incidents.

<HEADLINE> Falae: AD-APP Joint Presidential Candidate in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Samuel Oluyemisi Falae was
chosen by the Alliance for Democracy (AD) and the All People's
Party (APP) this month as their joint candidate for the February
27 presidential election in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The former finance minister, initially the AD presidential
candidate, was later nominated by the alliance of the two parties
as the only way to challenge General Olusegun Obasanjo,
presidential flag bearer of the People' s Democratic Party (PDP).
</P>
<P>
Falae was born in the southwestern farming region of Akure in
1938 and educated in the best schools which were then available in
the west African country.
</P>
<P>
The banker-turned politician was graduated in economics from
the prestigious University of Ibadan before travelling to the
United States to complete his master's degree at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
He has a distinguished public service career spanning almost 30
years and his nomination of presidential candidate is seen as
being a technocrat to lead the most populous African country if
elected.
</P>
<P>
Returning from the United States, Falae joined the civil
service and rose to the level of permanent secretary in the
cabinet from 1971 to 1981.
</P>
<P>
He acted as the Managing Director of Nigerian Merchant Bank
between 1981 and 1986 before he was appointed as secretary to
General Ibrahim Babangida's government.
</P>
<P>
Falae, who belongs to Yoruba tribe, was picked in 1986 to head
the civil service and later to become finance minister of
Babangida administration before he left the government in August
1990.
</P>
<P>
Upon resignation, Falae launched his presidential ambition
under the Social Democratic Party, one of the two political
parties approved by the Babangida regime.
</P>
<P>
Falae's political ambition was smashed by Babangida, who
disqualified him and 22 other presidential aspirants from the
contest in 1992 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
But, he remained in politics and supported the candidacy of
late politician Moshood Abiola, the Yoruba tycoon who was poised
to win 1993 elections which were annulled by Babangida.
</P>
<P>
Later, Falae joined the opposition National Democratic
Coalition in the campaign against the regime of late military
ruler General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
He was imprisoned in 1997 on charges of treason in connection
with the spate of explosions together with 16 others including
exiled Nobel literature laureate Wole Soyinka.
</P>
<P>
Following the sudden death of General Abacha in June 1998, his
successor General Abdulsalam Abubakar freed Falae and others as
part of his national reconciliation efforts. Soon after the new
military ruler announced his transition program, Falae re-launched
his presidential bid on the platform of the AD.
</P>
<P>
He is now facing stiff challenge from PDP president candidate
General Obasanjo in the February 27 presidential election which
would bring to an end Nigeria's military rule.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Serbs, Kosovo Ethnic Albanians to Make Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
Monday urged the conflicting parties in Kosovo to come to peace
agreement at the Rambouillet talks that had been extended until
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers said in a statement that the 15-nation
bloc supported the continuing efforts of the six-nation Contact
Group and appreciated the three international mediators for their
efforts in the pursuit of peace.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers said that the EU holds Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and leaders of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
personally responsible for the success or failure of the last
opportunity to achieve an accord and avoid "severest consequences
from the international community."
</P>
<P>
"They know what is at stake and it is for them to choose the
future of their peoples," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, which started on February 8 in Rambouillet,
France, was extended until Tuesday afternoon after the negotiating
parties failed to strike a deal before the Saturday noon deadline
set by the Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
The talks were extended after the mediators judged that "
substantial progress" had been made.
</P>
<P>
NATO is beefing up its military preparation for an air strike
in the event that no peace deal was struck at Rambouillet. The
western military alliance is also preparing a ground force to be
stationed in the Yugoslav province to implement a peace accord
once it is signed.
</P>
<P>
The EU promised to remain prepared to play an essential role in
the implementation of a peace agreement. It would contribute
towards the civil implementation through economic reconstruction
and community building.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers said that Kosovo-related sanctions
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would be suspended "
gradually" linked to concrete benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the EU,
expressed its readiness to organize a donors conference at an
early date after a peace deal is signed to raise money for the
reconstruction of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The commission said earlier that the reconstruction will need
at least 330 million euro (373 million U.S.dollars) as of January
21 this year.
</P>
<P>
The estimate was described as an "exhaustive" one except for
some places where international access was not available due to
raging conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Apart from such public buildings as schools, hospitals, water
and electricity supply plants, some 30,000 houses were destroyed
or damaged in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> HK People Urged to Work Hard for Better Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China Monday
called on the Hong Kong people to remain united and work towards a
common goal to build a better Hong Kong for all the citizens.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a spring reception at the Government House, Tung
said that during the 20 months since Hong Kong returned to China,
Hong Kong has successfully moved forward under the concept of "one
country, two systems" with the full support of the central
government.
</P>
<P>
While Hong Kong has been deeply affected by the unprecedented
financial turmoil that has hit Hong Kong and the rest of Asia and
many parts of the world, the resilience, determination and strong
drive of the Hong Kong people and the steady growth of the economy
of China's mainland have enabled Hong Kong people to overcome the
challenges, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that we will emerge in much better shape and
forge ahead into a brighter future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that when he visited Switzerland last month, he had
met with international financial leaders in the fields of commerce,
industry and finance. He was most pleased to learn that they have
been confident about Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. They
have also been reassured by the actions Hong Kong took during
these hard times, he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Deplores Ocalan Arrest-Related Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on
Monday deplored the massive unrest and violence triggered by the
arrest of the Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
European Union foreign ministers said in a joint statement that
the violence had resulted in deaths, hostage-taking, intimidation
and extensive destruction in several countries.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc reiterated its condemnation of all forms of
terrorism and urged that legitimate interests must be expressed
through a political process but not violence.
</P>
<P>
The EU fully upholds the territorial integrity of Turkey but
expects Turkey to resolve its problems by political means with
full respect for human rights, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has promised a fair trial for Ocalan and the European
Union underlined in its statement its strict opposition to the
death penalty. It urged the Turkish authorities to give Ocalan a
fair and correct treatment and an open trial in accordance with
the rule of law before an independent court.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Ocalan last week in Nairobi, Kenya, prompted
hostage-taking and property destruction in Britain, the
Netherlands and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the EU and Turkey went sore after the union
left Turkey out of the accession process in December 1997. The
union started soon afterwards accession talks with Poland, Hungary,
the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Although the EU tried to comfort Turkey with a pan-European
conference specially designed for the country, Turkey declined to
participate in the conference held in London in early 1998.
Turkey again failed to show up at the second pan-European
conference at the foreign ministers level.

<HEADLINE> HSBC Announces Sharp Fall in Profits Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The HSBC (Hong Kong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation) Holdings Plc announced here Monday
that the group's net profit in 1998 was 4.32 billion U.S. dollars,
a fall of 21 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Announcing its 1998 results, the HSBC said that it made a
profit before tax of 6.57 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, a fall of
1.56 billion U.S. dollars, or 19 percent, from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The directors have declared a second interim dividend of 0.55 U.
S. dollars per ordinary share which, together with the first
interim dividend of 0.37 U.S. dollars already paid, will make a
total distribution for the year of 0.925 U.S. dollars per share,
an increase of 11 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"In a number of our major markets, 1998 saw the toughest
economic conditions for many years," group chairman John Bond said
in the annual report released here.
</P>
<P>
"The level of bad and doubtful debt provisions required to meet
the group's prudent policy on non-performing loans resulted in a
21-percent decline in profit attributable to shareholders compared
to 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank took a charge for bad and doubtful debt of 2.63
billion U.S. dollars in 1998, up from 1.01 billion U.S. dollars in
the previous year, reflecting the continuing downturn in Asia and
its impact on asset quality in several economies.
</P>
<P>
Net interest income rose six percent to 11.54 billion U.S.
dollars. Basic earnings per share were down 22 percent to 1.61 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total capital ratio and tier 1 capital ratio for the group
remained strong at 13.6 percent and 9.7 percent respectively, on
December 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The group's total assets on December 31, 1998 were 483 billion
U.S. dollars, an increase of 11 billion U.S. dollars, or 2 percent,
since year-end 1997.
</P>
<P>
Net profit at subsidiary Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp.
Ltd. was down 46 percent to 10.785 billion Hong Kong dollars (1.39
billion U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The bank made provisions of 12.53 billion Hong Kong dollars for
bad and doubtful debt.
</P>
<P>
Hang Seng Bank, another Hong Kong-based unit of HSBC, posted a
27.5-percent fall in net profit to 6.79 billion Hong Kong dollars
(871 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The HSBC is seeking a listing on the New York Stock Exchange to
supplement the existing dual primary listings in London and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Bond said 1999 was shaping up to be "very challenging." "Much
will depend on the performance of the U.S. economy and its ability
to continue a remarkable record of sustained growth," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Some Asian economies are expected to begin to recover; others
are still experiencing a severe downturn and whilst we remain
confident in the region's long-term prospects we do not rule out
the possibility of further setbacks," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We enter 1999 confident in our strength to withstand further
volatility and in our ability to build on the strength of the
group to deliver further value to shareholders," he added.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, the HSBC announced that it has signed a
memorandum of understanding with the government of the Republic of
Korea with respect to the acquisition of a controlling interest in
Seoul Bank.

<HEADLINE> Canada's United Alternative Wants New Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Canada's United Alternative
convention voted Sunday to create a new right-wing political party
to replace the Reform and Conservative parties.
</P>
<P>
The conference's 1,500 delegates from Reformers, Tories and
other non-Liberal activists, also endorsed a backup plan asking
Reform to pursue a loose coalition with the federal Progressive
Conservatives in individual ridings during the next election.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a historic occasion," Reform Leader Preston
Manning said following the three-day convention in Ottawa. "The
people want a new party for a new century."
</P>
<P>
Selecting from four options on a "priority ballot," delegates
to the Reform-initiated event voted 55 percent in favor of
launching a new party aimed at uniting the fractured conservative
movement.
</P>
<P>
The results give the movement's powerful steering committee --
a group of 21 Reformers, Tories, and other non-Liberal activists --
the authority to plan a founding convention as early as this
November. A possible leadership convention could take place as
early as next spring.
</P>
<P>
Despite the outcome of the convention, the proposal to form a
new party faces many hurdles. Conservative leader Joe Clark hasn't
been willing to discuss any form of merger with Reform and spent
the weekend in Quebec pushing his own Canadian Alternative
initiative. Former Tory cabinet minister John Crosbie told the 1,
500 delegates they were doing things "ass backwards."

<HEADLINE> Hebei Province Doubles Water Conservation Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province
has allocated 5.03 billion yuan to construct water conservation
facilities since last summer's record flooding, the worst in some
44 years.
</P>
<P>
Total allocations include 1.8 billion yuan from the central
government and over 300 million yuan from the provincial
government, with the remainder coming from loans and private
donations.
</P>
<P>
The province decreed that cities and counties are responsible
for renovating local Yangtze River dams and levees and has urged
all localities to remain on a high state of alert during the
future flood seasons.
</P>
<P>
Construction companies working on dams, levees and reservoirs
will first receive partial payments for their work, with the
provincial or relevant county government escrowing between 5-30
percent of funds to ensure the quality of projects during the
coming flood season.
</P>
<P>
Related companies will not only be responsible for financial
losses, but will also be subject to administrative and legal
action.
</P>
<P>
Last summer's flooding breached numerous levees along the 300-
km Hubei section of the Yangtze River and either destroyed or
damaged over 80,000 water conservation facilities.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Politicians Differ in Security Assessment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Moshe Arens said on Monday that Palestinian terrorism is the main
threat to Israel's security, reported the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee on Israel's security, Arens said intelligence
information gathered by the military showed that the Palestinian
terrorists would launch attacks on Israel.
</P>
<P>
Based on the information, the Palestinian terrorists would
possibly mount attacks on the Israelis, the Radio quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
However, former Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai voiced
different view on the issue the same day, saying such attacks
would not be possible.
</P>
<P>
He made the judgement while addressing presidents of the
American Jewish Organizations who gathered here to learn
first-hand situation concerning Israel's coming general elections
on May 17.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, now leader of the newly-formed Centrist Party and a
candidate for prime minister, told the American Jewish leaders
that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have promised even since
last December that the Palestinian leadership will make utmost
efforts to prevent any terrorist attack against the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said Israeli politicians sometime should listen to
what the Palestinian leadership has promised and should not make
false accusations against them.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel's security could only be maintained by moving
the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, another prime minister
candidate, told the American Jewish presidents on Sunday that
giving the peace process a new impetus is one of Labor's three
main campaign policies.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that peace is insurance for security and not that
security should be a barrier to moving the peace process forward
with peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to address the
U.S. Jewish leaders later in the day.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kenya's Livestock Industry Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
encouraged its livestock breeders and commercial farmers to export
breeding stock as a new strategy to energetically boost the
country's livestock industry.
</P>
<P>
At a recent national livestock breeders show and sales
exhibition held in Nairobi, Agricultural Minister Musalia Mudavadi
urged all the exhibitors to export only the top breeds to earn
more foreign exchange, thus maintaining the country's good
reputation abroad.
</P>
<P>
Paying much attention to the development of cattle industry and
spread of best cattle breeds among small-holder farmers, the
Kenyan government has made the livestock breeders show as an
annual event for years.
</P>
<P>
This year's show was the largest ever, with more than 500 head
of cattle and dairy goats on exhibition from 36 dairy and beef
breeding farms and companies across the east African country.
</P>
<P>
During the event from February 9 to 11, the show organizers
also sponsored auctions and a seminar for the participants in
disseminating related knowledge and techniques in animal genetics,
economic nutrition, dry weather feeding, immunization, cattle
fertility and marketing.
</P>
<P>
The cattle industry in Kenya has been the most developed among
the livestock sectors in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the
Agricultural Society of Kenya (ASK).
</P>
<P>
Kenya boasts of its cattle breeds and crossbreeds. The country
has developed quite a number of quality breeds like Holstein,
Jersey, Boran, Guernsey, Redpole and Brown Swiss. Kenya's herd
can compete on a world scale with breeds being exported to the
world because of their unique abilities.
</P>
<P>
The ASK said that the Kenyan-improved Boran was winner at the
shows in Zimbabwe and Australia, cited as one of the most hardy,
disease-resistant and fertile beef breeds. The Holstein can
achieve daily milk production of 40 to 50 liters, which definitely
ranks among the world's best.
</P>
<P>
All these breeds are able to withstand the harsh tropical
conditions prevailing in east and southern Africa, and they have
been exported to Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Dated back as far as 20 years ago, the Kenyan government
attached importance to cattle industry in a bid to attain
sufficient meat and milk supplies to its people.
</P>
<P>
With the grants from the Netherlands government, Kenya launched
a national dairy development project in January 1980, which lasted
for 16 years. The aim of the project was to contribute to the
nationwide demand for milk by promoting intensive management
practises on small-holder dairy farms.
</P>
<P>
The project provided farmers in high potential areas with
extensive materials in form of pamphlets and video film in both
English and Kiswahili covering housing, feeding, calf rearing,
management of napier grass, fodder trees, fertility of dairy cow,
cattle judging and good hand milking.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Jumps 87 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade
surplus jumped 87 percent from a year earlier to 760.3 billion
yen (about 6.7 billion U.S. dollars) in January, the Finance
Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise was the result of a decline in imports outpacing
a decrease in exports, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's trade surplus has now increased for two straight months.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the politically sensitive trade surplus with the
United States fell 2.2 percent from a year earlier to 487.2
billion yen (about 4.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Japan's total exports in January dropped 10.6 percent to 3,450
billion yen (about 30.2 billion dollars), while imports fell 22.1
percent to 2,689.7 billion yen (about 23.6 billion dollars), the
ministry said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Exports have declined for four consecutive months. The January
decrease was attributed to falling shipments of office equipment,
including computer parts, semiconductors and optical instruments
like photocopiers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports declined for 13 months in a row on the
current recession and falling oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Japan's merchandise trade balance is measured on the basis of
goods clearing customs and is reported before adjustment for
seasonal factors.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Trade Deficit Improves Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia's trade deficit
improved slightly in the December quarter to 2.43 billion
Australian dollars (1.55 billion U.S. dollars) but was still the
second worst on record, new figures show.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data show Monday
merchandise exports increased by 0.8 percent in the quarter to
22.9 billion Australian dollars (14.65 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
While merchandise imports fell 0.6 percent to 25.4 billion
Australian dollars (16.25 U.S. dollars), the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
It follows a blowout in the trade deficit to 2.8 billion
Australian dollars (1.79 billion U.S. dollars) in the September
quarter - the worst result on record.
</P>
<P>
Exports of coal fell five percent in the December quarter while
exports of iron ore were down six percent and non monetary gold
down eight percent.
</P>
<P>
But exports of machinery and transport equipment increased 14
percent, while food and live animals were up three percent,
mainly due to increased exports of dairy products and birds' eggs.
</P>
<P>
Imports of passenger cars fell two percent, but petroleum oils
increased 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Australia's trade balance with Japan worsened with the surplus
down six percent, but its surplus with South Korea increased 47
percent.
</P>
<P>
There was a 12 percent blowout in Australia's trade deficit
with the United States and a one percent increase in its trade
deficit with Germany.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea, U.S Different on Priority in DPRK Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Washington supports Seoul's
proposal for a package deal with Pyongyang but differs on focus,
South Korean Ambassador to the United States Lee Hong-koo said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that there exists a nuance on determining
priorities," Lee said at a meeting of South Korean diplomats in
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Seoul suggests a comprehensive and long-term plan to improve
Washington-Pyongyang and inter-Korean relations while Washington
focuses on solving the nuclear and missile issues of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Lee said.
</P>
<P>
"It is natural for foreigners not to feel as much urgent as we
Koreans do in dismantling the Cold-War structure (on the Korean
Peninsula) to achieve reunification," said Lee, who was prime
minister of Kim Young-sam's administration.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee said Seoul and Washington will be able to narrow
their differences and the United States understands what the South
Korean side intends to do.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, Washington is giving a positive evaluation
of it," he said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that William Perry, U.S. policy coordinator on the
DPRK, will visit Seoul again around March 10 before finishing his
report for the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
"Perry's report will be important as it will deal with what
direction the U.S. administration should take toward the DPRK in
the future," added the former prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir, Part of India: BJP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A day after Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee returned from his visit to Pakistan, the
ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Monday reiterated that
"Pakistan-occupied Kashmir is part and parcel of India".
</P>
<P>
BJP spokesman Venkaiah Naidu said here that there could be no
deviation from the unanimous resolution in Parliament that
Pakistan-occupied Kashmir was part and parcel of India.
</P>
<P>
To a question on the Kashmir issue at a joint press conference
given by both Vajpayee and his Pakistan counterpart Nawaz Sharif
in Lahore Sunday, Vajpayee said that the Kashmir issue was being
discussed as per the agreed framework by the two countries and it
was "very difficult for him to say what solution" would emerge
from the ongoing dialogue at the foreign secretary level. He
suggested that the press wait for the outcome. He did not say his
exact position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Prime Minister Sharif devoted a significant part of
his address at a banquet hosted in Lahore last Saturday for
Vajpayee on the Kashmir issue which he said could not be wished
away and "had to be resolved consistent with international
obligations, justice and equity". He said, "It is the disease and
not the symptom that we have to address, only then can the healing
process begin." He stressed that the Kashmir issue was the "root
cause of tension" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan maintains that Kashmir is a disputed area and it
should be resolved in accordance with the concerned U.N.
resolution.
</P>
<P>
BJP spokesman's comment on the Kashmir issue Monday is expected
to cast a new shadow over the prospects of improvement of the
bilateral relations between India and Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Flexible in Peace Talks: Norwegian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Norwegian Foreign
Minister Kjell Bondevik on Monday praised Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat for his flexibility in the
peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in Jerusalem, Bondevik said that he is convinced that
both Netanyahu and Arafat are committed to pushing forward the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is "open-minded" and "flexible" in finding solutions
with Israel to some sensitive issues, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Bondevik on Sunday, Arafat softened his
stance over the issue of the Palestinian statehood, saying that he
would consult with Arab and other countries regarding the plan to
declare an independent state by May 4.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian minister urged Israel and the PNA to go back to
the negotiating table and expressed his hope that he would hold
talks with Arafat in Oslo before May 4.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had insisted that he would declare an independent
Palestinian state by the May 4 deadline for completion of the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations under the Oslo accord signed in
1993.
</P>
<P>
Western and Arab nations had urged Arafat to delay the
declaration, noting that such a move may strengthen Netanyahu's
hand before Israeli elections on May 17.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu reiterated that Israel would take
unilateral moves if the Palestinians do it first.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has also threatened to further annex territories to
be handed over to the Palestinians in case Arafat declares
statehood.
</P>
<P>
Both Netanyahu and Bondevik shared the view that it is also
important for Israel to make peace with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that he hopes to reach at least one peace
agreement with Israel's Arab neighbors by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Bondevik arrived in the region Saturday night for a three-day
visit. His ongoing Mideast tour will also take him to Jordan and
Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM Voices Concern About Japan-U.S. Defense Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov on Monday expressed concern about the revised
Japan-U.S. defense guidelines, under which the two countries will
expand their defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the Russian embassy in Tokyo,
Ivanov said he had conveyed Russia's view to Japanese Foreign
Minister Masahiko Komura during their four-hour talks Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We call for transparency and restraint over expanding the
scope of security alliances," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has been insisting on creating a credible and stable
security system in the Asia-Pacific region," he said, adding that
it should be strictly limited to national defense policy.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the United States updated their 1978 defense
guidelines in 1997 to facilitate cooperation in case of
emergencies in "undefined areas surrounding Japan."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, who arrived here Saturday for a four-day visit, also
called for dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) to resolve security concerns, and offered Moscow's
contributions to the stability on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
To clear concerns following the DPRK's satellite launch last
year, Ivanov said that it is important to pursue dialogue and
create a security system in the region.
</P>
<P>
Russia is prepared to contribute to the peace and stability on
the Korean Peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region, Ivanov said,
adding that Moscow has been promoting dialogue with both the DPRK
and South Korea.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Link Lending More With Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) said here Monday that the ADB will
increasingly link lending levels to country performance.
</P>
<P>
"Performance will be assessed in terms of both overall economic
management and in terms of portfolio performance," ADB
Vice-President Myoung-ho Shin said in a statement on the occasion
of the awarding ceremony held here Monday for project
implementation performance.
</P>
<P>
The bank will put more emphasis on policy and institutional
reforms to ensure the sustainability of investment projects, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the bank's investment will be more selective in order
to maximize the development impact of its limited resources, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, bank assistance will be designed and
implemented with wide participation of the stakeholders and
beneficiaries of bank assistance to increase its efficiency," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Shin arrived here Sunday for a three-day official visit to
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference here Monday that the ADB will send a
mission to Nepal in a few days to evaluate the country's
performance, which will be done once every year with all its
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the evaluation of performance would be linked,
among others, with anti-corruption, agricultural reform and
environment conservation.
</P>
<P>
Loan could be canceled for a borrower with poor performance, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that project implementation performance in Nepal has
improved in recent years as a result of joint efforts by the
government and the bank.
</P>
<P>
The ADB, which began operation in December 1966, is a
multilateral development finance institution. Forty of its 56
members are in the Asia and Pacific region and 16 are from outside
the region.

<HEADLINE> Information Pollution Causes Concern Among People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Residents in east China's
Fujian Province can dial "Yunlai," a telephone information service,
and chat with young women on wide-ranging subjects, including sex,
dream analysis and fortune-telling.
</P>
<P>
Telephone information services have flourished in major Chinese
cities, including Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Fuzhou over the
past few years, but are currently drawing harsh criticism from the
general public, especially from parents of young students.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guoli, an education specialist at Fujian Teachers
University, described the phenomena as "information pollution,"
and noted that the sole goal of related services centers on
profits.
</P>
<P>
"Yunlai" charges 1.2 yuan per second for intra city calls, a
rate equal to the cost for a long distance call to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that the services will undoubtedly have a
negative influence on the younger generation if they are left
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that some telephone services hire workers to
distribute promotional posters with erotic titles, with related
materials sometimes posted in front of primary and middle schools.
</P>
<P>
Random interviews with primary and middle school students
revealed that many have contacted the service and some have
discussed related calls in class.
</P>
<P>
Other so-called "information" hazards include electronic games,
pornographic videotape and CDs, as well as pornography appearing
on the Internet, according to Lin Wenfu, the father of a 15-year-
old son.
</P>
<P>
"The government should take drastic action to protect children,
" said Lin.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications officials have, in fact, expressed great
concern over the issue. For example, Beijing, the Chinese capital,
recently issued a circular demanding the closure of two telephone
services, and has banned related operations from offering sex-
related information, personality assessments or horoscopes.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese Firm to Take Over Angolan Cement Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Secil, a Portuguese company,
will soon sign an agreement with the Angolan government to take
over the management and operation of the Encime, the second
largest cement plant in Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the official Angolan news agency
ANGOP, Secil will invest some 35 million U.S. Dollars in the plant
in Lobito, central Benguela Province.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has made the proposal to Portuguese
Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, who paid a visit to Luanda from
February 17 to 19, the ANGOP reported.
</P>
<P>
After several contacts with the Angolan government, Secil has
previously agreed to take over the management and operation of the
Encime which started operation in the 1970s in central port city
of Lobito.
</P>
<P>
The plant which used to turn out some 200,000 tons of cement
per annum, is still unable to produce due to the great damage from
 the lingering civil war in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government proposed that the Portuguese government
write off the 50 million Dollars Angola owes to it after Secil
takes over the management and operation of the Encime.
</P>
<P>
Secil has planned to first invest 4.5 million Dollars in the
plant to bring back its production capability within three to five
years and then invest 30 million Dollars more to install a new
production line to double its output.
</P>
<P>
In return, Secil will get most of the profit the Encime makes
while the Portuguese firm maintains its rights to exploit lime and
plaster stones in Angola as raw materials for cement production.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Angolan government will supply electricity to the
Cimangal, another cement plant operated by Secil.
</P>
<P>
The Cimangal, the Angolan Cement Company, is the only cement
plant in formal operation. It produces 500,000 tons of cement per
year.
</P>
<P>
After Secil took over the management and operation of the
Cimangal in mid-1990s, the Angolan cement plant was quick to
recover its production and it gained 46 million Dollars in 1998.

Weizman told reporters after meeting with visiting Norwegian
Prime Minister Kjell Bondevik that Israel must resume its peace
talks with the Palestinians and only such talks can help the
region to realize peace.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Bondevik said that after his talks with Weizman

they really want to have peace in this region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the peace process could be moved
forward through joint efforts by regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Weizman, Bondevik also held talks with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Bondevik visited the Palestinian autonomous region on Sunday
and held talks with Arafat on issues concerning the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told Bondevik that the Oslo Accord was signed in 1993
with the help of Norway and under which the Palestinians have the
right to declare an independent state on May 4, the date when the
Oslo Accord expires.
</P>
<P>
Bondevik arrived in the region Saturday night for a three-day
visit. His ongoing Mideast trip will also take him to Jordan and

<HEADLINE> Estrada Rethinks Peace Policy With Rebel Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Monday that he is rethinking his administration's
peace policy towards the rebel National Democratic Front (NDF)
which ordered the abduction of an army general.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said in an interview that the NDF's move to order the
abduction of General Victor Obillo and his aide has prompted him
to suspend the grant of amnesty to 50 political detainees.
</P>
<P>
Obillo and his aide are being held in Mindanao, the southern
Philippines, by the rebels who thought they could bargain with the
government for the release of New People's Army leader Amado Payot
who was captured by the government last year.
</P>
<P>
"In fact I was about to give amnesty to about 50 political
detainees, but we held it because of this incidence of
kidnapping," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Estrada lambasted the NDF for issuing
conditions for the release of the two military officers, saying
"they have no business telling the commander-in-chief what to do."
</P>
<P>
The NDF had included in its list of conditions the suspension
of government military offensive against them as part of a plan to
rescue the two military officers.

<HEADLINE> Experts to Address Problems Posed by Small Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Governmental
Experts on Small Arms began here Monday a week-long meeting to
address the wide-ranging problems posed by small arms, said the
United Nations Department for Disarmament Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Participants from the group's 23 member countries will review
several chapters of a draft report, including the U.N.'s
recommendation on the convening of an international conference on
the illicit arms trade in all its aspects. It will also consider
further recommendations to be taken.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the Group of Governmental Experts on
Small Arms in March 1998, the U.N. General Assembly has adopted
unprecedentedly four resolutions dealing with small arms,
highlighting international concern over the wide-ranging problems
posed by small arms.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions have encouraged the U.N. secretary-general to
continue his efforts to curb the illicit circulation of small arms
and to collect such arms in affected states and have also
encouraged member states to support the secretary-general in
responding to requests for the collection and destruction of small
arms.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Geneva on February 22-26 is the second session
of the group which held its first session in New York on May 26-29,
1998. It will convene its third and final session in New York on
July 26-30 and submit its final report to the General Assembly in
the autumn.
</P>
<P>
In April 1998, the U.N. secretary-general appointed experts
from 23 countries including, for the first time, all the five
permanent members of the Security Council, to participate in the
group.
</P>
<P>
The group consists 23 experts from Algeria, Belarus, Belgium,
Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Colombia, Egypt, Finland, France,
Germany, Iran, Japan, Mexico, Mozambique, the Russian Federation,

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee's Visit, Important Milestone in Pak-India Ties: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government is
satisfied with the outcome of the visit by Indian Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee and described it as "an important milestone
in the bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
This is the main message contained in a statement read out by
Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf at a press conference here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Pakistan and India had agreed to upgrade the
level of bilateral talks from foreign secretaries.
</P>
<P>
"We have also agreed to give a political content to the
dialogue process. Accordingly, the two foreign ministers will meet
periodically to discuss all issues of mutual concern including the
nuclear related issues," Altaf said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that during Vajpayee's visit to Pakistan on February
20-21, Pakistan and India signed three documents -- the Lahore
Declaration, a Memorandum of Understanding and a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
The most important document is the Lahore Declaration which was
signed by Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Altaf described the Lahore Declaration as "an important
milestone on the path to promoting peace and security at the heart
of which lies resolution of Jammu and Kashmir issue."
</P>
<P>
The Lahore Declaration contains the reiteration of the
determination of both countries to implement the Simla Agreement
in letter and spirit.
</P>
<P>
"While this determination has been underscored once again by
the Lahore Declaration, its most important clause contains an
agreement between the two governments that they shall intensify
their efforts to resolve all issues including the issue of Jammu
and Kashmir," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Lahore Declaration also commits the two
governments to intensifying their composite and integrated
dialogue process for an early and positive outcome of the agreed
bilateral agenda, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We are desirous of peace and stability in the region. We want
resolution of all disputes with India and on that basis we wish to
promote good neighborly and harmonious relations with our
neighbor," Altaf said.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, it is imperative that disputes are
resolved and mutually beneficial cooperation is promoted, said
Altaf, adding that this was the message the prime ministers of
Pakistan and India wanted to send to their own peoples as well as
to the peoples of this region and indeed to the world at large.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that India will bend all efforts, as much
as Pakistan shall do the same to translate this vision of the two
prime ministers into reality.
</P>
<P>
Altaf also said that Pakistan expected "a genuine and positive
movement towards the final settlement of Jammu and Kashmir
dispute."

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Residents Enjoy Blue Skies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Piles of refuse have
virtually disappeared in Shenyang, an old heavy industrial base in
northeast China's Liaoning Province, and local residents are once
again enjoying blue skies.
</P>
<P>
The centralization of residents and heavy industrial
development have long been the main causes of pollution.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government initiated a pollution control program
last year and coal-fired furnaces with capacities of less than one
ton have been prohibited, with emphasis instead placed on the use
of gas and other clean energy resources.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 percent of enterprises in the province had met waste
gas and waste water discharge standards by the end of last year,
with the percentage expected to reach 70 this year and rise even
further to 100 percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Du Qiugen, director of the Liaoning Provincial Environmental
Protection Bureau, recently disclosed that the province has opened
four new sewage treatment plants. He also noted that eight cities
along the Liaohe River will be required to build their own plants.
</P>
<P>
Wen Shizhen, secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party
Committee, said the province will strengthen technological and
economic cooperation with enterprises both at home and abroad in
an effort to restructure the province's outdated industrial
structure at the earliest possible date.

<HEADLINE> New White Collar Definition for China's Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The term "white collar worker
" means quite a wide range of things to the Chinese, a survey has
shown.
</P>
<P>
The door-to-door survey of 5,673 households in 11 large cities
reflected the differing images of the white collar worker.
</P>
<P>
About 15 percent of the people thought that it must mean
management personnel, and 11 percent thought that government
employees are typical, but 1.3 percent think that it just means
people in clean clothing.
</P>
<P>
But, they all seemed to agree that a pleasant work environment
and the use of one's brain were two basic criteria for a white
collar worker. One might think that the term is fairly clear,
because about 70 percent of the respondents said they have heard
of it, and about 12.6 percent described themselves as white collar
workers.

<P>
SINGAPORE, February (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh

Singapore-Australia Joint Ministerial Committee (SAJMC) meeting
that reaffirmed closer cooperation in various fields between the
two countries, a senior minister of Singapore said here Monday.
</P>

collaboration will be signed later Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the ministers, six in all with

<HEADLINE> Australian Govt Rejects Increase of Migrant Intake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Australian Immigration
Minister Philip Ruddock Monday indirectly rejected the calls by
business, local governments backed by oppositions, for an increase
in the annual intake of migrants.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock said it was highly unlikely Australia could increase
its migrant intake without a significant degrading of the skill
level of those coming into the country, according to a report by
the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The business and local governments had urged the federal
government to increase the number of annual intake of migrants
from 60,000 to 123,000.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock said industry groups were telling him that skilled
migration was an area that should be increased.
</P>
<P>
"If you are going to reduce the overall skill requirements, the
age criteria or English language competence, you aren't going to
achieve a skilled migration outcome," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are, at the moment, with the criteria we have in place,
producing numbers that are very close to the numbers of people in
the eligible pipeline. At the moment, it is highly unlikely that
anybody would be able to wave the magic wand and increase the
numbers in the order that are being spoken of, without a
significant degrading of overall skill levels," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock said he was currently considering reviving a previous
policy by which labor agreements could be made to boost skilled
migrant numbers in particular industries where there were
shortages.
</P>
<P>
Some possible areas were computer specialists, nursing,
specialist nursing, accounting and even international-standard
chefs and catering experts for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"In the context of the demands that are being raised with me, I
think it is appropriate to look at the way in which the scheme
operates," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
left here for Rome on Monday for a two-day visit to Italy.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Mubarak will meet with Italian President
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema and other
senior officials, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to focus on ways of promoting bilateral
ties, cooperation between Egypt and the European Union (EU) and other
regional and international issues, including the Middle East peace
process, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Egypt and Italy stood at 2.3 billion
U.S. dollars in 1997, with Egyptian exports amounting to 877.5
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Italy is the largest importer of Egypt's products among EU
members, accounting for 27 percent of Egypt's annual exports to
the 15-nation organization.
</P>
<P>
The southern European country is also a major investor in Egypt
with 382.35 million dollars going to 83 ventures.
</P>
<P>
After wrapping up his trip in Italy, Mubarak will travel to
Germany for another two-day visit, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Mubarak and German leaders will deal with the
Mideast peace process and bilateral economic cooperation as
Germany is holding EU's rotating presidency for the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The EU, which intends to play a key role in advancing the
stalled peace process, keeps close consultations with Egypt, the
first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel and an
active mediator in the Mideast peace march.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the largest trading partner of Egypt among EU
members and the second largest aid donor after the United States.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Leader Blasts West's Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 22 (Xinhua) - Zanzibar President Salmin
Amour has said that despite economic problems facing the islands,
he will never bow to the pressure mounted by Western nations to
govern the country the way that suits their interests.
</P>
<P>
"I will never kneel down to the pressure by the foreigners on
governing Zanzibar," he told the ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi
(CCM) legislators and senior government officials at the House of
Representatives hall in Zanzibar Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Reports by local press Monday quoted Amour as saying that
African leaders should not be swayed by the rich nations.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar president said the current trend by the opposition
camp to look for support from donors was a testimony that the
parties were weak and could not stand on their own in spearheading
their policies and agenda.
</P>
<P>
Amour's speech was an apparent reaction to the move by the
European Union (EU) and other rich nations to suspend their
assistance to Zanzibar until the government reaches a compromise
with the opposition on the current political impasse on the isles.
</P>
<P>
The Isles leader criticized foreign missions accredited in
Tanzania for contravening diplomatic ethics by interfering in the
internal affairs of the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice-Chairman of the Civic United Front (CUF), the
main opposition party in Zanzibar, Seif Sharrif Hamad said Sunday
that recent statements by President Amour indicated that a
political consensus in the isles was in sight.
</P>
<P>
Hamad told a meeting by members of the CUF Women Wing that he
was optimistic the peace agreement brokered by the Commonwealth
Secretariat would soon be signed.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Moses Anaf, who negotiated the peace
proposals on behalf of Commonwealth Secretary-General Chief Fmeka
Anyaoku, was expected to be back in the country shortly to revive
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The ruling CCM Central Committee has formed a sub-committee to
review the peace proposals and recommend a position to be adopted
by the party.
</P>
<P>
The party Chairman, President Benjamin Mkapa, told students at
the University of Dar es Salaam last week that the sub-committee
had submitted its report and that a decision should be expected
shortly.

BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey conducted by
the State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision revealed
that 30 percent of paper napkins fail to meet quality standards.
</P>
<P>
The survey aims to urge relevant enterprises to improve their
product quality.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 80 products manufactured by 47 enterprises
throughout the nation found that a large number of paper napkins
carry germ levels far above hygiene standards, with some products
found to have excessive levels of potentially dangerous chemical
additives, and still others with poor water absorption properties.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that larger enterprises have a greater
capacity to meet quality standards. Some 91.7 percent of the
products manufactured by large enterprise fulfilled standards,
with the figure for small enterprises dropping to 70.8 percent.

<P>
PARIS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Never since the end of the Gulf War has the regime of Saddam
Hussein been faced with such an domestic protest. Once again, it
is the Shiite community which rose first in reacting to the death
of their spiritual chief, Ayatollah Mohammed Sadek al-Sadr.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States has surely led the hunting down which led
to the capture of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, anonymous
officials of the Clinton administration told the American press
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Latest revelations on the capture of Kurdish leader Abdullah
Ocalan collected all the ingredients of a detective thriller story,
with a 129-day "Safari" operation from Moscow to the Horn of
Africa, participated by the CIA and the Mossad. The telephone
conversation of Ocalan in Nairobi was tapped by the CIA, whose
presence is everywhere in Kenya after the bloody attack upon the U.
S. embassy there last year.
</P>
<P>
-- Baghdad has severely suppressed the protests of Shiite
Muslims triggered by the assassination of a religious dignitary.
The Shiite insurrection was the biggest in Iraq since that of 1991,
which was suppressed in blood.
</P>
<P>
Le Parisien:
</P>
<P>
-- Algeria will complete on Monday the registration of voters
for the presidential election scheduled for April 15. The outgoing
President Liamine Zeroual has assured that the voting will be free,
transparent and credible. The Algerians living in France regard it
as an important rendez-vous for a community which hopes that the
page of massacre will be turned in their home country.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Budget Body Proposes Anti-Bureaucracy Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- In line with the government's
thrust to streamline the bureaucracy, the Budget Dialog Group of
the Philippines is proposing a policy to avoid the creation of too
many government agencies.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Diokno, secretary of budget and management, said
Monday that the policy requires lawmakers to propose the scrapping
of at least one agency for every new office they propose.
</P>
<P>
"This means that if you want to propose a new agency or a new
program, you have to identify which existing ones should be
scrapped," said Diokno, who chairs the Budget Dialog Group.
</P>
<P>
The Budget Dialog Group, a consultative body of the government
on budget and fiscal reforms, held its first meeting last week.
</P>
<P>
Diokno, who said the build-and-scrap policy was one of the
recommendations forged during the meeting, noted that Congress has
created too many new agencies and programs without corresponding
funding.

MACAO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A recent official survey shows
that 62.7 percent of wholesale and retail businessmen in Macao
were not satisfied with the operation of their firms in the fourth
quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the survey conducted by the Macao Census and Statistics
Department, most people surveyed foresaw no remarkable turn for
the better in their business in the first half of this year, only
0.7 percent predicted favorable changes.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicates that the major factors restraining
wholesale and retail firms were sluggish demand and lack of
circulating funds. In particular, the lack of circulating funds
played a key part in affecting the wholesale of raw materials and
semi-finished products.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Airways to Be Privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The national carrier Nigeria
Airways is to be privatized by the end of May this year, according
to a Daily Times report Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has appointed the International Finance
 Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, as its advisor on the sale
of the airline, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
About 400 of its 1,000 work force are to be laid off in
preparation for the exercise and the list of the affected staff
has been forwarded to the Aviation Minister, Captain Ben Brigs for
approval.
</P>
<P>
Although the National Union of the Air Transport Employees
opposed the sale of the Nigeria Airways, participants at the
recently concluded workshop on the new national aviation policy
backed the privatization of the airline.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said that the government will guarantee the
effectiveness of the airline, in line with its resolve to hand off
strictly commercial ventures.
</P>
<P>
The attempt to privatize the airline was first made in 1991,
but its debt burden shelved the bid. The national carrier
currently has a debt of 80 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria re-launched the privatization program last October by
inviting expression of interest from potential investors to
acquire 40 percent equity in public sector enterprises. World
Bank officials who have reached agreement with the Nigerian
government to assist in the privatization process also disclosed
that the Kaduna Refinery whose repairs were recently completed
would also be partially privatized before the end of May this
year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Satisfied With Military Ties With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Defense
Minister Abang Abu Bakar Mustapha held talks here Monday with
Indian Chief of Army Gen. Ved Prakash Malik.
</P>
<P>
Abang Bakar expressed his "satisfaction" with Malaysia-India
bilateral military ties after the talks.
</P>
<P>
"This achievement results from the memorandum of understanding
on defense cooperation signed by both countries in 1993," he said
in a statement issued after his talks with the Indian army chief
who is on a two-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
Abang Abu Bakar told the Indian army chief that the local
company Advance Technology System Corporation (ATSC) was keen in
collaborating with India's' Hindustan Aerospace Ltd (HAL) in the
maintenance of the air force's MiG-29s, it said.

He expressed the hope that Malaysia could resume military
exercises with India upon recovery from the current economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
The Indian army chief, who earlier called on Malaysian Chief of
Defense Forces Gen. Zahidi Zainuddin, is scheduled to leave for
Vietnam Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Official Cancels Meeting With Iraqi FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Parliament Speaker
Nabih Berri on Monday canceled a scheduled meeting with visiting
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf in response to the
murder of Iraq's top Shiite cleric three days ago.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of the People radio said Berri, who himself is from
the Shiite community in Lebanon, called off the meeting citing a
busy working schedule.
</P>
<P>
Shiites are Lebanon's largest single sect with around 1.2
million population. Berri's unexpected move indicated Lebanon's
displeasure with Baghdad's handling of the assassination.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Sadiq al-Sader and his two sons
were killed by unidentified gunmen on Friday night in his native
town of Najaf in southern Iraq. No one has claimed responsibility
for the murder.
</P>
<P>
The cleric, appointed by the government as grand ayatollah in
1992, enjoyed high respect among Shiite Muslims who account for 65
percent of Iraq's 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
The cleric was killed reportedly because his growing
outspokenness and independence in recent weeks angered President
Saddam's regime which was dominated by the country's minority
Sunni Muslims.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi authorities accused "foreign conspiracies"
of conducting the assassination, while exiled opposition groups
said the Iraqi government was behind the killing.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf arrived here from Damascus on Sunday on a two-day
official visit. He has met Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and is
expected to hold talks with Prime Minister Salim Hoss on bilateral
ties and regional affairs on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He made no comment on Berri's refusal to meet him.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Police investigating the Omagh bombing, the worst atrocity
of the troubles in Northern Ireland which killed 29 people and
injured more than 200, arrested at least six people on Sunday in
dawn raids north and south of the border between the Irish
Republic and the Northern Ireland province of Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- A Real Irish Republic Army suspect arrested Sunday in
connection with the Omagh bombing had been freed on bail in the
Irish Republic four months before the bombing after being charged
with possession of a huge car bomb. His arrest is embarrassing to
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Kosovo's rebellious ethnic Albanians came under heavy
pressure on Sunday to sign up to a peace agreement after NATO's
failure to keep to Saturday's deadline exposed international
divisions and took some heat off Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The British government will concede later this week that the
public sector faces a more daunting and longer task preparing for
the euro than the private sector. This embarrassing admission may
undermine its calls on companies to invest for monetary union.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- In a fresh setback to efforts to corner Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, the United States failed on Sunday to win the
agreement of the ethnic Albanians to the proposed political
settlement that could have opened the way to NATO bombing of
Yugoslav military targets.

Turkey was reportedly not happy with Israel over its contacts
with the Kurdish movement to solve last week's Berlin shooting
incident, in which Israeli consulate guards shot dead three
Kurdish protesters.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is aware of Israel's position regarding contacts with
terrorist groups and there is no tension between the two
countries over this affair," said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Director-General Eytan Bentsur and General
Security Service head Ami Ayalon, who headed a fact-finding
mission in Germany, briefed the cabinet on Sunday about the
Berlin incident.
</P>
<P>
News reports said that Ayalon told the cabinet that there
would be more attacks on Israeli missions or Jewish targets
around the world and that security at missions would remain on
high alert.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Amira Dotan said on Sunday that
Israel will continue its dialogue with Kurdish leaders in
Berlin in an attempt to reduce the tension, but would not
have any contact with Ocalan's movement.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- United Nations peace
negotiator for Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi has arrived in Pakistan
as part of his regional tour aimed at seeking a political solution
to the Afghan problem, U.N. officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, who will stay in Pakistan for about two weeks, had met
with Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz and discussed matters relating
to the Afghan problem.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian diplomat also plans to visit Iran, Russia and
Central Asian republics, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed meeting of so-called Six plus Two Group in
Uzbekistan is also said to come up for discussion in the talks of
the U.N. official.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors - Pakistan, Iran,
Uzbekistan, China, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan - forms the group
along with the United States and Russia under the aegis of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the U.N. envoy will also meet
representatives of Afghanistan ruling Taliban movement and other
Afghan groups as part of his efforts for brokering reconciliation
in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi's visit to the region is taking place in the backdrop
of the meetings of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South
Asia Affairs Karl Inderfurth with Taliban officials and other
Afghan leaders in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official had visited Pakistan last October and
exchanged views on the possibility of bringing all warring Afghan
factions to the negotiating table to find out a solution to the
lingering problem.

<HEADLINE> India to Strengthen Ties With China: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- President K. R. Narayanan
said Monday that India would seek to strengthen and deepen its
historic and friendly relations with China in all fields.
</P>
<P>
In his address to a joint session of Parliament, which opened
its budget session here, the president said , "New Delhi is
looking forward to continuing the dialogue with that country."
</P>
<P>
Turning to Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's just concluded
visit to Pakistan, he described the "Lahore Declaration" signed by
the two countries Sunday as a landmark for the peace and security
of India and Pakistan, saying that the two countries would now
work to enter into agreements to put in place far-reaching
confidence building measures.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government considers the countries of West and
Central Asia important partners and India's ties with East and
Southeast Asian countries were developing satisfactorily. The
recent visit of the South Korean prime minister was another
concrete step in strengthening economic relations with East and
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the visit of Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov last December, he said that both sides had reaffirmed
their close partnership and determination to improve bilateral
ties by covering many more areas.

<HEADLINE> 3 Themes for Work Programs at APEC Meeting in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting New Zealand
International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith Monday spelt out three
fundamental themes for work programs at the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) meeting in September in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The first is in making things easier to do business in APEC
involving all elements of liberalization, facilitation and
ecotech.
</P>
<P>
The second is in helping to make markets work better because
part of the global economic crisis could have been avoided if
markets had worked better and transparently.
</P>
<P>
The third is to broaden the support frame and for all member
economies to understand how the elements of APEC work.
</P>
<P>
The work programs, among others, will address the needs of the
small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs), promote better
interactions among the private sector, the ministers and leaders,
Smith told reporters after meeting Malaysian International Trade
and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz here.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand will try as much to keep its focus on its work
programs, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
Smith said a senior officials meeting (SOM) was held in
Wellington a fortnight ago, the second will be held before the
trade ministers meeting in June. The SMEs meeting for APEC will be
in Christchurch this April, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said APEC would continue with its task of developing further
its members despite economic difficulties and felt that the
21-member group is steadily growing in strength.
</P>
<P>
Regarding 1999 as a special year for APEC as the World Trade
Organization will also restart its initial negotiations on trade
liberalization in agricultural products at the end of this year,
Smith said agricultural trade liberalization had always been a
difficult issue.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia was the host of the sixth informal meeting of APEC
leaders last year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Company to Build U.S. Amphibious Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Anjung Mustika
Sdn Bhd has finalized a deal with Lake Aircraft Inc of Florida,
United States, to build in Malaysia the Lake line of amphibious
planes, according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Anjung Mustika, appointed last September as Lake's marketing
agent and distributor for Asia and Asia-Pacific, and the American
company signed a memorandum of understanding early this month for
the Malaysian party to enter into a licensing agreement for an
eventual full manufacture production program, Bernama said quoting
the local company's Executive Chairman Ahmad Mustapha.
</P>
<P>
When Anjung Mustika attains full production, it is agreed that
Lake will require 60 units of amphibious aircraft over a
three-year period under a BASA (Bilateral Aviation Safety
Agreement), Ahmad Mustapha said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia was the first Asian country to sign BASA with the
U.S., which was done in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Being a signatory to the agreement enables Malaysian-made
aircraft to be exported to the highly competitive U.S. market,
Ahmad Mustapha was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the arrangement between Anjung Mustika and Lake
Aircraft would allow Lake, the only FAA (Federal Aviation
Administration)-approved manufacturer of single-engine boat-hulled
amphibians in the world today, to transfer its technology to
Malaysia and yet ensure that the quality of the aircraft conforms
to FAA certification.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Mustapha did not give details of the investment involved
or where the manufacturing plant would be sited, Bernama said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Steel Exports to Drop in 1998-1999: ABARE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A decline in steel export
opportunities to North America and intense competition in Asian
markets were expected to cause Australian steel exports to fall by
14 percent to three million tons in the 1998-1999 fiscal year,
Australia's official chief commodity forecaster said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
(ABARE) said the value of Australian steel exports were forecast
to decrease by 14 percent, around 1.4 billion Australian dollars
(882 million U.S. dollars), as the depreciation of the Australian
dollar failed to offset the forecast falls in both export volume
and prices.
</P>
<P>
Domestic steel consumption was expected to remain steady in the
fiscal year of 1998-1999, which ends on June 30, 1999, with
Australian steel production forecast to fall by over 10 percent to
reach 8.1 million tons.
</P>
<P>
ABARE said world steel production was forecast to decline by
six million tons to reach 774 million tons in 1999 after the 1998
fall of 16 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"In 1998, strong growth in steel consumption in North America
and Western Europe partly offset a significant fall in steel
consumption in Asia, thus supporting higher world steel production
than would have otherwise occurred," ABARE said.
</P>
<P>
"Further falls in world steel production are forecast in 1999,
in line with an assumed slowing in industrial production growth in
both North America and Western Europe," it said.
</P>
<P>
ABARE also reported the volume of Australian iron ore exports
was expected to decrease slightly in the fiscal year of 1998-1999
in line with the outlook for blast furnace output in export
markets.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings were forecast to rise by 200 million U.S.
dollars to 2.58 billion U.S. dollars in 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
World iron ore consumption was forecast to fall by four million
tons in 1999, in line with the weaker outlook for production from
blast furnace and direct reduced iron facilities.

<HEADLINE> Lahore-New Delhi bus service Starts from March 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The inaugural Lahore-New
Delhi bus is likely to leave for India on March 1, officials from
the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The PTDC has purchased two new buses and each will make two
trips to the Indian capital of New Delhi every week on regular
basis, the officials were quoted by the Associated Press of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Indian tourism department has also prepared two buses which
will make a twice a week shuttle bus service to Pakistan's second
biggest city of Lahore, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The 494-kilometer journey takes about 13 hours. The four trips
are likely to exchange bus-loads of nearly four hundred tourists
each week from both sides, the officials said, adding that an
agreement had been signed before Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee's visit to Pakistan on February 20-21.
</P>
<P>
However, they still have no idea who will lead the inaugural
trip to India, said the officials. There is little likelihood of
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif making a bus trip to India,
they added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India formally signed the five-year agreement on
the trans border bus service on February 17 in Islamabad. Trial
runs have been finished between New Delhi and Lahore in January.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Firms Urged to Build Good Image to Attract Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy
International Trade and Industry Minister Kerk Choo Ting Monday
urged Malaysian firms to portray a good corporate image to
strengthen investors' confidence and attract foreign investments
to facilitate the country's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
An impressive corporate image in the eyes of the world would
also make Malaysian product brands the preferred choice in the
global market, he said at a press conference here after
officiating a two-day National Conference on Strategic Image
Management and Corporate Investor Relations.
</P>
<P>
In order to have a reputable image, companies should not only
be able to reposition, restructure and reengineer their businesses
effectively during this trying times, but also sensitive to
feedback from investors and customers, Kerk said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for companies to establish a team to
receive various responses on the company's activities and products
and consider them in future business plans.
</P>
<P>
He said this would reduce the risk of bad publicity and
misrepresentation, stressing that corporate communications should
not become the back burner or the least important whenever a cost
reduction exercise is being done.
</P>
<P>
Kerk also said it was equally important that companies make
available company information accurately and consistently to
foreign investors as expectations for improved corporate
governance and greater transparency had grown.

<P>
CANBERRA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar was
caught in a struggle Monday between improved commodity prices and
a diving Japanese yen, finishing stronger despite dwindling during
the session.
</P>
<P>
MMS Standard &AMP; Poor's currency strategist Alex Douglas said the
Australian dollar hit a high around 64.23 U.S. cents early,
spurred on by improved performance in the Commodity Research
Bureau (CRB) index and gold prices.
</P>
<P>
But as the U.S. dollar galloped ahead against the Japanese yen
during the day, spiking above the 122 yen area on several
occasions, the Australian unit's gains were whittled away.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading in Sydney Monday the Australian dollar
was at 63.86 U.S. cents from Friday's close of 63.61 U.S. cents,
after falling to an intra-day low of 63.70 U.S. cents.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Right-Wing Party Changes Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel's right-wing National
Religious Party (NRP) made an image change in choosing its Knesset
(Parliament) slate by bringing three new moderate candidates,
including one woman, into its top 10 positions.
</P>
<P>
The results of NRP Central Committee's election announced
Monday morning showed that kawks were pushed down the list. Most
notably, Greater Land of Israel champion Hanan Porat, who is also
chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee,
was dropped to lower 11th slot.
</P>
<P>
NRP source said here on Monday that it meant unlikely that
Porat, a settlement leader who strongly opposes to giving more
land to the Palestinians, will return to the Knesset where he has
served nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Besides the first spot was won by NRP Education Minister
Yitzhak Levy; Transportation Minister Shaul Yahalom, who is
considered a leader of the moderate camp, won the second spot.
</P>
<P>
In the third slot is Deputy Minister of Religious Affairs
Yigal Bibi, a kawk, but just after him, came the moderate party
Secretary-General Zevulun Orlev.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the results and how many moderates were elected
to the top 10, NRP's rightist line is expected to remain the same,
given party leader Levy's hawkish leanings.
</P>
<P>
Levy has reaffirmed the need to keep the NRP firmly on the
right and maintain the alliance with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
NRP strongly opposes the peace process with the Palestinians
and contributed a great deal in bringing down the Netanyahu
government and holding new elections in May this year, although
it is one of the coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
NRP has nine members in the 14th the Knesset. Recent polls
showed it would win six or seven seats in the May 17
elections.

<HEADLINE> Murder of Iraqi Shiite Leader Condemned in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese religious leaders
have strongly condemned the assassination of Iraq's top Shiite
Muslim cleric Ayatollah Mohammed Sadiq al-Sader, the Daily Star
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Samseddine, head of the Lebanese Higher
Shiite Council, called for the establishment of an Arab-Muslim
committee to protect Iraqi religious dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
He said the crime has increased the fears for the fate of the
Islamic religious circle in Najaf, a city holy for Shiites.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi grand ayatollah and two of his sons were killed by
unidentified gunmen on Friday in his native town of Najaf, 160
kilometers south of Baghdad. No one has claimed responsibility for
the murder.
</P>
<P>
The cleric, appointed by the government as grand ayatollah in
1992, enjoyed high respect among Shiite Muslims who compromise 65
percent of Iraq's 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
He was reportedly killed because his growing outspokenness and
independence in recent weeks angered the regime which was
denominated by the minority Sunni Muslims prone to President
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Saayed Hassan Nasrallah, head of anti-Israeli militant group
Hezbollah, or Party of God, described the murder of Sader as
"another brutal crime to add to the series of crimes Saddam's
regime has committed against its people."
</P>
<P>
As leader of one of Lebanon's two biggest Shiite groups,
Nasrallah said the martyrdom of Sader has shown the regime's
determination to put an end to any group in defiance of oppression.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraqi authorities accused "foreign conspiracies" of
the assassination, while exiled opposition groups said the Iraqi
government was behind the murder.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo to Continue Efforts Toward Peace Treaty With Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi said Monday that Japan will continue its best efforts
toward concluding a peace treaty with Russia by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with Russia should be conducted "patiently,
patiently and patiently," Obuchi told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi's remarks came one day after Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov rejected Tokyo's demand that the two countries' long-
standing territorial dispute be resolved before they sign a peace
treaty by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"It's not possible," Ivanov told Japanese Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura in their four-hour talks Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers failed to narrow their differences over the
territorial row which has prevented the two countries from signing
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Japan has maintained a position that the territorial dispute
should be resolved before the two countries sign the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Russia has proposed that they sign a "treaty of peace and
friendship" while shelving the territorial issue for future
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The territorial dispute centers on four Russian-held islands of
Hokkaido -- Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai group of
islets. They were seized by Soviet troops at the end of World War
II.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, who arrived here on Saturday for a four-day visit, is
expected to meet Obuchi later in the day.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's PDP Set to Sweep Parliamentary Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Early results from the Saturday
National Assembly polls in Nigeria showed the People's Democratic
Party (PDP) is heading for a landslide victory with no threat from
the alliance of the other two parties.
</P>
<P>
According to results from 24 out of 36 states by Sunday night,
the PDP was leading with 38 of 67 Senate seats while the All
People's Democratic Party (APP) and the Alliance for Democracy
(AD) secured 12 and 17 seats respectively.
</P>
<P>
Of the 224 House of Representative seats declared on Sunday
night, the PDP won 140 seats with the APP and AD getting 42 seats
each.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper said Monday that from the initial
results, "the PDP looks set to secure a clear two-third majority
in both the Senate and the House of Representatives."

 elections held last December and January this year.
</P>
<P>
The AD confirmed its traditional hold in southwest six states
of the west African country including Lagos state in the local and
state elections and Saturday's National Assembly polls.
</P>
<P>
The PDP's governor-elect for Katsina State, Alhaji Umaru Musa,
was quoted as saying Sunday that the PDP had ruled out any threat
from the pact between the AD and the APP in the National Assembly
and presidential elections.

Ketumile Masire, leader of the Commonwealth Observers Group,
said Sunday that reports received from the field indicated that
Saturday polling had been peaceful and orderly.

<P>
ABU DHABI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Pan-Arab and the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) member states spent a total of 1.94
billion U.S. dollars in advertising in 1998, up 21 percent from
last year, the Gulf News daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Pan-Arab Research Center show that 46 percent
of the money went to Pan-Arab satellite televisions, 24 percent to
the media in Egypt and 30 percent to media in other countries,
said the paper.

<P>
Among the six GCC members, total advertisement spendings stood
at 817 million dollars, of which 350 million dollars were spent by

Saudi newspapers, holding 67 percent of the advertising market
share, generated 234 million dollars from the advertisement
sector, a 10 percent increase over 1997.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates remained the second in the GCC ad
market, with a revenue of 195 million dollars. Local newspapers
and magazines hold 55 percent and 17 percent of the market share,

LUSAKA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will soon establish
joint forest management schemes to combat environmental
degradation, a government minister has said.
</P>
<P>
Environment and Natural Resources Minister Alfeyo Hambayi told
the second environmental awareness workshop for members of
parliament in Lusaka Sunday that the schemes will be run and
managed by local communities in close partnership with the
government.

The schemes will give greater responsibility to local
communities in the management, protection, and development of
forest resources, the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Monday quoted
the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government is taking this measure to impart a sense of
belonging among villagers to the environment, said Hambayi.
</P>
<P>
He noted that environmental degradation has reached an alarming
 proportion and challenged the parliamentarians to play a vital
role in combating it.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the government efforts to conserve the
environment will not succeed if people at the grass-roots did not
appreciate its importance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government is to develop a national
environmental policy to promote sustainable environment, said the

<HEADLINE> Japanese Cars Popular for U.S. Thieves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Japanese automakers not
only make best-selling cars for the U.S. consumers, but also "
supply" numerous second-hand cars popular for U.S. thieves,
according to a survey Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 21 of the 25 most-stolen vehicles were made by the
Japanese automakers, according to CCC Information Services Inc.,
which tracks trends in thief and other vehicle damage claims for
the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
The top 10 most-stolen vehicles were all Toyotas and Hondas,
the survey showed. Experts believe the formula that put Carmys and
Accords atop the list is simple -- there were a lot of them sold,

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo: Man of Unique Destiny in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- With an overwhelming victory at
the party' s national convention on February 14, General Olusegun
Obasanjo was chosen as the presidential flag bearer of the
People's Democratic Party (PDP).
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo looks well on his way back to power 20 years after he
handed over the power to an elected government in 1979 since his
PDP won most of the vote in the local and state elections held
last December and January this year.
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old presidential candidate is the only military
ruler in the west African country who is on his way to the state
house for the second time in two decades, but this time as a
civilian leader if elected.
</P>
<P>
He is also the only military ruler in the history of Nigeria
who handed over power to elected President Shehu Shagari two
decades ago, hence was accused of "awarding" the presidency to an
Hausa-Fulani and of being stooge of the Moslem North.
</P>
<P>
The soldier-turned-poultry farmer was sentenced to life
imprisonment in 1995 and later commuted to 15 years of
imprisonment on alleged charges of plotting a coup along with 43
other people by the late military dictator General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The retired general cut a very different figure at the PDP
national convention from the man released from prison eight months
ago, following the sudden death of General Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Born in Abeokuta in southwestern Nigeria, Obasanjo belongs to
the Yoruba tribe, one of the three major tribes in the most
populous African country, but is not loved at home.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo criticized the military rule after Abacha took power
in 1993 following the annulment of elections which his late Yoruba
kinsman Moshood Abiola was poised to win, but many Yorubas have
never forgiven him for saying that Abiola was "not a messiah."
</P>
<P>
In a country riven by tribalism, Obasanjo is one of the few
politicians who can claim to be more popular outside than within
his own ethnic group of Yoruba.
</P>
<P>
He enjoys the backing of many in the Hausa-speaking North which
has dominated the Nigerian government in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Born on March 5, 1937, Obasanjo was educated at the Baptist
secondary school in his home town Abeokuta, about 100 kilometers
north of Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos. He became a
teacher before joining the army in 1958 and receiving military
training at schools in Britain and India.
</P>
<P>
During the Biafran civil war from 1967 to 1970, Obasanjo led
the famous 3rd Marine Commando Division and recorded a spectacular
victory over rebels, which paved the way for their final defeat.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed Works and Housing Commissioner (minister) in
1975 and later became Chief of Staff of Supreme Headquarters until
February 1976 when he succeeded the slain General Murtala Muhammad
as head of state.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo was Co-Chairman of the Commonwealth Eminent Persons
Group on South Africa and he founded the African Leadership Forum
in 1988 based in his Otta farm near Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Having won a reputation as an officer-democrat, Obasanjo
adopted the role of world statesman when he tried to win the post
of the U.N. Secretary- General in 1991.
</P>
<P>
After his release from prison last June, Obasanjo initially
said he would not run again for the country's top office but in
November last year announced he had changed his mind after
consultations with friends and supporters.
</P>
<P>
In apparent response to critics who see his possible presidency
as continuation of military rule in the country, Obasanjo pledged
in his acceptance speech of his party's presidential ticket on
February 14 that his leadership would end the "illogical
polarization of the nation into soldier and non-soldier."

<HEADLINE> "Shakespeare in Love" Wins U.S. Writers Guild Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 21 (Xinhua) -- "Shakespeare in Love",
which won 13 Oscar nominations earlier this month, walked off with
the U.S. Writers Guild Award for best screenplay written directly
for the screen.
</P>
<P>
Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard shared the award for "Shakespeare
in Love", which bested "Saving Private Ryan" with screenplay by
Robert Rodat, "Bulworth" by Warren Beatty and Jeremy Pikser, "The
Truman Show" by Andrew Nicol, as well as "The Opposite Of Sex" by
Don Roos.
</P>
<P>
The annual Writers Guild Awards, held Saturday evening in
Beverly Hills, was the latest awards show to honor the surprise
hit comedy which has already won the Golden Globe screenwriting
award last month and Oscar nomination as the best screenplay
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
In accepting the Writers Guild Award Saturday night, "
Shakespeare" co-writer Norman said, "I think this award is special
because it is given to people like us from people like us."
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1933, the Writers Guild of America represents
writers in the motion picture, broadcast, cable and new media
industries.
</P>
<P>
"I like the word guild very much as it resonates from the
middle ages and connotes craftsmanship," said celebrated
playwright Stoppard, who co-wrote "Shakespeare" with Norman.
</P>
<P>
The Writers Guild Awards began as a poolside gathering at the
Bel Air Hotel in 1949 and soon attracted the biggest stars in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
Taking home the Writers Guild Award for best screenplay based
on material previously produced or published was "Out of Sight",
by Scott Frank, based on the novel by Elmore Leonard.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the awards are considered an indication of where
Oscar awards for screenwriting might go on March 21.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania still has an

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Concludes Visit to New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard concluded his three-day visit to New Zealand and Left
here for home Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Queenstown and Wellington, Howard discussed
a wide-range of bilateral and international issues with his New
Zealand counterpart Jenny Shipley.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for home, Howard and Mrs. Shipley gave a
joint press conference. They said that during their talks they
considered the establishment of a prime ministerial taskforce
between New Zealand and Australia to sort out issues outstanding
from the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (CER) between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he agreed with Mrs. Shipley to consider expanding
CER agreement to include Chile, Argentina and other South American
countries.
</P>
<P>
Since New Zealand and Australia signed the CER agreement in
1983, bilateral trade has increased by over 275 percent.
Australia is both New Zealand's largest bilateral export
destination and its largest bilateral source of imports, and has
been so throughout the 1990's. Last year New Zealand-Australia
trade stood at 5.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Howard said he is interested in New
Zealand's experience, ahead of Australia's debate on the GST
(Goods and Service Tax) issue. He said he has not heard a single
negative comment about the GST during his visit to new Zealand.
The GST should be introduced in Australia as a very intelligent
economic reform, Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Shipley gave an official luncheon for the Australian prime
 minister in Wellington Monday. Speaking at the luncheon, Mrs.
Shipley said Australia is New Zealand's most important bilateral
partner in trade, defense, tourism, investment and diplomacy,
sporting and family matters.
</P>
<P>
She said she had "really valuable discussions" with Howard
during his stay in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand prime minister said she wants to place her
government's "thanks for the support we are getting from Australia
as we pursue our APEC responsibilities".
</P>
<P>
"APEC is, of course, but one of the major events that will
ensure an increased international profile for New Zealand and
Australia over the next two years," she said.

<HEADLINE> Malnutrition Is High Among Cambodia's Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 20 percent of
Cambodia's children are suffering from acute malnutrition, the
highest for the Southeast Asia region, according to a survey by
UNICEF and WFP.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and
World Food Program (WFP) in rural Cambodian villages has shown
alarming high rate of malnutrition in children, the Vision
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 61 percent of 1,700 children under five years in sample
were discovered to be lighter for their expected age (underweight)
with nearly 20 percent suffering from acute malnutrition (too thin
for their height). About 49 percent were stunted, which means that
they are short for their age.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the survey found 80 percent of the children
suffering from anemia. The nutrition status of women was also
poor, with about 27 percent of the mothers being malnourished and
nearly 70 percent anemic. As high as 74 percent of pregnant women
were anemic.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the rates of malnutrition in Cambodia
are the highest for the Southeast Asia region, according to the
standard of WHO for malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
As there is no information on the nutrition situation over the
years in Cambodia, it is impossible to say whether the situation
is improving or deteriorating, but the current levels are serious
by any standards.
</P>
<P>
The major causes of these high rates of malnutrition are a
combination of problems of household food insecurity, poor care,
inadequate access to health, safe water and sanitation and too low
levels of education particularly among women.
</P>
<P>
However, poverty is the basic cause. So far, still about 36
percent of Cambodians are living below the poverty line.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Sabah State Legislature Dissolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Legislative Assembly
of the Sabah State, East Malaysia, was dissolved Monday to pave
the way for a fresh state election.
</P>
<P>
Sabah state Chief Minister Bernard Dompok announced the
dissolution Monday afternoon over RTM (radio-television Malaysia)
from the state assembly building in Kota Kinabalu, the state's
capital.
</P>
<P>
Dompok, who is also chairman of the ruling Sabah Barisan
Nasional (BN) (National Front) Monday met Yang Dipertua Negeri
(state Governor) Sakaran Dandai to get his consent to dissolve the
48-seat legislature.
</P>
<P>
The dates for the nomination and polling, to be fixed by the
Election Commission, has not yet announced. However, the new polls
must be held within two months.
</P>
<P>
The current five-year mandate of the assembly ends on March 18.
</P>
<P>
In the just-dissolved assembly, the BN held 43 seats while the
opposition Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) (Sabah Unity Party) had four
and the remaining one seat was held by an Independent.
</P>
<P>
Sabah BN comprises of nine component parties with six parties
having seats in the state legislature and three others no
representation in the assembly.
</P>
<P>
Besides the 48 elected seats, the state assembly also had six
nominated assemblymen, three each by BN and PBS.
</P>
<P>
The PBS won the last state election with 25 seats for a simple
majority in the previous state election held on February 18 and
19, 1994, but the state government collapsed after only three
weeks in power when most of its assemblymen defected to the BN
which then formed the state government.

<P>
COLOMBO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Two companies from Australia
and Canada have bid to explore mineral deposits worth about 330
million U.S. dollars in the sea bed off the southwestern coast of
Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The bids are under scrutiny by the National Aquatic Resources,
Research and Development agency (NARA), Fisheries Ministry sources
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two companies have expressed their desire to conduct an
environment impact assessment study as a follow-up program to get
core samples to determine the grain size and the heavy mineral
content of the sediments from identified areas.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the deposits were first discovered by a
team of NARA scientists whose survey was sponsored by the United
Nations Revolving Fund for mineral resources exploration.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey there are 11 recognized heavy mineral
deposits in separate patches on the sea bed which could consist of
heavy economic sands such as Monazite, Rutile and Zircon.
</P>

BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Since China's central
government decided last year to clamp down on the arbitrary
financial levies that commercial and other enterprises were
obliged to make to local governments, more than 18,000 cases have
been dealt with.
</P>
<P>
The economic burden on enterprises was affecting both their
profit margins and viability and the government launched its
campaign to eliminate the random payments countrywide. Party or
government disciplinary action has so far been taken against 1,273
officials involved in the malpractice.
</P>
<P>
Last year, six central government departments ordered the
removal of 973 such levies which was running to a total of 45
billion yuan (5.42 billion US dollars) every year. And further
commitment from local governments has seen a total of 26,710
random fees being abolished, involving some 98.5 billion yuan per
annum.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, the random levies, which were
economically crippling many enterprises, have dropped by about 30
percent in the provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Hebei, Henan,
Hunan and Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Now, the central government has called for intensified efforts
to eliminate the malpractice by the end of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji's official
visit to Russia between February 24-27 is expected to raise
bilateral trade relations to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and his Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov will hold the
fourth regular meeting between the Chinese and Russian prime
ministers. Their discussion will be centered on expanding trade
and economic cooperation between the two countries and seeking
common development.
</P>
<P>
While China and Russia have maintained a rapid growth of
relations in recent years, the bilateral trade volume has dropped
due to repercussions of the Asian financial crisis and other
factors.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Chinese Customs show that the Sino-
Russian trade volume hit 5.48 billion US dollars in 1998, down 10.
5 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
China's main exports to Russia included clothing, footwear,
fresh and frozen meat, fresh and dried fruits, appliances and
machinery, while its main imports were fertilizer, rolled steel,
timber, appliances and machinery.
</P>
<P>
China had established 1,300 ventures in Russia by last June,
with total investments approaching 100 million US dollars. They
were engaged in trade, microelectronics, telecommunications, the
assembly of appliances and catering.
</P>
<P>
The 900-odd Russian companies in China, with investments of
close to 150 million US dollars, were mainly in the sectors of
automobile manufacturing, farm machinery, chemical and
construction materials.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Postal Workers Plan 24-hour Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's postal workers
have planned a 24-hour islandwide strike on Tuesday, as a protest
against government's proposal to convert the postal department
into a corporation.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, all local and foreign mail will be affected and
there will be no transactions at any post office, the Sinhalese
Island newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
All postal department unions will be participating in the token
strike and if there is no positive response, it is proposed to
continue the strike indefinitely, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A bill to set up the postal corporation was introduced in the
parliament on February 10 by Minister of Posts Mangala
Samaraweera.
</P>
<P>
The unions of the postal workers consider the setting up of the
corporation as the first step towards privatization of the postal
services.
</P>
<P>
Many people believe that once it is made a corporation and then
privatized, some of the services offered to the public would be
terminated as they are not profit-making.
</P>
<P>
The government is determined to go ahead with the proposal as
it is one of the requirements of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
As talks over the bill presented in the parliament for the
conversion had failed the workers had decided on trade union
action.
</P>
<P>
They have charged that Minister Samaraweera had earlier given
an undertaking that he would not present the bill in the
parliament but he had gone back on his word.
</P>
<P>
Altogether there are 24,000 postal workers belonging to the
different trade unions in the department and they will all be
participating in the strike, union sources said.
</P>
<P>
With five provincial council elections scheduled for April 1,
the official polling cards are to be distributed by the Postal
Department from Monday. The workers had chosen to strike Monday to
cripple the distribution of these polling cards.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the postal workers went on strike since March 11 for
53 days, pressing for higher wages. All sectors of the country had
been adversely affected at that time.

<TEXT>

DHAKA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's export performance
over the years has been quite impressive with an annual average
growth rate of 16.9 percent since 1986-87.
</P>
<P>
The average growth rate had increased to 17.76 percent from the

</P>
<P>
All this shows that the export growth rate of this South Asian
country is gaining momentum with the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from export were also increased rapidly with 5.172
billion U.S. dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal year as against 819.2
million dollars in the 1986-87 fiscal year, according to the
official figures.
</P>
<P>
The target of export earnings for the 1998-99 fiscal year has
been fixed at 5.7 billion dollars, but however, it may be not met
due to the worst flood the country experienced in a century last
year.
</P>
<P>
Besides, export base is also getting diversified and more and
more products are appearing in the list of export.
</P>
<P>
In the area of production diversification, quite good progress
was made in the period between 1972-73 and 1996-97. In 1972-73,
the number of export products was only 32, which had been
increased to 125 in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh had added a number of new, but high potential items
to the export list over the years, including frozen food chemical
fertilizer, ready-made garments and specialized textiles.
</P>
<P>
However, the product diversification is not up to the mark, and
like other developing countries, Bangladesh is seriously facing a
situation of supply constraints and its export program is being
affected by dependence on a limited number of effective export
products.
</P>
<P>
While 125 products were listed as having been exported, a core
group of seven products accounted for 92 percent of the total
export earning during 1996-97 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The core group constitutes woven garments (55.09 percent),
knitwear (18.22 percent), frozen food (5.69 percent), jute goods
(5.45 percent, leather (3.69 percent), raw jute (2.09 percent and
chemical products (1.44 percent).
</P>
<P>
In this group, ready-made garment (RMG) is the single most
important item and alone contributes over half (55.09 percent) to
the total export earnings. If the earning from knitwear is added
to that of RMG, the apparel sector as a whole contributed more
than two-thirds (73 percent) to the total export earnings in the
1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bangladesh's export markets are also being
diversified, with 67 export markets in the 1972-73 fiscal year
being increased to 132 in the 1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Although Bangladesh's products found their way to more than 130
destinations, a core group of nine markets accounted for over 80
percent of the total export earnings in the 1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The United States was the largest export market for Bangladesh
in the 1997-98 fiscal year with an intake of 37.38 percent of its
total exports, followed by Germany, Britain, France, Italy, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Japan and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The first group of nine markets together contributed 81.11
percent to the total export earnings in the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The next important market areas, encompass Hong Kong, India,
Spain, China, Sweden, Pakistan, Denmark, Australia, Iran and the
United Arab Emirates. These markets together contributed 9.66
percent to the total export earnings while the rest of 107 markets
were responsible for lifting of only 9.23 percent of its
exportable in the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
All these progresses achieved by Bangladesh are attributed to
relentless efforts made by the government.
</P>
<P>
An incentive package has been formulated and incorporated in
the export policies in a bid to encourage investors and exporters
to go for diversified production and export.
</P>
<P>
The government decided last year that export policy would be
for five years instead of every year in the past, and this would
remove uncertainties resulting from frequent policy changes and
exporters would be in a better position to plan their export
activities towards product and market diversification.
</P>
<P>
The government has formed a national committee for export with
the prime minister as chairperson. Besides, a task force, advisory
council and an export promotion council are also working now.
</P>
<P>
All these measures taken by the government will yield good
results in further developing and diversifying the country's
export sector, said analysts here.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Albania's border city of Kukes
has been reinforced in preparation for a possible border war with
Yugoslavia's Kosovo, the official Albanian news agency ATA
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The tense situation on the border and the "frequent provocation
by Serb military forces" have prompted local authorities and the
armed forces to intensify their cooperation and take measures to
prepare for emergency, the ATA said.
</P>
<P>
"The emergency commissions have been set up in communes and
villages," said Lieutenant Colonel Zaim Noka, chief of the city's
District Mobilization Branch,.
</P>
<P>
Noka said cooperation with local government bodies has ensured
a regular recruitment of young men.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 tanks have been reportedly dispatched to Kukes,
northeastern Albania.

<HEADLINE> Trade Officials Predict Buyer's Market to Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We foresee that supply of some two-thirds among the 605 kinds
of major commodities will outstrip market demand," today's China
Daily quoted Guo Shouzhong, director-general of the market
forecast department under the SAIT's Business Information Center.
</P>
<P>
The prediction is based on a recent survey by the SAIT on the
supply of industrial and agricultural products, farming materials
and renewable resources in the country's large wholesale markets
and key retail enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Among the 605 major commodities, 167 items will achieve a
balance between supply and demand. And more than 72 percent of the
total surveyed, or 437 items, will present a supply over market
demand, which is 38.4 percent superior to that of the second half
of last year," said he.
</P>
<P>
The SAIT predicted that the supply of grain in the first half
of this year will be sufficient, while 31 out of 111 items of farm
produce, side-line and speciality foodstuffs, including soybean
milk, instant noodles, canned vegetables, and chocolate, will
outstrip market demand, which will have an adverse effect on
farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture, Chen Yaobang noted that China plans to
raise the growth rate of farmers' per capita net income to 4
percent this year from last year's 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates there is balance in the demand and supply
of pork, beef, mutton, eggs, sugar and mild powder. And a number
of industrial products, such as textiles, leather shoes, matches
and detergents, already face a saturated market.
</P>
<P>
Guo said that the repetitive production of substandard goods is
a waste of resources and should not be allowed to continue.

The program targeting lieutenant-colonels and colonels, could

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Army Chief Vows to Defend Kosovo "AT All Costs" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The defense of Kosovo is "of
the utmost national interest to Yugoslavia" and the Yugoslav army
is ready to defend the troubled Serbian province "at all costs,"
Yugoslav army chief General Dragoljub Djdanic said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech to army officers, Djdanic said: "If we
lose Kosovo, we lose Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
and the most sacred thing cherished in the hearts of the Yugoslav
people -- freedom."
</P>
<P>
The government was doing all it could to resolve the situation
in the troubled province through peaceful and political means,
said the general who assumed chief of staff last November.
</P>
<P>
"But if world power-wielders try to impose on us unacceptable
conditions," he warned, referring to the deployment of foreign
troops in the Yugoslav territory, then "we really have no other
choice but to respond to force by force."
</P>
<P>
The primary task of the Yugoslav army at the moment was to
heighten "combat readiness and readiness to defend Kosovo at all
costs," he told the army officers.
</P>
<P>
The United States and NATO have repeatedly indicated that NATO
will send ground troops to Kosovo whatever the result of the
ongoing talks at Rambouillet, France, and if the deployment should
be rejected by Yugoslavia, NATO will launch air strikes against
the country.
</P>
<P>
The six-nation Contact Group on the former Yugoslavia set a new
deadline of 1400 GMT Tuesday for the Serbs and ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo to reach a peace accord.

BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The State Council's
Information Office recently joined the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office in presenting a special symbol featuring the Arabic number
"99" to indicate China's resumption of exercise of sovereignty
over Macao later this year.
</P>
<P>
A symbol in the upper left hand corner resembles an auspicious
cloud, which indicates the number "19" to complete the Year 1999.
</P>
<P>
The red and green numbers represent the principle of "one
country, two systems," with red being the color of the national
flag of the People's Republic of China and green the color of the
regional flag for the Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR).
The emblem of the MSAR is inlaid in the green number.
</P>
<P>
An official representing the two offices said the symbol will
mainly be displayed at formal occasions celebrating Macao's return,
including meetings, forums, exhibitions and performances. The
symbol will also appear on souvenirs approved by the two offices.

<HEADLINE> Village Elections Now In Every Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guangdong last year began a pilot program for the direct
election, and by this January, some 2,000 among more than 20,000
villages in the province had elected their own leaders instead of
having to accept appointed officials. More villages are expected
to do the same before April.
</P>
<P>
In these elections, many farmers have given their trust to a
number of warm-hearted entrepreneurs, who, they believe, can lead
them to an even richer life.
</P>
<P>
In Datang Village in the city of Maoming, the farmers elected
Tang Fuhua, owner of a brick plant, as head of the village
committee. Tang is a businessman in his 50s with a reputation for
caring for others, since he donated to the building of local roads
and a school.
</P>
<P>
In his first two months in office, he has drawn up a blueprint
for upgrading the village's power supply system, water facilities,
and collective businesses.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has been a trailblazing province in China's opening-
up and reform and is better-off than most of other provinces. Its
building of a rural democratic system, however, has lagged behind
its economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Now, Guangdong has joined all the other provinces in building
democracy at the grass-roots level as part of the country's
political structure.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Bank Recapitalization to Save 59m </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia Director
Subarjo Joyosumarto said the bank recapitalization scheme is
inevitable because it will save the country 500 billion rupiah
(about 59 million U.S. dollars) a day.
</P>
<P>
"The government is set to speed up this program because losses
incurred by the current unsound banking sector, totaling 500
billion rupiah a day, will hamper the country's economic recovery
program," Subarjo said here Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will announce the widely-expected
results of the due diligence conducted under the recapitalization
program on February 27.
</P>
<P>
"We won't announce the bank closures on that day. We will only
reveal the results of the due diligence which will indicate the
banks that will be closed down," he was quoted by the Indonesian
Observer Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Subarjo said that at present there are 38 banks falling under
the C category, that is, banks with capital adequacy ratios of
below minus 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The losses incurred by the banks are due to
under-capitalization and mounting bad debts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Subarjo said this will be the first and the last
recapitalization program launched by the government. In the
future, unhealthy banks failing the "fit and proper" test will be
closed down.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister of Economy, Finance and Industry
Ginandjar Kartasasmita said recently the government plans to close
around 40 banks.
</P>
<P>
Under the recapitalization scheme, the government provides up
to 80 percent of the funds needed to recapitalize banks under the
B category with capital adequacy ratio of between minus 25 percent
and 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
To be eligible for the program, the banks must make available
20 percent of recapitalization funds as well as submit a sound
business plan.
</P>
<P>
The government will issue bonds to finance the program. In
return it will get non-voting equity in the banks. Interest on the
bonds is to be paid by the government.
</P>
<P>
Rumors and uncertainties over the liquidation are expected to
prompt runs on deposits, the Indonesian Observer said.
</P>
<P>
In the first batch of liquidations conducted in November 1997,
millions of depositors flocked to bank counters and automated
teller machines across the country.
</P>
<P>
Even the International Monetary Fund, who suggested the
closure, admitted later that the move had an unfavorable impact on
the credibility of the banking sector in the eyes of the public.
</P>
<P>
The recapitalization has drawn a negative response from many
people as it is considered a move to save bankers at the expense
of the people, the paper added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Tim Duncan and Mario Elie
picked up the slack for foul-plagued David Robinson as the San
Antonio Spurs rolled to an 85-64 victory over the Detroit Pistons,
who were held to the lowest total in franchise history on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Duncan recorded his fourth straight double-double with 17
points and 14 rebounds while Elie added 16 points in his first
start of the season, helping San Antonio snap a two-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
"We did some things better offensive today," Duncan said. "We
have to take that into our game tomorrow. If we keep pushing the
ball and get good movement, we"ll be OK."
</P>
<P>
Robinson scored just 10 points, playing only 15 minutes after
picking up his fourth foul in the first minute of the third
quarter. He also got into foul trouble in Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Spurs didn't need much from Robinson as Detroit shot just
26 percent (21-of-18) from the field and went nearly nine minutes
without a basket in the fourth quarter. The Pistons were held to
four foul shots in the period until Charles O'Bannon hit a jumper
with 3:06 remaining.
</P>
<P>
Hill scored 16 points for the Pistons but was just 5-of-21 from
the field. Jerry Stackhouse added 10 points on 3-of-13 shooting.
Detroit has lost six of its last seven after starting the season 3-
0.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Float More Eurobond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines will issue additional 50-million to 100-million-U.S.
dollar eurobond this week to raise more funds for paying off
maturing short-term debts, the Today newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Singson, governor of the Central Bank, was quoted as
saying that the bank's approval of the additional eurobond
issuance comes on the heels of the 300-million-U.S. dollar
eurobond flotation more than a week ago.
</P>
<P>
"We (still) have some short-term loans maturing soon," Singson
said.
</P>
<P>
The bond issuance will coincide with the government's road show
for the planned 500-million-U.S. dollar eurobond flotation, the
third time the Finance Department is tapping the international
markets for funds under the present administration.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has indicated it is open to more
foreign borrowings this year to remove upward pressure on domestic
interest rates, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
But they are divided on whether the government should continue
to pile up borrowings considering the country's growing debt
stock.
</P>
<P>
Some are concerned that the debt stock is growing too rapidly,
while others agree the twin objectives of hammering down domestic
interest rates and keeping the economy growing should be a
paramount concern.

<P>
BERLIN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna
used all her experience on Sunday to win Hanover's 500,000-dollar
Grand Prix tournament for the second time, 6-4, 6-4 over teenager
Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
Top seeded Novotna rallied from 3-1 down in the first set
before prevailing in the battle of the two top seeds after one
hour 28 minutes. The 30-year-old Czech now leads the series
against Williams 3-0 and got an 80,000 dollars cheque.
</P>
<P>
Williams, aged 18, was unable to repeat her strong showing from
the previous night when the American claimed her first career win
in her third meeting against German star Steffi Graf. She
committed a flurry of unforced errors and rarely found an answer
to Novotna's aggressive serve and volley game.
</P>
<P>
Both players had a nervous start into the final as four of the
first five games went to the receiving player. World number six
Williams lost four straight games to give up a 3-1 lead and lost
the set 6-4 after 36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In the second, Novotna broke for 4-3. Williams bounced back to
4-4, but immediately dropped serve again to fall behind 5-4.
</P>
<P>
World number three Novotna needed to save another break point
in the 10th game before she wrapped up matters with a backhand
passing shot to add a second title here to the one she took in
1994.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Yugoslavia to Accept Foreign Military's Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini on Sunday urged Yugoslavia to accept the presence of a
multinational force in the country to monitor a peace deal on
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Serb President Milan
Milutinovic, Dini, who took part in the EU foreign ministers'
meeting in Luxembourg on Sunday, said it was essential that
Belgrade give its consent to the force's deployment before the new
Tuesday deadline set by the six-nation Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
"If we miss this unrepeatable opportunity to resolve the matter,
we risk sparking off a conflict that would last generations and a
humanitarian catastrophe," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
A Saturday deadline for the peace talks underway at Rambouillet
in France was extended after the Kosovo ethnic Albanian and
Yugoslav delegations both asked for more time to remove final
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
For the part of Yugoslavia, the main problem is the presence of
foreign troops on its territory.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kosovo ethnic Albanians are insisting on holding a
referendum on Kosovo's independence after a three-year
transitional period.
</P>
<P>
Dini told reporters in Luxembourg that it was wrong to think
the main problems came from the Serb side. "There are knots to be
unraveled on both sides," he said.

BERLIN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Terrence Malick's gripping

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chairman Yassir
Arafat arrived in Bonn Sunday evening for talks with German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and other Bonn government officials.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was scheduled to meet Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping
Sunday evening before his talks Monday with Schroeder and other
cabinet ministers during his second visit to Bonn in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Bild am Sonntag newspaper Sunday,
Arafat said he was prepared to declare a Palestinian state
sometime after the May 4 date when the Oslo peace agreement
expires.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people "have the right to declare an
independent state. We cannot continue this way in a political
vacuum. We will call on all our friends in the Arab world, with
members of the EU, the United States, Japan and Israel, to believe
in this state," Arafat was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Arafat pledged that an independent Palestinian state would
guarantee the "peace, security and stability of the Middle East."
He did not comment on whether he would delay a declaration of
independence past the May 4 date so as not to influence the May 17
general election in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader said he would like to deepen social,
cultural, scientific, economic and political ties between Germany
and the Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
He specifically mentioned German-Palestinian joint venture
projects in the Palestinian areas, such as Siemens' participation
in the construction of the Gaza airport.

WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes
attacked an Iraqi missile base and two military communication
sites Sunday after Iraqi jets "violated the no-fly zone," the U.S.
military said.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word on damage or casualties from the
strikes near al-Amarah and Tallil, about 270 kilometers southeast
of Baghdad. All the planes returned to their base, a statement
from the U.S. Central Command said.

<P>
The statement claimed the strikes were launched after two Iraqi
jets violated the zone in southern Iraq. There was no immediate

</P>
<P>
U.S. and British planes patrolling the no-fly zones over
southern and northern Iraq have regularly clashed with Iraqi
defense and aircraft. Iraq has said it does not recognize the
zones.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, the official Iraqi News Agency said Iraqi air
defenses may have shot down a Western military plane in southern
Iraq. But the U.S. and Britain denied any planes were lost.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has made several claims in the past about shooting down
Western planes, but none of them has proved to be correct,
according to the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
The zones were set up after the 1991 Gulf War to protect "rebel
Shiite Muslim groups" in the south and Kurdish guerrillas in the
north from Iraqi government forces.
</P>
<P>
The Western planes patrolling the two zones are based in Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait in the south and Turkey in the north.
