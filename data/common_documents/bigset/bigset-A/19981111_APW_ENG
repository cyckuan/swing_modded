Singapore committee announces measures to cut business costs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE _ As Singapore slumps into recession, a
government-linked committee reviewing the city-state's economic
competitiveness announced much-awaited measures to slash business
costs by billions of dollars.
	   The move, announced Wednesday, would trim business expenses by a
massive 10 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 6 billion) a year,
reducing corporate costs by about 15 percent annually. The cuts
equal about 7 percent of Singapore's entire gross domestic product.
	   Aimed at easing the pain of Singapore's first economic downturn
in 13 years, the package recommends major cuts in wages and pension
contributions, reduced land and factory rentals, slashed levies and
service charges, and lower taxes.
	   ``We must act decisively to restore our competitiveness and
enable our economy to weather the crisis,'' said the wide-ranging
report from the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness, which
comprises government and business representatives.
	   Although Parliament is scheduled to discuss the package on Nov.
23, the government is widely expected to implement most or all of
the recommended measures.
	   Topping the agenda are labor costs.
	   During more prosperous times, rising wages and pension
contributions did not pose a major problem, said the report. But
``economic conditions have totally changed and we are competing for
a shrinking economic pie.''
	   Employers' payments to the mandatory, state-run pension fund
should be slashed in half, from 20 percent of a worker's salary to
10 percent, said the committee. Overall wage-related costs should
be reduced by about 15 percent, including unspecified wage cuts.
	   The government should also ``reduce, or extend rebates for
government taxes like corporate and personal income taxes'' next
year.
	   But Singapore's Trade and Industry Minister Lee Yock Suan _ who
chairs the committee _ said there is only limited room to cut
corporate taxes, which stand at 26 percent, just above a long-term
goal of 25 percent.
	   The government-appointed panel also recommended cuts in gas
taxes, utility charges, levies on using foreign workers, and
industrial rentals.
	   Noting that Singapore has enjoyed robust average annual growth
of 8.9 percent since independence in 1965, the report concedes that
the economy has quickly deteriorated since the start of the
regional crisis in mid-1997.
	   The vulnerable city-state just posted its first quarterly
contraction since the last recession in the mid-1980s. The
government announced Tuesday that Singapore's economy is
technically in recession and could contract as much as 1 percent
next year.
	   The committee ruled out measures to stimulate domestic demand
because ``Singapore's small size and heavy dependence on global
export markets'' would make such a move ineffective.
	   The report warns that while labor costs have gradually risen to
levels much higher than its competitors, the sharp depreciation of
regional currencies against the relatively strong Singapore dollar
``has worsened our competitiveness further.''
	   Devaluing the local currency would ultimately hurt the economy
and tarnish the Southeast Asian financial center's reputation, said
the report, concluding that restoring business competitiveness
through cost-cutting is the only solution.
	   Singapore must also reform and strengthen its economic structure
to position itself for renewed growth once the regional slowdown
subsides, it said.
	   In addition to short-term measures, the committee outlined broad
strategies to ``make Singapore the first developed economy in the
tropics within the next 10 years.''

Macqueen says results not important
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ An Australian rugby team weakened by
the loss of seven leading players set out for Europe on Wednesday
with coach Rod Macqueen playing down the significance of tests
against France and England.
	   Macqueen said the Wallabies' main goal was to work on
combinations ahead of next year's World Cup.
	   ``In terms of results the tour's not all that important,''
Macqueen said. ``It's obviously important to win every game we can,
but it's certainly important for our depth, one year out from the
World Cup.''
	   Australia is in a similar position to England earlier this
season when it sent a weakened team Down Under and suffered a
record 76-0 loss in Brisbane.
	   ``It's going to be a very hard tour _ we're playing the two best
sides in the northern hemisphere and we've only got one match
preparation after being out of it for six or seven weeks and
they're in season,'' Macqueen said.
	   Australia has picked a near-Test outfit for the match against
France A in Lille on Sunday before the test against France on Nov.
21 and England on Nov. 28.
	   Veteran hooker Phil Kearns acknowledged Australia would be
vulnerable without regular test players Matt Burke, Ben Tune, Tim
Horan, Damian Smith, Dan Crowley and Richard Harry.
	   ``Hopefully we won't be weaker, we've got those injuries, but
hopefully the guys will slot in pretty well,'' Kearns said
Wednesday. ``It certainly does put a little bit of pressure on us _
they're obviously out for revenge. They've been talking about it
for the last couple of months and talking the whole situation up.''

Tamil Tiger leader to be tried in absentia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Velupillai Prabhakaran and seven other
leaders of the Tamil Tiger rebels will be tried in absentia for the
1996 bombing of the Sri Lankan capital's business district in which
78 people were killed, court officials said Wednesday.
	   Judge A.W. Somawansa ordered the trial Tuesday after prosecution
lawyers said Prabhakaran, who heads the separatist Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, was living in the northern jungles of Sri
Lanka which are not under the control of government troops.
	   Prabhakaran, 42, and seven other guerrillas were indicted for
the January 1996 bombing of the Central Bank that reduced Colombo's
business district to rubble. The massive truck bomb killed 78
people and wounded 1,400.
	   Police filed charges against the rebels but the cases could not
proceed because most of the accused are in hiding. Two of the eight
are in custody.
	   Last year, a Sri Lankan judge ordered newspaper advertisements
calling on the Tamil Tiger leader to surrender.
	   Each of the eight men are facing 90 charges, including 78 counts
of murder. Prosecutors have listed 472 witnesses.
	   Prabhakaran already has been sentenced to death by a court in
India for involvement in the 1991 assassination of former Indian
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. He has denied ordering the killing.
	   Prabhakaran also is wanted for the 1994 killing of Sri Lankan
opposition presidential candidate Gamini Dissanayake and for the
1996 bombing of a passenger train in Colombo in which 64 civilians
were killed and 400 wounded.
	   Prabhakaran founded the LTTE in 1973, demanding a separate state
in Sri Lanka's northeast for minority Tamils who comprise 18
percent of the country's 18.5 million people. Tamils claim
discrimination by the majority Sinhalese who dominate the
government and military.
	   The antagonism flared into open war after anti-Tamil riots in
1983. Since then, more than 55,000 people have been killed in
fighting between government troops and the Tamil Tigers.
	   The Tigers are notorious for using suicide bombers to attack
military and economic targets and political leaders. Few rebel
fighters have been captured alive because they carry vials of
cyanide which they consume when they fear capture.

Official: Infrastructure hinders investment in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's poor infrastructure remains a
key hindrance in attracting foreign investment to one of the
world's poorest countries, a government official said Wednesday.
	   The government has been trying to improve the investment
environment by passing regulations like one that recently cut the
land-lease rate, said Le Bo Linh, vice director of the Institute of
World Economy at the National Center for Social and Human Sciences.
	   ``But a very important factor for foreign investment which we
cannot supply overnight is infrastructure,'' Linh told a news
conference for the local release of an annual report by the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
	   Linh said other legal obstacles also remain. Many foreign
investors in Vietnam complain about red tape and conflicting
regulations that put too much power in the hands of officials.
	   Foreign direct investment in Vietnam and other Asian countries
has slowed since the Asian economic crisis hit last year and has
created greater competition in the region for such capital.
	   UNCTAD official Philippe R. Brusick said, however, that many
companies, particularly in Europe, are looking for judicious
long-term investments.
	   ``One way is to find bargains in countries like Vietnam that
have become even cheaper'' to operate in, he said.

Reports: Thais explain missed reform deadlines to IMF
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai officials have been required to
explain to an International Monetary Fund team why an Oct. 31
deadline for key reform legislation has been missed, newspapers
reported Wednesday.
	   The IMF team is in Bangkok until Nov. 23 to review Thailand's
progress during the fifth quarter of a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout of
the Thai economy and to negotiate policies and targets for the
upcoming sixth quarter.
	   According to the IMF, Thailand had a deadline of Oct. 31 to
complete 11 pieces of legislation on issues such as bankruptcy,
foreclosure and alien business registration. The reforms are seen
as vital to lifting Thailand out of its worst recession in decades.
	   Savit Bhotiwihok, minister in Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's
office, told reporters that the government believed it had met the
terms of the agreement by pushing the legislation through first
readings, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   Two additional readings are required in Parliament before a vote
on passage can be taken. However, the IMF apparently took Oct. 31
as the deadline for the implementation of the new legislation.
	   Savit's office said he had left the country Wednesday and was
unavailable for comment. IMF officials were involved in talks, but
they almost never comment during their regular assessment visits to
the country.
	   The visiting IMF team also asked for further details on new
agencies and processes involved with the planned privatization of
dozens of state enterprises.
	   Thailand has otherwise been widely praised for its reform
efforts and its adherence to the terms of the IMF program, which
are seen as a litmus test of the kinds of measures that will
succeed in lifting Asia and other emerging markets out of their
present crisis.
	   Several programs and laws needed to implement and finance
government programs for the restructuring and recapitalization of
financial institutions were pushed through by emergency decree for
subsequent approval by Parliament.

Mexican authorities link massacre to violent drug gang
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to add details of police investigation,
suspects. &QL; 
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The massacre of 19 people in a small northern
Mexican community has been linked to the country's most violent
drug gang, officials said Tuesday.
	   In one of the bloodiest drug-related massacres in Mexico, an
alleged drug trafficker and 18 members of his extended family _
including eight children _ were roused from their beds Sept. 17 by
gunmen who lined them up against a wall and shot them with
automatic weapons.
	   The gunmen's target, a Pei Pei Indian named Fermin Castro, died
two weeks later of complications from two bullet wounds.
	   Deputy Attorney General Jose Luis Ramos Rivera said three
suspects had been arrested, and warrants have been issued for 10
others _ one of whom may be hiding in the United States.
	   The gunmen were members of a gang led by a man known by his
associates as ``Lino Quintana,'' whose armed group works for drug
kingpin Ramon Arellano Felix, said Gen. Guillermo Alvarez, who
coordinates anti-drug efforts at the judicial police.
	   Ramon Arellano Felix was placed on the FBI's 10 most wanted list
last year, and U.S. federal authorities have offered a dlrs 2
million reward for information leading to his arrest.
	   He and three of his brothers are fugitives who control major
routes funneling cocaine, marijuana and other drugs into the United
States across the California-Mexico border, authorities said.
	   Mexican authorities have sought the brothers since 1993.
	   Alvarez and federal prosecutors said Quintana's gang killed
Castro to keep his marijuana-trafficking operation from growing
into a potential competitor.
	   Authorities said they solved the case after two people were
murdered Oct. 29 by gunmen wearing the same military-style uniforms
as those worn in the September massacre near the northern coastal
resort of Ensenada.
	   Descriptions gathered from survivors of the two attacks led to
the arrest of Armando Villegas, who said he was present during both
slayings. Villegas directed authorities to a ranch in Rosarito,
Baja California, where investigators found guns and uniforms
allegedly used by the gunmen.
	   Alvarez said the gunmen in Ensenada were especially brutal
because they had consumed large amounts of alcohol and cocaine
prior to the attack.
	   He said Quintana's gang had used military uniforms apparently
bought in the United States, and insisted Mexican soliders were not
involved in the massacre, as local media have speculated.
	   He said five soldiers who had been under house arrest during the
investigation have been cleared of any involvement in the killings
and released.
	   Mexican officials have asked U.S. authorities to help locate the
suspect thought to be hiding in the United States, Alvarez said. He
declined to name the suspect.

	   CHOLUTECA, Honduras (AP) _ Once the tide ebbed, rescuers could
venture out in the delta that flows into the Gulf of Fonseca,
plunging hip-deep into a river of mud in search of a man's body.
	   The man had been swept dozens of miles downstream from the
grieving town of Choluteca, one of dozens missing after Hurricane
Mitch unleashed deadly flooding in the Choluteca River.
	   At first, there were so many bodies that rescuers burned them on
the spot after finding them. Later, they were ordered to try and
identify every victim, or at least leave them be in hopes that
someone could.
	   Slogging through and over the 10-foot (3-meter)-deep muck, a
medical examiner took a quick look at the nude male victim tangled
in branches. He checked the teeth, jotted down a few notes and then
left.
	   ``There is nothing we can do with him, no place we can take
him,'' the examiner said.
	   These were among the many grim scenes played out across
Choluteca, a southern city of 100,000.
	   Behind the hospital, workers buried 30 bodies in a mass grave
Monday in a garbage dump littered with syringes and IV bags. The
town cemetery had been destroyed by flooding.
	   Flooding moved the Choluteca River some 200 yards (182 meters)
in places, depositing giant piles of sand that whipped up in the
hot, dry wind.
	   Debris was so deep that in some neighborhoods, residents removed
the red tiles from their roofs _ now at ground level _ in order to
dig down into their homes to salvage their possessions.
	   ``I'm just trying to find anything I can save. All there is left
are memories,'' Dionisa Sanchez said as she held her crying
grandson.
	   Mexican army helicopters delivered food and water, and CARE and
the Red Cross sent in the first aid shipments by land this week.
Churches _ Mormon, evangelical, Roman Catholic _ opened their doors
to the homeless.
	   In one Mormon church, children slept on mats on white tile
floors. Two boys, about 7, lay motionless in a separate room,
running high fevers.
	   Still in shock, many Cholutecans said they didn't know where to
go or what to do. In the blazing heat, Florencia Carnales sat
forlornly on a bed, surrounded by dinner chairs she had managed to
salvage.
	   Despite a nationwide curfew, other residents spent their nights
outdoors, atop patches of land where their homes once stood, to
protect anything that might remain below.
	   Come dawn, they rose to gather the hundreds of tree stumps
littering the city _ the wood could be used for fuel, or perhaps to
rebuild.

Women's group says Japan needs more female corporate executives
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARI YAMAGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Female executives are vastly underrepresented in
corporate boardrooms in Japan, the world's second-largest economic
power, an international women's group said Wednesday.
	   Only 0.2 percent of corporate directors in Japan are women,
compared to 11.1 percent in the United States and 5 percent in
Britain, according to Women Board Directors International, a
Washington-based non-profit organization.
	   ``These are all pathetic numbers,'' Irene Natividad,
co-president of the group, told a press briefing ahead of a meeting
with 16 Japanese women executives later in the day.
	   But Japan, which ranks last among industrialized economies in
the number of women executives, looks particularly bad considering
its global strength, Natividad said.
	   At most, the majority of Japanese companies give only one board
seat to women, she said, citing the group's latest report which
will be sent to all 2,396 Japanese companies listed on stock
exchanges throughout the nation.
	   The group is here to expand their global networks and discuss
ways to bring more women into executive positions, especially at
Japanese companies operating internationally.
	   Multinational automobile, electronics and computer companies,
which represent Japan's primacy in the global market, are
completely male dominated, while those that have opened up board
seats for women tend to be medium-sized concerns, she said.
	   ``Companies with major international presence, or name-brand
companies, do not have women on their boards,'' Natividad said.
	   Japanese women are conspicuously absent from most areas of
society traditionally dominated by men. For example, they account
for only 8 percent of legislators in Parliament.
	   And although women account for nearly half of the nation's
workforce only a small number are on the career track, with the
majority confined to part-time jobs offering little challenge.
	   ``Glass ceilings for women in business have also created glass
ceilings in boardrooms,'' said Natividad, who heads her own company
in the United States, and serves as a director of Sallie Mae Corp.,
a major student loan company.
	   Amid a nagging economic crisis, women in Japan and the rest of
Asia tend to be the first affected in the workplace, often getting
the boot when companies decide to cut costs.
	   That, other group members say, is why women should come together
and raise awareness about how they can contribute to making
corporations more successful.
	   ``You have to insist that women are capable,'' said co-president
Jean Sisco, who holds directorships at several leading companies,
including Textron Corp. a major U.S. aircraft maker. ``The women
have to be willing, too.''

	   TAMPA, Florida (AP) _ Kevin Stevens had three goals and two
assists and Ulf Samuelsson scored twice as the New York Rangers
beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 10-2 Tuesday night.
	   The Rangers entered the game as the NHL's lowest-scoring team
with 24 goals. After scoring 18 goals in their first 12 games, the
Rangers have erupted for 16 in their last two.
	   The Rangers last scored 10 goals in a game on Dec. 13, 1992 in a
10-5 victory over Montreal.
	   Stevens completed his first hat trick since Jan. 11, 1994 with
5:16 left to play. He recorded five points in a game for the first
time since Oct. 17, 1992.
	   Daymond Langkow and Enrico Ciccone, who scored his first goal
since Feb. 6, 1997, scored for Tampa Bay.
 &UR; Sabres 2, Senators 2 &QC; 
	   In Buffalo, New York, Curtis Brown's shorthanded goal and
Dominik Hasek's 38 saves helped Buffalo extend its unbeaten streak
to six games with a tie against Ottawa.
	   Senators goaltender Damian Rhodes stopped 21 shots, including a
spectacular diving glove save on Miroslav Satan with eight minutes
left in the third period that preserved the tie.
	   Hasek made 34 straight saves during the game and is now 17-4-2
against the Senators.
 &UR; Penguins 3, Islanders 2
	   In Pittsburgh, Robert Lang and Martin Straka scored in the
second period to help the Pittsburgh Penguins beat the New York
Islanders and win their first home game.
	   Pittsburgh had been 0-1-3 at home and the last NHL team without
a win on home ice. Overall, the Penguins are unbeaten in four
(2-0-2) while the Islanders have lost three of four.
	   Lang scored 54 seconds into the second period to break a 1-1
tie. Straka made it 3-1 with his fifth goal at 11:29.
 &UR; Blues 5, Blackhawks 2
	   In St. Louis, Pierre Turgeon had three goals and Pavol Demitra
had two goals and three assists to lead the St. Louis Blues over
the struggling Chicago Blackhawks.
	   The Blackhawks, held to only 14 shots, are winless in their last
seven games (0-6-1) and 3-6-2 in their last 11.
	   The Blues lead 2-0 after the first period on power-play goals by
Demitra and Turgeon and never looked back.
	   St. Louis outshot Chicago 41-14. The 14 shots are a season low
for the Blackhawks.
 &UR; Avalanche 1, Coyotes 1
	   In Phoenix, Keith Tkachuk of Phoenix scored in the second period
after Peter Forsberg had sent the Colorado Avalanche to an early
lead over the Coyotes, and the teams finished in a tie.
	   The Coyotes ran their unbeaten streak to six while posting the
best 10-game start in franchise history at 6-2-2. The former
Winnipeg Jets, who entered the NHL in 1979, were 6-3-1 after 10
games in the 1993-94 season.
	   Phoenix goaltender Jimmy Waite made 20 saves and maintained his
goal-a-game average. The Coyotes' defense, meanwhile, continued to
be the stingiest in the NHL (16 goals allowed).
	   Colorado's Patrick Roy (2-7-2) had 24 saves.
 &UR; Flames 5, Kings 4, OT
	   In Calgary, Alberta, Andrew Cassels scored in overtime as the
Calgary Flames rallied from a three-goal deficit to defeat the Los
Angeles Kings.
	   The Flames trailed 3-0 midway through the second period and were
down 4-2 with less than 10 minutes left in regulation when Cory
Stillman and Derek Morris scored to tie things up.
	   At 1:12 of the extra period, Cassels broke in alone and scored
on rookie goaltender Ryan Bach after Kings defenseman Steve
Duchesne lost his balance at his own blue line.
	   Theoren Fleury and Valeri Bure also scored for the Flames, who
have won four of their last five games. Luc Robitaille, Glen
Murray, Olli Jokinen, and Vladidmir Tsyplakov each had a goal and
an assist for the Kings.

Japanese men seek charisma of crocodiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Orders are pouring in for crocodile
penises from Japanese men looking to use the ancient reptile to
boost their sex life, an Australian producer said Wednesday.
	   ``We've had a lot of inquiries from Japan for crocodile penis,
which sells for Australian dollars 2,000 a kilogram (about U.S.
dlrs 630 a pound), and I intend to tap into that market,'' said
Andrew Cross, owner of the Southern Cross Crocodile farm in
Queensland state.
	   Just bigger than a man's little finger and weighing about one
ounce (30 grams) each, it would take more than 30 animals to fill
one order, he said.
	   Cross said Japanese herbalists dry the penises, which are then
ground into a powder for sale to men anxious to increase their sex
drive.
	   ``I have no idea if it works but crocodiles are mysterious
animals and apparently Japanese men believe the powder helps them
take on all the reptile's mysterious powers,'' he said.
	   Cross said the crocodile's reputation as an ancient animal which
has survived unchanged since the time of the dinosaurs captured the
imagination of people around the world.
	   He's received orders to make crocodile belts for Taiwanese
soccer teams who believed this would give them supernatural powers
on the playing field.
	   Crocodile feet are made into backscratchers for local tourists,
and the internal organs are used in Chinese medicine.
	   The skin is also in demand and can fetch Australian dollars 20 a
centimeter (U.S. dlrs 30 an inch) for the average 40-centimeter
(15-inch) skin from an adult reptile. Crocs are usually culled at
three years.
	   Crocodile meat is also sold in gourmet restaurants for around
Australian dollars 22 a kilogram (U.S. dlrs 6.30 a pound), about
twice the price of top beef cuts, Cross said.

Report: Thai premier to urge Malaysia to ease capital controls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai will urge
his Malaysian counterpart, Mahathir Mohamad, to ease controversial
currency controls on the ringgit, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Chuan will use his official visit in Kuala Lumpur next week to
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit to urge Mahathir
to change the controls to facilitate border trade.
	   Kobsak Chutikul, spokesman of the Thai Foreign Ministry, was
quoted by The Nation newspaper as saying Chuan hopes ``Malaysia
will treat the issue in the light of close neighborly ties.''
	   Malaysia has abandoned self-imposed austerity measures to cope
with an economic downturn due to the regional crisis. The currency
controls and economic stimulus package he introduced were at odds
with measures being taken in most stricken countries.
	   Malaysia fixed the ringgit at 3.8 to the U.S. dollar, banned
trading in ringgit outside the country and limited Malaysians and
non-residents to carrying only 1,000 ringgit abroad.
	   Thai officials have said the selective currency controls had
adversely affected Thai-Malaysian border trade and tourism.
	   Malaysians are the biggest foreign tourists in Thailand, most of
them crossing the border to visit the southern part of the country.

Israeli warplanes blast suspected guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israel's warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon Wednesday for the second
time in two days, Lebanese security officials said.
	   The planes fired at least six missiles at three bases of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, opposite the Israeli-occupied zone,
between 5:20 a.m. (0320 GMT) and 6:00 a.m. (0400 GMT), the
officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The targets were in Apple Province and about 12 kilometers
(seven miles) north of this southern market town. The area is often
used to launch attacks against Israeli troops in southern Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah said it suffered no casualties in the raids.
	   On Tuesday, Israeli jets also struck Hezbollah strongholds in
southern Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is a Shiite Muslim fundamentalist
group that is fighting to oust the Israeli army and its proxy South
Lebanon Army militia from south Lebanon.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to curb guerrilla attacks against
its northern territory.

U.S. negotiator cites progress on Kyoto global warming treaty

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The chief U.S. envoy to a global
warming summit says he is encouraged by the pace of negotiations
for enacting the Kyoto climate treaty curbing greenhouse gas
pollution.
	   Speaking hours before the U.N. convention entered its final
phase, Stuart Eizenstat said Tuesday night that talks were
accelerating. He also reaffirmed the Clinton administration's
commitment to signing the treaty before a March deadline.
	   Eizenstat did not give specifics of the talks, involving more
than 160 nations, which are to close Friday with a blueprint for
enacting the December 1997 Kyoto treaty.
	   ``I'm seeing real engagement, if not yet full agreement between
(developed) countries and developing countries on a whole range of
issues,'' Eizenstat said.
	   He wouldn't comment on precisely when the treaty might be
signed, saying there has been no final decision. Congressional
sources in Washington, however, said the administration was
considering signing it as soon as this week.
	   Every key industrial nation except the United States is among
the 57 signatories thus far. Only Fiji has ratified the pact.
	   Last year in Kyoto, Japan, countries agreed that industrialized
nations should, by 2012, cut their pollution output by an average
of 5 percent below 1990 levels. At stake is the gradual and
potentially destructive warming of the atmosphere through the
burning of coal, oil and gas.
	   Many scientists believe Earth is gradually warming because of
what are known as greenhouse gas emissions _ mainly carbon dioxide
from factories, power plants and automobiles.
	   Critics say global warming scenarios have not been proven and
that the pact threatens American industry. Proponents of the treaty
say it won't force costly measures on American companies to cut
pollution.
	   A political battle in Congress about whether to sign and later
ratify the Kyoto treaty has reached Buenos Aires.
	   U.S. congressional opponents of the Kyoto accord said the
meeting has not addressed key American demands _ especially a call
for developing nations to voluntarily pledge pollution reductions.
	   ``As this treaty stands now, it will not be ratified by the U.S.
Senate. It's dead on arrival,'' said Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner
Jr., a Wisconsin Republican.
	   When 160 nations kicked off the summit Nov. 2, an Argentine
effort to add the issue of voluntary pollution limits to the agenda
was quickly rebuffed.
	   Martin Bartenstein, an Austrian delegate speaking on behalf of
the European Union, said he felt voluntary commitments should be
welcomed.
	   ``We know in the long term that climate change can only be
combated on a worldwide basis,'' he said at a Tuesday evening news
conference. ``Industrialized countries have to take the lead.
There's no doubt about it. But there will be a time coming when it
will have to be a global effort.''
	   Developing nations and many European countries argue the United
States must do more domestically to curb greenhouse emissions. Some
U.S. lawmakers agreed.
	   ``We are the leading emitter of gases which cause global
warming. We cannot walk away from this problem,'' said Rep. Pete
DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat.

Anwar trial judge rejects conspiracy theory, trumped-up charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with testimony, comments from proceedings &QL; 
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The judge at the trial of Anwar
Ibrahim on Wednesday rejected defense attempts to show the former
Malaysian deputy prime minister is the victim of a political
conspiracy and trumped-up charges.
	   Anwar maintains the sex and corruption charges against him stem
from his rivalry with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   The criminal proceedings have cast a shadow over next week's
summit of 21 government leaders, with critics saying the case
demonstrates human rights abuses in this Southeast Asian nation.
	   During Wednesday's proceedings, defense lawyer Christopher
Fernando hinted there were irregularities with the letter
announcing Anwar's firing on Sept. 2.
	   ``The defense of the accused is that there was a political
conspiracy to bring the trumped-up charges, to remove the accused
and to destroy him politically,'' Fernando said.
	   Judge Augustine Paul cut him short, asserting: ``What you say
sounds like a political speech.''
	   Undeterred, Fernando shot back: ``There was a conspiracy. We
will endeavor to show that the crucial witnesses of the prosecution
would be lying in court.''
	   He said that pursuing the conspiracy and trumped-up charges
theory was vital to getting to the truth of the matter.
	   Judge Paul overruled him, saying: ``I honestly do not think that
has any bearing.''
	   The day before, Anwar had told reporters that his one-time
patron, Prime Minister Mahathir, was losing support both at home
and abroad.
	   ``Foreign leaders can no longer tolerate him anymore. He's
becoming recalcitrant,'' the 51-year-old Anwar said. He said many
Malaysians also rejected Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Later that evening, Mahathir defended his sacking of Anwar as
the country's No. 2 official, and said he believed Anwar would
receive a fair trial. Mahathir also said the charges showed that
Anwar was morally unfit to lead this country of 22 million people.
	   ``There is no way that anybody can say that Malaysian courts
just favor the government,'' the 72-year-old prime minister said in
a television interview. ``They are very fair to everyone and I am
quite sure they will be fair to Anwar also.''
	   The High Court started Wednesday's session by hearing closing
comments from Abdul Aziz Hussin, the intelligence officer who
testified he had forced two key witnesses to retract their
allegations of sexual misconduct against Anwar.
	   Prosecutors allege that Anwar ordered the retractions last year
as part of a cover-up attempt. The alleged cover-up resulted in the
four corruption charges that make up the current phase of the
trial.
	   He will be tried on another charge of corruption, as well as
five sexual misconduct charges, at a later date.
	   Before Wednesday's session started, Judge Paul told Anwar's
lawyers the defendant should avoid making statements relating to
the case.
	   While sitting in the defendant's dock, Anwar has made various
comments critical of the proceedings.
	   ``In the interest of justice, I ask this to be stopped,'' Paul
said.
	   The criminal proceedings will be suspended during next week's
summit of the 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

North Korean residents hold protest rally against harassment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ About 1,300 North Korean residents in Japan rallied
Wednesday to protest the harassment that has erupted since the
communist state fired a rocket in August.
	   Kim Tae Hwi, an organizer of the rally at a Tokyo hall, said
Japanese ultrarightists have shouted slogans over loudspeakers
while driving by Korean schools and the offices of the General
Association of Korean Residents in Japan, a pro-North Korean group.
	   The group has also complained about receiving death threats and
envelopes with razor blades inside.
	   It plans to hand chief government spokesman Hiromu Nonaka a
letter demanding an end to the harassment and the quick arrests of
any suspects, association spokesman Pak Kyong Ryol said.
	   Nearly 40 cases of harassment against Koreans across Japan have
been reported since North Korea fired a rocket that flew over Japan
and landed in the Pacific.
	   Last Thursday, two men stabbed a Korean schoolgirl at a Tokyo
train station with a knife, leaving her with minor injuries to her
hand, Pak said.
	   Last week, bottles filled with burning gasoline were tossed into
the grounds of the association's headquarters in Tokyo and nearby
Yokohama, but no one was injured.
	   On Oct. 15, the charred body of Ra Hun, a worker at an
association branch office east of Tokyo, was found after a fire
razed the building. Police suspect arson.
	   There have been no arrests in any of the attacks.
	   About 640,000 Koreans live in Japan, many of them descendants of
workers forcibly brought here during Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule
over the Korean Peninsula.

Arab breaks taboo and runs for Jerusalem city council

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two new arterial highways slice through the
small Arab village of Beit Safafa in eastern Jerusalem, cutting the
community into four isolated parts.
	   Though much of the village's land was expropriated to make room
for the highways, the planners didn't give residents any access to
them.
	   It was the roads through his birthplace that finally led Moussa
Aliyan, a prosperous insurance salesman and father of five, to
break the Arab taboo against running for Jerusalem's city council.
	   Undeterred by calls for a boycott against him and even death
threats, Aliyan ran as an independent Tuesday and said it was time
Jerusalem's Arab minority stood up for its rights.
	   ``Because we have no representatives on the city council, the
Israeli parties divide up the cake among themselves and we are left
with nothing but the crumbs,'' the 47-year-old told The Associated
Press on Tuesday.
	   Official results were expected late Wednesday.
	   Israeli-Arabs account for about 1 million of Israel's 6 million
people, and long have complained of discrimination. They have full
voting rights, but aren't required to serve in the army like
Israeli Jews and receive less government funding than the Jewish
majority.
	   Aliyan was born on the Israeli side of Beit Safafa. The village
was split after Israel's 1948 war against the Arabs and half of its
Arab residents became Israeli citizens. The others lived under
Jordanian rule. The village was reunited after the 1967 Mideast
war.
	   Since then, most of the Palestinians who fell under Israeli rule
have boycotted the municipal elections. The Palestinian Authority
maintains that sitting on the city council or even voting implies
recognition of Israel's rule over east Jerusalem, which
Palestinians claim as their future capital.
	   Although Aliyan is an Israeli citizen because of where and when
he was born, the vast majority of the 160,000 Palestinians living
in east Jerusalem refused Israeli citizenship after the 1967 war.
	   The Palestinian Authority's senior representative in the city,
Faisal Husseini, held a recent press conference urging Arab
residents to maintain the boycott, and loudspeaker vans drove
through Arab neighborhoods on the eve of the vote urging residents
to stay home.
	   But Aliyan said the boycott has only hurt Jerusalem's Arabs.
Services in Arab neighborhoods still lag far behind those in Jewish
parts of the city. In Beit Safafa, for example, entire
neighborhoods have no modern sewage system. Street lighting is
woefully inadequate. Some roads are unpaved, garbage collection is
irregular. Schools are neglected, with broken windows and no air
conditioning.
	   Worst of all, Aliyan said, the city has failed to provide a
pedestrian bridge across one of the six-lane highways bisecting the
village. ``Several of our residents have been killed and many more
injured. We pay 100 percent of our municipal taxes and get about
five percent of the services to which we are entitled.''
	   Sitting on a sofa in his large home, which also served as his
campaign headquarters, Aliyan was surrounded Tuesday night by
relatives who had helped out with the campaign. Neighbors and
friends stopped by to wish him luck and ask for directions to
polling stations.
	   In the middle of it all, he took a break to say his prayers,
kneeling down on a traditional Muslim prayer mat in his home.
	   Aliyan was not the only Israeli-Arab to run for a spot on the
city council. A handful of others followed his lead.
	   He certainly had the highest profile, however, and faced the
most threats from other Arabs because he entered the race first and
was the only one to run as an independent. The others all ran on
the ticket of an Israeli party.
	   If a Palestinian had stood in Tuesday's election he would have
likely been accused of collaborating with Israel, a dangerous
offense.
	   Aliyan said it was out of respect for the Palestinian position
that Israeli-Arabs chose not to run for public office. But the
peace process that began shortly after the last local elections in
1993 changed their position.
	   With strong ties to both Israel and the Palestinians, Aliyan
said his bid for office is not a political statement, and has
nothing to do with the future status of Jerusalem.
	   ``City Hall exists to provide municipal and social services.
Nobody needs them more than the Palestinians in east Jerusalem,''
he said.

	   CIUDAD SANDINO, Nicaragua (AP) _ Men, women and children lined
up under the midday sun, waiting hours for the food they heard was
on its way.
	   The rumbling arrival of two huge trucks loaded with cooking
supplies, rice, beans and sugar sent hundreds more running through
mudholes to join the line on a field northwest of the Nicaraguan
capital of Managua.
	   The aid is not from the government or even a relief agency, but
from a group of Managuan housewives who with their own resources
organized the delivery to families displaced by Hurricane Mitch.
	   ``This is a private effort. We got on the telephones and did
what needs to be done because of our concern for these people,''
said one woman in designer jeans and pearl earrings who asked to
remain anonymous.
	   Most of the food and medical aid being handed out here is coming
through such private efforts, according to people in the camp
called Nueva Vida, or New Life.
	   Tons of international aid has been flown into Managua's airport,
20 miles (32 kilometers) away, but relief workers said it has not
yet reached this camp.
	   ``Where is the medicine from the U.S.? They keep saying `manana,
manana, manana,' '' says Mark Shepler, a Catholic monk with The
Brothers and Sisters of Charity, referring to the Spanish word for
``tomorrow.''
	   For nearly a week, his group and the Quaker organization Pronica
have distributed medicine bought at local pharmacies with their own
funds. But the need is growing and patience was running low.
	   ``We've seen 700 people in four days. There's a limit to how
much you can do,'' Shepler said.
	   Others echoed his comments.
	   ``Almost everyone here is sick and almost everyone has multiple
problems _ respiratory problems from being out in the water so
long, fungal infections, open sores, diarrhea, parasites,'' said
Pronica coordinator Lillian Hall.
	   ``We're just putting our grain of sand in the bucket. The need
is so great,'' she added.
	   Tipper Gore, wife of U.S. Vice President Al Gore, was to visit
the camp Wednesday afternoon. Shepler had one thing to ask of her:
``Find out where our medicine is at and bring it here.''
	   The devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch has overwhelmed
governments and aid agencies across Central America, where an
estimated 10,000 people have been killed by the storm and tens of
thousands of others displaced.
	   Aid arriving at the Nicaraguan capital has been put onto
helicopters to be sent to the hardest-hit communities in northern
Nicaragua. The refugees at Nueva Vida, whose homes along Lake
Managua were flooded, make do with what little comes their way.
	   ``We don't have any provisions,'' said Gladys Sembrana Toledo,
who shares her new tin and plastic-sheet hut with two other adults
and her five children. ``The children eat whatever we can find.''
	   Nevertheless, there is optimism in the camp. The sound of
hammers and hand saws filled the air as men built shelters for
their families. A young girl hauled a long roll of sheet metal on
her shoulder to be used for her new home.
	   ``We don't have anything. We need roofs and wood,'' said her
father, Lazaro Antonio Padira Matamoros. ``But with time, perhaps
it will be better, when they put in roads, water and light.''
	   The 1,400 families will make permanent homes at Nueva Vida, a
field the government has divided into small plots for the refugees.
	   ``God willing, it will be pretty in the future,'' said Ana del
Socorro Moreno, as she patted fresh tortillas into shape to be
cooked over a wooden fire.
	   In the distance, the voice of John Lennon came over a radio _
``Imagine there's no hunger...''
	   Not likely here, not now.
	   At the food line, a young woman tapped one of the Managuan
housewives distributing food on the shoulder and, pointing to her
pregnant belly, asked to cut to the front.
	   She was told to go to the end of the line.

Northern Ireland's anti-terrorist Maze prison could close by 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The anti-terrorist Maze prison
_ home to some of Britain's most notorious killers and bombers and
the site of some of its worst breaches in security _ could close if
the peace process in Northern Ireland works.
	   The province's prison chief said Wednesday that the Maze, long a
focal point in the bitter history of Northern Ireland's conflict,
could close by the year 2000.
	   His prediction came as the British government published a
damning report by its chief prisons inspector, Sir David
Ramsbotham, into lax security at the Maze following a chain of
embarrassing and deadly breaches last year.
	   Irish Republican Army members nearly succeeded in digging an
elaborate tunnel out of one block, while another IRA inmate walked
out of the prison dressed as a woman and still hasn't been
recaptured.
	   Most threatening to the peace process was December's
assassination of Northern Ireland's most infamous Protestant
militant, Billy ``King Rat'' Wright, by other prisoners who had
smuggled in two handguns. That killing triggered a wave of slayings
of Catholic civilians outside the prison.
	   Ramsbotham's report concluded that ``battle weary and
traumatized'' guards had ceded too much control to the inmates,
whose secret organizations regularly threatened to kill the
officers or their families if prison security was tightened.
	   He cited many examples of luxuries offered to inmates, including
sex with their wives or girlfriends during visits, mobile phones
and cash payments for unverified damage to property.
	   But most of Ramsbotham's 143 recommendations were unlikely to be
enacted, since the Maze's future is in doubt.
	   ``It is obvious that the Maze has had a checkered history and
more than its fair share of problems,'' said Robin Halward,
director of the Northern Ireland prison system. ``But with the
prospect of a much smaller prison population, we now have the
opportunity to close that page of history.''
	   April's historic accord on how Northern Ireland should be
governed offered early paroles for all convicted members of
truce-observing paramilitary groups: the IRA on the Irish Catholic
side, and the Ulster Defense Association and Ulster Volunteer Force
on the British Protestant side.
	   More than 200 of the approximately 450 eligible prisoners have
already walked free since September, and the agreement specifies
that all should go free by mid-2000.
	   That would leave the Maze _ eight H-shaped blocks built to hold
800 people _ with only a handful of residents from smaller outlawed
gangs that have refused to observe credible cease-fires. Halward
called its closure by the end of 2000 ``a best-case scenario.''
	   ``There are few in Northern Ireland and further afield who will
be sorry at the prospect of the Maze closing,'' he said. ``But it
should also be remembered that the Maze has played a crucially
important role in protecting the community from convicted
terrorists.''
	   Most of the inmates insist on referring to the prison as Long
Kesh, the name of a prisoner-of-war-styled compound originally
built on the site in 1971 to intern paramilitary suspects without
trial.
	   The Maze, opened in 1976, became the front line in a grueling
battle between a British government determined to criminalize those
it imprisoned and IRA commanders determined to regain their lost
political status.
	   ``Nowhere on earth is there a prison like this _ such a
concentration of bombers, killers, terrorist tacticians under one
roof,'' the British government's security minister, Adam Ingram,
said after a visit in 1997.
	   The prison is southwest of Belfast, near the Protestant village
of Maze. At night, the prison's floodlights serve as a handy guide
for airplanes approaching Belfast.
	   Almost from the day the Maze opened, hundreds of arriving IRA
convicts refused to wear their new prison uniforms and smeared
excrement on their cell walls, while on the outside the IRA
assassinated prison officers. The campaign reached its climax in
1981, when 10 prisoners starved themselves to death.
	   Two years later, 38 IRA prisoners escaped, the biggest in
British penal history. Three are still fighting extradition in
California, while the mastermind behind the breakout, Gerry Kelly,
has been conspicuous at the Maze gates in recent months greeting
newly freed comrades.
	   Keeping control of the inmates has required 1,200 guards and
great expense to British taxpayers _ last year, more than dlrs
125,000 per prisoner.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two new arterial highways slice through the
small Arab village of Beit Safafa in eastern Jerusalem, cutting the
community into four isolated parts.
	   Though much of the village's land was expropriated to make room
for the highways, the planners didn't give residents any access to
them.
	   It was the roads through his birthplace that finally led Moussa
Aliyan, a prosperous insurance salesman and father of five, to
break the Arab taboo against running for Jerusalem's city council.
	   Undeterred by calls for a boycott against him and even death
threats, Aliyan ran as an independent Tuesday and said it was time
Jerusalem's Arab minority stood up for its rights.
	   ``Because we have no representatives on the city council, the
Israeli parties divide up the cake among themselves and we are left
with nothing but the crumbs,'' the 47-year-old told The Associated
Press on Tuesday.
	   On Wednesday, preliminary results indicated Alyan had failed to
win a seat on the council.

Dollar falls against yen, Tokyo stock prices rise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with close of afternoon session &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Profit-taking cut short the U.S. dollar's surge
Wednesday, pushing it down against the yen in Tokyo. Stock prices
rose on expectations most of Japan's troubled banks will apply for
public funds.
	   The dollar bought 120.78 yen at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT), down 1.54 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of
122.52 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 319.93 points,
or 2.27 percent, to 14,428.02 points by the end of the afternoon
session. On Tuesday, the Nikkei closed down 86.45 points, or 0.61
percent.
	   In currency trading, participants said Japanese trust bank
buying that had helped the dollar surge over the past two sessions
didn't materialize Wednesday.
	   And given the ease with which the dollar rose from the low-119
yen level early Monday to an intraday high of 123.36 yen Tuesday,
it was inevitable that profit-taking would set in, traders said.
	   ``Once the dollar got past 119 yen and 120 yen on Monday and
Tuesday, everyone was caught short and had to buy,'' said Takashi
Nakauchi, foreign exchange manager at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
``But 125 yen is still quite top heavy, and (Japanese) exporters
came back to sell the dollar.''
	   Others downplayed the impact of exporters, saying interbank
traders had started the dollar's move down when it couldn't retain
its upward momentum.
	   On the stock market, hopes that banks would take public money
grew after the government Tuesday announced conditions that will be
imposed on banks receiving public funds to strengthen their capital
bases.
	   The conditions were not seen as too burdensome and local press
reported that most major banks will apply for the funds.
	   Many traders also said that public funds bought stocks Wednesday
to support the market before the government's upcoming stimulus
package. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is expected to decide
Thursday on a basic framework for the stimulus plan and to release
details on Monday.
	   Investors are also closely watching the LDP as it moves towards
an alliance with the opposition Liberal Party. The Liberals are
pressing for a cut in Japan's national sales tax.
	   The tax was raised from 3 percent to 5 percent last year, an
increase widely blamed for helping plunge Japan into its deepest
recession since the end of World War II.
	   ``A cut in the consumption tax may not be good in the long term
for Japan, but it will provide an immediate boost to consumption,''
said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock trading division
at Tokyo Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 19.8 points, or 1.84 percent, to 1,098.12. The
TOPIX closed down 5.84 points, or 0.54 percent, the day before.
	   Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was
estimated at 386 million shares, up slightly from 366.94 million
shares Tuesday. Advances outnumbered retreats 811 to 309, while 151
issues were unchanged.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.855 percent from Tuesday's finish of 0.815 percent,
driving its price down to 108.37 yen from 108.76 yen.

Warne targets third test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Star spinner Shane Warne appears
resigned to missing the opening two tests of the Ashes series
against England.
	   Warne made the third test of the five-test series his target
Wednesday after previously maintaining he might be fit enough for
the Nov. 20 first test in Brisbane.
	   ``I think basically a third or fourth test is a more realistic
chance,'' Warne admitted Wednesday.
	   Warne has only played one top class match since April because of
his shoulder injury and subsequent surgery. He bowled just eight
overs in a limited overs match for state team Victoria last week.
	   He will have a more thorough examination of his recovery when he
plays in the Sheffield Shield match against Western Australia over
the next four days.
	   The third test is in Adelaide from Dec. 11-15 and Victoria has
another Shield game from Nov. 26-29.
	   ``Hopefully (I'll) get through this Shield game okay, pull up
all right and bowl a few more overs in the next Shield game and
gradually build it up,'' Warne said.
	   Influential figures such as selector Allan Border and captain
Mark Taylor urged Warne not to rush back into test match play.
Border said Warne was unlikely to be picked before the third or
fourth tests and it would be silly to risk further damage by
hurrying his return.
	   Warne has played a significant role in Australia's dominance
over England in the five years since he dismissed Mike Gatting with
his first ball in Ashes competition.
	   He was missing for Australia's 1-0 series win in Pakistan last
month and was ably replaced by fellow leg-spinner Stuart MacGill.

Cambodian government says parliamentary immunity safeguards
</HEADLINE>
opposition &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Opposition lawmakers worried about
being arrested if they return from abroad will be shielded by their
parliamentary immunity, a government spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Opposition fears of politically motivated arrests are one factor
holding up talks on forming a coalition government following July's
parliamentary elections.
	   The Cambodian People's Party of Co-Premier Hun Sen won a slight
majority in the polls, but needs opposition cooperation to attain
the two-thirds vote in parliament necessary to approve a new
government.
	   Opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy,
alleging election fraud and intimidation by Hun Sen, led an exodus
of their lawmakers from Cambodia after the ceremonial convening of
parliament Sept. 24. They expressed fear of arrest by Hun Sen after
two alleged assassination attempts on his life.
	   On Saturday, King Norodom Sihanouk offered to provide royal
protection for Ranariddh, his son, and Sam Rainsy if they return to
Cambodia before the end of this week.
	   Ranariddh, in a letter circulated Tuesday, showed no interest in
the offer of protection and insisted instead that the government
lift limitations on freedom of movement for some of his followers.
	   The government has said that opposition lawmakers are free to
travel in and out of the country, except some ``who have a prima
facie case to answer to the court.''
	   The statement released Wednesday by the government spokesman's
office said the opposition lawmakers should have no more doubt
about their security since they were already sworn as officially
elected members of parliament.
	   ``Therefore, all of them have fully enjoyed the parliamentary
immunity to protect them,'' the statement said, citing an article
in the Cambodian constitution that says ``no Assembly member shall
be prosecuted, detained or arrested.''
	   On Tuesday, Hun Sen's party rejected giving the presidency of
the National Assembly to Prince Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party, making
the chance for any breakthrough to form a new government even
slimmer.
	   FUNCINPEC, in a statement released Wednesday, said that by
turning down its demand for parliament's top position, Hun Sen is
hampering progress toward breaking the current impasse.
	   Sam Rainsy said in a statement Wednesday that ``there would be
no chance of bringing about any form of democracy in Cambodia and
the CPP would continue to monopolize all the powers in a communist
style'' if Hun Sen's party took the top positions in both the
legislative and executive bodies.
	   King Sihanouk, who is scheduled to leave Saturday for medical
treatment in Beijing, has offered to hold a political summit
meeting of the three leaders to try to bring an end to the
stalemate.
	   The opposition leaders are promoting the idea of having a summit
in Beijing, where the 76-year-old monarch maintains a residence, so
they can talk on an equal footing with Hun Sen.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The U.N. Special Commission said Wednesday
it was withdrawing its arms inspectors from Iraq.
	   It was not immediately known if the commission, which oversees
Iraq's disarmament, was withdrawing all its personnel from Iraq or
only its weapons inspectors.
	   The move comes amid reports that the United States was preparing
to strike Iraq in a bid to force Baghdad to back down from its Aug.
5 decision to freeze all cooperation with the commission.
	   A convoy of 11 vehicles carrying some 90 U.N. personnel and
their luggage left the U.N. Special Commission's headquarters in
Baghdad early Wednesday. It was presumed to be heading for the
airport.
	   The commission said it would hold a news conference at 10:30
local time (0730 GMT).
	   The commission withdrew 15 of its inspectors from Iraq on
Saturday, saying they had been idle since the government's decision
to refuse to allow them to conduct their work.
	   Iraq has said it would not cooperate with U.N. weapons
inspectors until the U.N. Security Council begins moving to lift
the embargo imposed after Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   The Security Council has said the embargo won't be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction, as required by U.N. resolutions passed after the
1991 Gulf War over the Kuwait occupation.

Indonesian assembly meets for second day as troops block protests

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A special assembly discussed how to
reform Indonesia's authoritarian political structure Wednesday as
troops blocked hundreds of protesting students from reaching the
Parliament.
	   The People's Consultative Assembly, the nation's highest
legislative body, is meeting until Friday to map out a new system
of government after decades of military-backed rule under
ex-President Suharto.
	   About 500 students took a convoy of buses to within about a
kilometer (half-mile) of the legislature before heavily armed
soldiers stopped them near the studios of state-owned television.
	   There were no reports of arrests.
	   The students, many of them wearing yellow university jackets,
waved red and white Indonesian flags and chanted anti-government
slogans. Some held up a banner that read: ``Put Suharto on trial.''
	   Another group of students sang the national anthem outside a
nearby hotel where assembly delegates are staying.
	   In May, students occupied the Parliament building for days
before Suharto quit and ended 32 years in power.
	   However, this week thousands of troops and police have been
guarding the green-domed legislature. About 30,000 security
personnel have been deployed across the capital to safeguard the
assembly.
	   Hundreds of other students gathered peacefully Wednesday at
Proclamation Park, several kilometers (miles) away, where they
demanded that the assembly be abandoned.
	   Leading opposition figures are not included in the ranks of the
assembly, and the students and other opponents are unconvinced by
promises that it will institute sweeping democratic change.
	   The students want the military out of politics and demand that
Suharto be tried for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   Many suspect that President B.J. Habibie, once a Suharto
protege, will use this week's meeting to bolster his position. He's
expected to be a candidate for the presidency when the assembly
chooses a head of state late next year.
	   The assembly is to set a date for parliamentary elections,
probably in May. It is also expected to support new laws to
legalize a large number of new political parties.
	   It is likely to back moves to reduce, but not abolish, the
military's representation in Parliament.
	   The streets were quiet and traffic in the normally congested
city was light Wednesday. Many residents chose to stay home. Some
shops and schools were closed.
	   Fears over potential of violence have slashed retails sales in
Jakarta by an estimated 70 percent, the newspaper Bisnis Indonesia
said.
	   About 1,200 people were killed during last May's violence. Most
were trapped in shopping centers that were set afire. Many of the
centers were owned by members of Indonesia's Chinese minority,
whose relative prosperity is resented by some other Indonesians
amid the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   When the assembly's session opened Tuesday, pro- and
anti-government groups clashed and threw rocks at one another in
several areas before being dispersed by security personnel.
	   Much of Tuesday's trouble involved teen-age boys armed with
knives and bamboo spears.
	   Local media reports estimate that as many as 120,000 have been
recruited by pro-government activists as private security guards to
protect the assembly from student protests.
	   Newspapers said police and troops had confiscated many of the
guards' weapons late Tuesday.

Philippine shares rebound, peso weakens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine shares rebounded
Wednesday, buoyed by bargain-hunting after two consecutive days of
losses, traders said.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks soared
71.13 points, or 4.3 percent, to 1,708.23 after losing a total of
160.97 points, or 9 percent, in the previous two days.
	   The broader All Shares Index surged 19.46 points to 552.54
following a fall of 23.42 points Tuesday.
	   Gainers beat losers 91 to 15, with 29 issues unchanged. Among
gainers were Metro Pacific Corp., Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Co. and property stocks such as C and P Homes, Ayala Land
and Filinvest Land.
	   Nicholas Ty, analyst for Capital Securities One, said
Wednesday's surge was a resumption of the momentum the market has
built up in recent days on the back of a stronger peso.
	   ``Despite profit-taking in previous days, the positive sentiment
for the market remains strong,'' Ty said.
	   Ty said the market draws its resilience from a ``new confidence
in the region'' because of recent moves by various countries to
address the 16-month-old financial crisis.
	   Sung Hung Kai research head Raul Ruiz said economic fundamentals
justify the market's advance, but he doubts whether they would be
enough to lift the main index past 1,800. ``That's pushing it
already,'' he said.
	   Ruiz said, however, that the market should rally if the economy
performed better than expected in the third quarter.
	   The government will release third-quarter data later this month,
but many already expect a further contraction. The country's gross
domestic product contracted by 1.2 percent in the second quarter
due, in part, to poor agricultural production.
	   The Philippine peso opened sharply lower against the dollar,
with the U.S. currency breaking its key resistance level of 41
pesos to the dollar.
	   Traders said heavy dollar demand is causing the weakness in the
peso as market players shore up their supply to cover short
positions.
	   ``This is just short-covering, nothing special,'' said a trader
for a large foreign bank.
	   Traders said pressure on the local currency may ease soon,
especially if the proceeds from food and beverage conglomerate San
Miguel Corp.'s sale of a 45 percent stake in Nestle Philippines
Inc. start flowing into the domestic currency market.
	   The sale, to Nestle SA, amounted to about 29 billion pesos (more
than dlrs 700 million based on the latest exchange rate).

Pierce heads hardcourt field
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) _ Former Australian Open champion
Mary Pierce will prepare for January's opening Grand Slam
tournament by tackling the Australian Women's Hardcourt title.
	   The U.S. dlrs 170,000 hardcourt event will feature 17 of the
world's top 50 players including No. 7-ranked Pierce, No. 10 Patty
Schnyder and Romania's Irina Spirlea.
	   There is speculation that Monica Seles, who has won all four
Australian Opens she has contested, may be in the 30-member field
with nominations to close Nov. 23.
	   Seles is coached by Gold Coast-based Gavin Hopper and is
expected to base there to prepare for her first Australian Open
since 1996.
	   ``There is always the possibility that more players in the top
10 or 20 enter at the last moment,'' said tournament spokeswoman
Liz Smylie. ``Monica Seles certainly has a Gold Coast connection if
you like. If she's around the place and wants a few matches who
knows, she could enter.''
	   The tournament, at Hope Island, will be played Jan. 3-9 with the
Australian Open in Melbourne Jan. 18-31.

Rowdy civilian guards at Indonesian assembly recall Suharto era
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Yelling insults and waving sharpened
bamboo staves, a mob of young men in headbands charged down the
highway in front of the green-roofed Parliament. A few flung rocks
at neighborhood youths who taunted them.
	   The scene was a throwback to the authoritarian era of former
President Suharto, when the military often deployed rowdy, armed
civilians to thwart anti-government demonstrators.
	   Since riots and protests helped unseat Suharto in May, Indonesia
has embarked on a transition to democracy under his successor and
one-time protege, President B.J. Habibie.
	   But thousands of civilian guards have been roaming around
Jakarta in trucks this week to help secure a government assembly on
political reform against the threat of unrest.
	   Some militias brawled with students and youths, and they were
barred from Parliament Wednesday after widespread complaints about
their thuggery. Police said their weapons had been confiscated and
that they would be assigned to guard shopping centers and office
buildings.
	   Military chief Gen. Wiranto said clashes broke out partly
because the volunteers were in danger. Angry youths besieged one
band of guards in a park and soldiers had to shepherd them out.
	   ``If there weren't a threat to the special assembly, I think the
civilian volunteers wouldn't be there,'' Wiranto said.
	   Some 30,000 police and soldiers are safeguarding the People's
Consultative Assembly, which began meeting at Parliament Tuesday to
cast rules for 1999 parliamentary elections.
	   Student protesters reject the assembly, the nation's highest
legislative body, as a corrupt relic of Suharto that is unlikely to
push hard for democratic reform.
	   Security is tight, with hundreds of troops camped out at
Parliament with guns and riot shields stacked in piles. On
Wednesday, soldiers blocked student activists near the building.
	   Outside Parliament and in several other areas, violence flared
briefly Tuesday between civilian guards, some carrying machetes,
and gangs of youths and students.
	   Critics have speculated that the military tacitly encourages
such fighting to bolster its image as an indispensable peacekeeper.
Military brass have denied the accusations.
	   Under Suharto, the army used civilian guards to counter
separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and Irian Jaya as
well as the former Portuguese colony of East Timor.
	   As police and soldiers stood by, civilian thugs ousted
supporters of pro-democracy leader Megawati Sukarnoputri from her
party headquarters in 1996.
	   Megawati and other opposition leaders have urged the government
to disperse the assembly guards, many of whom are members of
conservative Muslim groups and government-backed youth
organizations.
	   Some hail from outlying areas of Jakarta, and are unpopular in
local neighborhoods. Some wear paramilitary uniforms.
	   ``Part of the problem is that the kind of young people who
accepted the military's invitation to help with security are
precisely those who disagree with the student protests,'' Human
Rights Watch, a New York-based group, said in a statement.
	   Arifin Maliki, a 24-year-old civilian guard, said he had been
ordered to safeguard the assembly in exchange for daily meals.
	   ``I don't hate them and they are not our enemy,'' Maliki said of
the students. As he spoke, he cradled a bamboo spear.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A convoy of U.N. arms inspectors left
Baghdad early Wednesday as the United Nations announced it was
withdrawing its monitors from Iraq.
	   It was not immediately known if the U.N. Special Commission,
which oversees the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, was withdrawing all its personnel from Iraq or only
its weapons inspectors.
	   The move comes amid reports that the United States was preparing
to launch a military strike against Iraq in a bid to force Baghdad
to back down from its decision to freeze all cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors.
	   A convoy of 11 vehicles carrying about 90 U.N. personnel and
their luggage left the U.N. Special Commission's headquarters in
Baghdad, apparently heading for the airport.
	   The commission said it would hold a news conference later
Wednesday.
	   The commission withdrew 15 inspectors from Iraq on Saturday,
saying they had been idle since the government's decision to refuse
to allow them to conduct their work.
	   Iraq has said it would not cooperate with U.N. weapons
inspectors until the U.N. Security Council begins moving to lift
the embargo imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
	   The Security Council has said the embargo won't be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction, as required by U.N. resolutions passed after the
1991 Gulf War. Iraq is obligated to eliminate its nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons programs as well as long-range
missiles.
	   On Tuesday, Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf,
chose an Arab television station _ Qatar's Al-Jazeera _ for his
first interview on the dispute. The latest crisis began Oct. 31
when Iraq halted all cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Al-Sahhaf warned that ``any use of military force against Iraq
would lead to destabilizing the region.''
	   Hours later in Washington, President Bill Clinton met with
senior Pentagon officials to explore options for a possible
military attack on Iraq. Defense Secretary William Cohen stepped up
the movement of U.S. ships into the region.
	   ``The military option is still on the table,'' Cohen said.
	   Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, said
Tuesday that ``we have to prepare ourselves for a strike, obviously
_ this does not mean that we don't encourage diplomacy.''
	   He said Iraq has kept channels open through U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special representative in Baghdad,
Prakash Shah, but that ``nothing really has moved today.''
	   ``There are intensive contacts between the different capitals
with Baghdad, and hopefully this could produce some initiatives
that could help us in finding a common ground,'' he said later in
an interview on WNET television.
	   U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler, interviewed on the
same program, urged Iraq to face up to the fact that disarmament is
connected to the sanctions.
	   ``The key is in its hands _ and it's called full disclosure to
us,'' he said.
	   In mobilizing support for Iraq, the country's trade minister,
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, said Tuesday that America ``will lose from
any strike that takes place, and Iraq will gain.''
	   The comments reflected Iraq's thinking that sympathy for the
Iraqis _ especially on the Arab streets _ would leave the United
States isolated in its campaign against the Baghdad regime.
	   The tactic of appealing to the Arabs is one indication of how
differently the current dispute is unfolding compared to one that
ended earlier this year.
	   When Iraq refused U.N. inspectors access to President Saddam
Hussein's palaces, Russia, France and Turkey rushed envoys to Iraq
to try to head off a military strike by the United States.
	   The dispute was resolved on Feb. 23 when Annan traveled to
Baghdad and reached a last-minute agreement with Saddam to open the
palace compounds.
	   This time, Iraq's defiance is not over a technical issue _ such
as whether palaces were subject to inspection _ but over the
premise of whether there should be an inspection program.
	   Iraq has said it will not resume cooperation with the U.N.
Special Commission until the Security Council begins to move toward
ending the sanctions.
	   Iraq's Oct. 31 decision exempted nuclear experts, and teams from
the International Atomic Energy Agency have gone into the field
almost every day. On Tuesday, five teams visited five sites _ the
highest number this month.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Outgoing President Elias Hrawi was
admitted to hospital Tuesday night with an undisclosed complaint,
Lebanese officials said Wednesday.
	   A presidential palace statement said that Hrawi, 72, was in a
stable condition.
	   The president was taken ill while at the presidential palace in
the hilly suburb of Baabda. He was admitted to a nearby hospital.
	   Hospital officials could not reached for comment Wednesday.
	   Hrawi appeared on television Tuesday evening awarding a
decoration to a Lebanese bank executive for his charity work. Three
days ago, Hrawi traveled to Damascus for a farewell meeting with
his ally, Syrian President Hafez Assad.
	   Hrawi's presidential term expires on Nov. 24. The commander of
the army, Gen. Emile Lahoud, has been elected as his successor.

China drafting law to govern troubled trust companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's legislature is drafting a law to
consolidate and govern the country's unruly investment trust
industry, the official newspaper Financial News reported Wednesday.
	   Zhang Xiao, a National People's Congress official on the ``Trust
Law'' working committee, said the law will clarify the role of the
investment trust companies and seek to reduce the industry's risks,
the report said.
	   Many trust companies now compete with bigger commercial banks
for deposits and also engage in speculative stock trading, real
estate deals and foreign exchange dealings.
	   The wide array of businesses _ combined with heavy overseas debt
exposure _ helped bring down one of China's biggest investment
trusts. Guangdong International Trust and Investment Co. admitted
in early October it couldn't pay nearly dlrs 2 billion in debts.
Its liabilities are now being handled by the Bank of China, a
national commercial bank.
	   Dai Xianglong, the head of the People's Bank of China, the
nation's central bank, said only a small number of trusts would be
closed, according to the Financial News, the official newspaper of
the bank.
	   China has some 240 trust investment companies, representing
about 3 percent of total financial assets. Yet there is no law
governing the industry.
	   Under the draft version of the new law, trust companies will be
allowed to engage in stock broking, provide financial advice for
companies undergoing reforms, set up investment funds and assist in
medium- and long-term financing deals for infrastructure and
high-technology projects. They will also be able to provide some
financial services in the property sector, the newspaper said.

 &UR; Shooting of soldiers could deal new blow to peace deal
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead, UPDATES with Clinton calling Netanyahu &QL; 
changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite a late night shooting attack by
Palestinian militants on Israeli soldiers, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu decided not to call off a Cabinet meeting Wednesday in
which the ministers are to ratify the Wye peace agreement.
	   Two soldiers were wounded, one of them seriously, in the
roadside ambush near a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
	   Last week, Netanyahu broke off a Cabinet debate on the
land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians because of a
suicide bombing by Islamic militants in a Jerusalem market.
	   However, Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said Wednesday's
Cabinet session would proceed as scheduled. The ministers were to
convene at noon (1000 gmt), after Netanyahu consults with Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
	   The accord was expected to win narrow approval by nine of 17
ministers, with four opposing and four abstaining.
	   If the Cabinet ratifies the accord Wednesday, parliament could
vote on it Thursday and Israel might still be able to meet a key
commitment, an initial troop pullback Monday from 2 percent of the
West Bank.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton called Netanyahu on Tuesday to
discuss the ratification process and the U.S.-Iraqi showdown over
weapons inspections, U.S. officials said.
	   It was not clear whether the Clinton call came before or after
Netanyahu's announcement Tuesday evening that he was putting the
peace accord back on track in response to assurances that the
Palestinians were stepping up their anti-terror campaign.
	   The Haaretz daily said there was unconfirmed speculation that
Clinton told Netanyahu that the Cabinet's failure to ratify the
agreement has made it difficult for the United States to win
support from Arab states against Iraq.
	   The United States has urged Israel to stick to the original time
table of the agreement, despite the repeated delays over the past
two weeks in ratification. Under the accord, Israel is to hand over
13 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks, in exchange for a
Palestinian campaign against Islamic militants.
	   The Maariv daily said Netanyahu agreed to convene the Cabinet
after winning assurances from the United States on a key sticking
point - the procedure for revoking clauses of the PLO founding
charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   The Wye agreement says that the Palestine National Council and
other Palestinian organizations will convene in mid-December to
``reaffirm'' a January letter by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to Clinton that lists the clauses considered annulled.
	   Israel insists that the Palestinian delegates hold a vote, while
Palestinian officials have said only approval by acclamation was
required.
	   Under the compromise worked out by the United States, the
delegates will vote by a show of hands, but not all members of the
PNC, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, will have to be present
and there will be no need for a two-third majority, Maariv said.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said he hoped the Cabinet
would ratify the accord on Wednesday. He said Israel was already
behind schedule on several issues, including the opening of the
Palestinian airport in the Gaza Strip, and establishing a land
route for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza.
	   Asked about the stipulation on the PLO charter that Netanyahu
plans to attach to the accord, Erekat said: ``I hope he will
refrain from the use of threats and conditions.''
	   Erekat was evasive when asked whether the Palestinians would
agree to hold a vote on the charter, saying only that they would
meet all their obligations under the accord.
	   In Tuesday night's shooting attack near the West Bank town of
Hebron, Palestinian assailants hid by the side of a road and opened
fire on a white military truck as it stopped at an intersection.
	   The rear doors of the truck were riddled with bullets and the
back and side windows were shattered. The army said the soldiers
managed to fire back at the shooters.
	   The two victims, ages 21 and 23, were taken to a near by Israeli
hospital. One of the soldiers was in serious condition with a
chest-wound, and the other had minor head injuries.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian cargo plane crashed near the Siberian
city of Krasnoyarsk on Wednesday, but there was no immediate word
on the fate of the eight crew members, an official said.
	   The AN-12 plane, loaded with food, went down moments after
taking off from Krasnoyarsk on a trip to the Siberian town of
Mirni, said Irina Andriyanova, a spokeswoman with the Emergency
Situations Ministry in Moscow.
	   Another plane said it spotted the downed aircraft, which was
burning in a remote spot about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from
Krasnoyarsk, she said.
	   The eight crew members were the only people on board, she added.
A rescue helicopter was sent to the site to search for survivors.

Economy shuts down as national strike takes hold of Zimbabwe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A national strike to protest price
increases took hold Wednesday, with most factories and businesses
shut down in Harare and provincial centers.
	   Police and army troops, backed by helicopters, patrolled
township suburbs around Harare, where violent riots erupted last
Wednesday because of a 67 percent rise in gasoline prices. There
were no early reports of violence.
	   Workers appeared to be heeding a call by the main labor
federation to stay home and not take part in protest marches.
	   A few small groups of workers gathered on street corners, trying
to hitch rides into Harare. A state-owned bus company scaled back
services after some of its crews joined the strike.
	   Troops set up camps in the volatile dormitory suburb of
Chitungwiza, 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of Harare, scene of
rioting and looting last week.
	   But many Chitungwiza residents took the opportunity Wednesday to
dig on plots of land preparing for the planting of corn ahead of
the upcoming rainy season.
	   It looked like a Sunday in downtown Harare, with light traffic
and most banks and stores closed. Government offices were open but
manned only by handfuls of state employees.
	   ``It's like an anti-government public holiday,'' said Mathias
Wedza, a worker at one of a few fast food outlets that remained
open.
	   The gasoline increase has pushed up prices of food and essential
goods by a third, with latest increases of 20 percent on sugar and
cooking oil hitting Tuesday.
	   The Zimbabwe Confederation of Trade Unions, representing most
labor organizations, called the strike and said its members were
demanding urgent negotiations with the government and employers.
They are seeking price reductions and wage increases.
	   The government blames the gasoline increases on an 80 percent
slide in the value of the Zimbabwe currency against the U.S. dollar
in the past year.
	   The state-controlled Herald newspaper said Wednesday President
Robert Mugabe, at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, appointed Finance
Minister Herbert Murerwa to head a special committee ``to work on
immediate and concrete measures to stabilize the local currency.''
	   The labor federation, representing 90 percent of organized labor
groups, accuses the government of economic mismanagement,
corruption and using resources badly needed at home to deploy 6,000
Zimbabwe troops to support Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   Unrest over deteriorating economic conditions is posing the most
serious threat yet to Mugabe's hold on power.
	   Mugabe, 74, has been the only black leader since 1980, when he
led the former British colony of Rhodesia to independence.

Tipper Gore visits Honduras to assess hurricane relief needs

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ After a long day of shoveling mud
and making tortillas, Tipper Gore rested in the same school yard
where dozens of refugees were living because their homes had been
swept away by Hurricane Mitch.
	   The wife of Vice President Al Gore had pitched in Tuesday to
help clean up the school and feed hungry children in the Honduran
capital of Tegucigalpa.
	   More importantly, she arrived with medical supplies, congressmen
and a promise of an additional dlrs 10 million in U.S. aid to
hurricane-devastated Central America.
	   ``This is a tragedy of Biblical proportions,'' Mrs. Gore said
after meeting with residents of Tegucigalpa's El Chile
neighborhood, which was ripped apart by a torrent of mud. ``They're
telling me stories of entire villages being washed away.''
	   Mrs. Gore's visit did much to heighten spirits in El Chile.
Hundreds of children followed her through the streets. A few pushed
past security to hold her hand.
	   ``The important people never come to this neighborhood,'' said
27-year-old Claudia Boquin, who put her daughter on her shrs) of drinking water for
residents who have had little since Mitch killed an estimated 6,600
Hondurans last month.
	   Mrs. Gore was heading to Managua, Nicaragua, on Wednesday.
	   While Mrs. Gore surveyed Central America's devastation,
governments and lending institutions around the world moved to help
the region pick up the pieces.
	   France canceled debts owed by Nicaragua and Honduras, while
Ireland announced it was doubling aid to the countries ravaged by
the storm. Britain said it hoped to contribute to a trust fund for
the region and added its support to calls for a moratorium on debt
payments by all affected countries.
	   Cuba announced it was canceling Nicaraguan debts of dlrs 50
million, nearly all of which apparently was borrowed by Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government in the 1980s.
	   And the World Bank announced it was making dlrs 200 million
available from existing projects to assist the nations damaged by
Mitch.
	   Mitch became a tropical storm Oct. 22 in the Caribbean, bringing
storms to Costa Rica and Panama. It became a hurricane on Oct. 25
and battered Honduras while stalled just off the coast. It moved
inland as a tropical storm on Oct. 27, still dumping rain.
	   The storm knocked out hundreds of bridges, leaving many
communities isolated. It also devastated power and sewer lines
throughout Honduras and virtually obliterated the nation's farming
sector.
	   Honduran President Carlos Flores welcomed the support from the
world and from Mrs. Gore. With her boots and pants still caked in
mud, the president invited her to his home Tuesday night for a
pizza dinner.
	   ``The example is something that's not forgotten,'' Flores told
Mrs. Gore.
	   Stressing Washington's commitment to long-term relief, Mrs. Gore
said U.S. military engineers were rushing to Honduras to repair
roads and bridges and ensure that fuel and food could be moved to
stricken towns.
	   The dlrs 10 million in new aid for various projects is in
addition to the dlrs 70 million the Clinton administration already
has committed to Central America.
	   Mrs. Gore was joined on her trip by Brian Atwood, who heads the
U.S. Agency for International Development, Nicaraguan pitcher
Dennis Martinez of the Atlanta Braves and John Leonard, deputy
assistant secretary of state for Latin America.
	   The congressional delegation included Democratic senators
Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and
Mary Landrieu of Louisiana; Republican Senator Jim Colby of
Arizona; and Democratic representatives Gary Ackerman of New York
and Xavier Becerra of California.
	   Ackerman said he hoped there would be bipartisan support for
long-term U.S. assistance.
	   ``This gives us an opportunity to embrace our neighbors,'' he
said. ``If we can't do this on a nonpartisan basis, we're going to
go nowhere with this congress.''

Singapore committee announces measures to cut business costs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with trade and industry minister saying budget deficit
possible, last 2 grafs &QL; 
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ As Singapore slumps into recession, a
government-linked committee reviewing the city-state's economic
competitiveness has announced much-awaited measures to slash
business costs by billions of dollars.
	   The move, announced Wednesday, would trim business expenses by
10 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 6 billion) a year, reducing
corporate costs by about 15 percent annually. The cuts equal about
7 percent of Singapore's entire gross domestic product.
	   Aimed at easing the pain of Singapore's first economic downturn
in 13 years, the package recommends major cuts in wages and pension
contributions, reduced land and factory rentals, slashed levies and
service charges, and lower taxes.
	   ``We must act decisively to restore our competitiveness and
enable our economy to weather the crisis,'' said the wide-ranging
report from the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness, which
comprises government and business representatives.
	   Although Parliament is scheduled to discuss the package Nov. 23,
the government is widely expected to implement most or all of the
recommended measures.
	   Topping the agenda are labor costs.
	   During more prosperous times, rising wages and pension
contributions did not pose a major problem, said the report. But
``economic conditions have totally changed and we are competing for
a shrinking economic pie.''
	   Employers' payments to the mandatory, state-run pension fund
should be slashed in half, from 20 percent of a worker's salary to
10 percent, said the committee. Overall wage-related costs should
be reduced by about 15 percent, including unspecified wage cuts.
	   The government should also ``reduce, or extend rebates for
government taxes like corporate and personal income taxes'' next
year.
	   But Trade and Industry Minister Lee Yock Suan, who chairs the
committee, said there is only limited room to cut corporate taxes,
which stand at 26 percent, just above a long-term goal of 25
percent.
	   The government-appointed panel also recommended cuts in gas
taxes, utility charges, levies on using foreign workers, and
industrial rentals.
	   Noting that Singapore has enjoyed robust average annual growth
of 8.9 percent since independence in 1965, the report concedes that
the economy has quickly deteriorated since the start of the
regional crisis in mid-1997.
	   The vulnerable city-state just posted its first quarterly
contraction since the last recession in the mid-1980s. The
government announced Tuesday that Singapore's economy is
technically in recession and could contract as much as 1 percent
next year.
	   The committee ruled out measures to stimulate domestic demand
because ``Singapore's small size and heavy dependence on global
export markets'' would make such a move ineffective.
	   The report warns that while labor costs have gradually risen to
levels much higher than its competitors, the sharp depreciation of
regional currencies against the relatively strong Singapore dollar
``has worsened our competitiveness further.''
	   Devaluing the local currency would ultimately hurt the economy
and tarnish the Southeast Asian financial center's reputation, said
the report, concluding that restoring business competitiveness
through cost-cutting is the only solution.
	   Singapore must also reform and strengthen its economic structure
to position itself for renewed growth once the regional slowdown
subsides, it said.
	   In addition to short-term measures, the committee outlined broad
strategies to ``make Singapore the first developed economy in the
tropics within the next 10 years.''
	   Lee also cautioned that Singapore could run a budget deficit
again for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2000, as the country
wrestles with the economic crisis.
	   For the first time in more than a decade, Singapore's current
budget will have a deficit of 800 million Singapore dollars (dlrs
468 million).

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israel's warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon Wednesday for the fourth
straight day, Lebanese security officials said.
	   The planes fired at least six missiles at three bases of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, opposite the Israeli-occupied zone,
between 5:20 a.m. (0320 GMT) and 6:00 a.m. (0400 GMT), the
officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The targets were in Apple Province and about 12 kilometers
(seven miles) north of this southern market town. The area is often
used to launch attacks against Israeli troops in southern Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah said it suffered no casualties in the raids.
	   In Jerusalem, a spokesman for the Israeli military said aircraft
had attacked ``terrorist positions'' in southern Lebanon and that
pilots had reported accurate hits.
	   Israeli jets have been carrying out raids on Hezbollah positions
each day since Sunday.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is a Shiite Muslim fundamentalist
group that is fighting to oust the Israeli army and its proxy South
Lebanon Army militia from south Lebanon.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to curb guerrilla attacks against
its northern territory.

Dollar falls against yen, Tokyo stock prices rise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to RAISE stock results; UPDATES with bond, dollar
rates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices surged Wednesday on growing
expectations that most of the country's debt-laden banks will apply
for public funding. The U.S. dollar dropped against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 319.93 points,
or 2.27 percent, closing at 14,428.02. On Tuesday, the Nikkei had
slipped 86.45 points, or 0.61 percent.
	   Hopes that banks would take public money grew after the
government announced conditions Tuesday that will be imposed on
banks receiving public funds to strengthen their capital bases.
	   The conditions were not seen as too burdensome and local
newspapers reported that most major banks will apply for the funds.
	   Many traders also said that public funds bought stocks Wednesday
to support the market before the government's upcoming stimulus
package. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is expected to decide
Thursday on a basic framework for the stimulus plan and to release
details on Monday.
	   Investors are also closely watching the LDP as it moves toward
an alliance with the opposition Liberal Party. The Liberals are
pressing for a cut in Japan's national sales tax.
	   The tax was raised from 3 percent to 5 percent last year, an
increase widely blamed for helping plunge Japan into its deepest
recession since the end of World War II.
	   ``A cut in the consumption tax may not be good in the long term
for Japan, but it will provide an immediate boost to consumption,''
said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock trading division
at Tokyo Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 19.8 points, or 1.84 percent, to 1,098.12. It
had fallen 5.84 points, or 0.54 percent, the previous day.
	   Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was
estimated at 386 million shares, up slightly from 366.94 million
Tuesday. Advances outnumbered retreats 811 to 309, while 151 issues
were unchanged.
	   In currency trading, the dollar succumbed to a round of
profit-taking. It bought 121.12 yen in late afternoon, down 1.20
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of
122.52 yen overnight. The dollar ranged between 120.60 yen and
122.40 yen in the day's trading.
	   Participants said Japanese trust bank buying that had helped the
dollar surge over the past two sessions didn't materialize
Wednesday.
	   And given the ease with which the dollar rose from the low-119
yen level early Monday to an intraday high of 123.36 yen Tuesday,
it was inevitable that profit-taking would set in, traders said.
	   ``Once the dollar got past 119 yen and 120 yen on Monday and
Tuesday, everyone was caught short and had to buy,'' said Takashi
Nakauchi, foreign exchange manager at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
``But 125 yen is still quite top heavy, and (Japanese) exporters
came back to sell the dollar.''
	   Others downplayed the impact of exporters, saying interbank
traders had started the dollar's move down when it couldn't retain
its upward momentum.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.855 percent from Tuesday's finish of 0.815 percent,
driving its price down to 108.37 yen from 108.76 yen.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A convoy of U.N. arms inspectors left
Baghdad early Wednesday as the United Nations announced it was
withdrawing its monitors from Iraq.
	   The move comes amid reports that the United States was preparing
to strike Iraq in a bid to force Baghdad to back down from its Aug.
5 decision to freeze all cooperation with the commission.
	   A convoy of 11 vehicles carrying some 90 U.N. personnel and
their luggage left the U.N. Special Commission's headquarters in
Baghdad, and it was apparently heading for the airport or on the
road to neighboring Jordan.
	   It appeared all or almost all the UNSCOM staff was being pulled
out, not only inspectors but support staff. Jaakko Ylitalo, the
most senior UNSCOM official in Baghdad, also left with three other
officials in a van.
	   An official at U.N. headquarters, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the commission would hold a news conference later
Wednesday to announce the move.
	   Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to Iraq,
showed up at the headquarters but did not speak to reporters.
	   The commission withdrew 15 inspectors from Iraq on Saturday,
saying they had been idle since the government's decision to refuse
to allow them to conduct their work.
	   The U.N. official, however, said the U.N. humanitarian staff,
which runs the oil-for-food program, will remain.
	   In August, Iraq has said it would not cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors until the U.N. Security Council begins moving to
lift the embargo imposed after Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait in
1990. It allowed some personnel who do long-term monitoring to
continue working, but on Oct. 31 it stopped even that work.
	   The Security Council has said the embargo won't be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction, as required by U.N. resolutions passed after the
1991 Gulf War.
	   Despite warnings of a military strike by the United States and
Britain, Iraqi officials have said they will not back down from
their decision to bar the inspectors from working. Iraq appeared to
be turning to other Arab states to head off any attack.
	   On Tuesday, Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf,
chose an Arab television station _ Qatar's Al-Jazeera _ for his
first interview on the dispute.
	   Al-Sahhaf warned that ``any use of military force against Iraq
would lead to destabilizing the region.''
	   Hours later in Washington, President Clinton met with senior
Pentagon officials to explore options for a possible military
attack on Iraq. Defense Secretary William Cohen stepped up the
movement of U.S. ships into the region.
	   ``The military option is still on the table,'' Cohen said.
	   Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, said
Tuesday that ``we have to prepare ourself for a strike obviously _
this does not mean that we don't encourage diplomacy.''
	   He said Iraq has kept channels open through Shah, but that
``nothing really has moved today.''
	   ``There are intensive contacts between the different capitals
with Baghdad, and hopefully this could produce some initiatives
that could help us in finding a common ground,'' he said later in
an interview on WNET television.
	   U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler, interviewed on the
same program, urged Iraq to face up to the fact that disarmament is
connected to sanctions.
	   ``The key is in its hands _ and it's called full disclosure to
us,'' he said.
	   In mobilizing support for Iraq, the country's trade minister,
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, said Tuesday that America ``will lose from
any strike that takes place, and Iraq will gain.''
	   The comments reflected Iraq's thinking that sympathy for the
Iraqis _ especially on the Arab streets _ would leave the United
States isolated in its campaign against the Baghdad regime.
	   The tactic of appealing to the Arabs is one indication of how
differently the current dispute is unfolding compared to one that
ended earlier this year.
	   When Iraq refused U.N. inspectors access to President Saddam
Hussein's palaces, Russia, France and Turkey rushed envoys to Iraq
to try to head off a military strike by the United States.
	   The dispute was resolved on Feb. 23 when Annan traveled to
Baghdad and reached a last-minute agreement with Saddam to open the
palace compounds.
	   This time, Iraq's defiance is not over a technical issue _ such
as whether palaces were subject to inspection _ but over the
premise of whether there should be an inspection program.

Stewart plans to keep Australia guessing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ England cricket captain Alec Stewart
will keep Australia guessing over his first test team, saying he
won't give a preview in the final warm-up match starting Friday.
	   England plays Queensland in a four-day match following draws in
the first-class games against Western Australia and South
Australia.
	   Stewart was expected to lead the likely test team out against
Queensland with the first test starting in Brisbane on Nov. 20.
	   The record 377-run stand between Graham Thorpe and Mark
Ramprakash on Tuesday has complicated the English order and Stewart
will take his time to get the balance right.
	   The pair broke the record for the highest partnership by any
touring team in Australia, surpassing achievements from 116 tours
in 136 years.
	   The record stand also ensured five of England's seven specialist
batsmen _ Thorpe, Ramprakash, Nasser Hussain, John Crawley and
Michael Atherton _ had made decent scores in the two four-day
matches thus far.
	   The two batting concerns are Stewart, who made a pair of ducks
against SA, and opener Mark Butcher.
	   ``The test side won't be the side that plays in Cairns,''
Stewart said Wednesday. ``We will go to Brisbane, look at the
wicket and pick who we think will be required and carry that on
throughout the series. It helps, obviously, if six batsmen have
found form _ we have the option of whether we will play five
bowlers or seven batsmen.''
	   The England captain said he was not overly concerned at his or
Butcher's sluggish start to the tour with the bat.
	   Butcher received 10 stitches above the right eye when struck in
the first innings of the opening match against Western Australia.
	   The Surrey left-hander returned against South Australia but made
just two and five.
	   ``Obviously we want Butcher and Stewart to contribute a little
more than they did in the last game but it's not a concern,''
Stewart said. ``If you miss out again in the next two innings then
you don't go into the test full of confidence with runs under your
belt.''
	   Meanwhile, reserve wicketkeeper Warren Hegg returned to England
to be with his wife Joanne, who is overdue with their first child.
Hegg was expected to rejoin his teammates in Brisbane on Nov. 17.

South Korean president visits China to strengthen ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ South Korean President Kim Dae-jung arrived in
Beijing Wednesday, hoping to persuade China to boost trade and help
bring rival North Korea to peace talks.
	   Economic cooperation will top the agenda when Kim meets with
Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Thursday, Kim's office said.
	   During his five-day visit, Kim also is scheduled to meet with
Premier Zhu Rongji and other senior Chinese leaders and visit
Shanghai, China's No. 2 city.
	   The two countries, which opened diplomatic ties only six years
ago, are already each other's third largest trading partners. They
exchanged dlrs 23.7 billion in goods last year.
	   China also is North Korea's last remaining major communist ally,
and South Korea prizes Beijing's role in international efforts to
bring lasting peace to the divided Korean Peninsula.
	   China, which fought on North Korea's side during the 1950-53
Korean War, is working with Washington to mediate peace talks
between the two Koreas, which are still technically at war.
	   ``Both countries have made great strides in the economic sector.
Now it's time to expand the relations for more comprehensive
cooperation in such fields as politics, security, culture and
tourism,'' Kim said before boarding his plane for Beijing.
	   Kim will ask China to hire South Korean companies to build some
of the nuclear reactors it wants to meet rising energy demands,
Seoul officials said.
	   Beijing was expected to demand that South Korea buy more Chinese
food and animal feed to help narrow China's dlrs 3.5 billion trade
deficit.
	   On the eve of the Jiang-Kim summit, officials from both sides
agreed on a new treaty on fishing boundaries, establishing a joint
fishing zone halfway between the two countries.
	   The two countries will sign the fisheries treaty during Kim's
visit.
	   Kim was accompanied on the trip by Foreign Minister Hong
Soon-young and three other Cabinet ministers as well as heads of
major South Korean conglomerates.
	   South Korea is the second largest foreign investor in China. Its
investment there totaled dlrs 3.5 billion as of May.
	   Kim will visit Shanghai Saturday and from there, he will fly to
Kuala Lumpur the next day to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit.
	   The South Korean leader will return home Nov. 20 after a one-day
stopover in Hong Kong.

WIndies cricket opener delayed when gear goes missing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The start of the West Indies
opening exhibition against a Gauteng Invitation XI at Soweto on
Wednesday was delayed when the Caribbean team found it was missing
gear.
	   The gear apparently was lost at the airport on arrival Tuesday,
South African Press Association said.
	   West Indies captain Brian Lara also made a special request --
which was granted -- that he be allowed to use all his bowlers
during the match. Lara wants his players to have as much practice
as possible.
	   The team's arrival was delayed by a pay dispute.
	   Meanwhile, officials said President Nelson Mandela would attend
the match at the township outside Johannesburg.
	   The long-awaited tour, West Indies' first here since the fall of
apartheid, should decide the No. 2 team after Australia. The first
test begins Nov. 26.
	   The West Indies dominated during the 1980s and 1990s until
slumping several years ago. It lost to Australia in 1995 and
1996-1997, and this year was blanked by Pakistan 3-0, though the
team beat England 3-1.
	   The dispute between the players and West Indies Cricket Board
has been the talk of the Caribbean.
	   In Barbados, the two leading newspapers Tuesday reported calls
for WICB president Pat Rousseau to resign. ``Time for heads to
roll,'' The Advocate said in a commentary by former Barbadian
batsman Tony King, who quoted a friend as saying it was time
Rousseau stopped treating the board as if it was his own company.
	   ``Resign, Rousseau!'' headlined a Daily Nation story saying
Rousseau has been accused of misrepresenting the position of other
board members. It quotes the past president of the board, Peter
Short of Barbados as saying, ``I think the honorable thing to do in
this case is to tender his (Rousseau's) resignation ...''
	   On the television program ``Wake Up Caribbean,'' former WICB
member Allan Lequay, who is president of the Trinidad and Tobago
Cricket Association, questioned Rousseau's earlier statement that
the dismissal of Lara and vice captain Carl Hooper was a unanimous
decision of the board. The two were fired when they refused to
travel to South Africa in the pay dispute, though were reinstated
as part of a settlement.
	   ``When we chatted with our representatives, we were told that no
vote was taken ....'' Lequay said.
	   Roland Holder, the secretary of the West Indies Players'
Association, said he was happy about the agreement, and that it
should help outline new negotiating procedures with the WICB.
	   ``I think out of this there will more than likely be guidelines
for future negotiations which both sides are going to have to
follow,'' Holder said.

Boo-boos surface as Malaysia prepares for APEC summit

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Singapore's towering prime
minister wanted a 7-foot (2.1-meter)-long bed. Mexico's leader was
flying his own chef to Kuala Lumpur, apparently to avoid Malaysian
food.
	   And somebody really fouled up in the media handbook by
mistakenly naming a Taiwanese official as the leader of China.
	   As Malaysia went through the final stages of preparing for next
week's summit meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders, last-minute
headaches surfaced Wednesday.
	   ``Every leader has his own peculiar demand, from the brand of
mineral water he wants to the kind of coffee he drinks,'' said
Helen Ann Fernandez, spokeswoman at the Palace of Golden Horses.
	   The 480-room hotel, famous for its Moorish architecture and the
carved monkeys that appear on its concrete pillars, will be one of
the main venues for the Nov. 17-18 APEC summit, and a host of
meetings by lower-ranking officials beforehand.
	   Of course, given all the anti-government protests that Malaysia
has been facing lately, officials and police also briefed diplomats
from the 21 participating countries on security during the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   Police officers armed with assault rifles took positions around
the Palace of Golden Horses, where officials will begin meeting
Thursday to prepare a summit agenda to be discussed and approved by
APEC Cabinet ministers who meet in Kuala Lumpur Saturday and
Sunday.
	   In the meantime, hotel staffers scurried to ensure that the
special needs of each leader were catered to.
	   The hotel was told that Mexico's president, Ernesto Zedillo,
would be flying in his own chef and spicy Latin condiments. Closer
to home, they also learned that Brunei's sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah,
was expected to bring his own cook, too.
	   A 7-foot bed had to be hauled up to the hotel suite where Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong, the lanky leader from the tiny city-state,
will be staying during the summit.
	   At the Mine's Exhibition Center, where journalists from around
the world were setting up shop, officials were busy modifying the
media handbook that had been prepared for reporters.
	   Malaysian officials had to apologize to China for mistakenly
using a Taiwanese official's name as the leader of China, instead
of President Jiang Zemin.
	   Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade province. To avoid offending
China during APEC summits, Taiwan is called ``Chinese Taipei'' and
can't be represented by its own leader.
	   During the summit, most of the leaders who are allowed to come
will stay at the 2.25 billion ringgit (dlrs 590 million) Palace of
Golden Horses hotel, which overlooks a large, manmade lake about 20
kilometers (13 miles) south of Kuala Lumpur.
	   A three-story penthouse will be reserved for Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, in case he wants to stay there overnight
during the summit.
	   Outside, 5,700 riot police will be deployed to prevent
anti-government protests from embarrassing Mahathir.

 &UR; Shooting of soldiers could deal new blow to peace deal &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead, UPDATES with Clinton calling Netanyahu; CHANGES

 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite a late night shooting attack by
Palestinian militants on Israeli soldiers, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu decided not to call off a Cabinet meeting Wednesday in
which the ministers are expected to ratify the Wye peace agreement.
	   Two soldiers were wounded, one of them seriously, in the
roadside ambush near a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
	   Last week, Netanyahu broke off a Cabinet debate on the
land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians because of a
suicide bombing by Islamic militants in a Jerusalem market that
wounded 21 people.
	   However, Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said Wednesday's
Cabinet session would proceed as scheduled. The ministers were to
convene at noon (1000 GMT), after Netanyahu consults with Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
	   The Wye accord was expected to win narrow approval by nine of
the 17 ministers, with four opposing it and four abstaining.
	   If the Cabinet ratifies the accord Wednesday, parliament could
vote on it Thursday and Israel might still be able to meet a key
commitment, an initial troop pullback Monday from 2 percent of the
West Bank.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton called Netanyahu on Tuesday to
discuss the ratification process and the U.S.-Iraqi showdown over
weapons inspections, U.S. officials said.
	   It was not clear whether the Clinton call came before or after
Netanyahu's announcement Tuesday evening that he was putting the
peace accord back on track in response to assurances that the
Palestinians were stepping up their anti-terror campaign.
	   The Haaretz daily said there was unconfirmed speculation that
Clinton told Netanyahu that the Cabinet's failure to ratify the
agreement has made it difficult for the United States to win
support from Arab states against Iraq.
	   The United States has urged Israel to stick to the original
timetable of the agreement, despite the repeated delays over the
past two weeks in ratification. Under the accord reached at a
summit last month at the Wye Plantation in Maryland, Israel is to
hand over 13 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks, in exchange
for a Palestinian campaign against Islamic militants.
	   The Maariv daily said Netanyahu agreed to convene the Cabinet
after winning assurances from the United States on a key sticking
point _ the procedure for revoking clauses of the PLO founding
charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   The Wye agreement says that the Palestine National Council and
other Palestinian organizations will convene in mid-December to
``reaffirm'' a January letter by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to Clinton that lists the clauses considered annulled.
	   Israel insists that the Palestinian delegates hold a vote, while
Palestinian officials have said only approval by acclamation was
required.
	   Under the compromise worked out by the United States, the
delegates will vote by a show of hands, but not all members of the
PNC, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, will have to be present
and there will be no need for a two-third majority, Maariv said.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said he hoped the Cabinet
would ratify the accord on Wednesday. He said Israel was already
behind schedule on several issues, including the opening of the
Palestinian airport in the Gaza Strip, and establishing a land
route for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza.
	   Asked about the stipulation on the PLO charter that Netanyahu
plans to attach to the accord, Erekat said: ``I hope he will
refrain from the use of threats and conditions.''
	   Erekat was evasive when asked whether the Palestinians would
agree to hold a vote on the charter, saying only that they would
meet all their obligations under the accord.
	   In Tuesday night's shooting attack near the West Bank town of
Hebron, Palestinian assailants hid by the side of a road and opened
fire on a white military truck as it stopped at an intersection.
	   The rear doors of the truck were riddled with bullets and the
back and side windows were shattered. The army said the soldiers
managed to fire back at the shooters.
	   The two victims, ages 21 and 23, were taken to a nearby Israeli
hospital. One of the soldiers was in serious condition with a chest
wound, and the other had minor head injuries.
	   Since the two sides began talking again in late October after 18
months of stalemate, there have been a spate of attacks against
Israelis by groups aiming to derail the peace process.

Citing Russia and Asia, Commerzbank raises bad loan provisions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Following the lead of other big German
banks, Commerzbank AG said Wednesday it will raise its 1998 credit
risk provisions to 1.6 billion marks (dlrs 1 billion) ``to account
for ongoing problems in Asia and Russia.''
	   Commerzbank forecast, however, that full-year earnings would
still top 1997 levels.
	   ``The economic difficulties in many newly industrializing
countries and the global financial crisis have affected Commerzbank
group's earnings in the third quarter,'' the bank said in a
statement.
	   For the first nine months, the bank increased its credit risk
provision to 1.2 billion marks (dlrs 750 million). Commerzbank
didn't provide any comparative figures. In 1997, it took a total of
2 billion marks in risk provisions.
	   The bank's nine-month net income of 1.37 billion marks (dlrs 856
million), up from 1.3 billion in the year-earlier period, came in
at the higher end of analysts' expectations.
	   Nine-month trading profit dropped 19 percent to 504 million
marks (dlrs 315 million), the bank said. Analysts had forecast a
steeper drop in nine-month trading profit to between 420 million to
450 million marks. In the third quarter alone, trading profit stood
at 108 million marks.
	   Deutsche and Dresdner banks, Germany's two biggest, both
reported in recent days they were increasing provisions for
possible bad loan writeoffs due to the financial crises in Asia and
Russia.

Mir cosmonauts deploy `meteorite trap' during spacewalk
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details of the mission, ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two Russian cosmonauts on the Mir space station
deployed a French-made device for studying small meteorite
particles and handled more than a dozen other tasks during a
six-hour spacewalk that ended early Wednesday.
	   Cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev installed the
``meteorite trap,'' which should collect data on a barrage of
particles expected to peak around the Mir in mid-November, said
Valery Lyndin, spokesman for mission control.
	   The device will stay attached to the Mir until 1999, when it
will be taken back to earth for analysis by a French astronaut who
will fly to the station early next year.
	   The ``meteorite rain'' doesn't pose a serious threat to the Mir
because it consists of tiny remnants, not full meteorites. To be
safe, however, the two cosmonauts will board the Soyuz escape
capsule when the shower reaches its peak.
	   At the start of the spacewalk, Padalka and Avdeyev released a
three-kilogram (seven-pound) satellite model made by schoolchildren
from several countries.
	   ``Toss it gently toward the moon,'' Padalka told Avdeyev.
	   They spent just under six hours in open space, slowly crawling
all across the outer surface of the sprawling six-module station to
deploy and collect 17 sets of scientific equipment intended to
study the impact of space flight on different materials.
	   Among the samples they attached to the Mir's surface was a
Russian-made experimental solar panel intended for future
spacecraft.
	   Before a spacewalk, Padalka, the commander, asked the ground
controllers to explain the meaning of some experiments. ``Will you
tell us why we need this equipment for?'' he asked, according to
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``Experts will sort it out,'' came the curt answer from Mission
Control.
	   The spacewalk proceeded smoothly, although the duo once
complained of fatigue, saying the schedule was too tight.
	   A ground controller joked that the tough schedule was
``revenge'' for the cosmonauts working so quickly during their
previous spacewalk, when they performed all their assigned tasks in
only a fraction of the time allotted.
	   During the mission, the cosmonauts twice said they were growing
cold in their spacesuits, but each time the problem was quickly
fixed after the ground controllers helped the pair adjust their
temperature control.
	   In all, the two cosmonauts successfully completed all tasks
except one. They were unable to deploy a set of equipment, intended
to study the impact of weightlessness on various objects, because a
stubborn lock prevented them from clearing a space for the gear.
	   The cosmonauts said they failed to open it with a handle they
had and suggested they try again next time with a screwdriver.
	   Mission Control chief Vladimir Solovyov praised the crew's
performance.
	   ``I don't think that we have ever worked with such amount of
scientific equipment in the past,'' he said after the mission
ended.

Foreign minister warns of worsening relations with Eritrea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VERONIQUE BAGARRY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DJIBOUTI (AP) _ Foreign Minister Mohamed Moussa Chehem has
warned Eritrea of the danger of worsening relations between the two
neighbors if Asmara doesn't apologize for trying to exclude
Djibouti from group attempting to broker peace between Ethiopia and
Eritrea.
	   Speaking on government Radio Djibouti Tuesday night, Chehem said
Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki tried to force President Hassan
Gouled Aptidon from the OAU triumvirate that also includes Burkina
Faso and Zimbabwe on the grounds that Djibouti is backing Ethiopia
in its six-month-old border dispute with Eritrea.
	   The heads of state of Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe and Djibouti met in
the Burkinabe capital, Ouagadougou, over the weekend with Isaias
and Ethiopian Premier Meles Zenawi in a vain attempt to break the
deadlock between the two nations in the Horn of Africa.
	   Isaias and Meles did not meet.
	   Chehem said Aptidon ignored the ``lies and baseless
accusations,'' adding that Djibouti is demanding that Eritrea
publicly apologize for the affront to its president, ``otherwise
relations between Djibouti and Eritrea will be seriously
affected.''
	   Chehem also said Isaias has serious political problems at home
``for which he is trying to find a scapegoat to mislead his
people.''
	   The Organization of African Unity is attempting to mediate the
Ethiopian-Eritrean dispute that has resulted in the closure of
Eritrea's Red Sea ports of Massawa and Assab to landlocked
Ethiopia.
	   Djibouti's port on the Gulf of Aden has since become Ethiopia's
sole maritime outlet.
	   Last year Djibouti claimed Eritrean-based rebels of the Front
for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD) attacked army
patrols in northern Djibouti.
	   Djibouti was riven by a 1990-93 civil war sparked by a rebellion
of the northern Afar people under the aegis of the FRUD against the
Issa clan of Djibouti town. The FRUD split, one half signed a peace
treaty with Aptidon's government, but the other half remains in
armed opposition.
	   Analysts point to an attack last week by FRUD rebels on
Ethiopian trucks as a sign that Eritrea could step up its support
for the FRUD and threaten the growing truck traffic between the
Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, and Djibouti.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A convoy of U.N. arms inspectors left
Baghdad early Wednesday as the United Nations announced it was
withdrawing its monitors from Iraq.
	   The move comes amid reports that the United States was preparing
to strike Iraq in a bid to force Baghdad to back down from its Aug.
5 decision to freeze all cooperation with the commission.
	   A convoy of 11 vehicles carrying some 90 U.N. personnel and
their luggage left the U.N. Special Commission's headquarters in
Baghdad, and it was apparently heading for the airport or on the
road to neighboring Jordan.
	   It appeared all or almost all the UNSCOM staff was being pulled
out, not only inspectors but support staff. Jaakko Ylitalo, the
most senior UNSCOM official in Baghdad, also left with three other
officials in a van.
	   An official at U.N. headquarters, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the commission would hold a news conference later
Wednesday to announce the move.
	   Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to Iraq,
showed up at the headquarters but did not speak to reporters.
	   The commission withdrew 15 inspectors from Iraq on Saturday,
saying they had been idle since the government's decision to refuse
to allow them to conduct their work.
	   The U.N. official, however, said the U.N. humanitarian staff,
which runs the oil-for-food program, will remain.
	   In August, Iraq has said it would not cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors until the U.N. Security Council begins moving to
lift the embargo imposed after Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait in
1990. It allowed some personnel who do long-term monitoring to
continue working, but on Oct. 31 it stopped even that work.
	   The Security Council has said the embargo won't be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction, as required by U.N. resolutions passed after the
1991 Gulf War.
	   Despite warnings of a military strike by the United States and
Britain, Iraqi officials have said they will not back down from
their decision to bar the inspectors from working. Iraq appeared to
be turning to other Arab states to head off any attack.
	   On Tuesday, Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf,
chose an Arab television station _ Qatar's Al-Jazeera _ for his
first interview on the dispute.
	   Al-Sahhaf warned that ``any use of military force against Iraq
would lead to destabilizing the region.''
	   Hours later in Washington, President Clinton met with senior
Pentagon officials to explore options for a possible military
attack on Iraq. Defense Secretary William Cohen stepped up the
movement of U.S. ships into the region.
	   ``The military option is still on the table,'' Cohen said.
	   Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, said
Tuesday that ``we have to prepare ourself for a strike obviously _
this does not mean that we don't encourage diplomacy.''
	   He said Iraq has kept channels open through Shah, but that
``nothing really has moved today.''
	   ``There are intensive contacts between the different capitals
with Baghdad, and hopefully this could produce some initiatives
that could help us in finding a common ground,'' he said later in
an interview on WNET television.
	   U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler, interviewed on the
same program, urged Iraq to face up to the fact that disarmament is
connected to sanctions.
	   ``The key is in its hands _ and it's called full disclosure to
us,'' he said.
	   In mobilizing support for Iraq, the country's trade minister,
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, said Tuesday that America ``will lose from
any strike that takes place, and Iraq will gain.''
	   The comments reflected Iraq's thinking that sympathy for the
Iraqis _ especially on the Arab streets _ would leave the United
States isolated in its campaign against the Baghdad regime.
	   The tactic of appealing to the Arabs is one indication of how
differently the current dispute is unfolding compared to one that
ended earlier this year.
	   When Iraq refused U.N. inspectors access to President Saddam
Hussein's palaces, Russia, France and Turkey rushed envoys to Iraq
to try to head off a military strike by the United States.
	   The dispute was resolved on Feb. 23 when Annan traveled to
Baghdad and reached a last-minute agreement with Saddam to open the
palace compounds.
	   This time, Iraq's defiance is not over a technical issue _ such
as whether palaces were subject to inspection _ but over the
premise of whether there should be an inspection program.

China warns Philippines against low-flying jets over disputed reef
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ China has warned that if Philippine
military reconnaissance jets fly too low over a disputed South
China Sea shoal, it might trigger an accidental confrontation, the
Philippine military chief said Wednesday.
	   Armed forces chief of staff Maj. Gen. Joselin Nazareno said he
ordered Philippine military planes not to fly lower than 5,000 feet
(1,515 meters) over Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands
after China protested.
	   ``They were concerned that we were flying very low and this
might be misinterpreted by people and lead to a confrontation,''
Nazareno told reporters.
	   Philippine military S-211 jets have been flying in tandem daily
over the reef, Nazareno said.
	   On Tuesday, President Joseph Estrada ordered increased naval
patrols in the area after the military reported that China was
expanding its structures and forces on the reef.
	   Estrada and other officials, however, said the conflict over the
reef would be solved diplomatically and would not lead to a
military confrontation.
	   Last week, Manila delivered a diplomatic protest to Beijing over
the expansion of concrete platforms China built in 1995 at Mischief
Reef, demanding that China dismantle the structures and that
Chinese ships leave the area.
	   China has told Philippine officials that it was repairing
fishing shelters in the area damaged by natural causes, and that it
has a sovereign right to undertake the repairs to ensure the safety
of its fishermen.
	   Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, however, said
China was building massive barracks and possibly a pier that could
be used militarily.
	   Mercado described China's actions as a ``creeping invasion'' of
the Philippine territory and said Manila was considering filing a
complaint at the United Nations.
	   Estrada said he also plans to take up the issue with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin on the sidelines of a meeting of Asia-Pacific
leaders in Malaysia next week.
	   ``We will do it through negotiations. Let us not be
confrontational, you know we cannot afford to,'' he told reporters
Tuesday.
	   The Philippines has one of the weakest militaries in Southeast
Asia and its navy relies on old ships donated by the United States.
	   Mercado showed reporters pictures of a large wooden barracks
being built on stilts on a concrete foundation adjacent to a
cluster of concrete platforms on the two-by-four-mile
(three-by-six-kilometer) reef. The pictures also showed dozens of
workers. Military officers say the barracks could house about 70
people.
	   Mercado said China's occupation of the reef could threaten the
food security of the Philippines by reducing its access to fishery
resources.
	   Mischief Reef, called Panganiban by the Philippines, is about
150 miles (240 kilometers) west of the western Philippine island of
Palawan.
	   The Spratlys island group is claimed in whole or in part by the
Philippines, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei and Malaysia.
	   The Philippines occupies eight of the islands, including Pagasa,
the biggest.

Cargill to sell Chinese corn to South Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-SKorea-President's Trip &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. agribusiness giant Cargill Inc. has agreed
to sell 89,500 metric tons of Chinese yellow corn to South Korea, a
company official said Wednesday.
	   The deal, announced in conjunction with South Korean President
Kim Dae-jung's visit to China, which began Wednesday, is to be
signed Friday, the official told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The contract is between Cargill, the National Livestock
Cooperation Federation of the Republic of Korea, and China National
Cereals, Oils and Foodstuff Import and Export Corp., said Norwell
Coquillard, country manager for Cargill Investments China.
	   ``It will be one of the largest (deals) we've done,'' said
Coquillard, who declined to give specific figures.
	   Cargill is one of the largest exporters of corn from China and
has been involved in trade between China and South Korea since
1984.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A military Mi-24 helicopter
crashed in north Moravia Tuesday, killing all four on board, the
defense ministry said Wednesday.
	   Spokesman Miroslav Sindelar said the helicopter crashed Tuesday
shortly after 5 p.m. (1600 GMT) in a forest near Olomouc, 300
kilometers (187 miles) east of Prague. No one of its four-member
crew survived the accident.
	   Rescuers were searching the debris overnight for the bodies of
the crew. The last body was found Wednesday morning, Sindelar said.
	   All flights by the Mi-24 helicopters were immediately suspended
in the Czech military.
	   Sindelar said that causes of the crash are still unclear but did
not rule out technical failure. The helicopter was completely
destroyed in the crash.

U.N. withdraws arms inspectors from Iraq

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A convoy of U.N. arms inspectors left
Baghdad early Wednesday as the United Nations announced it was
withdrawing its monitors from Iraq.
	   The move comes amid reports that the United States was preparing
to launch a military strike against Iraq in a bid to force Baghdad
to back down from its Aug. 5 decision to freeze all cooperation
with the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, responsible for
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   A convoy of 11 vehicles carrying some 90 U.N. personnel and
their luggage left the U.N. Special Commission's headquarters in
Baghdad, and it was apparently heading for the airport or the road
to neighboring Jordan.
	   It appeared all or almost all of the UNSCOM staff was being
pulled out, not only inspectors but also support staff. Jaakko
Ylitalo, the most senior UNSCOM official in Baghdad, left with
three other officials in a van.
	   An official at U.N. headquarters, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the commission would hold a news conference later
Wednesday to announce the move.
	   Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to Iraq,
showed up at the headquarters but did not speak to reporters.
	   The commission withdrew 15 inspectors from Iraq on Saturday,
saying they had been idle since the government's decision to refuse
to allow them to conduct their work.
	   The U.N. official, however, said the U.N. humanitarian staff,
which runs the oil-for-food program, will remain.
	   In August, Iraq said it would not cooperate with U.N. weapons
inspectors until the U.N. Security Council begins moving to lift
the embargo imposed after Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait in August
1990. It allowed some personnel who do long-term monitoring to
continue working, but on Oct. 31 it stopped even that work.
	   The Security Council has said the embargo won't be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction, as required by U.N. resolutions passed after the
1991 Gulf War. Iraq is obligated to eliminate its nuclear, chemical
and biological weapons programs as well as long-range missiles.
	   Despite warnings of a military strike by the United States and
Britain, Iraqi officials have said they will not back down from
their decision to bar the inspectors from working. Iraq appeared to
be turning to other Arab states to head off any attack.
	   On Tuesday, Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf,
chose an Arab television station _ Qatar's Al-Jazeera _ for his
first interview on the dispute.
	   Al-Sahhaf warned that ``any use of military force against Iraq
would lead to destabilizing the region.''
	   Hours later in Washington, President Bill Clinton met with
senior Pentagon officials to explore options for a possible
military attack on Iraq. Defense Secretary William Cohen stepped up
the movement of U.S. ships into the region.
	   ``The military option is still on the table,'' Cohen said.
	   Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, said
Tuesday that ``we have to prepare ourself for a strike obviously _
this does not mean that we don't encourage diplomacy.''
	   He said Iraq has kept channels open through the U.N. envoy Shah,
but that ``nothing really has moved today.''
	   ``There are intensive contacts between the different capitals
with Baghdad, and hopefully this could produce some initiatives
that could help us in finding a common ground,'' he said later in
an interview on WNET television.
	   U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler, interviewed on the
same program, urged Iraq to face up to the fact that disarmament is
connected to sanctions.
	   ``The key is in its hands _ and it's called full disclosure to
us,'' he said.
	   In mobilizing support for Iraq, the country's trade minister,
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, said Tuesday that America ``will lose from
any strike that takes place, and Iraq will gain.''
	   The comments reflected Iraq's thinking that sympathy for the
Iraqis _ especially on the Arab streets _ would leave the United
States isolated in its campaign against the Baghdad regime.
	   The tactic of appealing to the Arabs is one indication of how
differently the current dispute is unfolding compared to one that
ended earlier this year.
	   When Iraq refused U.N. inspectors access to President Saddam
Hussein's palaces, Russia, France and Turkey rushed envoys to Iraq
to try to head off a military strike by the United States.
	   The dispute was resolved on Feb. 23 when Annan traveled to
Baghdad and reached a last-minute agreement with Saddam to open the
palace compounds.
	   This time, Iraq's defiance is not over a technical issue _ such
as whether palaces were subject to inspection _ but over the
premise of whether there should be an inspection program.

Suu Kyi's party says authorities shutting down local offices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The opposition party led by Nobel Peace
Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi has said that Myanmar's military
government is harassing members and forcing local offices to close.
	   Official newspapers, meanwhile, reported Wednesday that the
local office of the National League for Democracy in Bilin, eastern
Myanmar, had closed and all its members resigned. The papers
claimed the opposition members took the action of ``their own free
will.''
	   Local NLD offices appear to be the latest targets in the clash
of wills between the military, which has ruled Myanmar since 1962,
and the beleaguered opposition led by Suu Kyi.
	   The party said in a statement Monday that the government has
detained a total of 920 members since May, when the NLD made known
it intended to convene a parliament elected in 1990 but was never
allowed by the military to meet.
	   The NLD overwhelmingly won those elections, but the military
held on to power. The government has constantly pressured elected
NLD legislators to resign the posts and leave the party.
	   Those detained since May include 184 of the elected NLD
legislators _ about half, the party said. Only three _ one who is
very old, another who is ill and a third who has been out of touch
with party headquarters for some time _ have been freed, the party
said.
	   The ruling State Peace and Development Council issued a
statement Wednesday saying that 27 detainees _ who were described
as having been ``invited for the exchange of views'' _ had returned
home in the past week.
	   According to the official press, the Bilin township NLD office
closed Monday and the entire 21-member executive committee
resigned. The newspapers claimed that members had ``no desire to
continue to take part in the NLD party activities.''
	   Since Friday, official newspapers have also reported the
dissolution of two other NLD township offices in western and
southeastern Myanmar and the resignation of opposition members in
Kachin State in the north.
	   The NLD said Monday that local authorities ``are forcing party
members and elected representatives to resign and to dissolve
township organizing committees.''
	   The NLD has urged the chairman of the ruling council of
generals, Sen. Gen. Than Shwe, to stop the harassment.
	   Myanmar is also known as Burma.

Namibia confirms sending extra troops to Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Namibia on Wednesday said it was
sending more troops to Congo to help with an announced
government-backed offensive against rebels in the east.
	   Defense Ministry spokesman Vincent Mwange said Namibian combat
troops and equipment were being deployed, South African Press
Association said. He refused to comment on reports that the troop
increase numbered 2,000.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila's allies -- who also include
Zimbabwe, Angola and Chad -- agreed two weeks ago to launch a new
offensive against rebels in the east.
	   The rebels are an amalgam of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members
of the Congolese army and opposition politicians. Kabila accuses
Rwandan and Ugandan troops in Congo of backing them.
	   The rebels launched their insurgency Aug. 2. They advanced
quickly until Kabila's allies routed them outside the capital,
Kinshasa early on.
	   The rebels then retreated to eastern strongholds from which they
have launched attacks, making steady gains in northern Congo and
the southern, mineral-rich provinces of Katanga and Eastern Kasai.
	   The foreign troop involvement is starting to stir up unrest and
economic problems for Kabila's allies at home.

East Timorese rebels hold two soldiers captive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Rebels in the disputed territory of East
Timor were holding two soldiers captive Wednesday after releasing
11 others they abducted in a deadly raid.
	   Three soldiers and one pro-independence activist were killed in
the raid Monday on a military post, in which guerrillas stole seven
guns, including some M-16 rifles.
	   Col. Tono Suratman, military chief in the former Portuguese
colony, threatened an attack on the rebels if they did not free
their captives.
	   ``If they're not released, then we will have to use force,'' he
said, adding that troops know where the rebel hideout is.
	   The soldiers were abducted in an attack by 50 rebels in
Manufahi, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili, the
capital of East Timor.
	   In recent days, four other soldiers have been killed in attacks
linked to the independence struggle in East Timor, which was
invaded by the Indonesian military in 1975.
	   On Thursday, church Masses and a march are planned to coincide
with the seventh anniversary of a massacre in which at least 50
people were killed when Indonesian troops fired on a
pro-independence protest.
	   Human rights activists claim at least 200 people were killed.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after its troops
intervened in a civil war that broke out during the last days of
Portuguese rule. The United Nations still considers Portugal the
administering power.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian cargo plane crashed near the Siberian

dead.
	   The Emergency Situations Ministry said eight people were on

	   The AN-12 aircraft, loaded with food, went down moments after
taking off from Krasnoyarsk, said Irina Andriyanova, a spokeswoman

just outside the city, but there was no sign of survivors,
officials said.

Bangladesh strike enters third day; death toll rises to four
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FARID HOSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Police detained 250 protesters as a
violent and costly anti-government general strike shut down
businesses across the country for a third day Wednesday, officials
said.
	   The arrests were made Tuesday and Wednesday in Dhaka,
Bangladesh's capital, and the southern city of Chittagong.
	   The strike was called by seven opposition parties to protest
what they called a police attempt to kill their leader, former
Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, at a rally in Dhaka on Saturday.
	   The death toll from the three-day strike rose to four as a
17-year-old boy died in a Dhaka hospital Wednesday from bullet
wounds he suffered during clashes with opponents of the strike two
days ago, doctors said.
	   Nearly 500 people have been injured in clashes between
supporters and opponents of the strike in Dhaka, Chittagong and the
northern town of Mymensingh.
	   More rickshaw drivers _ who earn an average of 100 takas (dlrs
2) a day _ came out on the streets Wednesday, defying the protest
and risking attacks by anti-government demonstrators. But
businesses, banks and stores remained closed, raising concern of
further damage to the country's already crippled economy.
	   The government estimates that each day of the strike is costing
the economy more than 3 billion takas (dlrs 68 million) in lost
exports and production.
	   No major confrontations were reported Wednesday, even though
protesters set off firecrackers and police responded by firing tear
gas shells to disperse them.
	   The strike call was made a day after a court convicted 15 former
army officers in the assassination of the country's first prime
minister, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of current Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina, in a 1975 coup and sentenced them to death.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian survivors of World War I
were guests of honor at official ceremonies held across the country
Wednesday to mark the conflict's end 80 years ago.
	   At the main ceremony in Canberra, the national capital, Prime
Minister John Howard and Governor-General Sir William Deane were
among those who honored Australia's war dead and met six veterans
of the battlefields of the Great War, as it is also known.
	   Remembrance ceremonies were held at cenotaphs and monuments in
all Australian capitals and in hundreds of country towns from which wheelchair to lay a wreath a the city's
Cenotaph at a ceremony that attracted thousands of people.
	   ``I'm not a weepy bloke as a rule. ... I'm just really highly
honored to have been accepted to lay the second wreath,'' he told
reporters.
	   More than 330,000 Australian men served overseas during the
1914-18 war and more than 61,000 were killed. With a population
then of 4.8 million, Australia had the highest per capita death
toll of any country involved.
	   Just 66 veterans of the war are still alive, according to the
Department of Veterans Affairs.
	   In Canberra, about 2,000 people gathered at the Australian War
Memorial at 11 a.m. (0000 GMT) on the 11th day of the 11th month:
Armistice Day.
	   Six veterans _ Ted Smout, Howard Pope, Eric Abraham, Angus
Clark, August Brand and Mick Holingsworth, aged between 99 and 103
_ were met by Howard and Deane, Queen Elizabeth II's representative
and Australia's titular head of state.
	   They watched as dignitaries laid wreaths at the Stone of
Remembrance following a commemorative address by the French
ambassador to Australia, Dominique Girard.
	   Girard listed many of the northern French towns synonymous with
Australian bravery such as Bullecourt, Poziers and Fromelles, and
cited the 46,000 Australian lives lost in France and Belgium during
``the cruelest war probably in mankind's history.''
	   ``The war cemeteries scattered across the Somme countryside bear
witness to the Australian sacrifices,'' Girard said.
	   ``France will never forget the sacrifices of all the
Australians. France will keep the spirit alive.''
	   Howard announced that Australia's survivors would receive a new
medal _ the 80th Anniversary Armistice Remembrance Medal _ to
express Australia's pride at their contribution.
	   ``The deeds of that generation of young Australians, more than
60,000 of whom lost their lives, have become a legend and continue
to inspire us all,'' Howard said.
	   ``On behalf of the nation, I thank them and express our pleasure
in honoring them with this symbol of our recognition.''

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The start of the West Indies
opening exhibition against a Gauteng Invitation XI at Soweto on
Wednesday was delayed when the Caribbean team found it was missing
uniforms.
	   The gear apparently was lost at the airport on arrival Tuesday,
South African Press Association said.
	   When pacemen Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh, who missed the
original flight, arrived Wednesday morning the clothing was brought
out with them and rushed to the Soweto cricket oval.
	   After an hour delay, West Indies Captain Brian Lara won the toss
and elected to bat.
	   Lara had made a special request --which was granted -- that he
be allowed to use all his bowlers during the match. Lara wants his
players to have as much practice as possible.

 &UR; Ultra-Orthodox claim elections victory in Jerusalem &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with preliminary results, strong showing of
religious parties in Jerusalem; changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a show of their growing strength, religious
parties won nearly half the seats in Jerusalem's city council and
will have a major say over the disputed city's future.
	   Throughout Israel, candidates representing special interests,
including immigrants from the former Soviet Union, made a strong
showing in municipal elections at the expense of the veteran Labor
and Likud parties, according to preliminary results Wednesday.
	   Jerusalem's secular mayor, Ehud Olmert, was re-elected by a
comfortable majority, but his slate for city council won only two
of 31 seats, sharply undercutting his influence on crucial issues,
such as the budget. Two ultra-Orthodox Parties, Shas and Agudat
Israel, won five and seven seats respectively, and the National
Religious Party, had three seats, for a total of 15.
	   Olmert blamed secular voters whose turnaround fell far below
that of religious residents of Jerusalem.
	   ``The secular public that complained so much and was so afraid
of the ultra-Orthodox, decided at the decisive moment to stay home
and not participate in the elections,'' Olmert told Israel radio.
	   In many ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods, voters were taken to
polling stations by buses organized by candidates for religious
parties. Ultra-Orthodox Jews make up about one-third of Jerusalem's
population of 600,000.
	   Most of the city's 180,000 Palestinian residents stayed away
from the polls at the urging of the Palestinian Authority. The
Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, the sector captured by Israel in
the 1967 Mideast war, as a future capital, and say voting would be
tantamount to accepting Israeli rule in all of the city.
	   Among Jerusalem's Jewish residents, there is a deep divide
between the secular and the religious. The two camps have squared
off in the past, sometimes violently, over issues like budgets for
religious institutions and closing roads on the Jewish Sabbath.
	   After the 1993 municipal elections, in which a strong showing by
religious parties ended popular mayor Teddy Kollek's 28-year
tenure, secular Jerusalem residents seem resigned to the growing
power of the ultra-Orthodox in city politics.
	   ``I'm disappointed,'' said Rami Cohen, a 29-year-old grocery
store clerk. ``They just want more money for their schools, and
there's only one cash register in this city.''
	   ``I knew it would happen,'' said Naava Droma, 21, as she waited
for a bus at Jerusalem's central station. ``There's nothing you can
do,'' she said.
	   Her friends joked about escaping on the first bus to Tel Aviv.
	   Fewer than 50 percent of more than 3 million eligible voters
turned out nationwide Tuesday, prompting Shimon Shetreet, the
unsuccessful Labor candidate for mayor of Jerusalem, to suggest
that no-shows be fined.
	   Ultra-Orthodox parties, on the other hand, helped ensure a good
turn-out by promising blessings and a place in heaven to those who
voted for the right candidates.
	   Eli Barshesky, a 45-year-old educator in Jerusalem, said he
voted for Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party popular among Sephardi Jews
from North African and Middle Eastern countries.
	   ``It's good,'' he said of the elections results. ``The city will
be more considerate of the ultra-Orthodox, give them more money for
schools, ritual baths, and synagogues.''
	   The election results reflected the increasing fragmentation of
Israeli society along ethnic and religious lines, with major
parties losing out to smaller special interest parties or to
candidates running on independent lists.
	   Israel B'Aliya, the party representing Russian immigrants,
fielded candidates in local elections for the first time, and won
dozens of the 2,800 seats up for a vote nationwide. One-issue
parties, such as Dor Shalom, a group of peace activists, and the
Greens, won seats on the Haifa and Tel Aviv city councils.
	   In Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial center and second-largest city,
high school principal Ron Huldai, an independent with Labor
backing, was elected mayor. The popular incumbent, Roni Milo, did
not seek re-election because he plans to challenge Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in the next general elections.
	   The elections were marked by violent incidents at the polling
stations nationwide, with 424 disturbances reported, 13 arrests,
and 24 injuries, police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said.

Hong Kong share prices close sharply higher

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed sharply higher
Wednesday, snapping a four-day losing streak as plenty of cash came
in from overseas investors.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed up 415.99 points, or 4.3
percent, at its high point for the day, 10,137.32. On Tuesday, the
index had fallen 130.60 points.
	   Turnover came to 7.82 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.00
billion), compared with Tuesday's 5.97 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 765 million).
	   Analysts said the rally was not based on any major news, but
rather on perceptions among traders that prices had fallen so
sharply it was time to buy again.
	   Once foreign investors discovered that the Hong Kong stock
market was rebounding, they scrambled to buy shares, said Francis
Lun, an analyst at Pacific Challenge Securities Ltd.
	   Hong Kong's flagship airline, Cathay Pacific Airways, surged 55
Hong Kong cents to 7.70 on news that it was close to completing a
deal to take a controlling stake in Philippine Airlines.
	   Among real estate companies, Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 4.00
Hong Kong dollars to 52.00, and Cheung Kong Holdings gained 4.25
dollars to 56.50.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings gained 5.50 dollars to
181.50, while its affiliate Hang Seng Bank gained 2.25 dollars to
65.50.

Judge tells Anwar to refrain from sharp comments during trial

 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Trial &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The judge in the Anwar Ibrahim
trial says he has had enough of the defendant's sharp comments in
the courthouse.
	   Judge Augustine Paul told Anwar's defense team to keep their
client in check during the former deputy prime minister's trial on
corruption and sexual misconduct charges.
	   What annoyed Judge Paul was an article in Wednesday's editions
of the Star newspaper that described Anwar's quick cookie snack
during a court recess the previous day in the Malaysian capital.
	   ``While munching his food, he (Anwar) said aloud: `No eating in
court, according to Justice Paul,' and then smiled at some of the
policemen, who appeared to be chewing gum,'' the Star reported.
	   The Star also quoted Anwar as poking fun at the unrelated
criminal trial of his former tennis partner in a nearby courthouse.
During the same recess, Anwar harshly criticized Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, in comments already widely distributed
by international news media.
	   Before Wednesday's session started, Judge Paul told Anwar's
lawyers the defendant should avoid making such statements.
	   ``In the interest of justice, I ask this to be stopped,'' Paul
said.
	   The judge said that ``sometimes, the way it was reported makes
it more glamorous or sensational.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Nippon Life Insurance Co. and Deutsche Bank
AG, Germany's largest bank, have agreed to form a joint-venture
asset management company, a spokesman for the Japanese insurer said
Tuesday.
	   Nippon Life and Deutsche Bank will set up an investment-advisory
company in London next spring to handle asset management in Europe,
said Nippon Life's Seiji Shinmura.
	   Nippon Life, Japan's largest insurer, will take a two-thirds
capital position in the venture, with Deutsche Bank holding the
remaining one-third, he said.
	   The amount of capitalization and other details will be worked
out later, Shinmura added.
	   As part of the venture, Nippon Life will establish a global
network for investment trust and asset management that will cover
three core markets across the world _ Japan, the United States and
Europe, Shinmura said.
	   Also, Nippon Life will increase its stake in Deutsche Bank's
Japanese trust-banking subsidiary to 10 percent, up from the
current 5 percent, Shinmura said.
	   In October, Nippon Life strengthened an alliance with Putnum
Investments, a major U.S. asset management company, to develop an
investment trust product line.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese government-run financial institution
will extend 100 billion yen (dlrs 820 million) in a special loan to
Nissan Motor Co., a news report said Wednesday.
	   The loan by the Japan Development Bank, to be made next month,
will be the largest ever given to a single company, the Nihon
Keizai business newspaper said.
	   The money will apparently be used to pay back funds Nissan
borrowed from commercial banks, the paper said.
	   Tatsuya Onishi, a spokesman at Tokyo-based Japan Development
Bank, said the bank does business with Nissan, but added he could
not comment on individual loan cases.
	   Nissan spokesman Keiichi Tsuboi said the automaker, Japan's
second-largest, was still trying to confirm the report.
	   Nissan said Tuesday it posted a net loss of 32.6 billion yen
(dlrs 267 million) for the six months ended in September,
reflecting a sharp fall in the value of its investment in domestic
stocks.
	   Nissan said it has been hit by a deepening slump in demand for
vehicles in its recession-hit home market. Total sales, including
overseas, over the sixth-month period declined 7.7 percent from a
year earlier.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean stainless steel makers
said Wednesday a preliminary U.S. ruling against them would not
seriously affect their exports to the American market.
	   The U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has found
evidence that some stainless steel products from France, Italy and
South Korea are illegally subsidized.
	   Under the ruling, the U.S. Customs Service will require
importers to begin posting a bond or cash deposit to cover any
retroactive duties that may be imposed later.
	   The Commerce Department will make a final decision early next
year.
	   ``The U.S. ruling concerns only a small amount of products by a
few steel makers. It won't affect our exports much,'' said Kim
Sung-woo, a spokesman for the Korean Iron and Steel Association.
	   The ruling applies to stainless steel sheets and strips in coil
sold by three companies, including bankrupt Sammi Steel Co., Inchon
Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. and Taihan Electric Wire Co. Ltd.
	   U.S. steel makers have long complained that government subsidies
and other practices let foreign companies sell goods in the United
States at cut-rate prices, violating the trade laws.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ The national legislature is drafting a law to
consolidate and govern the country's unruly investment trust
industry, the official newspaper Financial News reported Wednesday.
	   Zhang Xiao, a National People's Congress official on the ``Trust
Law'' working committee, said the law will clarify the role of the
investment trust companies and seek to reduce the industry's risks,
the report said.
	   Currently, many trust companies compete with bigger commercial
banks for deposits and also engage in speculative stock trading,
real estate deals and foreign exchange dealings.
	   The wide array of businesses _ combined with heavy overseas debt
exposure _ helped bring down one of China's biggest investment
trusts. Guangdong International Trust &AMP; Investment Co. admitted in
early October it couldn't pay nearly dlrs 2 billion in debts. Its
liabilities are now being handled by the Bank of China, a national
commercial bank.
	   Under the draft version of the new law, trust companies will be
allowed to engage in stock brokering, provide financial advice for
companies undergoing reforms, set up investment funds and assist in
medium- and long-term financing deals for infrastructure and high
technology projects. They will also be able to provide some
financial services in the property sector, according to the
newspaper report.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Foreign direct investment is declining as
recessions in neighboring Asian countries slow the flow of funds
into China, the official newspaper China Daily reported Wednesday.
	   Citing a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development, or Unctad, the newspaper said foreign direct
investment in China was forecast to fall by 12 percent this year to
dlrs 40 billion from dlrs 45.3 billion last year.
	   Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan account for
about two-thirds of China's total foreign direct investment. The
report said prolonged malaise in those economies was taking its
toll on China.
	   According to earlier reports, foreign direct investment remained
steady in the first three quarters of this year at dlrs 31.4
billion, while pledged investment rose 2.45 percent to dlrs 35.8
billion.
	   China's foreign direct investment volume in 1997 accounted for
almost half the flows into the Asia-Pacific region and about
one-third of all foreign direct investment in developing countries,
the report said.
	   China has ranked second behind the United States in attracting
foreign direct investment for the past six years. China's foreign
investment in other countries reached dlrs 2.5 billion last year,
the report said without providing a forecast for 1998.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Big new sales to the United States
and Europe have outweighed the impact of the Asian economic crisis
on Australia's exports, Trade Minister Tim Fischer said Wednesday.
	   He said diversification had been the key to exporters' success.
	   The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Wednesday
released a report which showed that the value of Australia's
exports in the first eight months of 1998 was 7.1 percent higher
than those in the same period last year.
	   Australia's exports to the United States had risen by 41 percent
and to the European Union by 44 percent in that time, Fischer said.
	   But East Asia remains among the most important of Australia's
trading partners, taking more than half Australia's exports in the
year ended June 30, the report said.
	   Fischer said Australia's wine exporters had been particularly
successful in increasing their sales to European countries.
	   Australia's exports to Japan, its biggest customer, in the first
eight months of 1998 were worth Australian dollars 11.5 billion
(U.S. dlrs 7.2 billion), a rise of 7.3 percent over the comparable
period the previous year.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite a late night shooting attack by
Palestinian militants on Israeli soldiers, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu decided not to call off a Cabinet meeting Wednesday in
which the ministers are to ratify the Wye peace agreement.
	   Two soldiers were wounded, one of them seriously, in the
roadside ambush near a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
	   Last week, Netanyahu broke off a Cabinet debate on the
land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians because of a
suicide bombing by Islamic militants in a Jerusalem market.
	   However, Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said Wednesday's
Cabinet session would proceed as scheduled. The ministers were to
convene at 1 p.m. (1100 gmt), after Netanyahu consults with Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.

Hong Kong welfare chief takes first-class day off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ With Hong Kong struggling through recession, an
official who suggested slashing welfare payments raised eyebrows by
flying first class for a day off in London, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The South China Morning post quoted Andrew Leung, director of
the Department of Social Welfare, as saying it was reasonable for
officials to take ``one or two days off'' while they are away on
overseas trips because at other times they are too busy for
relaxation.
	   Leung was attending an international conference in Tel Aviv,
Israel, in July when he stopped over in London aboard the
first-class section of British Airways, the newspaper said.
	   Hong Kong department directors can fly first class on journeys
that exceed six hours, but Leung's extra visit to London pushed his
air fare to 70,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 8,970) _ double the
price of a direct flight, the Post said.
	   The newspaper quoted Leung as saying he did not know how much
his ticket was going to cost the taxpayers.
	   ``I would consider taking business class, particularly with the
present difficult times for the economy,'' Leung said.
	   Leung is paid about 181,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 23,200)
a month to oversee Hong Kong's welfare system. With a financial
downturn bringing unemployment to a 15-year high of 5 percent,
Leung said recently that monthly payments of 12,000 Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1,500) for a struggling family of four were ``a
bit high in the current economic situation,'' so they might be cut.
	   Leung says his official trips, including recent visits to
Canada, Japan and South Africa, have resulted in useful experience
for the government.

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon Wednesday for the fourth
straight day, Lebanese security officials said.
	   The planes fired at least six missiles at three bases of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah group between 5:20 a.m. (0320 GMT) and 6
a.m. (0400 GMT), the officials said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The targets were in Apple Province, about 12 kilometers (seven
miles) north of Nabatiyeh. The area is often used to launch attacks
against Israeli troops in southern Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah reported that its forces suffered no casualties in the
attacks.
	   In Jerusalem, a spokesman for the Israeli military said its
aircraft had attacked ``terrorist positions'' in southern Lebanon
and that the pilots had reported accurate hits.
	   Israeli jets have been carrying out raids on Hezbollah positions
each day since Sunday.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is a Shiite Muslim
fundamentalist group that is fighting to oust the Israeli army and
its proxy South Lebanon Army militia from a zone in southern
Lebanon along the border with Israel.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to curb guerrilla attacks against
its northern territory.

Israel: Spies weren't working on Turkey's behalf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Trying to dispel persistent rumors, Israel's
Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday that two Israelis arrested in
Cyprus last week as suspected spies were not working for Turkey.
	   The statement did not say who had employed the two.
	   ``The two Israelis that were arrested in Cyprus didn't act
against Cyprus and didn't act on Turkey's behalf,'' the statement
said.
	   The arrests have strained relations between Israel and Cyprus,
which has grown increasingly suspicious of Israel's military pact
with Turkey. Cypriot police had said they suspected the Israelis
were spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the
northern third of Cyprus in 1974.
	   But the Foreign Ministry said it would work to maintain good
relations with the island country.
	   ``The friendly relations between the two countries, expressed
recently by the Israeli president's visit to Cyprus, will continue
and will be tightened,'' the statement said.
	   The Foreign Ministry said it would continue to clarify the
issue.

Dozens protest futures swindle outside China's news agency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Dozens of investors bilked in a futures swindle
mobbed China's official news agency Wednesday to demand government
help in retrieving their losses.
	   About 60 protesters stood outside the front gate of the Xinhua
News Agency in central Beijing, held back by 20 to 30 police
officers. Another 50 or so people looked on.
	   The protesters claimed to be customers of the failed Xinguoda
Futures Brokerage Co. Ltd. The company stopped trading in August
and its chairman disappeared, leaving thousands of investors with
tens of millions of dollars in losses.
	   A spokeswoman for Xinhua said the protesters demanded that
Xinhua report their grievances to try to coax the government into
getting back their money.
	   ``The relevant departments are dealing with the matter,'' said
the spokeswoman, Xie Dan.
	   Xinguoda's collapse underscores the problems the Chinese
government has in policing its fledgling, freewheeling free
markets. Unscrupulous operators have moved into everything from
financial securities to door-to-door sales, often preying on
China's struggling working class.
	   Police have arrested the once-missing chairman, Ni Wenliang _ a
41-year-old native of central China who lives in Taiwan and carries
a Belize passport _ and two other accomplices, according to a
Xinhua report Sunday. The report gave the following details:
	   The three lured investors with promises of high returns and
conducted trades on a ``fake exchange'' in eastern Shandong
province.
	   As of Nov. 5, Xinguoda had taken in 532 million yuan (dlrs 64
million) from 4,121 investors and paid out 169 million yuan (dlrs
20 million) in profits and interest.
	   Police have traced 162 million yuan (dlrs 19.6 million), some of
it invested in cash, cars and property and the rest spirited abroad
or hidden inside China. That left more than 200 million yuan (dlrs
24 million) still unaccounted for.

China warns Philippines against low-flying jets over disputed reef
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with diplomatic source saying China relayed concern to
Filipino ambassador Monday, calling low flights over reef
irresponsible and dangerous, grafs 5-6 &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ China has warned that if Philippine
military reconnaissance jets fly too low over a disputed South
China Sea shoal, it might trigger an accidental confrontation, the
Philippine military chief said Wednesday.
	   Armed forces chief of staff Maj. Gen. Joselin Nazareno said he
ordered Philippine military planes not to fly lower than 5,000 feet
(1,515 meters) over Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands
after China protested.
	   ``They were concerned that we were flying very low and this
might be misinterpreted by people and lead to a confrontation,''
Nazareno told reporters.
	   Philippine military S-211 jets have been flying in tandem daily
over the reef, Nazareno said.
	   A senior Chinese official relayed his government's concern
Monday to Philippine Ambassador Romualdo Ong in Beijing, a
diplomatic source said.
	   The source said Chinese authorities consider the low-altitude
flights by Philippine military planes over the reef ``irresponsible
and dangerous because it could lead to something else.''
	   On Tuesday, President Joseph Estrada ordered increased naval
patrols in the area after the military reported that China was
expanding its structures and forces on the reef.
	   Estrada and other officials, however, said the conflict over the
reef would be solved diplomatically and would not lead to a
military confrontation.
	   Last week, Manila delivered a diplomatic protest to Beijing over
the expansion of concrete platforms China built in 1995 at Mischief
Reef, demanding that China dismantle the structures and that
Chinese ships leave the area.
	   China has told Philippine officials that it was repairing
fishing shelters in the area damaged by natural causes, and that it
has a sovereign right to undertake the repairs to ensure the safety
of its fishermen.
	   Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, however, said
China was building massive barracks and possibly a pier that could
be used militarily.
	   Mercado described China's actions as a ``creeping invasion'' of
the Philippine territory and said Manila was considering filing a
complaint at the United Nations.
	   Estrada said he also plans to take up the issue with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin on the sidelines of a meeting of Asia-Pacific
leaders in Malaysia next week.
	   ``We will do it through negotiations. Let us not be
confrontational, you know we cannot afford to,'' he told reporters
Tuesday.
	   The Philippines has one of the weakest militaries in Southeast
Asia and its navy relies on old ships donated by the United States.
	   Mercado showed reporters pictures of a large wooden barracks
being built on stilts on a concrete foundation adjacent to a
cluster of concrete platforms on the two-by-four-mile
(three-by-six-kilometer) reef. The pictures also showed dozens of
workers. Military officers say the barracks could house about 70
people.
	   Mercado said China's occupation of the reef could threaten the
food security of the Philippines by reducing its access to fishery
resources.
	   Mischief Reef, called Panganiban by the Philippines, is about
150 miles (240 kilometers) west of the western Philippine island of
Palawan.
	   The Spratlys island group is claimed in whole or in part by the
Philippines, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei and Malaysia.
	   The Philippines occupies eight of the islands, including Pagasa,
the biggest.

Chemicals company Bayer 9-month net profit up 2 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEVERKUSEN, Germany (AP) _ German chemicals giant Bayer AG said
Wednesday it expects sales in 1998 to be flat but earnings still to
be higher than in 1997.
	   Bayer made its forecasts after reporting nine-month figures that
showed a net profit rise of 2 percent over the same period last
year.
	   ``The world economy has lost much of its momentum and this has
affected us too,'' company chairman Manfred Schneider said.
	   Bayer said sales in the first nine months were 41.1 billion
marks (dlrs 25.8 billion,) slightly up from 41.3 billion marks
(dlrs 25.8 billion) in same period in 1997.
	   Net profit rose 2 percent to 2.42 billion marks (dlrs 1.51
billion) while pretax profit rose 4 percent to 4.1 billion marks
(dlrs 2.57 billion) compared to 3.95 billion. Operating profit rose
5 percent to 4.4 billion marks (dlrs 2.8 billion) from 4.2 billion
marks (dlrs 2.6 billion.)
	   Continuing effects of the economic crisis in Asia and price
pressures will mean full-year 1998 sales ``will be at the 1997
level,'' Schneider said. ``As far as pretax income is concerned, we
believe we still stand a chance of exceeding last year's record
figure.''

Singapore court rejects claims of opposition leader's wife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's High Court on Wednesday rejected
claims by an exiled opposition leader's wife, who sought damages
from ruling party leaders for freezing all her assets between
January 1997 and last Monday.
	   The tangled case has pitted the ruling party leaders against
opposition politician Tang Lian Hong, who was charged with tax
evasion and sued for 4 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 2.4 million)
after he responded to government leaders' criticism by calling them
``liars.''
	   Tang fled in 1997 and was declared bankrupt in absentia. Lawyers
for the government leaders then froze all the assets of Tang's
wife, claiming she was only holding them in trust for her husband.
	   But on Monday, lawyers for Singapore's elder statesman Lee Kuan
Yew told the court they wished to drop the proceedings, saying they
``did not wish to deprive (Mrs. Tang) of whatever little property
she had.''
	   Her prime asset, the once valuable family villa in Singapore,
meanwhile has plummeted in value because of a severe real estate
slump, and a bank took possession of the house in August after Mrs.
Tang was unable to meet mortgage payments.
	   The hearings continued Tuesday, after Mrs. Tang sought
compensation for what she said was a wrongful seizure of her
property. She also wanted the other party to pay her considerable
legal costs.
	   But lawyers for the government leaders said Wednesday her house
is partially owned by Tang, and could be used to pay her legal
bills, Singapore TV reported.
	   Tang, 62, is a lawyer who took his first step into politics in
1996 as a candidate for the small Workers' Party, one of the few
opposition parties in Singapore.
	   During election campaigning in 1996, government leaders labeled
the increasingly popular Tang an ``anti-Christian,
anti-English-educated, Chinese chauvinist,'' charges he denied.
	   Dominant for more than three decades, the People's Action Party
holds all but three seats in Singapore's 84-seat parliament.
	   Singapore is often criticized abroad for using legal procedures
such as defamation suits and tax evasion charges to intimidate
opponents and stifle political debate.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A convoy of U.N. arms inspectors left
Baghdad on Wednesday as the United Nations announced it was
withdrawing its ``non-essential'' staff from Iraq in what appeared
to be a large withdrawal of personnel.
	   The move comes amid reports that the United States was preparing
to strike Iraq in a bid to force Baghdad to back down from its Aug.
5 decision to freeze all cooperation with the commission.
	   A convoy of 11 buses and other vehicles carrying more than 100
U.N. workers and their luggage left the U.N. Special Commission's
Baghdad headquarters.
	   Many of those leaving hugged U.N. workers _ including Iraqi
staffers _ who were staying behind. None would speak with reporters
as they boarded the gold, pink and blue buses.
	   A U.N. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said other
staff would leave later Wednesday. Some of the departing personnel
were flying to the Gulf state of Bahrain, and others were going by
road to neighboring Jordan.
	   The move covered not only UNSCOM but monitors for the
International Atomic Energy Agency and other U.N. workers who run
the oil-for-food program supplying aid to the Iraqi people. Jaakko
Ylitalo, the acting director of UNSCOM in Baghdad, left with three
other officials in a van.
	   Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs in Iraq,
told reporters said the move was ``precautionary'' and taken
``solely with the safety of U.N. staff in mind.''
	   ``In view of uncertainties surrounding the current situation and
following instructions from the U.N. headquarters in New York, it
has been decided to temporarily relocate non-essential U.N. staff
to Amman, Jordan,'' Falt said.
	   He described the step as a ``temporary relocation'' and said it
applies to ``all U.N. staff resident in Baghdad,'' which would
include humanitarian workers.
	   As the vehicles were leaving the compound, U.N. workers were
putting screens up over the windows of the headquarters _ a move
apparently aimed at preventing them from shattering glass into the
building if there were a military strike.
	   Falt said that Hans von Sponeck, head of the humanitarian
operations who also is security coordinator for U.N. staff in
Baghdad, would be remaining.
	   In Bahrain, Goran Wallen, chief of the UNSCOM field office
there, said no UNSCOM officials would be left in Iraq. He said 11
inspectors for the IAEA, which monitors Iraq's nuclear weapons
programs, were also coming to Bahrain.
	   In August, Iraq has said it would not cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors until the U.N. Security Council begins moving to
lift the embargo imposed after Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait in
1990.
	   It allowed some personnel who do long-term monitoring to
continue working, but on Oct. 31 it stopped even that work.
	   The Security Council has said the embargo won't be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction, as required by U.N. resolutions passed after the
1991 Gulf War.
	   Before Wednesday's departures, there were about 110 UNSCOM and
IAEA personnel in the country before the evacuation began. There
were about 400 humanitarian workers.
	   The commission withdrew 15 inspectors from Iraq on Saturday,
saying they had been idle since the government's decision to refuse
to allow them to conduct their work.
	   Despite warnings of a military strike by the United States and
Britain, Iraqi officials have said they will not back down from
their decision to bar the inspectors from working. Iraq appeared to
be turning to other Arab states to head off any attack.
	   On Tuesday, Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf,
chose an Arab television station _ Qatar's Al-Jazeera _ for his
first interview on the dispute.
	   Al-Sahhaf warned that ``any use of military force against Iraq
would lead to destabilizing the region.''
	   Hours later in Washington, President Clinton met with senior
Pentagon officials to explore options for a possible military
attack on Iraq. Defense Secretary William Cohen stepped up the
movement of U.S. ships into the region.
	   ``The military option is still on the table,'' Cohen said.
	   Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, said
Tuesday that ``we have to prepare ourself for a strike obviously _
this does not mean that we don't encourage diplomacy.''
	   He said Iraq has kept channels open through U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy, Prakash Shah, but that
``nothing really has moved today.''
	   U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler, interviewed on the
same program, urged Iraq to face up to the fact that disarmament is
connected to sanctions.
	   ``The key is in its hands _ and it's called full disclosure to
us,'' he said.

China urges Japan to recognize WWII aggression during Jiang visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan should issue a clear statement about its
history of military aggression in China during Chinese President
Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan this month, China's ambassador to
Japan said Wednesday.
	   Chinese Ambassador Chen Jian told reporters that if Japan makes
the overture in a joint statement, it will help open up a new era
of partnership between the two countries.
	   ``Japan should make a clear and appropriate expression regarding
its past history in order ... to lift obstacles to the development
of relations between China and Japan,'' Chen said.
	   ``Through Jiang's visit ... we hope to create the framework for
new strategic, long-term relations into the 21st century,'' he
said.
	   Tokyo's unwillingness to issue a clear apology for wartime
atrocities has been a major obstacle to warmer ties between Japan
and China, even as the countries develop stronger economic bonds.
	   Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura has said he expects
the two countries to settle the issue of Japan's brutal World War
II invasion of China during Jiang's visit, the first by a Chinese
head of state to Japan.
	   Last month, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi issued Tokyo's
fullest apology for its colonial rule over South Korea during South
Korean President Kim Dae-jung's state visit to Japan.
	   Chinese officials have said they are seeking a similar apology
from Tokyo during Jiang's trip.
	   Chen also urged Japan to clarify its stance regarding China's
claims of sovereignty over Taiwan, which Beijing considers a
renegade province.
	   ``We would like to see Japan make a clear expression of its
attitude toward Taiwan'' in the joint statement expected during
Jiang's visit, Chen said.
	   During his visit to Japan Nov. 25-30, Jiang will meet with
Japanese Emperor Akihito, hold talks with Prime Minister Obuchi and
travel to the northern cities of Sendai and Sapporo.

Nuclear watchdog pulls out inspectors from Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Fixes Iraq in overline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Reversing a previous decision, the
International Atomic Energy Agency decided Wednesday to pull out
all IAEA inspectors from Iraq for safety reasons, a spokesman said.
	   ``Having consulted with the secretary general of the United
Nations, our director general decided to temporarily locate all
IAEA inspectors from Baghdad to Bahrein due to concern for their
safety in view of the escalating situation,'' spokesman David Kyd
said.
	   On Tuesday, Kyd told The Associated Press the Vienna-based
nuclear watchdog has no plans to suspend nuclear monitoring work in
Iraq in solidarity with United Nations weapons inspectors.
	   Early Wednesday, a convoy of U.N. arms inspectors left Baghdad
as the United Nations announced it was withdrawing its monitors
from Iraq.
	   The move comes amid reports that the United States was preparing
to strike Iraq in a bid to force Baghdad to back down from its Aug.
5 decision to freeze all cooperation with the inspectors.
	   A convoy of 11 vehicles carrying some 90 U.N. personnel and
their luggage left the U.N. Special Commission's headquarters in
Baghdad Wednesday, and it was apparently heading for the airport or
on the road to neighboring Jordan.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the twelve IAEA inspectors
based in Baghdad were part of that convoy, but Kyd told The AP:
``They are heading for the airport now.''
	   ``The decision has been taken in parallel with that of
UNSCOM,which is also withdrawing its personnel and on whose
logistics support our insspectors depend,'' Kyd said.
	   He said it would be difficult for the IAEA inspectors to do
their work since they depend on UNSCOM for helicopters, medical
support and other logistics.
	   Kyd said it was unclear for what period the IAEA personnel would
be relocated, but stressed the measure was temporary.
	   Iraq's decision to halt inspections was aimed at the U.N.
Special Commission, whose inspectors are charged with eliminating
Iraq's biological and chemical weapons as well as long-range
missiles.
	   The Iraqi ban exempted monitors from the IAEA, whose inspectors
in Iraq had been carrying out ``business as usual,'' Kyd said on
Tuesday.

Musashimaru remains undefeated at 4-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ Hawaiian-born ozeki (champion) Musashimaru
stayed undefeated Wednesday, sharing the lead at 4-0 with five
lower-ranking wrestlers after four days of the 15-day Kyushu Grand
Sumo Tournament.
	   Yokozunas (grand champions) Takanohana and Wakanohana and ozeki
Takanonami also won Wednesday, but Wakanohana was one victory
behind the leader at 3-1, while Takanohana and Takanonami were at
2-2.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani, grabbed No. 3 maegashira
(senior wrestler) Ganyu's belt and bulldozed him out, leaving Ganyu
at 1-3.
	   Takanohana fought off winless No. 2 maegashira Kaiho's hand
thrusts and pulled him down. His elder brother, Wakanohana, thrust
out winless No. 2 maegashira Higonoumi.
	   Takanonami held off No. 1 maegashira Tochiazuma's driving and
leg trick attacks and sent him out, leaving Tochiazuma at 1-3.
	   Tied with Musashimaru at 4-0 were sekiwake (junior champion)
Chiyotaikai, No. 1 maegashira Kaio, No. 4 maegashira Tamakasuga,
No. 9 maegashira Tosanoumi and No. 14 maegashira Kotonishiki.
	   Chiyotaikai, seeking promotion to ozeki, thrust out winless No.
3 maegashira Tochinowaka after a series of hand thrusts.
	   Kaio, who had defeated both yokozunas and ozeki Takanonami in
the first three days, crushed out komusubi (junior champion second
class) Dejima (1-3) in their second bout.
	   In the first, Kaio twisted down Dejima at the ring's edge, but
the five judges ruled that both wrestlers hit the dirt at the same
time.
	   Tosanoumi thrust out winless No. 14 maegashira Akinoshu,
Kotonishiki bulldozed out No. 8 maegashira Wakanojo (1-3), and
Tamakasuga sent out No. 7 maegashira Aogiyama (1-3) from behind.
	   No. 12 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa,
threw down No. 13 maegashira Tokitsuumi (1-3) for his second
victory against two defeats.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 2-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
forced out No. 5-ranked Dewaarashi, leaving both wrestlers at 2-2.
	   No. 10-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon,
slapped down No. 9-ranked Tokitsunada. They also are both 2-2.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 8-ranked Kaishinzan,
or American Henry Armstrong Miller, pushed out No. 9-ranked
Kaigatake and remained undefeated at 2-0.
	   No. 56-ranked Kyokutenzan (1-1), or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha,
was forced out by No. 58-ranked Furuichi.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, No. 47-ranked
Azumakaze (1-1), or Brazilian Tussato Guiuliano Kotinda, slapped
down No. 48-ranked Koutoyama.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
tournament.

Shooting of soldiers could deal new blow to peace deal

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite a late night shooting attack by
Palestinian militants on Israeli soldiers, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu decided not to call off a Cabinet meeting Wednesday in
which the ministers are expected to ratify the Wye peace agreement.
	   Two soldiers were wounded, one of them seriously, in the
roadside ambush near a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
	   Last week, Netanyahu broke off a Cabinet debate on the
land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians because of a
suicide bombing by Islamic militants in a Jerusalem market that
wounded 21 people.
	   However, Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said Wednesday's
Cabinet session would proceed as scheduled. The ministers were to
convene at 1 p.m. (1100 GMT), after Netanyahu consults with Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A one-day national strike to protest
price increases took hold Wednesday, with most factories and
businesses shut down in Harare and provincial centers.
	   Police and army troops, backed by helicopters, patrolled
township suburbs around Harare, where violent riots erupted last
Wednesday because of a 67 percent rise in gasoline prices. There
were no early reports of violence.
	   Workers appeared to be heeding a call by the main labor
federation to stay home and not take part in protest marches.
	   A few small groups of workers gathered on street corners, trying
to hitch rides into Harare. A state-owned bus company scaled back
services after some of its crews joined the strike.
	   Troops set up camps in the volatile dormitory suburb of
Chitungwiza, 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of Harare, scene of
rioting and looting last week.
	   But many Chitungwiza residents took the opportunity Wednesday to
dig on plots of land preparing for the planting of corn ahead of
the upcoming rainy season.
	   It looked like a Sunday in downtown Harare, with light traffic
and most banks and stores closed. Government offices were open but
manned only by handfuls of state employees.
	   ``It's like an anti-government public holiday,'' said Mathias
Wedza, a worker at one of a few fast food outlets that remained
open.
	   The gasoline increase has pushed up prices of food and essential
goods by a third, with latest increases of 20 percent on sugar and
cooking oil hitting Tuesday.
	   The Zimbabwe Confederation of Trade Unions, representing most
labor organizations, called for weekly one-day strikes, and said
its members were demanding urgent negotiations with the government
and employers. They are seeking price reductions and wage
increases.
	   The government blames the gasoline increases on an 80 percent
slide in the value of the Zimbabwe currency against the U.S. dollar
in the past year.
	   The state-controlled Herald newspaper said Wednesday President
Robert Mugabe, at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, appointed Finance
Minister Herbert Murerwa to head a special committee ``to work on
immediate and concrete measures to stabilize the local currency.''
	   The labor federation, representing 90 percent of organized labor
groups, accuses the government of economic mismanagement,
corruption and using resources badly needed at home to deploy 6,000
Zimbabwe troops to support Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   Unrest over deteriorating economic conditions is posing the most
serious threat yet to Mugabe's hold on power.
	   Mugabe, 74, has been the only black leader since 1980, when he
led the former British colony of Rhodesia to independence.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's outspoken vice president said
Wednesday that leaders of the breakaway territory, including
himself, should go before an Islamic court and face a possible
death sentence for constantly quarreling among themselves.
	   Vakha Arsanov said the Chechen government and its political
rivals have been guided by personal ambitions, and have failed to
combat lawlessness that has plagued the territory in the aftermath
of the 1994-96 war with Russia.
	   ``We all fought together against the Russian invasion, but now
we can't find accord,'' he said in an interview. ``Our ambitions
and inability to listen to each other have brought Chechnya to the
present state.''
	   Arsanov said the Chechen leaders should face the death penalty
if convicted the the Shariah courts, or Islamic courts, that have
been set up throughout Chechnya.
	   Arsanov made similar statements during a television broadcast
Tuesday. In those remarks, he also proposed setting up gallows and
guillotines for public executions.
	   He said it would require ``boundless cruelty'' to crush the
current crime wave, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Arsanov is given to making controversial statements, though in
the past his comments have usually been aimed at Russia.
	   Chechen authorities have carried out several public executions
of convicted criminals, and some have been shown on television. The
government halted the practice following international criticism.
	   Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov has come under increasing
criticism recently from a number of prominent Chechen figures who
fought alongside him in the war against Russia.
	   The critics say Maskhadov has been unable to bring about law and
order, and should resign, or be impeached.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdrew two years ago. But no country has recognized its
independence, and Moscow insists the territory is still part of
Russia.

Philippine shares rebound, peso weakens

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing exchange rate &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine shares rebounded
Wednesday, buoyed by bargain-hunting after two consecutive days of
losses, traders said.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks soared
71.13 points, or 4.3 percent, to 1,708.23 after losing a total of
160.97 points, or 9 percent, in the previous two days.
	   The broader All Shares Index surged 19.46 points to 552.54
following a fall of 23.42 points Tuesday.
	   Gainers beat losers 91 to 15, with 29 issues unchanged. Among
gainers were Metro Pacific Corp., Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Co. and property stocks such as C and P Homes, Ayala Land
and Filinvest Land.
	   Nicholas Ty, analyst for Capital Securities One, said
Wednesday's surge was a resumption of the momentum the market has
built up in recent days on the back of a stronger peso.
	   ``Despite profit-taking in previous days, the positive sentiment
for the market remains strong,'' Ty said.
	   Ty said the market draws its resilience from a ``new confidence
in the region'' because of recent moves by various countries to
address the 16-month-old financial crisis.
	   Sung Hung Kai research head Raul Ruiz said economic fundamentals
justify the market's advance, but he doubts whether they would be
enough to lift the main index past 1,800. ``That's pushing it
already,'' he said.
	   Ruiz said, however, that the market should rally if the economy
performed better than expected in the third quarter.
	   The government will release third-quarter data later this month,
but many already expect a further contraction. The country's gross
domestic product contracted by 1.2 percent in the second quarter
due, in part, to poor agricultural production.
	   The Philippine peso closed lower against the U.S. dollar in
moderate trading, weighed down by banks covering short dollar
positions early in the session and slack dollar inflows, traders
said.
	   At the close, the dollar averaged 40.744 pesos, up by less than
1 percent from Tuesday's average of 40.492 pesos. It traded between
40.530 and 41.060 pesos.
	   Volume was moderate at dlrs 199.3 million, compared with
Tuesday's dlrs 270.5 million.
	   Traders said banks that bought dollars in the morning unloaded
some of their positions in afternoon trading, bringing the peso
back up. The peso was last traded at 40.570 to the dollar.

Three endangered cranes poisoned in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIDDELBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Three critically endangered
wattled cranes that were painstakingly reared by humans in crane
costumes were found poisoned, wildlife authorities said Wednesday.
	   The cranes died from eating grain laced with pesticide,
apparently spread by farm laborers seeking to kill game for food,
said Sue Adams, manager of the South African Crane Working Group.
	   They were found by a farmer Monday near Middelburg, about 150
kilometers (95 miles) east of Johannesburg.
	   An estimated 250 wattled crane exist in South Africa. The number
has dwindled as farmers drain their wetland habitat for crops or
grazing. The animal, one of 15 crane species in the world, exists
only in southern Africa.
	   The crane group, part of the national Endangered Wildlife Trust,
has worked to reintroduce the birds into the Mpumalanga highlands,
an area of 300,000 to 400,000 hectares (740,000-1 million acres)
east of Johannesburg.
	   Five chicks were incubated and taught to fly and feed by ``crane
mothers,'' or people dressed in crane costumes and using crane
puppets. Crane chicks form a visual imprint of their mothers, and
without the costumes, the chicks would not breed in the wild, Adams
said.
	   The cranes were raised last year and released into the wild in
January.
	   ``It really is a disaster,'' Adams said.
	   The other two cranes died several weeks ago from power lines.
	   Adams said four cranes were being reared and would be released
in December.

Hundreds of would be immigrants reach Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian coast guard on Wednesday blocked about 300
would-be immigrants who had journeyed across the Adriatic to
Italy's southern shores on crowded dinghies during the night.
	   Authorities estimated that another 200 people, mostly Albanians,
Kurds and Kosovo refugees, fled before the coast guard arrived.
	   Coast guard also rescued 14 Albanians, including a woman and two
children, who were stranded at sea in a sinking dinghy. The group
was escorted back to Durres, an Albanian port city, and turned over
to local police forces.
	   A day earlier, Italy and Albania pledged to work together to
stop criminal gangs who smuggle people across the Adriatic. The
gangs usually charge huge fees for the voyage and often leave the
immigrants stranded in rickety boats off the coast. Dozens have
died trying to swim ashore.
	   Under the accord, Italian police will provide training and
assistance to Albanian forces.
	   The 300 immigrants discovered Wednesday were taken to shelters
in southern Italy, which are filled to maximum capacity. The
government on Tuesday set aside 8.5 billion lire (dlrs 5.4 million)
in its 1999 budget plan to expand existing shelters and build new
ones.

Dozens protest futures swindle outside China's news agency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with protest over, protesters
criticizing Xinhua; picks up 6th graf pvs `Xinguoda's collapse ...
' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Dozens of investors bilked in a futures swindle
mobbed China's official news agency Wednesday to demand that the
government help retrieve their losses.
	   About 60 protesters stood outside the front gate of the Xinhua
News Agency in central Beijing, held back by 20 to 30 police
officers. Another 50 or so people looked on.
	   After about four hours, police moved through the crowd, ordering
the protesters to disperse, which they did.
	   The protesters claimed to be customers of the failed Xinguoda
Futures Brokerage Co. Ltd. The company stopped trading in August
and its chairman disappeared, leaving thousands of investors with
tens of millions of dollars in losses.
	   A spokeswoman for Xinhua said the protesters wanted Xinhua to
report their grievances to get the government to recover their
investments.
	   ``The relevant departments are dealing with the matter,'' said
the spokeswoman, Xie Dan.
	   But protesters also said they marched to Xinhua to criticize the
news agency for inaccurate reporting on the swindle. They did not
explain the inaccuracies.
	   Xinguoda's collapse underscores the problems the Chinese
government has in policing its fledgling, freewheeling free
markets. Unscrupulous operators have moved into everything from
financial securities to door-to-door sales, often preying on
China's struggling working class.
	   Police have arrested the once-missing chairman, Ni Wenliang _ a
41-year-old native of central China who lives in Taiwan and carries
a Belize passport _ and two other accomplices, according to a
Xinhua report Sunday. The report gave the following details:
	   The three lured investors with promises of high returns and
conducted trades on a ``fake exchange'' in eastern Shandong
province.
	   As of Nov. 5, Xinguoda had taken in 532 million yuan (dlrs 64
million) from 4,121 investors and paid out 169 million yuan (dlrs
20 million) in profits and interest.
	   Police have traced 162 million yuan (dlrs 19.6 million), some of
it invested in cash, cars and property and the rest spirited abroad
or hidden inside China. That left more than 200 million yuan (dlrs
24 million) still unaccounted for.

Taylor cashes in on 334
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian cricket captain Mark Taylor,
overwhelmed by the public reaction to his 334 against Pakistan, is
about to cash in on the mammoth innings.
	   Taylor declared on his overnight score in the second test
against Pakistan at Peshawar last month, forever linking himself
with Sir Donald Bradman who scored the same number of runs against
England at Headingley in 1930.
	   Taylor's decision to sit as an equal Australian record holder
deprived him of a chance to break Brian Lara's world record 375,
but might prove to be a financially shrewd decision.
	   Bradman has agreed to endorse a limited edition joint photo
souvenir commemorating their equal record. Retailing for Australian
dlrs 1,334, some proceeds from the 334 photos will go to the
Bradman Museum. No. 334 sold for Aust dlrs 5,000 (U.S. dlrs 3,150)
at auction on Monday.
	   Taylor has received overwhelming support for ending his innings,
an unselfish move which nonetheless failed to help Australia win
the drawn test.
	   ``It has been unbelievable,'' Taylor said. ``Entertaining the
crowd as far as I'm concerned is not about breaking world records.
That's for people who play individual sports. Cricket is about
winning and making the game interesting for spectators and
players.''
	   But it is the big innings that will make big money for Taylor.
	   On sale are 334 framed limited edition bats made by Millichamp
and Hall going for Aust dlrs 750 (U.S. dlrs 420) each. No.1 went
for Aust dlrs 4,500 (U.S. dlrs 2,800) at auction.
	   Next year there'll be a commercial release of a Mark Taylor 334
bat.
	   A special release of 334 magnums of Australian shiraz cabernet
wine is also on sale.
	   ``I've never felt I needed to cash in,'' said Taylor. ``Everyone
would say that I can earn more money but I've never looked at it
from that point of view.
	   ``I've tried to keep my profile the same throughout, that is a
bloke who if he can make a few extra dollars off the field will do
so, but the right way.
	   ``The 334 is obviously something different and I've had a lot of
approaches. That's why I've got a manager.''
	   Taylor said he was trying to get the 334 hype out of the way
before he leads Australia in the opening test against England on
Nov. 20. That game is his 100th test.
	   And does he regret not chasing Lara's record?
	   ``No way. The fact that after 720 minutes and 564 balls I end up
on the same score as Donald Bradman in 1930, that's a greater story
to me than going past Brian Lara's 375. It was fate that I finished
that day on 334. It was a very strange coincidence.''

Study: Pregnancy, nursing may make women smarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Hormones released during pregnancy and
nursing dramatically enrich parts of the brain involved in learning
and memory, a study of animals suggests.
	   The findings, released Tuesday at a Society for Neuroscience
meeting, may help in understanding the effects that higher hormone
levels have on the brain during childbearing.
	   Neuroscientists at the University of Richmond and Randolph Macon
College in Virginia suggested a pregnant animal's behavior changes
because of a permanent shift in the brain.
	   ``We are seeing significant changes,'' said Richmond
neuropsychologist Craig Kinsley, who conducted the study with
Randolph Macon psychologist Kelly Lambert. ``Pregnancy, a perfectly
natural biological experience for the female, appears to mark the
brain for a lifetime.''
	   Special brain cell structures called dendrites _ necessary for
communication between neurons _ doubled in pregnant and nursing lab
mice, the research indicates. At the same time, the number of the
brain's glial cells, which act as scaffolding and communication
conduits, also doubled.
	   The pregnant mice were bolder, more curious and energetic. They
learned mazes more quickly, made fewer mistakes and retained their
new knowledge longer. And the effects appeared to be long-lasting,
researchers found.
	   ``In a way, the brain of a late-pregnant female resembles a toy
factory at Christmas time, receiving orders and gearing up for the
increased demands about to be placed on it,'' Kinsley said in
Wednesday's Los Angeles Times.
	   The findings are inconsistent with research at the University of
Southern California indicating that pregnant women perform poorly
on cognitive tests designed to test memory, perceptual speed and
learning ability.

World War II missiles found underground in southern Croatia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A total of 381 tank missiles, stored
underground during the World War II Italian occupation of southern
Croatian, are being carefully removed from the decades-old shelter,
media reported Wednesday.
	   Police declined to say when exactly the storage was discovered
in the tunnel under the Pisak hill near the city of Sibenik, 250
kilometers (156 miles) south of the capital Zagreb.
	   Experts told Croatian state television late Tuesday that the
amount of pure explosive _ about half a metric ton _ has been a
constant threat to Sibenik and a nearby motorway linking Zagreb
with Croatia's southern coast.
	   The missiles were filled with trinitrotoluene, known as TNT, and
ammonium, Jutarnji list daily reported.
	   Marijan Tomurad, a local chief police, told the paper that. as
time passed, the missiles stuck together due to the underground
water, while TNT leaked from some and crystallized along the walls
of the tunnel. But the missiles' fuses are still intact.
	   The removal of the missiles will take about 20 days because
great care must be taken, he said. They will be destroyed.
	   The area around Sibenik and other parts of Croatia's coast were
controlled by Italian forces during World War II, while Croatia, a
Nazi puppet state, was Italy's ally.

Thailand media urged to be careful with suicide coverage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A spate of copycat incidents has
prompted the government's mental health department to caution the
media to be more sensitive in coverage of suicides.
	   The warning, in a press statement received Wednesday, came two
days after a woman who had been threatening for several hours to
jump from a rooftop accidentally fell to her death after a
misguided rescue attempt.
	   The incident, in Hat Yai, 950 kilometers (590 miles) south of
Bangkok, was captured by television news cameras and broadcast
repeatedly.
	   On Tuesday, in what mental health experts fear was a response to
the explicit broadcasts, four people in and around Bangkok were
reported to have threatened to jump off buildings. One did jump,
and died.
	   The mental health department is calling for an urgent meeting
next week with foreign and local news organizations to discuss news
coverage, a department spokesman said.
	   A report compiled by the department suggested that there is a
parallel between the amount of news coverage of suicides and the
number of attempts.
	   About 4,000 people a year commit suicide, the department's
deputy director general, Dr. Somchai Chakrabhand, was quoted as
saying by the newspaper Bangkok Post Wednesday.
	   The authorities were criticized for their handling of Monday's
incident in Hat Yai.
	   Aside from the abrupt attempt to grab the 25-year-old woman,
Sripraphai Cheoyphiew, no nets had been placed to break her fall
and no ambulance was standing by, even though she was on a roof
ledge for several hours.
	   After she fell, she was taken to hospital by a pickup truck
belonging to a local charity that normally collects bodies from car
accidents. She died two hours later from internal bleeding.

Violence mars Indonesian assembly for second day

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with warning shots fired; four soldiers, two students

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Soldiers fired warning shots and hit
students with sticks Wednesday as protesters marched toward
Parliament, where a special assembly discussed how to reform
Indonesia's authoritarian political structure.
	   Violence broke out when a car driven by students rammed into a
group of riot officers on a main thoroughfare near a group of
luxury hotels, injuring four soldiers. Two students and a
photographer were hurt when angry troops lashed out with rattan
canes.
	   Meanwhile, police and soldiers blocked separate protest marches
near the meeting of the People's Consultative Assembly, the
nation's highest legislative body.
	   The assembly is meeting until Friday to map out a new system of
government after decades of military-backed rule under ex-President
Suharto.
	   One group of 500 students drove in a convoy of buses to within
about a kilometer (half-mile) of the legislature before heavily
armed soldiers stopped them near the studios of state-owned
television.
	   There were no reports of arrests.
	   The students, many of them wearing yellow university jackets,
waved red and white Indonesian flags and chanted anti-government
slogans. Some held up a banner that read: ``Put Suharto on trial.''
	   Another group of students sang the national anthem outside a
nearby hotel where assembly delegates are staying.
	   In May, students occupied the Parliament building for days
before Suharto quit and ended 32 years in power.
	   However, this week thousands of troops and police have been
guarding the green-domed legislature. About 30,000 security
personnel have been deployed across the capital to safeguard the
assembly.
	   The march that ended in a clash with riot officers began at
Proclamation Park, a symbol of Indonesia's struggle for
independence from Dutch colonial rule.
	   Leading opposition figures are not included in the ranks of the
assembly and the students and other opponents are unconvinced by
promises that it will institute sweeping democratic change.
	   The students want the military out of politics and demand that
Suharto be tried for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   Many suspect President B.J. Habibie, once a Suharto protege,
will use this week's meeting to bolster his position. He's expected
to be a candidate for the presidency when the assembly chooses a
head of state late next year.
	   The assembly is to set a date for parliamentary elections,
probably in May. It is also expected to support new laws to
legalize a large number of new political parties.
	   It is likely to back moves to reduce, but not abolish, the
military's representation in Parliament.
	   The streets were quiet and traffic in the normally congested
city was light Wednesday. Many residents chose to stay at home.
Some shops and schools were closed.
	   Fears over potential of violence have slashed retails sales in
Jakarta by an estimated 70 percent, the newspaper Bisnis Indonesia
said.
	   About 1,200 people were killed during last May's violence. Most
were trapped in shopping centers that were set afire. Many of the
centers were owned by members of Indonesia's Chinese minority,
whose relative prosperity is resented by some other Indonesians
amid the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   When the assembly's session opened Tuesday, pro- and
anti-government groups clashed and threw rocks at one another in
several areas before being dispersed by security personnel.

Pakistan seizes 5,000 kilograms of hashish
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMMED RIAZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Armed with automatic rifles,
anti-narcotics police stopped a truck Wednesday packed with 5,000
kilograms (11,000 pounds) of hashish destined for markets in Europe
and the United States, officials said.
	   They said the truck was stopped just 10 kilometers (six miles)
outside Peshawar, at the foot of the Khyber Pass that links
Pakistan to neighboring Afghanistan _ one of the largest producers
of opium, which is used to make heroin.
	   It was the biggest hashish seizure by Pakistan's Anti-Narcotics
Task Force, said Brig. Bharamand Shah, regional director of the
force.
	   ''The fine quality hashish was hidden in sacks in the truck,''
he said.
	   While the hashish was grown in Pakistan's tribal area that
borders Afghanistan, Shah told a news conference that there is more
heroin coming across the border from Afghanistan.
	   Since gaining control of much of northern Afghanistan, the
Taliban religious army has tried to seal its borders with
neighboring Central Asian states.
	   That is bad news for Pakistan because Central Asia had become
the preferred route of smugglers to move heroin out of Afghanistan,
said Shah.
	   ''... The route has shifted once again to Pakistan via the
tribal areas,'' he said.
	   About 200 heroin labs that refine raw opium into heroin are
operating in Afghanistan's eastern Nangarhar province, which
neighbors Pakistan.
	   ''There was a bumper crop of poppies this year and the narcotics
are being dumped in Peshawar and moved to the Punjab and then to
Karachi,'' where it is loaded on ships, said Shah.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ West Indies on Wednesday
opened its problem-plagued South African tour against a provincial
11 without star batsman Jimmy Adams, who was being sent home
because of a cut finger.
	   The match was delayed an hour while uniforms misplaced at the
airport were recovered and brought out to the Soweto cricket oval
with pacemen Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh, who had missed
Tuesday's flight but came in Wednesday morning.
	   West Indies Captain Brian Lara won the toss and elected to bat.
	   Adams cut his right pinky with a bread knife during the flight
over from London Monday night. Manager Clive Lloyd said a doctor
predicted that it would take six weeks to heal, so Adams would
leave South Africa. No replacement was named.
	   Lara made a special request for the exhibition against a Gauteng
Invitation XI, played before a sparse crowd in the hundreds. He
asked to be be allowed to use all his bowlers during the match,
which was granted. Lara wants his players to have as much practice
as possible.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese President Elias Hrawi has
suffered a mild heart attack but is in a stable condition, hospital
officials said Wednesday.
	   A statement issued by Sacre Coeur Hospital in suburban Beirut
said the life of the 73-year-old statesman was not in danger.
	   ``He is recuperating steadily,'' the statement said.
	   Hrawi is due to step down as president on Nov. 24.
	   Hrawi fell ill at the presidential palace in Baabda on Tuesday
night and was taken to the hospital for medical tests. He spent the
night in intensive care, with his wife Mona at his bedside,
presidential aides said.
	   The presidential palace said in a statement that Hrawi's
condition ``does not warrant any worry.''
	   Media reports said the president would return to his residence
within 48 hours.
	   The heart attack came less than two weeks before he hands over
to President-elect Emile Lahoud at the end of an extended nine
years in office.
	   Hrawi appeared on television Tuesday evening awarding a
decoration to a Lebanese bank executive for his community work.
Three days ago, Hrawi traveled to Damascus for a farewell meeting
with his ally, Syrian President Hafez Assad.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mostly higher
Wednesday as bargain hunting and a technical rebound reversed
losses from earlier in the week.
	   Tokyo stocks rose on expectations that most of the debt-laden
banks will apply for public funds under a scheme to strengthen
their capital base, as well as on growing optimism about tax cuts
expected to be included in the government's upcoming economic
stimulus package.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is expected to decide
Thursday on a basic framework for the stimulus plan, then to
release details on Monday.
	   The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues rose 319.93 points, or
2.3 percent, to 14,428.02 after a 86.45-point fall Tuesday.
	   The dollar was trading at 121.12 yen in late afternoon, down
1.20 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its late New York
level of 122.52 yen overnight.
	   The dollar weakened in a round of profit-taking, traders said.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong closed sharply higher, mainly on a
technical rebound after four days of losses.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended up 415.99 points, or 4.3
percent, at an intraday high of 10,137.32.
	   Singapore shares also surged, bolstered by a stronger Singapore
dollar and easing interbank rates.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Index closed up 64.76 points, or 5.5
percent, at 1,236.82.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Shares ended sharply lower after another of the island's
conglomerates said it bounced checks, raising concerns about
companies' cash flow problems. The key Weighted Price Index of the
Taiwan Stock Exchange fell 157.51 points, or 2.3 percent, to
6,654.79.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed sharply higher on the
back of strong gains in the banking sector and by media concern
News Corp. The All Ordinaries index of share prices closed at
2,720.7, up 38.3 points.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices finished lower for a second
consecutive session, pulled down by a fall by market leaders
Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. and Tranz Rail Holdings Ltd. The
benchmark NZSE-40 capital index closed down 20.85 points, or 1.0
percent, at 1,986.56.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher, buoyed by
bargain-hunting after two consecutive days of losses. The
Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks soared 71.13
points, or 4.3 percent, to 1,708.23 after losing a total of 160.97
points, or 9 percent, in the previous two days.
	   BANGKOK: Thai shares closed higher on a rebound in finance
shares after two days of losses, dealers said. The Stock Exchange
of Thailand index gained 19.64 points, or 5.8 percent, closing at
356.26.
	   SEOUL: Share prices ended lower for the second straight day as
the market continued to consolidate following its recent sharp
rise. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 2.54 points to
400.70.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed higher as local
funds and retail players bought into the market, taking advantage
of extra cash in the banking system following an interest rate cut
earlier this week. The benchmark Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
Composite Index rose 8.58 points, or 1.8 percent, closing at
476.12.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian share prices ended higher, following
regional rallies and supported by a stronger rupiah. The JSX Index
closed up 5.703 points, or 1.6 percent, at 363.007.

Government debts spur more protests, leave schools freezing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government's chronic debt problems kept some
schools closed in Russia's Far East because they lack heat, and
wage arrears also prompted several protests in the region
Wednesday.
	   In Vladivostok, the main city on Russia's east coast,
authorities have shut several schools or reduced the duration of
classes because of the energy shortage.
	   Alevtina Belik, the local education chief, said it was the first
time in memory that schools had not received heat before the
arrival of the first snows, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   In the eastern Siberian region of Buryatia, an unpaid worker
shot himself to death while 200 of his colleagues digging a railway
tunnel continued their underground strike that started more than a
week ago.
	   Nikolai Zaigrayev, who was taking part in the protest, came to
the surface and fatally shot himself, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported, quoting local officials.
	   His fellow workers remained in the 15-kilometer (nine-mile)
tunnel near the town of Severomuisk, close to the Lake Baikal,
about 4,400 kilometers (2,700 miles) southeast of Moscow.
	   They were demanding that the government pay off its seven-month
wage debt.
	   Meanwhile, about 120 workers at an aircraft plant in the eastern
city of Ulan-Ude also launched a protest over back wages, claiming
that they haven't been paid in 15 months, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Millions of Russians nationwide have gone without pay for
months, the result of the government's inability to collect taxes.
The situation has grown worse since an economic crisis hit in
August.

British unemployment rate remains steady
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Unemployment in Britain stayed at 4.6 percent for
the third consecutive month in October, although the number of
people claiming welfare rose slightly.
	   The government reported Wednesday that the number claiming
welfare increased by 6,800 to about 1.3 million, partly because of
fewer students leaving welfare rolls at the end of the summer
compared with last year.
	   The 4.6 percent unemployment rate, which has held steady since
August, is the lowest since the summer of 1980. Unemployment stood
at 4.7 percent in July.
	   The number of people in jobs in Britain increased by 124,000
between July and September, the government reported.
	   Employment Minister Andrew Smith said the number of full-time
employees is at its highest level since spring 1981.
	   ``Young people have had a better deal in the last 18 months than
at any time during the preceding 18 years,'' Smith said. ``The
number of young people claiming benefit for more than six months
has halved since April 1997, and is now at its lowest level since
1976.''

Gambian president to visit as Taiwan shores up diplomatic ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Shoring up ties with its African allies,
Taiwan will play host to Gambian President Yahya Jammeh on an
eight-day visit beginning Nov. 18, the Foreign Ministry announced
Wednesday.
	   Jammeh, a 32-year-old retired colonel, will be the third African
head of state to visit Taiwan in 1998, a year that has brought
Taiwan a series of setbacks in its rivalry with China for
diplomatic recognition.
	   During the visit, Jammeh's second since winning power in the
former British colony in a bloodless 1994 coup, the Gambian will
meet Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui and other officials. Jammeh also
plans to visit agricultural stations, fisheries and small business
workshops.
	   Taiwan fetes visiting allied heads of state as major world
leaders, and relies heavily on providing aid to their countries as
an incentive for maintaining diplomatic ties.
	   Gambia, a cigar-shaped country with a population of 1 million,
is the smallest in Africa, and one of just 26 nations that
recognize Taiwan, the island stronghold of Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalists, who fled here amid civil war in 1949.
	   China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province with no right to
international relations, and refuses to recognize countries that
have diplomatic links with the island.
	   Charging ahead in its campaign to isolate Taiwan, China has
poached away four of Taiwan's former allies this year alone, most
recently Tonga on Nov. 2. Switches in relations are usually
precipitated by lavish Chinese offers of aid, loans and investment.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ceremony at Arc de Triomphe, quotes
 &UR; AP Photos planned
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Britain's queen and France's president presided
Wednesday over an occasion both grand and poignant _ the last major
anniversary of the Great War likely to include actual veterans of
the carnage.
	   At 11 a.m., Queen Elizabeth II, wearing a bright lavender coat
and hat, arrived at Paris' grandest military site, Napoleon's Arc
de Triomphe, where she and President Jacques Chirac laid a huge
wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
	   Both were presented to four World War I veterans _ 101-year-old
Gen. Maurice Bourgeois, a lieutenant at Verdun; Abramo Pellencin,
102; Guy Cohen, 101, and Georges Rideau, 101.
	   France's oldest survivor from the war _ Raymond Abescat, 107 _
was unable to attend.
	   The 80th anniversary of when the guns fell silent _ at the 11th
hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 _ was being marked
with pomp and ceremony under sunny skies.
	   ``I prefer not to talk about it,'' an emotional Rideau told
reporters. ``There are good and bad memories. I did my duty.''
	   He said that it was ``painful'' that today's youth did not seem
interested in the Great War.
	   Bruno Manfrini, an 84-year-old World War II veteran, was first
to jump to attention when the French national anthem, the
Marseillaise, began to play at the Arc de Triomphe, saluting with
his white-gloved hand.
	   ``It's a magnificent moment for France to have the queen here on
this occasion,'' Manfrini said. Pointing to the blue sky, he added:
``The good Lord was thinking of us today.''
	   It was supposed to be a quick war, and a ``war to end all
wars,'' but of course it wasn't. It was a four-year nightmare of
unimaginable brutality, one that killed millions and changed Europe
forever.
	   Precious few are still alive who fought in World War I. And yet
fascination with the conflict remains, evident in the countless
grainy, black-and-white photos gracing newspaper and magazine
covers in France and Britain as the anniversary approached.
	   Chirac and the queen were to place another wreath at a statue of
Georges Clemenceau, France's deeply respected World War I leader.
	   There were echoes of World War II as well: the queen planned to
unveil a statue of Sir Winston Churchill, on an avenue renamed the
Avenue Winston Churchill.
	   Later in the day, the queen was to travel to Ypres in Belgium,
where she was joining Belgian King Albert II in remembering the
appalling losses from a four-year war of attrition against the
Germans in the trenches there.
	   There was one major figure missing from the ceremonies:
Germany's new leader, chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, who
informed Chirac he could not attend because his calendar was
already full with creating a new government.
	   Schroeder dismissed as ``rubbish'' reports that he wasn't
attending because he wanted to avoid the past.
	   The Great War killed 13 million civilians and 8.5 million
fighting men. Germany lost an estimated 1.7 million soldiers;
Britain lost more than 900,000; Italy 650,000; the United States
116,000. France was proportionally the hardest hit, with 1.3
million dead.
	   The sheer devastation wrought on France can partly be measured
by the 30,000 or so monuments in cities, towns and villages across
the nation. Some villages list more war dead than their current
populations.
	   As if there were any doubt about the enduring wound left by the
war, a bitter dispute broke out between the political right and
left just days before the anniversary.
	   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, visiting the site of a
suicidal offensive against the Germans at Chemin des Dames, asked
that 49 mutineers executed ``as an example'' be ``fully
reintegrated today into our national collective memory.''
	   Chirac, a rightist, called Jospin's remarks ``inopportune.'' And
a political ally of the president's, former Interior Minister
Jean-Louis Debre, said Jospin's remarks were ``of a nature to
justify acts of mutiny in the future.''
	   The same debate has taken place in Britain, where last week,
some 306 men executed for cowardice or desertion were not included
in a memorial led by the queen.
	   Many are believed now to have been suffering from post-traumatic
stress disorder after enduring the horrors of the trenches for
months.

Ultra-Orthodox claim elections victory in Jerusalem

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a show of their growing strength, religious
parties won nearly half the seats in Jerusalem's city council and
will have a major say over the disputed city's future.
	   Throughout Israel, candidates representing special interests,
including immigrants from the former Soviet Union, made a strong
showing in municipal elections at the expense of the veteran Labor
and Likud parties, according to preliminary results Wednesday.
	   Jerusalem's secular mayor, Ehud Olmert, was re-elected by a
comfortable majority, but his slate for city council won only two
of 31 seats, sharply undercutting his influence on crucial issues,
such as the budget. Two ultra-Orthodox Parties, Shas and Agudat
Israel, won five and seven seats respectively, and the National
Religious Party, had three seats, for a total of 15.
	   Olmert blamed secular voters whose turnout fell far below that
of religious residents of Jerusalem.

Lebanese president suffers mild heart attack, condition stable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Outgoing Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
suffered a mild heart attack but is in stable condition, hospital
officials said Wednesday.
	   A statement issued by Sacre Coeur Hospital in suburban Beirut
said the life of the 73-year-old statesman was not in danger.
	   ``He is recuperating steadily,'' the hospital said.
	   Hrawi is due to step down as president on Nov. 24.
	   Hrawi fell ill at the presidential palace in Baabda on Tuesday
night and was taken to the hospital for medical tests. He spent the
night in intensive care, with his wife Mona at his bedside,
presidential aides said.
	   The presidential palace said in a statement that Hrawi's
condition ``does not warrant any worry.''
	   Media reports said the president would return to his residence
within 48 hours.
	   The heart attack came less than two weeks before he hands over
power to President-elect Emile Lahoud at the end of an extended
nine years in office.
	   Hrawi appeared on television Tuesday evening awarding a
decoration to a Lebanese bank executive for his community work.
Three days ago, Hrawi traveled to Damascus for a farewell meeting
with his ally, Syrian President Hafez Assad.

Michael Owen doubtful for at least two games with hamstring injury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ England and Liverpool star Michael
Owen was set to learn Wednesday the extent of the hamstring injury
he suffered in the Reds' 3-1 home defeat to Tottenham in the League
Cup.
	   The 18-year-old striker, who shot to international stardom with
his goal-scoring exploits at the World Cup in France, was injured
while scoring Liverpool's only goal in Tuesday night's fourth-round
game at Anfield.
	   Owen fell down in pain after stretching to shoot with his left
foot into an open net in the 81st minute. He was helped off the
pitch and watched the rest of the match holding an ice pack to his
hamstring.
	   Owen is doubtful for Saturday's Premier League game against
Leeds and England's international friendly against the Czech
Republic at Wembley next Wednesday.
	   Liverpool received another injury blow Tuesday when midfield
star Steve McManaman, who missed the Tottenham game, was told to
rest for up to six weeks because of a recurrent Achilles injury. He
may not return until early January.
	   The injuries are the latest setback to a Liverpool club which is
in crisis following two straight home defeats, with speculation
mounting that co-manager Roy Evans is on the way out.

U.S. wants ''excuse'' to attack Afghanistan again: Taliban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR SHAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban's chief justice accused
the United States on Wednesday of looking for an ``excuse'' to
launch another missile attack on his war-shattered homeland.
	   And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man Washington calls
Enemy No. 1 and blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in
East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said an interview with The
Associated Press.
	   On Aug. 20 the United States retaliated by firing Tomahawk
missiles at suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan,
killing 26 people. According to U.S. intelligence sources, the
camps were being used to train members of bin Laden's al Qaeda
terrorist group.
	   ``America is looking for an excuse to fire more rockets on our
dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden,'' Saqib said.
	   Washington, which has posted a dlrs 5 million reward for bin
Laden's arrest, hasn't ruled out further attacks on Afghanistan.
	   Saqib, who heads a judicial inquiry established by the Taliban
to investigate the terrorism charges against bin Laden, says the
United States has become insecure.
	   ``America fears its shadow ... in every part of the world it is
afraid and sees every danger connected to bin Laden,'' he said in
an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul.
	   In Afghanistan, bin Laden is considered an honored guest by his
Taliban hosts. They cite Afghan tradition, which demands the host
guarantee his guest protection.
	   So far Saqib says he has no evidence of bin Laden's involvement
in terrorist activities. The Taliban have refused to turn over bin
Laden to the United States, but they say if there is evidence they
will try him under Islamic law.
	   In the 90 percent of Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban a harsh
brand of Islamic justice has been imposed, including the death
penalty.
	   ``We want good relations with the United States and all Muslim
and non-Muslim countries, but they have to respect our ways,'' he
said.
	   Saqib said his inquiry will wind up on Nov. 20 and if there is
no evidence against bin Laden the case will be closed _ at least
for the Taliban.
	   ``Bin Laden is not a sinful man ... America has been silent ...
they have given no evidence,'' he said. ``It is too shameful for
America who is now seen by all that world to have no reason to go
after bin Laden.''

Two U.S. citizens charged with cruelty to students
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Charges have been preferred
against two U.S. citizens after police investigation of a private
American school in Moravia revealed students were held there
against their will and were often inadequately punished, police
said Wednesday.
	   Spokeswoman Dagmar Bartonikova said the two were charged Tuesday
with cruelty to persons in their custody and with curtailing the
students' freedom of movement, charges that can entail eight years
in prison under Czech law.
	   She refused to identify the two by name and to specify what
function they held in the school, but said one of them is a woman.
	   According to media reports, the school is run by U.S. citizen
Glenn Roach and her husband Steven.
	   A judge now must rule whether the two will remain in police
custody, Bartonikova said.
	   Last Friday, police searched the school located in Brno, 200
kilometers (125 miles) southeast of Prague, and interviewed some of
the students after former employees of the school complained that
the children were being unduly punished and were forbidden to leave
the premises.
	   Martin Pilka, the co-owner of Morava Academy agency that runs
the school, told The Associated Press last week that the school is
a regular boarding school for American teenagers who were
neglecting school at home and also had problems to get along with
their families.
	   He ruled out any harsh methods, saying the children were being
regularly taken out for walks and excursions.
	   Pilka said that the school has 60 students aged 15-18. The first
students arrived in Brno in March. The course takes 8 to 10 months,
he said. But he claimed the school is accepted in the United States
as part of the U.S. educational system.
	   He said that Ralph Atkin from St. George, Utah, is the majority
owner of Morava Academy.
	   Czech television said late Tuesday that a first group of
students already left for the United States and the rest will leave
by the end of the week.
	   According to media reports, parents paid dlrs 60 per day for
each child.
	   Nobody was answering the phone at the school on Wednesday, and
the U.S. Embassy in Prague was closed due to a national holiday.

Japan, U.S. trade summit showdown already under way
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The anticipated showdown between
Japan and the United States at next week's Pacific Rim summit
appears already under way, with Washington accusing Tokyo of
offering money to other Asian nations to weaken a proposed
free-trade pact.
	   Japan will donate dlrs 204 million to Asian nations to help
develop their fishing and forestry industries, a major Japanese
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The aid, promised for the next five years, will be announced at
a meeting Saturday of representatives in the Malaysia capital ahead
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit next Tuesday and
Wednesday, the Asahi said.
	   The United States, Australia and Canada will be pushing the
21-member trade forum to agree to a plan to cut tariffs in nine
sectors covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade by 2020.
	   The industries would be chemicals, forest products, medical
equipment, energy, telecommunications equipment, environmental
goods and services, gems and jewelry, fisheries and toys.
	   But Japan, in its worst recession since World War II, insists it
can't accept a fixed schedule for opening its forestry and fishing
industries to outsiders because of domestic politics.
	   APEC's aim is free trade among the developed member nations by
2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   The Japanese aid offer is apparently an attempt to push Japan's
position that technical assistance to develop industries is more
crucial than tariff reductions to wrest the region out of its
current economic crisis.
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky accused Japan of
trying to derail the proposed free-trade pact, known as early
voluntary sectoral liberalization. She said it would fall apart
unless Japan, the world's second-largest economy, signs on to all
nine sectors.
	   ``Japan is going around the region promising overseas
development assistance to countries that don't participate'' in the
pact, she said. ``It's completely outrageous.''
	   She said forestry and fisheries were two sectors that could make
a significant contribution to the trade package as a whole.
	   ``We have to press Japan hard on this,'' Barshefsky said in
Washington Tuesday. ``Other nations have as well, and we wait to
see whether Japan will become a constructive force in APEC, or
whether it will continue on a destructive path that it has thus far
set for itself.''
	   Malaysia, the host for the sixth annual summit, indicated
Tuesday that other Asian nations may line up behind Japan on its
stand against fisheries and forestry.
	   Malaysian trade minister Rafidah Aziz said Japan shouldn't be
pressured into signing on to the pact and that it could still move
forward without those two sectors.
	   Rafidah also indicated that Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad would attempt to steer summit debate toward regulatory
controls on currency speculators.
	   In September, Malaysia imposed sweeping capital controls to curb
flows of speculative money and peg the Malaysian currency at 3.80
ringgit to the dollar.
	   Mahathir has long held that the Asian currency and stock market
turmoil was brought about by speculative attacks by currency
traders and in no way reflected weaknesses of the battered
economies.
	   During the summit, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai is expected
to urge Mahathir to ease his currency controls to facilitate border
trade, the Thai newspaper The Nation reported Wednesday.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join APEC during this summit.

Death toll in floods in western Ukraine rises to 10
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Emergency workers battling floods in
western Ukraine have found another dead body, bringing the death
toll to 10, officials said Wednesday.
	   The water level in the flooded Zakarpattia region, which has
suffered from heavy rains for more than a week, has finally stopped
rising, allowing repair work to proceed, the Emergency Situations
Ministry said.
	   About 9,500 emergency workers were sent to the region where 118
cities, towns and villages have been hit by the floods, destroying
hundreds of buildings and severely damaging roads and railways.
	   The Ukrainian government has appealed for assistance to the
United Nations, European Union and individual countries.
	   The Cabinet so far has allocated 10 million hryvna (2.9 million)
dollars for the relief effort following orders from President
Leonid Kuchma, who visited the region last week.
	   Environment Minister Vasyl Shevchuk said Tuesday no official
estimates of the losses incurred by the floods could yet be
provided.
	   Rains in Zakarpattia are expected to continue for another week,
but they are not expected to inundate more settlements, the
Ukrainian Meteorological Center said.

Government troops repulse rebel attack in northern Uganda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels attacked a village in northern
Uganda and abducted 14 people, and were defeated in a separate raid
on military barracks, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Lord's Resistance Army rebels on Sunday kidnapped the Ugandans
from near Gulu, about 360 kilometers (225 miles) north of the
capital, Kampala, the independent Monitor newspaper said.
	   Later that day, an unspecified number of rebels were captured
during their raid on Agoro barracks, about 520 kilometers (325
miles) north of Kampala, the Monitor reported.
	   Security sources said a ``fierce and decisive'' battle at the
barracks lasted for two hours. They provided no casualty figures.
	   The LRA usually attacks soft targets such as schools, markets
and villages.
	   Defense Minister Stephen Kavuma, who has been designated as army
spokesman on rebel activities, could not be reached for comment
Wednesday.
	   Early this week, the government-owned New Vision newspaper
quoted the army as saying between 200 and 300 LRA rebels had
entered Uganda from bases in southern Sudan.
	   New Vision quoted the army as saying a captured rebel had said
the rebels were accompanied by women who were to act as porters.
The rebels normally use abducted schoolgirls as porters and
concubines, while boys are trained as fighters.
	   Sudan has admitted supporting the LRA in retaliation for
Uganda's assistance to the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which
has been fighting the Islamic government in Sudan for 15 years to
press for increased autonomy and development in the country's
south.
	   Uganda is also fighting two other rebel groups in western and
northwestern border areas.

Newspaper: U.S. could land troops in Iraq as part of attack

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The United States and Britain have planned a
three-phase strike against Iraq that could involve deploying troops
in the country, a leading Arabic newspaper quoted diplomats as
saying.
	   After each phase of military action, the allies would present
Iraq with a list of demands pending further strikes, the
London-based daily Al-Hayat in its Wednesday edition.
	   The diplomats did not specify the demands, but they would
certainly include Iraq's reversing its Aug. 5 decision to freeze
all cooperation with the U.N. inspectors charged with overseeing
the elimination of Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Al-Hayat said the diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity from
Amman, Jordan, citing as the source of the plan briefings to Arab
leaders by U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen during his tour of
the Middle East last week.
	   U.S. officials have not specified what action they might take
against Iraq. But Pentagon planners have prepared deployment orders
that could put tens of thousands of U.S. ground troops, 100 more
warplanes and additional ships into the Gulf should President
Clinton order sustained attacks against the country.
	   The U.S. force in the Gulf is now about half the size it was in
February during the most recent standoff over weapons inspections.
	   The report, leaked to Al-Hayat, the Arab world's leading
newspaper, could be a warning to Iraq that an attack would not be
merely a retaliatory strike but instead a sustained campaign.
	   The London-based newspaper did not say how Arab leaders viewed
the reported plan, but publicly all Arab governments have called
for a peaceful solution to the standoff.
	   There is widespread feeling in the Arab world that the sanctions
imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait have inflicted
too much suffering on ordinary Iraqis. The sanctions, which cover
the sale of oil, have devastated the Iraqi economy.
	   The Security Council has said the embargo will not be lifted
until the weapons inspectors give Iraq a clean bill of health.
	   Al-Hayat outlined the following steps in the plan:
	   _In the first phase, U.S. and British jets would attack bases of
the Iraqi Republican Guards for four days, the newspaper said. The
guards are the elite of the Iraqi army and regarded as the mainstay
of President Saddam Hussein's government.
	   The United States and Britain would then issue an ultimatum to
the Baghdad government, Al-Hayat reported.
	   _In the second stage, if Baghdad does not respond to demands,
the American and British air forces would hit presidential palaces
and Iraq's infrastructure, including the bridges that were
destroyed in the 1991 Gulf War but repaired since.
	   After the second phase, ``a harsher list of demands'' would be
delivered to Iraq.
	   _ Finally, if Baghdad did not respond satisfactorily, the U.S.
and British forces would land troops in Iraq to attack ``sensitive
sites.''
	   America and Britain drew up the plan during the earlier crisis,
it said. That standoff ended in February when U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan visited Baghdad to broker a
compromise.

	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The authorized biography of President
Daniel arap Moi has become an overnight bestseller as Kenyans scoop
it up to learn about the man who has run their country for 20 years
but has revealed little about himself in the process.
	   ``Moi: The Making of an African Statesman,'' by Andrew Morton _
whose book on Princess Diana first revealed the depth of her
unhappiness as a member of the British royal family _ went on sale
Nov. 2 in paperback for 600 shillings (dlrs 10).
	   ``The book is selling very fast. We have not seen anything
selling like this one,'' Deepak Shah, manager of Bookpoint, the
sole agent for the book in East Africa, said Wednesday. He said the
book had sold 3,500 copies _ both retail and wholesale.
	   The hardback version will go on sale in Britain Nov. 20 for 20
pounds (dlrs 33.5).
	   The independent weekly East African began serializing the book
Monday, a practice the Kenya Times warned could be misused ``for
diabolical purposes.'' The daily is owned by Moi's ruling Kenya
African National Union party.
	   --
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ The first of five boatloads of
Liberians returning to their homeland has departed the Ivory Coast
under a U.N. repatriation program, U.N. officials said.
	   The 179 Liberians boarded a boat in the Ivorian port of San
Pedro on Monday for Monrovia, the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees reported Tuesday.
	   Four other sea trips to transport another 2,000 refugees were
planned for this month, the statement said.
	   Over 20,000 Liberians have returned home from the Ivory Coast so
far under the UNHCR program.
	   But last month, the U.N. reported that over 4,000 Liberians
arrived in Ivory Coast in a fresh exodus following a clash between
a former rebel leader and government troops.
	   --
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ President Jerry Rawlings has reshuffled his
Cabinet, changing the portfolios of six of his ministers.
	   A government statement issued Monday said that Minister of
Communications Ekwow Spio-Garbrah moves to the ministry of
education, taking over for Christina Amoako-Nuamah, who moves to
the ministry of lands of forestry.
	   Joseph Owusu-Acheampong, minister of parliamentary affairs,
switches jobs with Minister of Agriculture Kwabena Adjei.
	   Minister of Lands and Forestry Cletus Avoka takes over from John
Afful at the ministry of environment, science and technology while
Afful becomes a presidential staffer.
	   Rawlings also shuffled eight of his regional ministers, who
administer Ghana's various regions.
	   No reason has been immediately given for the changes.
	   --
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The European Union plans to inspect
Mozambique's fisheries sector.
	   The Mozambican Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries told the
Mozambique News Agency, AIM, that an EU mission is to visit Maputo
at the end of November to undertake a general inspection of the
sector.
	   The team wants to see how Mozambique is improving the quality of
its exports to Europe and living up to EU norms, the ministry said.
	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Foreign Minister Eriya Kategaya and U.S.
Ambassador Nancy Powell have called for domestic and political
solutions to the conflict in neighboring Congo, Radio Uganda said
Wednesday.
	   The government-run radio said both Kategaya, who is a longtime
friend and comrade-in-arms of President Yoweri Museveni, and the
U.S. diplomat acknowledged that rebels attempting to oust Congolese
President Laurent Kabila are a major factor in settling the
conflict and expressed hope for a negotiated settlement.
	   The radio said Powell met with Kategaya at his office Tuesday.
	   Uganda has two army battalions in Congo that were initially sent
to root out Ugandan rebels based in eastern Congo.
	   But Museveni has acknowledged lately that Ugandan troops have
expanded their operations beyond hunting down the rebels.
	   Last week Rwanda publicly acknowledged that it had troops in
Congo in support of the rebellion that broke out Aug. 2.
	   --
	   GABORONE, Botswana (AP) _ More than 300 Namibians from a group
planning the secession of the Caprivi area in Namibia have crossed
illegally into Botswana in the past week.
	   They claimed to be running from Namibian Defence Force patrols
and wanted asylum, presidential spokesman Andrew Sesinyi said on
Wednesday.
	   The government had not yet ruled on the status of the Namibians.
	   ``They are asking for protection against forcible return to
Namibia, where they claim their lives and freedom would be in
jeopardy,'' Sesinyi said.
	   United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has found that the
fears are ``plausible,'' he said.
	   Namibian President Sam Nujoma has called on Botswana to
extradite the group. Sesinyi said there had not been a formal
application for the group's extradition.

Violence mars Indonesian assembly for second day

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Soldiers fired warning shots and beat
students with sticks Wednesday when they blocked protesters from
marching toward Parliament, where a special assembly discussed how
to reform Indonesia's authoritarian political structure.
	   Witnesses said the violence broke out when a car driven by
students rammed into a group of riot officers on a main
thoroughfare near a group of luxury hotels in downtown Jakarta,
injuring four soldiers.
	   Two students and a photographer were hurt when angry troops
lashed out with rattan canes.
	   Witnesses said the car drove at high speed toward a group of
police who had blocked several thousand students from marching.
	   Frustrated by the security clampdown, the students staged a
sit-in street protest.
	   Later, scores of troops and police with riot shields gathered
near the presidential palace and the National Monument, about one
kilometer (half-mile) away, as a precaution against further
trouble.
	   Meanwhile, police and soldiers blocked separate protest marches
near the meeting of the People's Consultative Assembly, the
nation's highest legislative body.
	   The assembly is meeting until Friday to map out a new system of
government after decades of military-backed rule under ex-President
Suharto.
	   One group of 500 students drove in a convoy of buses to within
about a kilometer (half-mile) of the legislature before heavily
armed soldiers stopped them near the studios of state-owned
television.
	   There were no reports of arrests.
	   The students, many of them wearing yellow university jackets,
waved red and white Indonesian flags and chanted anti-government
slogans. Some held up a banner that read: ``Put Suharto on trial.''
	   Another group of students sang the national anthem outside a
nearby hotel where assembly delegates are staying.
	   In May, students occupied the Parliament building for days
before Suharto quit and ended 32 years in power.
	   However, this week thousands of troops and police have been
guarding the green-domed legislature. About 30,000 security
personnel have been deployed across the capital to safeguard the
assembly.
	   The march that ended in a clash with riot officers began at
Proclamation Park, a symbol of Indonesia's struggle for
independence from Dutch colonial rule.
	   Leading opposition figures are not included in the ranks of the
assembly and the students and other opponents are unconvinced by
promises that it will institute sweeping democratic change.
	   The students want the military out of politics and demand that
Suharto be tried for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   Many suspect President B.J. Habibie, once a Suharto protege,
will use this week's meeting to bolster his position. He's expected
to be a candidate for the presidency when the assembly chooses a
head of state late next year.
	   The assembly is to set a date for parliamentary elections,
probably in May. It is also expected to support new laws to
legalize a large number of new political parties.
	   It is likely to back moves to reduce, but not abolish, the
military's representation in Parliament.
	   The streets were quiet and traffic in the normally congested
city was light Wednesday. Many residents chose to stay at home.
Some shops and schools were closed.
	   Fears over potential of violence have slashed retails sales in
Jakarta by an estimated 70 percent, the newspaper Bisnis Indonesia
said.
	   About 1,200 people were killed during last May's violence. Most
were trapped in shopping centers that were set afire. Many of the
centers were owned by members of Indonesia's Chinese minority,
whose relative prosperity is resented by some other Indonesians
amid the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   When the assembly's session opened Tuesday, pro- and
anti-government groups clashed and threw rocks at one another in
several areas before being dispersed by security personnel.

Turkish premier implicated to bank scandal, pressured to

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Wednesday
faced intense pressure to step down after allegations that he
interfered in a privatization contract and helped a businessman
linked to a mobster secure loans.
	   Deniz Baykal, leader of the center-left Republican party whose
backing in parliament helps Yilmaz's minority government, said he
would withdraw his support unless the premier resigned immediately.
	   Two opposition parties threatened to press for a motion to
censure the government.
	   The allegations were made by businessman Korkmaz Yigit, who
claimed that Yilmaz and Gunes Taner, the economy minister, had
encouraged him to buy the state-run bank Turkbank, offering him
loans from other state banks to ensure that his offer was the
highest bid.
	   Yigit's allegations were carried Tuesday night on two of his TV
channels which showed a videotape he had made to explain his
version of the story before his detention Monday evening for
questioning about the bidding.
	   Yigit bought the bank at a public auction in August for dlrs 600
million. The government suspended the privatization last month
after a lawmaker released an audio tape of a conversation
supposedly between Yigit and mobster Alaattin Cakici.
	   On that earlier tape, Cakici was heard assuring Yigit that he
will fend off rival bidders. It was not clear who made the tape,
which got into the hands of an opposition deputy.
	   Yigit claimed Yilmaz and Taner were aware of Cakici's
involvement in the bidding for the bank but urged him nevertheless
to go ahead with the bidding.
	   Yilmaz has said that an intelligence report revealing Yigit's
ties with Cakici only reached him after Yigit won the tender.
	   Yigit said the premier had also encouraged him to buy
mass-circulation national newspaper Milliyet, apparently to ensure
the paper's backing to his center-right Motherland party in
elections next year. Milliyet's sale to Yigit was canceled after
the scandal.
	   Cakici was arrested in France in August. Turkey has requested
his extradition.
	   Last month State Minister Eyup Asik resigned after allegations
he had been in close contact with Cakici.

`Xinguoda's collapse ... ' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ More than 200 investors bilked in a futures
swindle mobbed China's official news agency Wednesday, demanding
that the government take responsibility and help retrieve their
losses.
	   The protesters marched to the front gate of the Xinhua News
Agency in central Beijing, where they were held back by 20 to 30
police officers. Another 50 or so people looked on.
	   After about four hours, the number of protesters dwindled to
about 50 and police moved through the crowd, ordering them to
disperse, which they did.
	   The protesters, investors in the failed Xinguoda Futures
Brokerage Co. Ltd., were upset with a Xinhua report on the
company's collapse because it evaded official responsibility. They
demanded a new account to pressure the government.
	   A leaflet distributed by the protesters noted that Xinhua made
no mention of alleged investments by the People's Armed Police and
Xinguoda's regulatory approval by the China's Securities Regulatory
Commission, the central bank and other agencies.
	   ``Who ought to take responsibility for these consequences?'' the
leaflet said.
	   ``We believe this report was a prelude to allowing these
agencies to skillfully escape _ like a cicada sloughing off its
skin _ and ultimately put the responsibility on the investors,''
the leaflet said.
	   The protesters requested a meeting with Premier Zhu Rongji and
the regulatory agencies to resolve their claims.
	   ``The relevant departments are dealing with the matter,'' said
Xinhua spokeswoman, Xie Dan.
	   Xinguoda's collapse underscores the problems the Chinese
government has in policing its fledgling, freewheeling free
markets. Unscrupulous operators have moved into everything from
financial securities to door-to-door sales, often preying on
China's struggling working class.
	   Police have arrested the once-missing chairman, Ni Wenliang _ a
41-year-old native of central China who lives in Taiwan and carries
a Belize passport _ and two other accomplices, according to the
Xinhua report that the protesters questioned. The report gave the
following details:
	   The three lured investors with promises of high returns and
conducted trades on a ``fake exchange'' in eastern Shandong
province.
	   As of Nov. 5, Xinguoda had taken in 532 million yuan (dlrs 64
million) from 4,121 investors and paid out 169 million yuan (dlrs
20 million) in profits and interest.
	   Police have traced 162 million yuan (dlrs 19.6 million), some of
it invested in cash, cars and property and the rest spirited abroad
or hidden inside China. That left more than 200 million yuan (dlrs
24 million) still unaccounted for.

Families of sailors sue Windjammer, saying trip was a suicide

<TEXT>
	   NEW AMSTERDAM, Guyana (AP) _ Families of sailors lost in
Hurricane Mitch are suing a Miami cruise company for dlrs 1 million
apiece, accusing it of sending a crew on a suicide mission in an
attempt to save the pride of its fleet.
	   Windjammer Barefoot Cruises Inc. said it believed it did
everything possible to save the crew and its 71-year-old Fantome, a
four-masted, 280-foot (85-meter) vessel once owned by Aristotle
Onassis.
	   On Oct. 27, a day after rushing to deposit 100 passengers in
Belize City, the Fantome said in its last message that it was being
buffeted by 115-mph (185-kph) winds and 40-foot (12-meter) waves.
Rescuers gave up their search Nov. 5, after finding only some life
vests, life rafts and part of a staircase.
	   At least six lawsuits asking for dlrs 1 million per family have
been filed by relatives in Honduras, Antigua, Guyana and Jamaica,
``and there are probably going to be many, many more,'' Nelson
Ayala, an investigator for the Miami law firm Huggett and
Scornavacca, said Tuesday.
	   ``We believe Windjammer attempted to save their 10 or 15
million-dollar vessel instead of worrying about the crew members.
Low-income, low-paid Third Worlders were instructed to save the
vessel no matter what,'' he said. ``Basically, it was a suicide
voyage.''
	   James Canty, vice president of corporate development for
Windjammer, described the allegations as ``false accusations from a
self-serving personal-injury attorney.''
	   ``This storm was a tragedy to all the family members of
Windjammer and thousands of people in Central America,'' Canty told
The Associated Press. He pointed out that it was standard practice
for ships to ride out storms, and said the company believed it had
done everything correctly.
	   As Mitch approached, Fantome was ordered from the Honduran port
of Omoa, north to Belize City. There, it dropped off its 100
passengers and 10 nonessential crew. Another 31 crew members stayed
aboard, planning to head north toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula to
get away from Mitch. But the storm changed course and the ship was
caught.
	   Several Miami lawyers flew to countries of victims last week,
about the same time Windjammer sent representatives to discuss
compensation.
	   British captain Guyan March commanded a crew from Guyana, St.
Vincent, Jamaica, Honduras, Antigua, Nicaragua, Panama, St. Lucia,
Trinidad and Romania.
	   Ayala said the company paid relatives two months' salary,
amounting to dlrs 300 for kitchen helpers and dlrs 500 for an
engineer. Canty said those figures sounded ``very possible,'' and
that Windjammer has set up a trust fund to help families of the
sailors.
	   Some relatives, including Sanita Dindiall, 30, of Guyana, have
said they believe ethnicity played a role in Windjammer's
decisions.
	   ``The owners of the vessel couldn't care less about these
Caribbean people,'' said Dindiall, whose husband Maxell Bhikham was
a crew member. ``They should have put off everybody, not just the
white passengers.''

Turkish premier implicated in bank scandal, pressured to quit

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore all of overline &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Wednesday
faced intense pressure to step down after allegations that he
interfered in a privatization contract and helped a businessman
linked to a mobster secure loans.
	   Deniz Baykal, leader of the center-left Republican party whose
backing in parliament helps Yilmaz's minority government, said he
would withdraw his support unless the premier resigned immediately.
	   Two opposition parties threatened to press for a motion to
censure the government.
	   The allegations were made by businessman Korkmaz Yigit, who
claimed that Yilmaz and Gunes Taner, the economy minister, had
encouraged him to buy the state-run bank Turkbank, offering him
loans from other state banks to ensure that his offer was the
highest bid.
	   Yigit's allegations were carried Tuesday night on two of his TV
channels which showed a videotape he had made to explain his
version of the story before his detention Monday evening for
questioning about the bidding.
	   Yigit bought the bank at a public auction in August for dlrs 600
million. The government suspended the privatization last month
after a lawmaker released an audio tape of a conversation
supposedly between Yigit and mobster Alaattin Cakici.
	   On that earlier tape, Cakici was heard assuring Yigit that he
will fend off rival bidders. It was not clear who made the tape,
which got into the hands of an opposition deputy.
	   Yigit claimed Yilmaz and Taner were aware of Cakici's
involvement in the bidding for the bank but urged him nevertheless
to go ahead with the bidding.
	   Yilmaz has said that an intelligence report revealing Yigit's
ties with Cakici only reached him after Yigit won the tender.
	   Yigit said the premier had also encouraged him to buy
mass-circulation national newspaper Milliyet, apparently to ensure
the paper's backing to his center-right Motherland party in
elections next year. Milliyet's sale to Yigit was canceled after
the scandal.
	   Cakici was arrested in France in August. Turkey has requested
his extradition.
	   Last month State Minister Eyup Asik resigned after allegations
he had been in close contact with Cakici.

U.N. withdraws arms inspectors from Iraq

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A convoy of U.N. arms inspectors rolled out
of Baghdad Wednesday in a major pullout of U.N. staff that comes
amid preparations for a U.S. military strike against Iraq.
	   Eleven buses and other vehicles carrying more than 100 U.N.
workers and their luggage left the U.N. Special Commission's
headquarters in Baghdad. Many of those leaving hugged the U.N.
workers, including Iraqi employees, who were staying behind. None
would speak with reporters as they boarded the buses.
	   Other U.N. workers were putting screens over the office windows
_ a move apparently aimed at preventing them from shattering glass
into the building in the event of a U.S. military strike.
	   Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs in Iraq,
told reporters that the move was ``precautionary'' and taken
``solely with the safety of U.N. staff in mind.''
	   ``In view of uncertainties surrounding the current situation and
following instructions from the U.N. headquarters in New York, it
has been decided to temporarily relocate nonessential U.N. staff to
Amman, Jordan,'' Falt said.
	   The United States and Britain have warned that military force
may be used to try to force Baghdad to back down from its decision
to freeze all cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, or
UNSCOM, which is responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton met Tuesday with senior Pentagon
officials to explore options for a military attack, and Washington
has stepped up the movement of U.S. ships into the region.
	   Iraq has said it will not cooperate with U.N. inspectors until
the U.N. Security Council begins moving to lift an embargo imposed
after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in August 1990, sparking the Gulf
War. The Security Council maintains the embargo won't be lifted
until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction, including chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons programs and long-range missiles.
	   A U.N. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said more
staff would leave later Wednesday. Some departing personnel were
flying to the gulf state of Bahrain; others were traveling by road
to neighboring Jordan.
	   The move covered not only workers affiliated with the U.N.
Special Commission, but also monitors for the Vienna-based
International Atomic Energy Agency and U.N. workers who run the
oil-for-food program supplying aid to the Iraqi people. Jaakko
Ylitalo, acting director of UNSCOM in Baghdad, left with three
other officials in a van.
	   Hans von Sponeck, head of humanitarian operations and security
coordinator for U.N. staff in Baghdad, would be remaining, Falt
said.
	   In Bahrain, Goran Wallen, chief of the Special Commission field
office there, said no UNSCOM officials would be left in Iraq.
	   David Kyd, spokesman for the IAEA, said Wednesday that the
decision to temporarily send its 12 inspectors to Bahrain was ``due
to concern for their safety in view of the escalating situation.''
	   He noted, however, that it would have been difficult for IAEA
inspectors to keep working in Iraq because they depend on UNSCOM
for helicopters, medical support and other logistics. The IAEA
monitors Iraq's nuclear weapons programs.
	   Iraq said in August that it would not cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors until the U.N. Security Council begins moving to
lift the sanctions. It allowed some personnel who do long-term
monitoring to continue working, but on Oct. 31 it stopped even that
work.
	   Before Wednesday's departures, there were about 110 UNSCOM and
IAEA personnel in the country and about 400 humanitarian workers.
The Special Commission withdrew 15 idled inspectors from Iraq on
Saturday.
	   Iraqi officials have said even the threat of force would not
compel them to back down from their decision to bar inspectors from
working. Iraq appeared to be turning to other Arab states to head
off any attack.
	   On Tuesday, Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf,
warned that ``any use of military force against Iraq would lead to
destabilizing the region.''

Germany to grant rights to gay couples, but rules out adoption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new center-left government
intends to grant some legal status to same-sex couples, but not the
right to adopt children, Justice Minister Herta Daeuber-Gmelin
said.
	   ``We're not calling it gay marriage,'' the Social Democrat told
journalists Tuesday night.
	   Expanding on a promise made in the new government's coalition
agreement last month, she said gay couples should be able to
officially register long-term relationships and receive some of the
same rights and responsibilites granted to married heterosexual
couples.
	   But she said traditional marriage would retain its special
protection under the constitution, and ruled out allowing same-sex
couples to adopt.
	   The state has no interest in the sexual orientation of its
citizens, but does have to promote the efforts of people to support
each other, she said.
	   What's needed is ``a conceptual and legal differentiation'' from
marriage, she said.
	   A recent proposal by France's leftist government to give legal
status to homosexual and other unmarried couples prompted street
protests in Paris and a bitter fight by opposition lawmakers to
kill the bill.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian cargo plane crashed into the woods near
the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk on Wednesday, killing as many as
14 people.
	   The Emergency Situations Ministry and Russian media reports said
all on board were killed, but they gave conflicting figures on how
many people were on the plane, ranging from 12 to 14.
	   The AN-12 aircraft, loaded with food, went down and exploded
into flames moments after taking off from Krasnoyarsk, where it had
refueled. It was traveling on to the Siberian town of Mirny, said
Irina Andriyanova, a spokeswoman with the Emergency Situations
Ministry in Moscow.
	   A rescue helicopter was sent to the site of the burning wreak
just outside the city, but there were no survivors, officials said.
	   There were seven crew members on the plane and up to seven
people accompanying the cargo, officials added.

Legislator calls for help to save endangered species of antelope
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A legislator from northeastern Kenya
Wednesday showed reporters two skulls of an endangered species of
antelope supposedly protected under a community-based program to
show the animals are dying from tick-borne diseases.
	   ``The villagers are lacking medicine. They do not have the
potential to treat these animals,'' said Alias Shill, an opposition
member of parliament from Fafi constituency in North Eastern
Province.
	   ``We are telling Kenya Wildlife Service that if they do not do
quick action the Hirola antelopes will be wiped out in the next two
months.''
	   The Hirola, also known as Hunter's antelope, is a species with a
rusty tan or sandy coat, long horns, inverted white chevron between
the eyes and mostly white tail. It is found in Garissa district in
North Eastern Province at the Awarale game reserve, about 350
kilometers (218 miles) northeast of Nairobi.
	   In 1996, the local community stopped KWS from relocating the
antelopes to Tsavo East National Park and agreed to conserve the
them in their natural habitant with assistant from the wildlife
service.
	   ``The area is neglected. We are telling them (KWS), this is the
last resource, and you told us it is an endangered species,'' Shill
said.
	   In 1996, there were only 350 Hirola left in Kenya, down from an
estimated 14,000 in 1976, according to a KWS report.

Military delays attempt to rescue kidnapped foreigners as
</HEADLINE>
negotiations reopen &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOLO, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine military delayed a plan
to rescue three abducted foreigners Wednesday to give civilian
negotiators a final chance to persuade the kidnappers to free their
captives peacefully, officials said.
	   At least five Muslim civilian emissaries have offered to broker
talks with kidnappers who took two Hong Kong citizens and a
Malaysian in the southern Philippines Sept. 8, said Munib Estino,
governor of Sulu province.
	   Estino said the government had given the kidnappers until
Tuesday to free the three foreigners, but a military offensive
against the kidnappers' suspected jungle lair was called off to
allow the negotiations.
	   The negotiators were given safe conduct passes to enter the
kidnappers' lair. Police and military officials, however, opposed
the new talks, fearing they could give the kidnappers more time to
consolidate, police sources said.
	   The ultimatum was given because of the difficulty of raising the
dlrs 1.5 million ransom demanded by the kidnappers and in line with
the government's policy not to pay, said Estino.
	   Munib said the captives, Law Cheung Yau and So Chi Ming of Hong
Kong and Tong Ket Ming of Malaysia, were buying live fish for sale
to Hong Kong restaurants when they were seized from an island in
Tawi-tawi province near the Philippine boundary with the east
Malaysian state of Sabah, about 1,040 kilometers (650 miles) south
of Manila.
	   Authorities say the kidnappers are members of the extremist Abu
Sayyaf Muslim group and disgruntled former members of the Moro
National Liberation Front, which signed a peace accord with the
government two years ago.
	   Talks also were continuing for the freedom of Italian missionary
priest Luciano Benedetti, who was kidnapped in Sibuco, northwest of
Zamboanga, by another suspected Muslim rebel group on the same day
the three other foreigners were seized.
	   The Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the group suspected by the
government in Benedetti's abduction, has denied any role in the
kidnapping.
	   A day later, the mother and family of a Taiwanese businessman
were also abducted in Zamboanga City.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Britain's queen and France's president presided
Wednesday over an occasion both grand and poignant _ the last major
anniversary of the Great War likely to include actual veterans of
the carnage.
	   The 80th anniversary of when the guns fell silent _ at the 11th
hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 _ was marked with
all the pomp and ceremony the French are famous for, under a
brilliant blue sky.
	   At the stroke of 11, Queen Elizabeth II, wearing a bright
lavender coat and hat, arrived at Paris' grandest military site,
Napoleon's Arc de Triomphe.
	   She was greeted by President Jacques Chirac, and together they
walked under the arch to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, where the
queen laid a huge red wreath by the eternal flame, inscribed: ``In
Memory of the Glorious Dead.''
	   The two leaders were introduced to four World War I veterans _
101-year-old Gen. Maurice Bourgeois, a lieutenant at Verdun; Abramo
Pellencin, 102; Guy Cohen, 101, and Georges Rideau, 101.
	   France's oldest survivor from the war _ Raymond Abescat, 107 _
was unable to attend.
	   ``There are good and bad memories,'' an emotional Rideau told
reporters. ``I did my duty. I prefer not to talk about it.''
	   He said it was ``painful'' that today's youth did not seem
interested in the Great War.
	   Bruno Manfrini, an 84-year-old World War II veteran, was the
first to jump to attention when the French national anthem, the
Marseillaise, began to play, saluting with his white-gloved hand,
and weeping at the same time.
	   ``It's a magnificent moment for France to have the queen here on
this occasion,'' Manfrini said.
	   Arlette Huiban, 72, a volunteer nurse in World War II, wore her
own medals and those of her husband, a World War II pilot who was
killed in a wartime accident. ``This is a day to remember everyone
who died in all our wars,'' she said.
	   The Great War was supposed to be quick, and a ``war to end all
wars,'' but of course it wasn't. It was a four-year nightmare of
unimaginable brutality, one that killed millions and changed Europe
forever.
	   Precious few are still alive who fought in World War I. And yet
fascination with the conflict remains, evident in the countless
grainy, black-and-white photos gracing newspaper and magazine
covers in France and Britain as the anniversary approached.
	   After lunch with Chirac, the queen was to unveil a statue of Sir
Winston Churchill, on an avenue renamed the Avenue Winston
Churchill.
	   And later in the day, she was to travel to Ypres in Belgium,
where she was joining King Albert II in remembering the appalling
losses from a four-year war of attrition against the Germans in the
trenches there.
	   There was one major figure missing from the ceremonies:
Germany's new leader, chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, who
informed Chirac he could not attend because his calendar was
already full with creating a new government.
	   Schroeder dismissed as ``rubbish'' reports that he wasn't
attending because he wanted to avoid the past.
	   The war killed 13 million civilians and 8.5 million fighting
men. Germany lost an estimated 1.7 million soldiers; Britain lost
more than 900,000; Italy 650,000; the United States 116,000. France
was proportionally the hardest hit, with 1.3 million dead.
	   The sheer devastation wrought on France can partly be measured
by the 30,000 or so monuments in cities, towns and villages across
the nation. Some villages list more war dead than their current
populations.
	   As if there were any doubt about the enduring wound left by the
war, a bitter dispute broke out between the political right and
left just days before the anniversary.
	   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, visiting the site of a
suicidal offensive against the Germans at Chemin des Dames, asked
that 49 mutineers executed ``as an example'' be ``fully
reintegrated today into our national collective memory.''
	   Chirac, a rightist, called Jospin's remarks ``inopportune.'' And
a political ally of the president's, former Interior Minister
Jean-Louis Debre, said Jospin's remarks were ``of a nature to
justify acts of mutiny in the future.''

Ultra-Orthodox claim elections victory in Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from legislator, corrects attribution in

Shetreet, the unsuccessful mayoral candidate in Jerusalem &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a show of their growing strength, religious
parties won nearly half the seats in Jerusalem's city council and
will have a major say over the disputed city's future.
	   Throughout Israel, candidates representing special interests,
including immigrants from the former Soviet Union, made a strong
showing in municipal elections at the expense of the veteran Labor
and Likud parties, according to preliminary results Wednesday.
	   Jerusalem's secular mayor, Ehud Olmert, was re-elected by a
comfortable majority, but his slate for city council won only two
of 31 seats, sharply undercutting his influence on crucial issues,
such as the budget. Two ultra-Orthodox Parties, Shas and Agudat
Israel, won five and seven seats respectively, and the National
Religious Party, had three seats, for a total of 15.
	   Olmert blamed secular voters whose turnout fell far below that
of religious residents of Jerusalem.
	   ``The secular public that complained so much and was so afraid
of the ultra-Orthodox, decided at the decisive moment to stay home
and not participate in the elections,'' Olmert told Israel radio.
	   In many ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods, voters were taken to
polling stations by buses organized by candidates for religious
parties. Ultra-Orthodox Jews make up about one-third of Jerusalem's
population of 600,000.
	   Yossi Sarid, a parliament member from the liberal Meretz Party,
predicted a secular exodus from Jerusalem. ``A large part of the
secular public will leave Jerusalem,'' he said.
	   Most of the city's 180,000 Palestinian residents stayed away
from the polls at the urging of the Palestinian Authority. The
Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, the sector captured by Israel in
the 1967 Mideast war, as a future capital, and say voting would be
tantamount to accepting Israeli rule in all of the city.
	   Among Jerusalem's Jewish residents, there is a deep divide
between the secular and the religious. The two camps have squared
off in the past, sometimes violently, over issues like budgets for
religious institutions and closing roads on the Jewish Sabbath.
	   After the 1993 municipal elections, in which a strong showing by
religious parties ended popular mayor Teddy Kollek's 28-year
tenure, secular Jerusalem residents seem resigned to the growing
power of the ultra-Orthodox in city politics.
	   ``I'm disappointed,'' said Rami Cohen, a 29-year-old grocery
store clerk. ``They just want more money for their schools, and
there's only one cash register in this city.''
	   ``I knew it would happen,'' said Naava Droma, 21, as she waited
for a bus at Jerusalem's central station. ``There's nothing you can
do,'' she said.
	   Her friends joked about escaping on the first bus to Tel Aviv.
	   Fewer than 50 percent of more than 3 million eligible voters
turned out nationwide Tuesday, prompting Meir Shetreet, the
chairman of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition in
parliament, to suggest that no-shows be fined.
	   Ultra-Orthodox parties, on the other hand, helped ensure a good
turn-out by promising blessings and a place in heaven to those who
voted for the right candidates.
	   Eli Barshesky, a 45-year-old educator in Jerusalem, said he
voted for Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party popular among Sephardi Jews
from North African and Middle Eastern countries.
	   ``It's good,'' he said of the elections results. ``The city will
be more considerate of the ultra-Orthodox, give them more money for
schools, ritual baths, and synagogues.''
	   The election results reflected the increasing fragmentation of
Israeli society along ethnic and religious lines, with major
parties losing out to smaller special interest parties or to
candidates running on independent lists.
	   Israel B'Aliya, the party representing Russian immigrants,
fielded candidates in local elections for the first time, and won
dozens of the 2,800 seats up for a vote nationwide. One-issue
parties, such as Dor Shalom, a group of peace activists, and the
Greens, won seats on the Haifa and Tel Aviv city councils.
	   In Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial center and second-largest city,
high school principal Ron Huldai, an independent with Labor
backing, was elected mayor. The popular incumbent, Roni Milo, did
not seek re-election because he plans to challenge Netanyahu in the
next general elections.
	   The elections were marked by violent incidents at the polling
stations nationwide, with 424 disturbances reported, 13 arrests,
and 24 injuries, police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said.

German chancellor should organize Nazi-era slave laborer fund
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The leader of Germany's Jewish
community has appealed to Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to
personally administer a promised new government foundation to
compensate Nazi-era slave laborers, and not give industry the power
to set levels.
	   Ignatz Bubis urged Schroeder during a television interview
Tuesday night to take the lead and ``tell industry what is what.''
He also said the new government should make a symbolic gesture by
contributing ``the first penny'' to the fund.
	   Schroeder's government has pledged to set up a fund with
industry to pay former slave laborers back wages, something the
previous government refused to do. However, Schroeder has not
specified whether the fund would include government money or only
industry funds.
	   The foundation _ and another to compensate the Nazi's
``forgotten victims,'' are to be headed by Schroeder's chief of
staff, Bodo Homboch.
	   Industry, under pressure from lawsuits filed in the United
States, appealed to Schroeder to help resolve the issue and protect
them from continued lawsuits. Among those to participate are the
heads of Allianz insurance company, Dresdner and Deutsche banks,
Volkswagen, BMW, Siemens, Krupp, Degussa and BASF.
	   The lawyers who have filed the suits have said they will fight
any attempt to use the funds to settle the claims on behalf of
surviving slave laborers.

Mighty Casey strikes out in Q-school
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A year that began with a federal lawsuit and
nationwide debate about carts and rights ended with barely a
mention for Casey Martin.
	   Martin, the first player to use a cart in a PGA Tour event and
the U.S. Open, returned home to Oregon last week after failing to
advance to the final stage of qualifying school.
	   Martin had rounds of 75-76-75-71 for a 297 on the Black Horse
courses in Seaside, California, finishing three strokes behind the
cutoff in the second stage of Q-school.
	   ``I'm more discouraged than I thought I would be,'' Martin told
CBS SportsLine. ``I'm as low as I've been in a while as far as golf
is concerned. I take heart in knowing it can come back as quick as
it leaves.''
	   Martin is still eligible for the Nike Tour because he won the
Lakeland Classic. He also can play PGA Tour events with sponsors'
exemptions, which shouldn't be short in supply.
	   But that's not what Martin had in mind, especially after winning
in Lakeland, Florida, and then winning the real battle _ the
lawsuit against the PGA Tour for the right to use a cart. Martin
has a rare circulatory disease in his right leg.
	   He became the first player to use a cart in the U.S. Open, where
he tied for 23rd, and on the PGA Tour, where he missed the cut in
Hartford, Connecticut. But he went into a tailspin at the end of
the year.
	   First, he slipped out of the top 15 on the Nike Tour money list,
missing a chance to earn his PGA Tour card without going to
Q-school. Then he slipped out of the top 25, losing a chance to go
straight to the final stage of qualifying.
	   Martin, however, says he's not finished with golf.
	   ``The main thing is I'm going to take a little time off to
recharge my batteries,'' he said. ``I just want to relax and bring
some normalcy back to my life.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; MONTY'S ITINERARY: Colin Montgomerie might not join the PGA
Tour, but he expects to be in the United States more often next
year _ especially with the World Golf Championship series starting.
	   The Scotsman, who won his record sixth consecutive money title
on the European tour last week, has talked the past few years about
taking on a new challenge by playing the PGA Tour.
	   ``With the world championship events coming up and with the
traveling so tiring, I think I will stay over there and play
more,'' he said last week after receiving his Member of the British
Empire from Queen Elizabeth. ``It has happened on its own that I
will play more in America next year, which I'm looking forward
to.''
	   Montgomerie has never won in the United States.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WEISKOPF RETURNS?: Tom Weiskopf might return to the Senior Tour
next year.
	   ``I'd say there's a good possibility that I will play about
eight to 12 tournaments,'' Weiskopf wrote in his column for
GolfWeb. ``I don't have any great challenges from the standpoint of
a goal. I might just give it a try and see where it goes.''
	   Weiskopf said he lost ``quite a bit'' of his left forearm to
cancer surgery earlier this year; he had a malignant melanoma
removed and couldn't feel his last two fingers. He also says he
hasn't even practiced since winning the Senior Open in 1995, which
didn't stop him from winning two tour events the next year.
	   If Weiskopf does return, it sounds as if the Senior Open is the
only tournament that will get his attention.
	   ``Fast greens, rough, there's a cut, they play 72 holes and
everybody walks,'' Weiskopf wrote about the Open. ``It's a golf
tournament.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HANDICAPPING THE HALL: While Greg Norman came up short in his
bid to be voted into the Hall of Fame on the PGA Tour ballot, his
65.8 percent was up slightly from the 62.9 percent of the vote he
received in 1997.
	   That wasn't the case for some others.
	   Ben Crenshaw and Tom Kite received a much smaller percentage
this year _ Crenshaw dropped from 57 percent to 49.4 percent, while
Kite fell from 54.3 to 44.9. Neither came close to winning this
year.
	   Of the top 10 on the ballot, only four players got more votes
than the previous year _ Lloyd Mangrum, elected with exactly 75
percent of the vote; Norman; Nick Price (32.4) and Mark O'Meara
(23.4). O'Meara got only 4.7 percent last year, his first on the
ballot. Funny how winning two majors can make a difference.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; STAT OF THE WEEK: Hale Irwin finished in the top five in 20 of
22 Senior Tour events this year. During his 26-year career on the
PGA Tour, he never had more than 18 finishes in the top 25 in any
one season.

Ukrainian miner killed in accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian miner has died from injuries at
a mine in eastern Ukraine, bringing to 330 the number of coal
industry workers who have died on the job this year, officials said
Wednesday.
	   The accident occurred Tuesday after a safety rules violation at
a mine in the Dnipropetrovsk region, about 500 kilometers (310
miles) southeast of the capital Kiev, the Emergency Situations
Ministry said.
	   No further details were provided.
	   A total of 1,384 workers have died in job accidents in Ukraine
since the beginning of 1998, according to the Labor Ministry.
	   Of these, the largely state-owned coal industry has accounted
for 330 deaths compared to 290 last year.
	   Despite frequent miners' strikes, the cash-strapped government
has not modernized the deteriorating coal mines or improved safety
conditions.

Cabinet convenes to ratify peace agreement with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with meeting started, legislators saying
parliament vote not possible before Monday &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After two weeks of repeated delays and bitter
disputes with the Palestinians over security issues, Israel's
Cabinet convened Wednesday to ratify the Wye peace accord.
	   However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attached several
stipulations to the land-for-security agreement that could cause
new disruptions and threaten implementation in the future.
	   If a slim majority of the 17 ministers approves the accord, as
is expected, by Wednesday evening, parliament could vote on it
Monday, and Israel might still be able to meet a key commitment, an
initial troop pullback Monday from 2 percent of the West Bank.
	   Wednesday's meeting began at 1:40 p.m. (1140 gmt), with a delay
of nearly an hour.
	   The Cabinet discussed the accord for one day last week, but
Netanyahu called off a second session last Friday when Islamic
militants carried out a suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market.
	   For several days, it was unclear if and when the ministers would
reconvene, and in the meantime implementation was placed on hold.
	   On Tuesday evening, Netanyahu announced that the Cabinet would
meet Wednesday to conclude its debate and vote on the accord. It
was not clear whether Netanyahu made the announcement before or
after he received a phone call from U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   U.S. officials said the two leaders discussed the ratification
process and the U.S.-Iraqi showdown over weapons inspection.
	   An Israeli official said the United States let it be known that
its policy of being tough on Iraq was encountering problems in the
Arab world because Israel had not moved forward on its
implementation of the Wye agreement.
	   The Haaretz daily said there was unconfirmed speculation that
Clinton told Netanyahu the Cabinet's failure to ratify the
agreement has made it difficult for the United States to win
support from Arab states against Iraq.
	   Late Tuesday, the Cabinet meeting was once more in doubt when
Palestinian militants ambushed an Israeli military truck in the
West Bank, injuring two soldiers, including one who was seriously
wounded. However, Netanyahu in the end decided to move ahead.
	   The United States has urged Israel to stick to the original time
table of the agreement, despite the repeated delays.
	   Under the accord, Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West
Bank over 12 weeks, in exchange for a Palestinian campaign against
Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu reportedly intends to attach four new stipulations to
the accord that seem to be aimed mainly at winning the support of
hardline Cabinet ministers. At least four ministers plan to oppose
the agreement, with only nine in favor and four abstentions.
	   A key Israeli demand concerns the procedure for revoking clauses
of the PLO founding charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   The Wye agreement says that the Palestine National Council and
other Palestinian organizations will convene in mid-December to
``reaffirm'' a January letter by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to Clinton that lists the clauses considered annulled.
	   Israel insists that the Palestinian delegates hold a vote and
Netanyahu said in a statement Tuesday that the agreement would only
be carried out if the Palestinians comply. Palestinian officials
have said only approval by acclamation was required.
	   The Maariv daily said the dispute has been resolved quietly by
the United States. Under the compromise, the delegates will vote by
a show of hands, but not all members of the PNC, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, will have to be present and there will be no
need for a two-thirds majority, Maariv said.
	   The Cabinet will also insist that in an additional troop
pullback, Israel will hand over only 1 percent of the West Bank and
that the Palestinians refrain from a unilateral declaration of
statehood in May, at the end of the five-year autonomy period.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said he hoped the Cabinet
would ratify the accord on Wednesday.
	   He said Israel was already behind schedule on several issues,
including the opening of the Palestinian airport in the Gaza Strip,
and establishing a land route for Palestinians between the West
Bank and Gaza.
	   Asked about the stipulation on the PLO charter, Erekat said: ``I
hope he will refrain from the use of threats and conditions.''
	   Erekat was evasive when asked whether the Palestinians would
agree to hold a vote on the charter, saying only that they would
meet all their obligations under the accord.

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A military Mi-24 helicopter
crashed in north Moravia Tuesday, killing all four on board, the
defense ministry said Wednesday.
	   Spokesman Miroslav Sindelar said the helicopter crashed Tuesday
shortly after 5 p.m. (1600 GMT) in a forest near Olomouc, 300
kilometers (187 miles) east of Prague. No one of its four-member
crew survived the accident.
	   Rescuers were searching the debris overnight for the bodies of
the crew. The last body was found Wednesday morning, Sindelar said.
	   A member of the investigation group that was inspecting the site
of the crash was injured Wednesday morning when some fuel exploded
in the debris, the news agency CTK said. The soldier was
hospitalized with serious burns to his face, it added.
	   All flights of the Mi-24 helicopters were suspended by the Czech
military following the crash.
	   Sindelar said that the causes of the crash are still unclear but
did not rule out technical failure. The helicopter was completely
destroyed in the crash.

Diamondbacks acquire Powell for Embree; Johnson tours park
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BOB BAUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ The Arizona Diamondbacks picked up young center
fielder Dante Powell from the San Francisco Giants and are courting
a much more coveted player at the same position, Bernie Williams.
	   The Diamondbacks traded left-handed reliever Alan Embree to the
Giants on Tuesday for the 25-year-old Powell.
	   The trade came the same day that the Diamondbacks showed free
agent pitcher Randy Johnson around Bank One Ballpark.
	   The high-priced parade was to resume Wednesday with the arrival
of Williams on his tour of teams interested in luring him from the
World Series champion New York Yankees.
	   Johnson downplayed the significance of his visit after he toured
the facilities with Diamondbacks owner Jerry Colangelo and manager
Buck Showalter.
	   ``It was just a nice visit, very cordial, very businesslike,''
Johnson said. ``They just wanted to show me the facilities. It's
nothing more than what other teams are doing.''
	   Colangelo said Johnson is concerned about how quickly Arizona
can become a contender.
	   ``As Buck and I pointed out,'' Colangelo said, ``he can help us
get there sooner.''
	   Powell, the Giants' top pick in the 1995 amateur draft and the
22nd choice overall, was 4-for-8 with a home run in eight games
with San Francisco last season. He hit .230 with 14 home runs, 52
RBIs and 41 stolen bases with Triple-A Fresno before being called
up in September.
	   Powell helps fill the void left by the departure of Devon White,
who became a free agent and signed a dlrs 12.4 million, three-year
contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday.
	   Embree, 28, came to the Diamondbacks on June 23 in a trade with
Atlanta. With Arizona, he was 3-2 with a 4.11 earned run average.
	   The Giants wanted relief pitching help, and the Diamondbacks
sorely needed speed on the bases. Powell was voted the fastest base
runner in the Pacific Coast League by PCL managers.

Kabila wants U.N. to investigate massacres, ambassador says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN DAVIES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Congo's president, despite past refusals
to cooperate, has invited a new U.N. team to investigate massacres
he blamed on Tutsi rebels who put him in power last year and now
want to oust him.
	   President Laurent Kabila ``has asked the United Nations to send
a team to investigate,'' Gabriel Kyungu Wa-Ku-Mwanza, newly
appointed Congolese ambassador to Kenya, said at a news conference
Wednesday.
	   There was no immediate comment from U.N. officials.
	   Since June 1997, Congolese authorities have thwarted U.N.
attempts to investigate allegations that Kabila's Tutsi-led rebels
massacred thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees, who were in U.N.
camps in eastern Congo when the rebellion broke out in late 1996.
	   The United Nations withdrew its investigators from Congo in
April, citing a total lack of cooperation from the government,
which harassed and intimidated witnesses who spoke with the
experts.
	   Wa-Ku-Mwanza said one man was to blame for the roadblocks:
Bizima Karaha, a Tutsi who was Kabila's foreign minister until he
defected to the Rwandan- and Ugandan-backed rebels who have been
trying to topple Kabila since Aug. 2.
	   ``The first mission didn't succeed because of Bizima Karaha,''
Wa-Ku-Mwanza said.
	   He did not explain how a Cabinet minister could usurp the
president, if he did wanted the investigation to go ahead, nor how
Karaha forced Kabila to repeatedly and publicly insult the U.N.
investigators.
	   A U.N. report released Oct. 29 accused the Congolese government
of new human rights violations, which merited investigation.
	   It said the government adopted a strategy of ethnic cleansing in
trying to quash the new insurgency by rebel forces composed of
ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's army and opposition
politicians.
	   Particularly serious was the government's incitement to hatred
of Tutsis, who were called ``viruses, mosquitoes, garbage'' that
should be eliminated.
	   Wa-Ku-Mwanza denied any discrimination in Congo, saying more
than 450 tribes live in Africa's third largest country, and
``however minor they are, have never been persecuted.''
	   ``The one and only case of genocide that we deeply regret is the
Mbandaka massacres which were perpetrated by the Tutsi soldiers
from Rwanda,'' who were sent to support Kabila's rebellion in
1996-97, Wa-Ku-Mwanza said.
	   ``The Tutsi soldiers are the ones who killed the Hutu
refugees,'' he said.
	   Kabila's Tutsi-backed rebellion forces have been accused of
targeting Rwandan Hutus to avenge the genocide of more than 500,000
Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994.
	   There have been persistent reports that Kabila's forces killed
Rwandan refugees in sites stretching from Uvira, an eastern border
town where the rebellion began in September 1996, to Mbandaka,
1,250 kilometers (780 miles) to the west.
	   Some U.N. officials have asserted that up to 200,000 people were
massacred, but those who worked with refugees in Congo itself put
the figure much lower, in the 10s of thousands.

Russian lawmakers fail in bid to lift sanctions against Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist party
launched a motion Wednesday that called for lifting sanctions
against Iraq, but it failed to win approval.
	   A total of 156 lawmakers voted for lifting the sanctions, and
only 36 voted against, but the motion was well short of the 226
votes needed for a simple majority in parliament's lower house, the
State Duma.
	   Even if it had passed, the motion would have been non-binding,
because parliament has little say over foreign policy, which is
crafted almost entirely by President Boris Yeltsin's government.
	   Zhirinovsky has visited Iraq on several occasions and expressed
his support for Iraq leader Saddam Hussein.
	   The Russian government has called for the early lifting of
international sanctions against Iraq, but has not moved to act
unilaterally. The sanctions were imposed against Iraq following its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraq owes Moscow billions of dollars from Soviet times, when the
Arab nation was a big arms buyer.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Wednesday reiterated
Moscow's opposition to any possible strikes against Iraq because of
its refusal to cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has complied with U.N.
resolutions calling for the dismantling of the country's weapons of
mass destruction before the sanctions can be lifted.
	   Baghdad accuses the U.N. Special Commission of working on behalf
of the United States to prolong the sanctions.
	   Ivanov, speaking after a meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister
Lloyd Axworthy, said strikes against Iraq ``would cancel the
immense work done by the international community over the past
seven years and complicate the situation in the region.''
	   At the same time, Ivanov urged Iraq to ``fully resume''
cooperation with the U.N. weapons experts.

Cuba to meet China in women's world volleyball final

	   OSAKA, Japan (AP) _ China upset Russia and defending champion
Cuba downed Brazil Wednesday, advancing to the final of the Women's
World Volleyball Championships.
	   China, which had barely reached the semifinals with an
unimpressive 3-2 record in the competition's second round, won
15-4, 15-4, 15-9 against Russia, successor to the Soviet teams that
had won six world titles since 1949.
	   The Russians' best effort came as they trailed 13-2 in the final
set. But the rally netted only seven points, and the match was all
over in 67 minutes.
	   Russia had come into the tournament ranked No. 1 by volleyball's
international governing body, FIVB, followed by Cuba, China,
Brazil, South Korea and Japan among 53 member countries.
	   Cuba advanced to Thursday's final by beating its 1994 world
championship runner-up Brazil 15-10, 4-15, 15-11, 15-10.
	   China built an early 7-3 lead and never had serious trouble,
displaying tight blocks and defenses spearheaded by Li Yan, Lai
Yawen and Wu Yongmei, and also staging effective attacks by Qiu
Aihua, Sun Yue and Wu Yongmei.
	   The 182-centimeter (6-foot) Qiu often found space between the
taller Russian blockers as she scored eight points and won 16
side-outs in 59 attempts.
	   Li was the star retriever.
	   For Russia, Japan-based Evguenia Artamonova led scoring with
four points and 14 side-outs in 55 tries.
	   ``All the (Russian) players are young and lost their
concentration and confidence,'' said Russian coach Nikolai Karpol.
	   Chinese coach Lang Ping said: ``We have no superstars, so we
united ourselves and played as one unit. Russia and China are on
the same level, but psychologically we were at ease. Tomorrow?
We'll do our best.''
	   The Cubans, also the 1996 Olympic champions, jumped well and
smacked the ball hard and accurately.
	   Brazil found it difficult to cope with the power of Cuban
players like Regla Torres Herrera and Regla Bell McKenzie, except
in the second set, when the 1996 Olympic bronze medalist rallied
with a good combination of blocking and attacks. Leila Barros
served three consecutive aces.
	   ``It was a tough game,'' said Brazilian player Karin Vebturini.
``We had difficulty in gaining points. Blocking was not good. We
did not play well defensively and our spikes were not effective.''
	   Cuban head coach Antonio Perdomo said, ``We know Brazil very
well, so we were well prepared. We are extremely happy with this
success, and we are looking forward to play the final against China
tomorrow.''
	   In the consolation round to decide fifth through eighth places,
Italy outclassed the Netherlands 15-7, 15-4, 16-14, and Croatia
beat host Japan 15-13, 15-3, 15-9.
	   Italy meets Croatia for fifth place and Japan takes on the
Netherlands for seventh on Thursday.

Cabinet convenes to ratify peace agreement with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with meeting started, legislators saying
parliament vote not possible before Monday &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After two weeks of repeated delays and bitter
disputes with the Palestinians over security issues, Israel's
Cabinet convened Wednesday to ratify the Wye peace accord.
	   However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attached several
stipulations to the land-for-security agreement that could cause
new disruptions and threaten implementation in the future.
	   If a slim majority of the 17 ministers approves the accord, as
is expected, by Wednesday evening, parliament could vote on it
Monday. Israel might still be able to meet a key commitment of the
accord, an initial troop pullback Monday from 2 percent of the West
Bank.
	   Wednesday's Cabinet meeting began at 1:40 p.m. (1140 GMT), with
a delay of nearly an hour.
	   The Cabinet discussed the accord for one day last week, but
Netanyahu called off a second session last Friday when Islamic
militants carried out a suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market,
injuring 21 people.
	   For several days, it was unclear if and when the ministers would
reconvene, and in the meantime implementation was placed on hold.
	   Late Tuesday, the Cabinet meeting was once more in doubt when
Palestinian militants ambushed an Israeli military truck in the
West Bank, injuring two soldiers, including one who was seriously
wounded. However, Netanyahu in the end decided to move ahead.
	   On Tuesday evening, Netanyahu announced that the Cabinet would
meet Wednesday to conclude its debate and vote on the accord. It
was not clear whether Netanyahu made the announcement before or
after he received a phone call from U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   U.S. officials said the two leaders discussed the ratification
process and the U.S.-Iraqi showdown over weapons inspection.
	   An Israeli official said the United States let it be known that
its policy of being tough on Iraq was encountering problems in the
Arab world because Israel had not moved forward on its
implementation of the agreement reached last month at a summit at
the Wye Plantation in Maryland.
	   The Haaretz daily said there was unconfirmed speculation that
Clinton told Netanyahu the Cabinet's failure to ratify the
agreement has made it difficult for the United States to win
support from Arab states against Iraq.
	   Late Tuesday, the Cabinet meeting was once more in doubt when
Palestinian militants ambushed an Israeli military truck in the
West Bank, injuring two soldiers, including one who was seriously
wounded. However, Netanyahu in the end decided to move ahead.
	   The United States has urged Israel to stick to the original
timetable of the agreement, despite the repeated delays.
	   Under the accord, Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West
Bank over 12 weeks, in exchange for a Palestinian campaign against
Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu reportedly intends to attach four new stipulations to
the accord that seem to be aimed mainly at winning the support of
hardline Cabinet ministers. At least four ministers plan to oppose
the agreement, with only nine in favor and four abstentions.
	   A key Israeli demand concerns the procedure for revoking clauses
of the PLO founding charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   The Wye agreement says that the Palestine National Council and
other Palestinian organizations will convene in mid-December to
``reaffirm'' a January letter by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to Clinton that lists the clauses considered annulled.
	   Israel insists that the Palestinian delegates hold a vote and
Netanyahu said in a statement Tuesday that the agreement would only
be carried out if the Palestinians comply. Palestinian officials
have said only approval by acclamation was required.
	   The Maariv daily said the dispute has been resolved quietly by
the United States. Under the compromise, the delegates will vote by
a show of hands, but not all members of the PNC, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, will have to be present and there will be no
need for a two-thirds majority, Maariv said.
	   The Cabinet will also insist that in an additional troop
pullback, Israel will hand over only 1 percent of the West Bank and
that the Palestinians refrain from a unilateral declaration of
statehood in May, at the end of the five-year autonomy period.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said he hoped the Cabinet
would ratify the accord on Wednesday.
	   He said Israel was already behind schedule on several issues,
including the opening of the Palestinian airport in the Gaza Strip,
and establishing a land route for Palestinians between the West
Bank and Gaza.
	   Asked about the stipulation on the PLO charter, Erekat said: ``I
hope he will refrain from the use of threats and conditions.''
	   Erekat was evasive when asked whether the Palestinians would
agree to hold a vote on the charter, saying only that they would
meet all their obligations under the accord.

Pinochet lawyers warn British court against judging his record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with morning testimony; ADDS byline; trims pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet argued Wednesday
that putting the former Chilean dictator on trial in a foreign
court would be unprecedented and invite retaliation from Chile.
	   The only previous attempt to try a former head of government in
a foreign court failed when Argentine judges said they had no
jurisdiction to put Margaret Thatcher on trial for murder, the
lawyers said.
	   An Argentine official had sought to try the former British prime
minister in the deaths of some 600 sailors drowned when a British
submarine sank the Argentine cruiser Belgrano in the 1982 Falkland
Islands war.
	   ``Your act in denying immunity ... would engage a breach of
international law and would expose the United Kingdom to suit by
Chile,'' Clare Montgomery, a lawyer for Pinochet, told judges in
the House of Lords, Britain's highest court.
	   Pinochet, 82, was arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a
Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite him to face charges of
genocide, murder and kidnapping. He is recuperating from back
surgery and remains in hospital under police guard.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of secret police during Pinochet's
17-year-old rule after he ousted Salvador Allende, an elected
Marxist, in a 1973 military coup.
	   The House of Lords is hearing arguments on an appeal by Spanish
and British prosecutors of an Oct. 28 High Court decision quashing
Pinochet's arrest on grounds that, as a former foreign head of
state, he has immunity from prosecution in this country.
	   In addition to pressing for immunity, Ms. Montgomery noted
Wednesday that torture did not become an offense in Britain until
1988, when the country adopted the U.N. Convention on Torture.
	   She said all the alleged victims of Pinochet's regime were
tortured before Britain adopted the act except for one _ a
17-year-old girl who died of electric shock treatment after being
picked up by military police in 1989.
	   The senior of the five judges, Lord Gordon Flynn, interjected
that the court had only to decide whether Pinochet has immunity.
	   ``We are not here to decide whether these quite appalling crimes
_ whether committed _ should be tried by somebody sometime,'' he
said.
	   The appeal hearing was scheduled to continue through Wednesday
and perhaps part of Thursday, with judgment likely next week, court
officials said.
	   On Tuesday, Ms. Montgomery told the judges that upholding
Pinochet's arrest would upset British-Chile relations, as well as
endanger democracy developed in Chile since Pinochet stepped down
in 1990.
	   Lawyers for the prosecutors say Pinochet is responsible for
deeds beyond immunity.

Santer urges Clinton to restore peace in banana war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union Commission said
Wednesday its leader has asked U.S. President Bill Clinton not to
implement trade sanctions against the European Union to counter the
EU's banana import regime.
	   In a letter addressed to Clinton late Tuesday, the president of
the EU's executive body, Jacques Santer warned the U.S leader that
the sanctions would be a clear breach of the United States' World
Trade Organization commitments.
	   ``No WTO member has the right unilaterally to determine whether
another member is in compliance with WTO rules,'' a Commission
statement quoted Santer as saying.
	   Late Tuesday the United States released a five-page list of EU
exports it plans to slap with extra duties. The list covers a wide
range of products from toys and vacuum-cleaners to French wines,
Nigel Gardner, spokesman for the EU's Trade Commissioner Sir Leon
Brittan said.
	   Sanctions on these EU exports would affect 1.3 billion ecu's
(dlrs 1.6 billion) worth of EU trade in terms of 1997 EU trade
figures, Gardner said.
	   ``We cannot walk around with this gun of unilateralism pointed
at our head,'' Gardner said, adding that the EU will take ``rapid
WTO action'' unless the United States step down from its position.
	   Over the weekend, the United States warned of punitive action if
the 15-nation EU does not change its banana trade system, which
Washington claims unfairly favors imports from former European
colonies.
	   The United States says the EU has not done enough to fall in
line with a WTO verdict last year which ruled against the EU's
favorable treatment of a number of African, Caribbean, and Pacific
region countries.
	   The EU argues it approved new import regulations to comply with
WTO demands, but the United States and Central and South American
banana producers claim its banana import regime is still
discriminatory.

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A convoy of U.N. arms inspectors rolled out
of Baghdad Wednesday in a major pullout of U.N. staff that comes
amid preparations for a U.S. military strike against Iraq. Eleven
buses and other vehicles carrying more than 100 U.N. workers and
their luggage left the U.N. Special Commission's headquarters in
Baghdad. Many of those leaving hugged the U.N. workers, including
Iraqi employees, who were staying behind. Other U.N. workers were
putting screens over the office windows _ a move apparently aimed
at preventing them from shattering glass into the building in the
event of a U.S. military strike. The United States and Britain have
warned that military force may be used to try to force Baghdad to
back down from its decision to freeze all cooperation with the U.N.
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, which is responsible for eliminating
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. (IRAQ-UN)
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Governments and lending
institutions around the world moved to help Central America pick up
the pieces since Mitch killed an estimated 10,000 people last
month. France canceled debts owed by Nicaragua and Honduras, while
Ireland announced it was doubling aid to the countries ravaged by
the storm. Britain said it hoped to contribute to a trust fund for
the region and added its support to calls for a moratorium on debt
payments by all affected countries. Cuba announced it was canceling
Nicaraguan debts of dlrs 50 million, nearly all of which apparently
was borrowed by Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government in the
1980s. And the World Bank announced it was making dlrs 200 million
available from existing projects to assist the nations damaged by
Mitch. The wife of U.S. vice president Al Gore delivered an aid
shipment that included blankets, sheets and drinking water for
residents. (MITCH)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite a late night shooting attack by
Palestinian militants on Israeli soldiers, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu decided not to call off a Cabinet meeting Wednesday in
which the ministers are expected to ratify the Wye peace agreement.
Two soldiers were wounded, one of them seriously, in the roadside
ambush near a Jewish settlement in the West Bank. Last week,
Netanyahu broke off a Cabinet debate on the land-for-security
agreement with the Palestinians because of a suicide bombing by
Islamic militants in a Jerusalem market that wounded 21 people.
However, Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said Wednesday's Cabinet
session would proceed as scheduled. The ministers were to convene
in the afternoon, after Netanyahu consults with Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Police detained 250 protesters as a
violent and costly antigovernment general strike shut down
businesses across Bangladesh for a third day Wednesday, officials
said. The arrests were made Tuesday and Wednesday in Dhaka,
Bangladesh's capital, and the southern city of Chittagong. The
strike was called by seven opposition parties to protest what they
called a police attempt to kill their leader, former Prime Minister
Khaleda Zia, at a Saturday rally in Dhaka. The death toll from the
three-day strike rose to four as a 17-year-old boy died Wednesday
from bullet wounds he suffered during clashes with opponents of the
strike two days ago, doctors said. Nearly 500 people have been
injured in clashes between supporters and opponents of the strike
in Dhaka, Chittagong and the northern town of Mymensingh.
(BANGLADESH-STRIKE)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Soldiers fired warning shots and beat
students with sticks Wednesday when they blocked protesters from
marching toward Parliament, where a special assembly discussed how
to reform Indonesia's authoritarian political structure. Witnesses
said the violence broke out when a car driven by students rammed
into a group of riot officers on a main thoroughfare near a group
of luxury hotels in downtown Jakarta, injuring four soldiers. Two
students and a photographer were hurt when angry troops lashed out
with rattan canes. Police and soldiers blocked separate protest
marches near the meeting of the People's Consultative Assembly, the
nation's highest legislative body. The assembly is meeting until
Friday to map out a new system of government after decades of
military-backed rule under ex-President Suharto.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mostly higher
Wednesday as bargain hunting and a technical rebound reversed this
week's losses. Tokyo stocks rose on expectations that most of the
debt-laden banks will apply for public funds under a scheme to
strengthen their capital base, as well as on growing optimism about
tax cuts expected to be included in the government's upcoming
economic stimulus package. The Nikkei average rose 319.93 points,
or 2.3 percent, to 14,428.02. Share prices in Hong Kong closed
sharply higher, mainly on a technical rebound after four days of
losses. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended up 415.99 points, or
4.3 percent, at an intraday high of 10,137.32. Singapore shares
also surged, closing up 64.76 points, or 5.5 percent, at 1,236.82.
The dollar was trading at 121.12 yen in late afternoon, down 1.20
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo in a round of profit-taking, traders
said. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's prime minister faced intense
pressure Wednesday to step down after allegations that he
interfered in a privatization contract and helped a businessman
linked to a mobster secure loans. A leader of the center-left
Republican party whose backing in parliament helps Mesut Yilmaz's
minority government, said he would withdraw his support unless the
premier resigned immediately. Two opposition parties threatened to
press for a motion to censure the government. A businessman alleged
that Yilmaz and Gunes Taner, the economy minister, encouraged him
to buy the state-run bank Turkbank, offering him loans from other
state banks to ensure that his offer was the highest bid. Yigit
bought the bank at a public auction in August for dlrs 600 million.
The government suspended the privatization last month after a
lawmaker released an audio tape of a conversation supposedly
between Yigit and a mobster. (TURKEY-SCANDAL)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Poor Pakistan, scrambling to raise
funds to pay off its huge debt, resumed stalled talks Wednesday
with the International Monetary Fund, an IMF official said.
Pakistan is seeking a bailout package worth dlrs 5 billion from
global donor agencies to avoid a default on the repayment of a
whopping dlrs 32 billion debt. Pakistan is optimistic of a
breakthrough following a decision last week by U.S. President Bill
Clinton to waive some sanctions, imposed after last May's
underground nuclear tests, as well as his offer of one-time support
to Pakistan for this bail out package. Without it Pakistan will be
forced to default on its debt, its imports would dry up and the
country would be ruined economically. The IMF package is said to
include dlrs 2 billion of debt rescheduling and dlrs 3 billion in
loans. (PAKISTAN-IMF-ECONOMY)
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A politically influential banker who
fled Mexico after being accused in an Australian dollars 1.1
billion (U.S. dlrs 700 million) bank fraud has been captured in
Australia, authorities said Wednesday. Carlos Cabal Peniche, 45,
who is accused in financial and political scandals that have shaken
Mexico, was arrested by Australian Federal Police officers
Wednesday morning at a house in the seaside suburb of Brighton. In
a brief hearing, Cabal Peniche made no application for bail, but
reserved his right to challenge the validity of the extradition
warrant at a future hearing. The Mexican attorney general's
department, calling him ``Mexico's most-wanted fugitive,'' said
Cabal Peniche was carrying a passport from the Dominican Republic
in a false name. (MEXICO-FUGITIVE BANKER)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The anticipated showdown between
Japan and the United States at next week's Pacific Rim summit
appears already under way, with Washington accusing Tokyo of
offering money to other Asian nations to weaken a proposed
free-trade pact. Japan will donate dlrs 204 million to Asian
nations to help develop their fishing and forestry industries, a
major Japanese newspaper reported Wednesday. The aid, promised for
the next five years, will be announced at a meeting Saturday of
representatives in the Malaysia capital ahead of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit next Tuesday and Wednesday, the Asahi
said. The United States, Australia and Canada will be pushing the
21-member trade forum to agree to a plan to cut tariffs in nine
sectors covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade by 2020. But
Japan, in its worst recession since World War II, insists it can't
accept a fixed schedule for opening its forestry and fishing
industries to outsiders because of domestic politics. APEC's aim is
free trade among the developed member nations by 2010 and
developing countries by 2020. (APEC)
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The chief U.S. envoy to a global
warming summit says he is encouraged by the pace of negotiations
for enacting the Kyoto climate treaty curbing greenhouse gas
pollution. Stuart Eizenstat also affirmed the Clinton
administration's commitment to signing the treaty before a March
deadline. The talks among more than 160 nations are to close Friday
with a blueprint for enacting the December 1997 Kyoto treaty, in
which industrialized nations are to, by 2012, cut their pollution
output by an average of 5 percent below 1990 levels. At stake is
the gradual and potentially destructive warming of the atmosphere
through the burning of coal, oil and gas. Critics say global
warming scenarios have not been proven and that the pact threatens
industry. Proponents of the treaty say it won't force costly
measures on American companies to cut pollution. (GLOBAL WARMING)

Singapore committee announces measures to cut business costs

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ As Singapore slumps into recession, a
government-linked committee reviewing the city-state's economic
competitiveness has announced much-awaited measures to slash
business costs by billions of dollars.
	   The move, announced Wednesday, would trim business expenses by
10 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 6 billion) a year, reducing
corporate costs by about 15 percent annually. The cuts equal about
7 percent of Singapore's entire gross domestic product.
	   Aimed at easing the pain of Singapore's first economic downturn
in 13 years, the package recommends major cuts in wages and pension
contributions, reduced land and factory rentals, slashed levies and
service charges, and lower taxes.
	   ``We must act decisively to restore our competitiveness and
enable our economy to weather the crisis,'' said the wide-ranging
report from the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness, which
comprises government and business representatives.
	   The Parliament is scheduled to discuss the package Nov. 23.
	   But later Wednesday, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong expressed his
support for the report, and said he would ask relevant ministries
to follow up promptly on the recommendations, TV reported.
	   Goh said the measures would help Singapore navigate safely
through the crisis.
	   Singapore labor leader Lim Swee Say also endorsed the report,
saying that slashed wages and benefits will help save more jobs.
	   Topping the agenda are labor costs.
	   During more prosperous times, rising wages and pension
contributions did not pose a major problem, said the report. But
``economic conditions have totally changed and we are competing for
a shrinking economic pie.''
	   Employers' payments to the mandatory, state-run pension fund
should be slashed in half, from 20 percent of a worker's salary to
10 percent, said the committee. Overall wage-related costs should
be reduced by about 15 percent, including unspecified wage cuts.
	   The government should also ``reduce, or extend rebates for
government taxes like corporate and personal income taxes'' next
year.
	   But Trade and Industry Minister Lee Yock Suan, who chairs the
committee, said there is only limited room to cut corporate taxes,
which stand at 26 percent, just above a long-term goal of 25
percent.
	   The government-appointed panel also recommended cuts in gas
taxes, utility charges, levies on using foreign workers, and
industrial rentals.
	   Noting that Singapore has enjoyed robust average annual growth
of 8.9 percent since independence in 1965, the report concedes that
the economy has quickly deteriorated since the start of the
regional crisis in mid-1997.
	   The vulnerable city-state just posted its first quarterly
contraction since the last recession in the mid-1980s. The
government announced Tuesday that Singapore's economy is
technically in recession and could contract as much as 1 percent
next year.
	   The committee ruled out measures to stimulate domestic demand
because ``Singapore's small size and heavy dependence on global
export markets'' would make such a move ineffective.
	   The report warns that while labor costs have gradually risen to
levels much higher than its competitors, the sharp depreciation of
regional currencies against the relatively strong Singapore dollar
``has worsened our competitiveness further.''
	   Devaluing the local currency would ultimately hurt the economy
and tarnish the Southeast Asian financial center's reputation, said
the report, concluding that restoring business competitiveness
through cost-cutting is the only solution.
	   Singapore must also reform and strengthen its economic structure
to position itself for renewed growth once the regional slowdown
subsides, it said.
	   In addition to short-term measures, the committee outlined broad
strategies to ``make Singapore the first developed economy in the
tropics within the next 10 years.''
	   Lee also cautioned that Singapore could run a budget deficit
again for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2000, as the country
wrestles with the economic crisis.
	   For the first time in more than a decade, Singapore's current
budget will have a deficit of 800 million Singapore dollars (dlrs
468 million).

	   OSAKA, Japan (AP) _ China upset Russia and defending champion
Cuba downed Brazil Wednesday, advancing to the final of the Women's
World Volleyball Championships.
	   China, which had barely reached the semifinals with an
unimpressive 3-2 record in the competition's second round, won
15-4, 15-4, 15-9 against Russia, successor to the Soviet teams that
had won six world titles since 1949.
	   The Russians' best effort came as they trailed 13-2 in the final
set. But the rally netted only seven points, and the match was all
over in 67 minutes.
	   Russia had come into the tournament ranked No. 1 by volleyball's
international governing body, FIVB, followed by Cuba, China,
Brazil, South Korea and Japan among 53 member countries.
	   Cuba advanced to Thursday's final by beating its 1994 world
championship runner-up Brazil 15-10, 4-15, 15-11, 15-10.
	   China built an early 7-3 lead and never had serious trouble,
displaying tight blocks and defenses spearheaded by Li Yan, Lai
Yawen and Wu Yongmei, and also staging effective attacks by Qiu
Aihua, Sun Yue and Wu Yongmei.
	   The 182-centimeter (6-foot) Qiu often found space between the
taller Russian blockers as she scored eight points and won 16
side-outs in 59 attempts.
	   Li was the star retriever.
	   For Russia, Japan-based Evguenia Artamonova led scoring with
four points and 14 side-outs in 55 tries.
	   ``All the (Russian) players are young and lost their
concentration and confidence,'' said Russian coach Nikolai Karpol.
	   Chinese coach Lang Ping said: ``We have no superstars, so we
united ourselves and played as one unit. Russia and China are on
the same level, but psychologically we were at ease. Tomorrow?
We'll do our best.''
	   The Cubans, also the 1996 Olympic champions, jumped well and
smacked the ball hard and accurately.
	   Brazil found it difficult to cope with the power of Cuban
players like Regla Torres Herrera and Regla Bell McKenzie, except
in the second set, when the 1996 Olympic bronze medalist rallied
with a good combination of blocking and attacks. Leila Barros
served three consecutive aces.
	   ``It was a tough game,'' said Brazilian player Karin Vebturini.
``We had difficulty in gaining points. Blocking was not good. We
did not play well defensively and our spikes were not effective.''
	   Cuban head coach Antonio Perdomo said, ``We know Brazil very
well, so we were well prepared. We are extremely happy with this
success, and we are looking forward to play the final against China
tomorrow.''
	   In the consolation round to decide fifth through eighth places,
Italy outclassed the Netherlands 15-7, 15-4, 16-14, and Croatia
beat host Japan 15-13, 15-5, 15-9.
	   Italy meets Croatia for fifth place and Japan takes on the
Netherlands for seventh on Thursday.

Jordan warns time is running out for diplomacy in Iraqi crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq-UN
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's prime minister warned Wednesday
that a U.S. military strike against Iraq seemed increasingly
likely.
	   ``It appears that attempts to defuse the crisis (diplomatically)
could be late,'' Fayez Tarawneh told reporters on his return from
two days of consultations about the tension with the Saudi
government in Riyadh.
	   The prime minister spoke hours after the United Nations began
pulling out all but essential staff from Iraq in what was seen as a
withdrawal ahead of a U.S. and British military strike.
	   The Americans and British have said they could resort to force
to pressure Iraq to reverse its Aug. 5 decision to freeze
cooperation with inspectors of the U.N. Special Commission, which
oversees the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``We have warned Iraq that ceasing cooperation with the United
Nations Special Commission is very serious,'' the prime minister
said.
	   Jordan ``urges Iraq to rescind its decision because it has no
choice but to cooperate with UNSCOM,'' Tarawneh added.
	   Tarawneh was one of a number of Arab leaders that U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen met last week while on a tour of the Middle
East aimed at sounding out governments about a possible strike
against Iraq.
	   Tarawneh reiterated that Jordan wanted to see a diplomatic
solution to the standoff, saying a strike would exacerbate the
suffering of Iraqis whose economy has been devastated by the U.N.
sanctions imposed after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Tarawneh said he would meet his senior security advisors on
Thursday to discuss ``the Iraqi crisis and its effects on Jordan.''
	   He did not elaborate, but other officials said the government is
planning to activate a ``contingency plan'' that deals with
Jordan's finding alternatives to Iraqi oil supplies. It also
addresses how to meet an expected influx of refugees from Iraq in
the event of a strike on Jordan's eastern neighbor.
	   Jordan receives all its daily requirement of 90,000 barrels of
crude and fuel oil from Iraq under a special exemption from the
U.N. embargo.
	   Officials say Jordan has fuel reserves to last for six weeks and
that supplies would come from Saudi Arabia in case those from Iraq
were severed.

Anwar predicts state of emergency in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Trial &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Anwar Ibrahim has predicted the
Malaysian leadership will impose a state of emergency after a
Pacific Rim summit meeting ends next week in Kuala Lumpur, the wife
of the former deputy prime minister said Wednesday.
	   The prediction is contained in a rambling letter written by
Anwar in prison, and later smuggled out to his supporters. His
wife, Azizah Ismail, confirmed to The Associated Press that the
letter is from her husband.
	   Since his arrest two months ago, Kuala Lumpur has been hit by
dozens of anti-government protests, though the demonstrations have
trailed off in recent days.
	   Still, Anwar predicts that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad will
declare a state of emergency after the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit ends next Wednesday.
	   ``After the APEC meeting, Cabinet ministers and other officials
will make direct calls for a state of emergency so that (Mahathir)
can say he has no choice but to declare it,'' Anwar said in the
note from prison.
	   ``In a desperate bid to remain in power, he (Mahathir) will
declare a state of emergency,'' Anwar added.
	   There was no indication of how the 51-year-old Anwar reached the
conclusion that Mahathir will take such a drastic step.
	   Anwar was expelled from the government on Sept. 2, and now is on
trial on corruption and sexual misconduct charges, which he says
were trumped up to stop his challenge to Mahathir's leadership.
	   In the 11-page letter, Anwar said the 72-year-old Mahathir had
been surprised by the growing anti-government movement and was
seeking a way to safeguard his 17-year rule.
	   ``The message comes from him through his lawyers,'' Anwar's wife
told the AP in an interview at her suburban home. The letter was
later posted on the Internet.
	   His followers have staged dozens of anti-government protests
that have drawn thousands to the streets of the capital, Kuala
Lumpur, in defiance of police bans.
	   Police and Cabinet ministers have warned of a crackdown if the
rallies continued.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ At least 400 weapons inspectors and other
U.N. staff left Baghdad Wednesday as the United Nations began
withdrawing all its ``non-essential'' staff amid preparations for a
U.S. military strike.
	   A convoy of 11 buses and vans carrying more than 100 arms
inspectors and their luggage rolled out of the U.N. Special
Commission's headquarters Wednesday morning. About 300 other U.N.
staff _ apparently humanitarian workers _ departed four hours
later.
	   Many of those leaving hugged U.N. workers _ including Iraqi
staffers _ who remained behind. None of U.N. employees would speak
with reporters as they boarded the gold, pink and blue buses.
	   As the vehicles left, U.N. workers were putting screens up over
the windows of the headquarters _ a move apparently aimed at
preventing glass shattering into the building if there were a
military strike.
	   Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs in Iraq,
told reporters the move was ``precautionary'' and taken ``solely
with the safety of U.N. staff in mind.''
	   ``In view of uncertainties surrounding the current situation and
following instructions from the U.N. headquarters in New York, it
has been decided to temporarily relocate non-essential U.N. staff
to Amman, Jordan,'' Falt said.
	   The United States and Britain have warned that military force
may be used to try to force Baghdad to back down from its decision
to freeze all cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission in
charge of arms inspections.
	   President Clinton met Tuesday with senior Pentagon officials to
explore options for a military attack, and Washington has stepped
up the movement of U.S. ships into the region.
	   Iraq has said it will not cooperate with inspectors until the
U.N. Security Council begins moving to lift an embargo imposed
after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War.
The Security Council maintains the embargo won't be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Before Wednesday's departures, there were about 120 UNSCOM and
IAEA personnel in the country before the evacuation began. There
were about 450 humanitarian workers.
	   Those pulled out Wednesday included not only all UNSCOM staff
but monitors for the International Atomic Energy Agency and other
U.N. workers who run the oil-for-food program supplying aid to the
Iraqi people.
	   The arms inspectors flew to Bahrain, while other were traveling
aboard five buses on the nine- or ten-hour trip across the desert
to neighboring Jordan.
	   Falt described the step as a ``temporary relocation'' and said
it applies to ``all U.N. staff resident in Baghdad,'' which would
include humanitarian workers.
	   Hans von Sponeck, head of the humanitarian operations who also
is security coordinator for U.N. staff in Baghdad, would be
remaining, Falt said. Jaakko Ylitalo, the acting director of UNSCOM
in Baghdad, was among those seen leaving.
	   In Bahrain, Goran Wallen, chief of the UNSCOM field office
there, said no UNSCOM officials would be left in Iraq. He said 11
inspectors for the IAEA, which monitors Iraq's nuclear weapons
programs, were also coming to Bahrain.
	   The current crises began in August when Iraq said it would not
cooperate with the Special Commission. It allowed some personnel
who do long-term monitoring to continue working, but on Oct. 31 it
stopped even that work.
	   Despite warnings of a military strike by the United States and
Britain, Iraqi officials have said they will not back down from
their decision to bar the inspectors from working. Iraq appeared to
be turning to other Arab states to head off any attack.
	   On Tuesday, Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf,
chose an Arab television station _ Qatar's Al-Jazeera _ for his
first interview on the dispute.
	   Al-Sahhaf warned that ``any use of military force against Iraq
would lead to destabilizing the region.''
	   The United States and Britain maintain they have backing in the
Middle East for a military strike, but Arab officials have offered
no public support for using force.
	   Jordan's Prime Minister Fayez Farawneh met Wednesday with Saudi
Arabia's Kind Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah and said later the two
countries ``are in agreement that the crisis ... should be solved
diplomatically.''
	   But he added: ``It appears that attempts to defuse the crisis
could be late.''
	   In New York, Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's ambassador to the United
Nations, said Tuesday that ``we have to prepare ourself for a
strike obviously _ this does not mean that we don't encourage
diplomacy.''
	   He said Iraq has kept channels open through U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy, Prakash Shah, but that
``nothing really has moved today.''
	   U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler, interviewed on
American television, urged Iraq to face up to the fact that
disarmament is connected to sanctions.
	   ``The key is in its hands _ and it's called full disclosure to
us,'' he said.

German lawmakers take up Schroeder's agenda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Citing already high unemployment, Germany's
labor minister Wednesday ruled out cuts in government programs to
keep people off the jobless rolls.
	   Walter Riester's comment came during parliament's first policy
debate since the center-left won September elections on promises to
fight joblessness and strengthen protection for society's weakest
members.
	   Later, lawmakers began debating Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
first proposal _ lowering deductibles for prescription drugs under
Germany's national health care system.
	   Nearly 4 million Germans, or more than 10 percent of the
workforce, are out of work. Roughly another 1 million are in
government-subsidized low-paid jobs as well as make-work and
training programs, especially in former communist East Germany.
	   Riester said the aid would continue ``at the necessary high
level,'' but when companies offer young persons a full-fledged
trainee job, ``we do expect them to take it.''
	   Schroeder, a Social Democrat, has made combating unemployment
his top priority. To counter his left-leaning image among business,
he also promised in his inaugural speech to parliament Tuesday to
review Germany's costly social programs.
	   Yet at the same time, he plans to undo cuts in retirement
benefits and sick pay as well as other modest pro-business reforms
by his predecessor, Helmut Kohl.
	   Riester, Schroeder's point man on jobs, said voters had given
the new government of Social Democrats and environmentalist Greens
a ``clear mandate'' to rescind the measures.
	   A social policy expert from the opposition Christian Democrats,
Hermann Kues, accused the government of sending ``the wrong
signals'' to industry.

Northern town is calm after clashes, but not stable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The northern Albanian town of Shkodra was
calm Wednesday, but far from back to normal, a day after armed men
took to the streets, shooting the air and entering a government
building in protest of several arrests.
	   The unrest in Shkodra, 85 kilometers (50 miles) north of Tirana,
and a stronghold of the opposition Democratic Party, began late
Tuesday after police arrested three men _ all members of an
anti-Communist union _ on charges of theft.
	   Two of the men were later released, but a third, identified as
Marjan Zef Gryka, 27, remained in custody.
	   Local media reported Wednesday that Gryka was a former bodyguard
of Azem Hajdari, a popular opposition leader who was killed Sept.
12. Hajdari's funeral sparked a week of violent protests in the
capital.
	   The reports said Gryka was arrested for confronting President
Rexhep Mejdani during a visit to Shkodra last week while carrying
weapons. But an Interior Ministry spokesman later said he was only
charged with theft.
	   A crowd of anti-Communists gathered in the town's main square
late Tuesday, demanding the detained be released. They blocked off
part of the town and started shooting into the air, state news
agency ATA reported. Later state television said some of the men
had gained entry into the main local government building.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said its
office in Shkodra had been looted of computers and other equipment
and a vehicle had been stolen during the violence. Nobody was
injured, said the organization.
	   By Wednesday Shkodra appeared calm. Shops opened and people
moved freely through the streets.
	   Interior Ministry officials said special police units have were
sent from Tirana to reinforce local officers.
	   But the situation is far from returning to normal with
anti-Communist unions demanding Gryka be released by evening and
Shkodra police chief and several local government officials be
replaced.
	   Ali Lacaj, the prefect of Shkodra, has called a meeting of
representatives from the local government, political parties, the
anti-Communist unions and the OSCE, in hopes of working out a
peaceful solution.

Athletes lament Taliban decision to pull out of Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR SHAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Frustrated athletes Wednesday lamented
the Taliban's decision to pull out of the Asian Games in December
because their impoverished homeland cannot afford to send them to
Thailand.
	   ``We wanted to prove our skills and show that despite all the
problems our players can compete in international events,'' said
the coach of the national boxing team, who gave his name only as
Najibullah.
	   ``Despite the lack of facilities and even proper food, we
applied ourselves. Many of my boxers couldn't afford a glass of
milk, but still they worked hard . . . it is a blow for us,'' he
said.
	   The Taliban pay their Olympic-level athletes 2,000 Afghanis or
the equivalent of 56 cents a day.
	   In a cost-saving move, the Taliban earlier cut its 40 member
team to 10, but it wasn't enough.
	   ``Now our Shoora (the ruling council) decided Tuesday not to
participate in the games altogether,'' Sport Minister Abdul Shakoor
Mutmaen told The Associated Press.
	   ``We can't afford to pay dlrs 3,000 for each person to cover his
traveling expenses and two week's stay in Thailand,'' he said.
	   Previously the host country bore the expenses, Mutmaen said.
	   An Olympic Association previously had given Afghanistan dlrs
45,000 to promote sports, but the war-battered country has not
received the donation for two years.
	   Mutmaen and a second Taliban will carry Afghanistan's flag at
the Asian Games to give the county their country a token
representation.
	   Afghanistan's athletes earlier came under fire for wearing
beards in the boxing ring.
	   They were warned they would have to shave if they hoped to
participate, something the Taliban religious army protested.
	   In Islamic Afghanistan, where the hard-line religious militia
rules most of the country, it is illegal to shave, which the
Taliban say is offensive to Islam.
	   ``We will also protest against the discriminatory attitude
toward us and take up the issue of not allowing boxers with beards
in tournaments,'' Mutmaen said. ``The Taliban want to promote
sports, but it has to be done in line with the teachings of
Islam.''

Latvian train derails, cargo of fuel catches fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) - A freight train hauling diesel fuel derailed
near Riga early Wednesday, spilling fuel tanks that burst into
flames on the railway embankment without causing injury, the Baltic
News Service reported.
	   At least a dozen fire trucks and five special fire-fighting
trains rushed to the wreck site and brought the blaze under
control, the BNS news agency said. Teams were building a dike to
prevent spilled diesel from reaching a nearby river.
	   Investigators told BNS that a faulty wheel caused the train to
derail and lose 32 of the 55 fuel tanks it was hauling. One 60-ton
capacity tank burst into flames, and the fire engulfed a total of
14 tanks.
	   No injuries were reported, and a task force lead by Latvian
Environment Minister Anatolijs Gorbunovs was to assess possible
environmental damage.
	   The accident near the town of Vecumnieki, about 45 kilometers
(28 miles) south of the Latvian capital, occurred before dawn
Wednesday and the fire was believed to be under control by midday.
	   The train was carrying diesel fuel refined in Russia and Belarus
to the Latvian port of Ventspils for export. The report did not say
how much diesel was spilled.

Thousands of students and workers march through Romanian cities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Thousands of angry workers and
students marched through Romanian cities and blocked a major
highway Wednesday, in linked protests against economic hardship and
government policies.
	   Some 3,000 students whistled and jeered as they marched through
Bucharest to protest the government's refusal to discuss their
demands.
	   For three days students have cut classes all over the country to
show they disapprove of high examination fees, outdated equipment,
poor-quality accommodation and too few grants.
	   ``Our requests require money and cannot be solved on the spot,''
said Razvan Ilie, a spokesman for Students' League on national
radio. ``We want a very precise plan which we can constantly
supervise.''
	   In the cities of Galati, Cluj, Deva, Satu Mare and Brasov,
thousands of miners, energy and chemistry workers, and truck and
taxi drivers protested falling living standards.
	   Workers said they have had enough of delayed salaries and
demanded the resignation of Industry Minister Radu Berceanu,
claiming his proposed reforms are untenable. The average monthly
salary in Romania is 1.2 million lei (dlrs 120).
	   Since reformist parties came to power two years ago, the
coalition government has stalled on market reforms. Purchasing
power and production have dropped. Unemployment is about 8.6
percent and salaries are often paid late.
	   Berceanu wants to split the state electricity production and
distribution company into two parts, which critics say would lead
to job losses.
	   ``Berceanu's reform programs are pure fantasy,'' said Dumitru
Costin, the leader of the National Trade Union Bloc, a group of
trade unions that represents 600,000 workers.
	   Early Wednesday, some 1,500 miners and energy workers blocked a
national highway near the city of Deva, 300 kilometers (188 miles)
northwest of Bucharest.
	   A few thousand truck and taxi drivers are expected Thursday to
block Bucharest's streets with their vehicles. They oppose a recent
law which hands out fines equivalent to a month's salary for minor
traffic offenses.
	   Trade unions say they will stage marches and street protests for
all this week.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Wednesday
faced intense pressure to step down after allegations that he
interfered in a privatization contract and helped a businessman
linked to a mobster secure loans.
	   Deniz Baykal, leader of the center-left Republican party whose
outside-coalition backing in parliament gives Yilmaz's minority
government the votes it needs, said he would withdraw his support
unless the premier resigned immediately.
	   The opposition would have a comfortable majority to bring the
government down if the Republicans voted against Yilmaz.
	   In addition, two opposition parties threatened to press for a
motion to censure the government.

Israel says it wants to stay out of Iraq crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel does not consider itself a player in the
new showdown between the United States and Iraq, officials said
Wednesday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the
crisis with senior Cabinet ministers.
	   However, Israel appeared to be at least indirectly involved. One
report said U.S. President Bill Clinton may have urged Netanyahu to
speed up ratification of the peace accord with the Palestinians in
order to help Washington win Arab support for a strike against
Iraq.
	   Clinton called Netanyahu on Tuesday to discuss the
land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians and the Iraq
situation, U.S. officials said.
	   Implementation of the peace accord was to begin Nov. 2, but
Israel has put it on hold pending Cabinet approval of the
agreement. Netanyahu has postponed several Cabinet sessions on the
subject, but ministers were expected to ratify the deal Wednesday.
	   An Israeli official the United States let it be known that its
policy of being tough on Iraq was encountering problems in the Arab
world because Israel had not moved forward on its implementation of
the Wye agreement. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The Haaretz daily said there was speculation that Clinton told
Netanyahu in Tuesday's phone call that the Cabinet's failure to
ratify the agreement has made it difficult for the United States to
win support from Arab states against Iraq.
	   On Wednesday morning, Netanyahu met with Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon to discuss the
new crisis over Iraq.
	   ``We are not a part of this conflict, except as members of the
United Nations,'' a Foreign Ministry official said after the
meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``And right now, the
issue is between the United States and Iraq.''
	   In the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel in
hopes of breaking up the Arab coalition against it. However, Israel
did not retaliate and the coalition held.
	   In a subsequent U.S.-Iraq crisis in February, Iraq did not make
any attempt to draw Israel into the dispute.
	   Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad Anani, meanwhile, arranged to
meet with Sharon and Netanyahu on Wednesday afternoon, apparently
to discuss the latest developments in Iraq.
	   The United Nations has ordered most of its weapons inspectors to
leave Iraq and travel to Jordan.
	   One Israeli opposition lawmaker expressed hope that the United
States would crack down hard on Iraq. ``Any military solution which
is short of the overthrow of Saddam Hussein is senseless,'' said
Ephraim Sneh, a retired general from the opposition Labor Party.

Canada's foreign minister to assess Russia's crisis during visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Canada's visiting Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy
was holding talks Wednesday on Russia's economic crisis, a
development that prompted the postponement of the Canadian prime
minister's trip to Moscow.
	   Axworthy discussed Russia's economic woes and international
problems during a meeting Wednesday with his Russian counterpart
Igor Ivanov, Russian news agencies reported.
	   There have also been media reports that Canada was considering
humanitarian aid to Russia's vast Arctic regions.
	   Axworthy had originally been scheduled to lay the groundwork for
a visit by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who was to lead a
delegation of Canadian business executives to Russia in January.
	   But Chretien's visit was first scaled back and then put off
altogether two weeks ago, because of Russia's economic crisis.
	   Axworthy also met with Russian regional leaders and the
government's economic officials during his one-day stay in Moscow.
	   Axworthy and Ivanov also discussed the problems in Iraq and
Kosovo, and Canada's upcoming two-year term on the U.N. Security
Council, Russia's ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies reported.
	   ``This circumstance gives additional importance to Canada's
position in the international arena,'' Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin was quoted as saying by Interfax.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Crystal Palace's Chinese defender Fan Zhiyi has
been charged with misconduct by the English Football Association
for allegedly pushing a referee.
	   The FA announced the charge after studying referee Terry
Heilbron's report on the incident, which occurred at the end of
Palace's 3-2 defeat to West Bromwich Albion on Nov. 3.
	   Heilbron, who awarded Albion a last-minute penalty, was
surrounded by Palace players at the end of the match and allegedly
manhandled by Fan.
	   The FA said Fan has 14 days to respond to the charge. If found
guilty, Fan could face a suspension or fine or both.

Athletes lament Taliban decision to pull out of Asian Games

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Frustrated athletes Wednesday lamented
the Taliban's decision to pull out of the Asian Games in December
because their impoverished homeland cannot afford to send them to
Thailand.
	   ``We wanted to prove our skills and show that despite all the
problems our players can compete in international events,'' said
the coach of the national boxing team, who gave his name only as
Najibullah.
	   ``Despite the lack of facilities and even proper food, we
applied ourselves. Many of my boxers couldn't afford a glass of
milk, but still they worked hard . . . it is a blow for us,'' he
said.
	   The Taliban pay their Olympic-level athletes 2,000 Afghanis or
the equivalent of 56 cents a day.
	   In a cost-saving move, the Taliban earlier cut its 40 member
team to 10, but it wasn't enough.
	   ``Now our Shoora (the ruling council) decided Tuesday not to
participate in the games altogether,'' Sport Minister Abdul Shakoor
Mutmaen told The Associated Press.
	   ``We can't afford to pay dlrs 3,000 for each person to cover his
traveling expenses and two week's stay in Thailand,'' he said.
	   Previously the host country bore the expenses, Mutmaen said.
	   An Olympic Association previously had given Afghanistan dlrs
45,000 to promote sports, but the war-battered country has not
received the donation for two years.
	   Mutmaen and a second Taliban will carry Afghanistan's flag at
the Asian Games to give the county their country a token
representation.
	   Afghanistan's athletes earlier came under fire for wearing
beards in the boxing ring.
	   They were warned they would have to shave if they hoped to
participate, something the Taliban religious army protested.
	   In Islamic Afghanistan, where the hard-line religious militia
rules most of the country, it is illegal to shave, which the
Taliban say is offensive to Islam.
	   ``We will also protest against the discriminatory attitude
toward us and take up the issue of not allowing boxers with beards
in tournaments,'' Mutmaen said. ``The Taliban want to promote
sports, but it has to be done in line with the teachings of
Islam.''

Spain considering paying damages for anti-Basque death squad
</HEADLINE>
killings

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar is
considering paying damages to relatives of people killed by
government-backed death squads that targeted Basque separatists in
the 1980s when his Socialist predecessors were in power, a
spokesman said Wednesday.
	   ``This is a subject that is being analyzed now. That is all
there is to say,'' spokesman Josep Pique told reporters.
	   The death squads, which called themselves the Anti-terrorist
Liberation Groups, or GAL, killed 27 people from 1983 to 1987 in a
campaign designed to crush the armed Basque separatist group ETA.
Many of the victims were mistaken targets.
	   Jose Barrionuevo, interior minister under then-Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez, and his deputy for state security, Rafael Vera,
are serving 10-year jail terms for their role in organizing a
botched 1983 kidnapping that marked the GAL's first act.
	   Pique also rejected a call Tuesday by ETA's political wing,
Herri Batasuna, for a blanket amnesty for more than 500 jailed ETA
members as a way to end decades of separatist conflict.
	   He reiterated the government position that if ETA, which
declared a ceasefire Sept. 16, renounces violence for good,
officials are willing to consider transferring some ETA prisoners
to jails in or near the Basque country in line with a long-standing
ETA demand.
	   Pique also said the government is ``still waiting'' for a
response from ETA to Aznar's offer of exploratory talks to discuss
whether the group is willing to renounce violence.
	   The government insists that if full-blown peace talks do get
underway, it is prepared to discuss only the prisoner issue and ETA
disarmament, not ETA's stated goal of an independent Basque
homeland.
	   ETA is a Basque-language acronym that stands for Basque Homeland
and Freedom. Its bombings and shootings in the Basque country and
elsewhere in Spain have left nearly 800 people dead since 1968.

 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The emerging Kosovo Verification
Mission is the last chance ``to avert an irrational spiral of more
violence'' in the strife-torn Serbian province, its head said
Wednesday.
	   William Walker, an American diplomat, and some aides arrived in
this Kosovo capital to plan the startup of the mission of 2,000
verifiers appointed by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. But he could not give any date for when the
mission will formally begin.
	   Speaking of an ``unprecedented international effort to bring
stability and peace to all the people in Kosovo,'' Walker told
reporters he was hopeful that the OSCE inspectors can create a
climate for the people of Kosovo ``to choose the way of moderation,
the way of sanity, the way of peaceful resolution.''
	   Serb forces in February launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists fighting for independence for Kosovo, which is 90
percent ethnic Albanian. Several hundred other people, mostly
ethnic Albanians, have been killed since, and as many as 300,000
driven from their homes.
	   The violence has continued past the Oct. 12 agreement by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to sharply reduce his forces.
In three incidents over the past few weeks, police reported killing
fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army they said shot at them
first.
	   KLA spokesman Adem Demaci on Tuesday accused Serb police of
provoking fighting and said any violence committed by their side
was purely in self-defense.
	   Mindful of the lingering enmity in the majority Albanian
province, Walker said Wednesday, ``It is obvious that we have a
long way to go from this battlefield to the neogitating table.''
	   In the latest incident, three Serb policemen were wounded
Tuesday night in Glogovac, some 30 kikometers (20 miles) west of
Pristina, the pro-government Serbian Media Center in Pristina
reported. It said ethnic Albanian extremists attacked a police
station, and there was a one-hour fire fight. The wounded were
taken to a Pristina hospital.
	   Walker, who said he was heading the most ambitious OSCE mission
ever, declared it ``might be the last, best chance to avert an
irrational spiral of more violence, more human suffering.''
	   He said, ``The mission is going to be forward-leaning,
pro-active, assertive, intrusive, whatever you want to call it,''
he said.
	   Asked about the safety of the 2,000 inspectors, Walker said
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had guaranteed the safety of
people and all access, adding ``our security in the first instance
depends on the guaratees of President Milosevic.''
	   The safety of the verification team will also depend on the
behavior of the rebel force that has been defeated but not
destroyed.
	   The guerrillas have grudgingly accepted the de-facto October
cease-fire that calls for a large-scale cutback of Serb police and
Yugoslav army forces in the province. But they refuse to agree to
any final plan that falls short of independence.
	   In past comments, they have rejected a U.S.-backed draft
political agreement for Kosovo that calls only for a restoration of
autonomy for the majority Albanian province in Serbia, the dominant
Yugoslav republic.
	   Demaci, the KLA spokesman, has been long at odds with Ibrahim
Rugova, the Kosovo Albanian leader supported by foreign powers in
his efforts at a peaceful accommodation with the Serbs.
	   In an indirect slap at Rugova, Demaci on Tuesday criticized
``those in power (who) now refuse to relinquish even the tiniest
part of that power.''
	   He said any chance of agreement with Rugova ``had passed by
now.'' And he urged Rugova's people to stay out of plans to form an
independent, predominantly Albanian police force for Kosovo, saying
that role was reserved for KLA fighters.
	   His statement followed the kidnapping of two Serb police
officers who were later found dead with gunshot wounds to the head.
Demaci did not specifically comment on accusations that the KLA
killed the men.
	   The two Serb policemen disappeared Friday, the same day Serb
police shot and killed five ethnic Albanian guerrillas.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ China has warned that if Philippine
military reconnaissance jets fly too low over a disputed South
China Sea reef, it might trigger an accidental confrontation, the
Philippine military chief said Wednesday.
	   Armed forces chief of staff Maj. Gen. Joselin Nazareno said he
ordered Philippine military planes not to fly lower than 5,000 feet
(1,515 meters) over Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands
after China protested.
	   ``They were concerned that we were flying very low and this
might be misinterpreted by people and lead to a confrontation,''
Nazareno told reporters.
	   Philippine military S-211 jets have been flying in tandem daily
over the reef, Nazareno said.
	   Last week, Manila delivered a diplomatic protest to Beijing over
the expansion of concrete platforms China built in 1995 at Mischief
Reef, demanding that China dismantle the structures and that
Chinese ships leave the area.
	   China has said it was repairing fishing shelters damaged by
natural causes, and that it has a sovereign right to undertake the
repairs to ensure the safety of its fishermen.
	   Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, however, said
China was building massive barracks and possibly a pier that could
be used militarily.
	   Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said Chinese
officials were also concerned that the flights, which come as close
as 30 meters (yards) from the Chinese structures and ships at the
reef, might cause air turbulence and lead to fatal accidents.
	   A senior Chinese official relayed his government's concern
Monday to Philippine Ambassador Romualdo Ong in Beijing, Siazon
said.
	   A diplomatic source said Chinese authorities consider the
low-altitude flights by Philippine military planes over the reef
``irresponsible and dangerous because it could lead to something
else.''
	   On Tuesday, President Joseph Estrada ordered increased naval
patrols in the area after the military reported the Chinese
expansion.
	   Estrada said the conflict over the reef would be solved
diplomatically and would not lead to a military confrontation.
Nazareno, however, suggested that Philippine troops would consider
retaliating if attacked.
	   Mercado described China's actions as a ``creeping invasion'' of
Philippine territorial waters and said Manila was considering
filing a complaint at the United Nations.
	   Estrada plans to take up the issue with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin on the sidelines of a meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders in
Malaysia next week.
	   ``We will do it through negotiations. Let us not be
confrontational, you know we cannot afford to,'' he told reporters
Tuesday.
	   The Philippines has one of the weakest militaries in Southeast
Asia.
	   Siazon met Chinese Ambassador Guan Dengming on Wednesday to
discuss the agenda for talks between Estrada and Jiang, which are
expected to be dominated by the dispute over Mischief Reef.
	   During the meeting, Siazon said, Guan acknowledged that the
Chinese were expanding structures in the reef but said this would
not be used militarily.
	   Mercado has shown reporters pictures of large wooden barracks
being built on stilts on a concrete foundation adjacent to a
cluster of concrete platforms on the two-by-four-mile
(three-by-six-kilometer) reef. The pictures also showed dozens of
workers. Military officers say the barracks could house about 70
people.
	   China's occupation of the reef could threaten the food security
of the Philippines by reducing its access to fishery resources,
said Mercado.
	   Mischief Reef, called Panganiban by the Philippines, is about
150 miles (240 kilometers) west of the western Philippine island of
Palawan.
	   The Spratlys island group is claimed in whole or in part by the
Philippines, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei and Malaysia.

Portuguese lawmakers open budget debate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Prime Minister Antonio Guterres on
Wednesday presented his minority Socialist government's last state
budget before next year's general election and stressed its
emphasis on social issues.
	   In a speech to parliament, Guterres also underscored his
administration's strong economic record since it took power in late
1995 after 10 years in opposition.
	   ``Spending on social issues in 1995 accounted for less than half
of total state spending _ 48.7 percent. In 1999, it will be 55.4
percent,'' Guterres said at the start of the annual budget debate.
	   The government earmarked the largest budget increase for the
health sector, with a 5.1 percent share of the Gross Domestic
Product, while education is also to receive more cash _ 5.7 percent
of GDP _ to improve infrastructure and train more teachers.
	   Strong economic growth and fiscal discipline had made it
possible for Portugal to meet the tough economic criteria for
membership of the new 11-nation European currency, the euro, to be
launched next year, he said.
	   That meant Portugal, a country of 9.9 million people, had joined
the front rank of European Union nations ``after three-quarters of
a century which accentuated our weaknesses and our isolation,''
Guterres said.
	   The economy ``is growing at a rate above the EU average, we have
hit record levels of public and private investment ... unemployment
has been falling for 21 months, and our interest rates are almost
the same as those in Germany,'' he said.
	   The budget envisages a GDP growth rate of between 3.5 percent
and 4 percent in 1999, down from an estimated 4.2 percent expected
this year.
	   The budget aims to lower income tax rates for two-thirds of the
population, while the richest two percent pay more tax, Guterres
said.
	   The center-right Social Democrat Party, the largest opposition
party in parliament, called for more tax breaks for the
middle-class.
	   However, the party said it would abstain from the final vote,
due before the end of the month, which effectively guarantees
approval for the budget because the two other opposition parties
together have fewer seats than the Socialists.

NATO concerned about upsurge of violence in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO is very concerned about the
upsurge in violence in Kosovo and condemned the increasing number
of incidents, no matter who is responsible for starting them,
alliance officials said Wednesday.
	   Since the Oct. 12 agreement American negotiator Richard
Holbrooke struck with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, there
have been a number of attacks in which Serb police or fighters from
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army have been killed.
	   While alliance officials say the situation on the ground is much
better than it was prior to the agreement, they are worried that
tit-for-tat attacks, or attempts by one side or the other to gain
advantage, could rekindle the fighting that originally broke out
last February.
	   ''There is a great deal of concern about the deteriorating
situation ... and the deaths that have occurred, and obviously we
condemn these incidents,'' a NATO official, speaking on condition
of anonymity, told reporters during a briefing on the weekly
meeting of NATO ambassadors.
	   Hundreds died and nearly 300,000 made homeless, mostly civilian
ethnic Albanians, in seven months of conflict between Serb military
and police forces and KLA rebels. Ethnic Albanians make up about 90
percent of the 2 million inhabitants of this southern province of
Serbia.
	   Not wanting to put the blame on either side, the NATO official
said Serb special police forces have a heavy presence in some
particularly sensitive areas of the province and that it was clear
the KLA has been trying to exploit the situation and making
provocative attacks.
	   Nonetheless, the official stressed, the Serbs are still largely
in compliance with the Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement.
	   NATO military authorities continue to work on the operations
plan for the special rapid reaction force that will be based near
Kosovo, but outside Yugoslavia, to conduct emergency rescue
operations if any of the eventual 2,000 unarmed civilian ''ground
verifiers'' run into trouble.
	   France has offered to provide 40-50 percent of the force,
expected to number about 1,800, and Germany also has volunteered to
participate. Officials hoped to approve the plan by Friday.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana has said he expects the
force, which probably will be based in Macedonia, to be in place by
the end of November.

Kabila wants U.N. to investigate massacres, ambassador says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.N. comments, grafs 3, 9. &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN DAVIES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Congo's president, despite past refusals
to cooperate, has invited a new U.N. team to investigate massacres
he blamed on Tutsi rebels who put him in power last year and now
want to oust him.
	   President Laurent Kabila ``has asked the United Nations to send
a team to investigate,'' Gabriel Kyungu Wa-Ku-Mwanza, newly
appointed Congolese ambassador to Kenya, said at a news conference
Wednesday.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has not received an
invitation from Kabila to renew its investigation, spokesman Jose
Diaz said in Geneva.
	   Since June 1997, Congolese authorities have thwarted U.N.
attempts to investigate allegations that Kabila's Tutsi-led rebels
massacred thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees, who were in U.N.
camps in eastern Congo when the rebellion broke out in late 1996.
	   The United Nations withdrew its investigators from Congo in
April, citing a total lack of cooperation from the government,
which harassed and intimidated witnesses who spoke with the
experts.
	   Wa-Ku-Mwanza said one man was to blame for the roadblocks:
Bizima Karaha, a Tutsi who was Kabila's foreign minister until he
defected to the Rwandan- and Ugandan-backed rebels who have been
trying to topple Kabila since Aug. 2.
	   ``The first mission didn't succeed because of Bizima Karaha,''
Wa-Ku-Mwanza said.
	   He did not explain how a Cabinet minister could usurp the
president, if he did wanted the investigation to go ahead, nor how
Karaha forced Kabila to repeatedly and publicly insult the U.N.
investigators.
	   The first team of investigators concluded that ``obstacles came
from the authorities at various levels,'' Diaz said.

Primakov pledges to pay wages without printing new money
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Wednesday said
his government is trying to keep a tight lid over spending and
wouldn't print large sums of money to pay debts.
	   ``We guarantee payments of current wages,'' he said at a meeting
with lawmakers. ``We can and will do that without printing new
money.''
	   ``We have hardly printed any money so far, but we have huge
debts,'' Primakov said without elaboration.
	   Primakov acknowledged that the government is short of funds to
pay off all pensions and social subsidies for families with
children.
	   At the same time, Primakov indicated that the government may
print up to 25 billion rubles (dlrs 1.7 billion), saying that
wouldn't fuel high inflation.
	   Primakov claimed that the International Monetary Fund wouldn't
oppose money printing as long as it didn't exceed that amount. When
other Russian officials made similar claims in recent weeks, the
IMF denied that, saying it's against issuing new money that could
stoke high inflation.
	   The government got some good news Wednesday when the State
Statistics Committee announced that inflation in October was 4.5
percent, dropping sharply from 38.4 percent in September.
	   Prices gyrated wildly shortly after the crisis hit in August,
but have been relatively stable in recent weeks.
	   Some officials have acknowledged that the government might be
forced to print more money to cover a large budget deficit if the
International Monetary Fund and other lenders don't release more
aid.
	   The IMF arranged a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package to Russia last
summer, but it froze disbursements following Russia's economic
crisis in August.
	   The IMF has criticized the economic recovery plan produced by
Primakov's Cabinet after nearly two months of discussions, saying
it contains many proposals to impose more state controls over the
economy.
	   With no foreign loans likely in near future, Primakov's
government is facing a tough task of boosting tax collection and
other domestic revenues.
	   Primakov said the government plans to introduce criminal
punishment for tax evasion in addition to fines, and wants to ban
alcohol imports as part of an effort to eradicate illegal alcohol
production.
	   He also spoke of stronger state controls to stem capital flight
abroad.
	   ``We will uproot swindlers who leave their capital in foreign
bank accounts,'' Primakov said.
	   In other economic news on Wednesday, Russian crude oil exports
rose 9.9 percent in the first nine months of the year, but lower
world oil prices caused revenues to plummet by 28 percent compared
with the same period last year, according to the government
statistics. Oil is one of the country's leading exports.

Strict Greek spending plan keeps eye on EU single currency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The Greek government unveiled a
cost-cutting budget Wednesday aimed at clearing fiscal hurdles to
reach the European Union's single currency group.
	   The government's austerity measures have led to labor protests
and strikes against plans to trim services, sell state holdings and
limit wage hikes. The governing Socialists also lost ground to the
opposition conservatives in municipal elections last month.
	   But Premier Costas Simitis has so far refused to budge from the
drive to join the single currency club by 2001. Failure could leave
the EU's poorest nation as an economic backwater in the 15-nation
bloc, Simitis insists.
	   Greece was the only EU member not to qualify for the inaugural
group using the single currency, which is scheduled to be
introduced in January. Britain, Denmark and Sweden opted not to
take part.
	   The 1999 budget seeks to reduce the general deficit to 1.9
percent of gross domestic product from an expected 2.2 percent at
the end of this year. This is well below an EU requirement of 3
percent.
	   Inflation, however, remains Greece's main challenge. The
government has reduced prices on some consumer goods, such as cars,
and seeks to hold down wage increases in an attempt to lower
inflation, which stood at 4.7 percent in October.
	   Inflation must be below 3 percent under EU single currency
guidelines.

Police say they are closing in on reputed leader of Sicilian Mafia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police expressed confidence Wednesday that they are
closing in on the alleged leader of the Sicilian Mafia, Bernardo
Provenzano, who has been a fugitive for 29 years.
	   Authorities said a raid of mobsters' homes in various Sicilian
cities Tuesday produced vital information on Provenzano's
whereabouts. Forty-seven mobsters linked to Provenzano were
arrested.
	   Also found were 11 letters written by Provenzano to a fellow
mobster, Luigi Illardo, who was later murdered after he agreed to
collaborate with police, authorities said.
	   In the letters, Provenzano sends ``kisses to the children'' of
Illardo advises him to ``stay calm, respectful and coherent,''
towards rivals. In one letter he refers to ``our wicked life.''
	   Provenzano is believed to have taken over leadership of the
Mafia in 1993, following the arrest of the ``boss of bosses,''
Salvatore ``Toto'' Riina, himself long a fugitive.
	   In recent months police have stepped up their search for
Provenzano, who has been convicted in absentia of several counts of
murder.

<TEXT>
	   MESEN, Belgium (AP) _ In ceremony packed with symbolism for
efforts to end conflict in today's Ireland, the British monarch and
the Irish president will jointly unveil Wednesday a monument to
50,000 Irishmen _ Catholics and Protestants _ who died in World War
I.
	   ``The inauguration ... is an important symbolic moment of
reconciliation in our history,'' said Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern in Dublin.
	   Queen Elizabeth II and Irish President Mary McAleese will open
the Island of Ireland Peace Park, crowned with a replica of a
Celtic round tower, on the 80th anniversary of the armistice that
ended the First World War.
	   It was built on the site of the battle of Messines Ridge where
in 1917 Catholic and Protestant Irishmen serving in the British
army battled shoulder-to-shoulder against the Germans.
	   Built by young Irish people from both sides of the religious
divide, the tower is the first monument to the fallen of World War
I paid by the Irish government, which for decades ignored the
ultimate sacrifice of those who fought for Britain.
	   Though men of the 36th Ulster division and the 16th Irish
Division fought and died in the same trenches, they returned home
after the armistice to very different receptions.
	   Protestant Ulstermen were welcomed as heroes. Their suffering
helped forge the identity of the pro-British community in Ulster.
	   But in the south of Ireland, marked by the failed 1916 Easter
uprising against British rule, the veterans who fought under
British colors were often denounced as traitors.
	   Now Irish leaders hope that by honoring the 30,000 Catholics and
20,000 Protestants who perished in the war they can help heal the
scars of the more recent conflict in Northern Ireland and
strengthen the peace process there.
	   ``The Island of Ireland Peace Park ... seeks to use their
tremendous sacrifice as the basis on which to forge a deeper
understanding and respect between traditions,'' McAleese wrote in
the program to Wednesday's ceremony.
	   The men behind the peace park themselves symbolize that spirit
of reconciliation.
	   Paddy Harte is Catholic. For 35 years, he served as a deputy in
the Irish parliament. Glen Barr is an Ulster Protestant who
strongly defended British rule in the province.
	   ``It was time to say sorry,'' said Barr. ``Sorry to those young
men we had forgotten. And sorry to each other for the terrible
atrocities we had committed against each other since,''
	   ``It's a great day for Ireland,'' Harte told reporters at the
foot of the tower. ``It's really a gesture of reconciliation for
the people of Britain and Ireland.''
	   As the little Belgian village of Mesen waited for the heads of
state to arrive, Irish pipers filled the crisp morning air with
music and local people draped their homes with Britain's the Union
Jack and the green, white and orange tricolor of Ireland.

U.N. withdraws arms inspectors, ``nonessential'' staff from Iraq

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ At least 400 weapons inspectors and other
U.N. staff left Baghdad on Wednesday and the United Nations began
withdrawing ``nonessential'' staff amid preparations for a U.S.
military strike.
	   A convoy of 11 buses and vans carrying more than 100 arms
inspectors and their luggage rolled out of the U.N. Special
Commission's headquarters Wednesday morning. About 300 other U.N.
staff _ apparently humanitarian workers _ departed four hours
later.
	   Many of those leaving hugged U.N. workers _ including Iraqi
staffers _ who remained behind. None of U.N. employees would speak
with reporters as they boarded the gold, pink and blue buses.
	   As the vehicles left, U.N. workers were putting screens up over
the windows of the headquarters _ a move apparently aimed at
preventing glass shattering into the building if there were a
military strike.
	   Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs in Iraq,
told reporters the move was ``precautionary'' and taken ``solely
with the safety of U.N. staff in mind.''
	   ``In view of uncertainties surrounding the current situation and
following instructions from the U.N. headquarters in New York, it
has been decided to temporarily relocate nonessential U.N. staff to
Amman, Jordan,'' Falt said.
	   The United States and Britain have warned that military force
may be used to try to get Baghdad to back down from its decision to
freeze cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
arms inspections.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton met Tuesday with senior Pentagon
officials to explore options for a military attack, and Washington
has stepped up the movement of U.S. ships into the region.
	   Iraq has said it will not cooperate with inspectors until the
U.N. Security Council begins moving to lift an embargo imposed
after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War.
The Security Council maintains the embargo won't be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   The current crises began in August when Iraq said it would not
cooperate with the Special Commission. It let some personnel
continue long-term monitoring, but on Oct. 31 it stopped even that
work.
	   Despite warnings of a military strike by the United States and
Britain, Iraqi officials have said they will not back down from
their decision to bar the inspectors from working. Iraq appeared to
be turning to other Arab states to head off any attack.
	   On Tuesday, Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf
warned that ``any use of military force against Iraq would lead to
destabilizing the region.''
	   The United States and Britain maintain they have backing in the
Middle East for a military strike, but Arab officials have offered
no public support for using force.
	   Jordan's Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh met Wednesday with Saudi
Arabia's Kind Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah and said later the two
countries ``are in agreement that the crisis ... should be solved
diplomatically.''
	   But he added: ``It appears that attempts to defuse the crisis
could be late.''
	   In New York, Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's ambassador to the United
Nations, said Tuesday that ``we have to prepare ourself for a
strike obviously _ this does not mean that we don't encourage
diplomacy.''
	   He said Iraq has kept channels open through U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy, Prakash Shah, but that
``nothing really has moved today.''
	   U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler, interviewed on
American television, urged Iraq to face up to the fact that
disarmament is connected to sanctions.
	   ``The key is in its hands _ and it's called full disclosure to
us,'' he said.
	   Before Wednesday's departures, there were about 120 UNSCOM and
IAEA personnel in the country before the evacuation began. There
were about 450 humanitarian workers.
	   Those pulled out Wednesday included not only all UNSCOM staff
but monitors for the International Atomic Energy Agency and other
U.N. workers who run the oil-for-food program supplying aid to the

Imran Khan testifies some Pakistani cricketers fixed matches
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Former cricket captain Imran Khan told a
judicial inquiry Wednesday that some Pakistani players were
involved in corruption and took bribes to throw the matches.
	   ``I am sure some Pakistani players were involved in the
betting,'' Khan testified.
	   Khan recalled a match played in Sharjah in the United Arab
Emirates in 1989 when several Pakistani players had taken money to
throw the match.
	   To prevent his team losing, Khan said he took all of Pakistan's
previous earnings in the tournament and bet that amount on his team
to win.
	   Khan said he was warned by another form captain Javed Miandad
about his renegade players attempts to throw the match.
	   When he heard, Khan said: ``I was worried. . . it was quite
unusual. . . after careful thinking I finally decided to bet all
the money we had made in the other matches on our team. That is how
we won the match.''
	   Sharjah and Bombay, India are the two big betting centers,
according to Khan.
	   The judicial inquiry, being held in the Punjab capital of
Lahore, is investigating allegations that senior Pakistani players,
including Wasim Akram and Salim Malik, participated in match
fixing.
	   The inquiry stems from allegations made by Australian
cricketers, as well as some of Pakistan's own team members.
	   While he was captain, Khan said Akram was a ``very clean
member'' of the team. But whether that has changed, Khan said ``I
don't know what has happened now.''
	   Khan said his first introduction to match fixing was nearly two
decades ago during a tour of India. Then the Pakistan captain was
Asif Iqbal, who told his Indian counterpart that he had won the
toss without looking at the coin.
	   In cricket the toss of a coin gives the winning captain the
right to decide whether to bat or bowl.
	   Pakistan lost that Test match.
	   During his testimony Khan told the inquiry that corrupt players
should be banned from the game and heavily fined.
	   Khan blamed the problems in cricket on the Pakistan Cricket
Control Board saying the board delayed punitive action against
corrupt cricketers.
	   Also giving testimony was Pakistani batsman Inzamam-ul-Haq, who
said he too had heard stories about match fixing.
	   The inquiry continues Nov. 17.
	   The judicial inquiry will submit its report to the government on
Nov. 30.

Japanese stars beat Major League squad 1-0, tie series at 2-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSAKA, Japan (AP) _ Tetsuro Kawajiri held a team of U.S. Major
League stars to just four hits over 8 1/3 innings Wednesday as
Japan's all-stars won 1-0, evening the two teams' exhibition series
at two games each.
	   Nomar Garciaparra of the Boston Red Sox was thrown out at home
on the game's final play. Devon White of the Arizona Diamondbacks
also was thrown out trying to score in the third inning.
	   Japan scored the game's lone run in the sixth, when Ichiro
Suzuki of the Orix BlueWave hit a sacrifice fly against Curt
Schilling of the Philadelphia Phillies after two walks and a
single.
	   Playing before a capacity crowd of 48,000 at Osaka Dome,
Kawajiri yielded a double to Carlos Delgado of the Toronto Blue
Jays in the first inning, a single to Jason Kendall of the
Pittsburgh Pirates in the seventh, a single to Manny Ramirez of the
Cleveland Indians in the eighth, and a single to pinch hitter Jason
Giambi of the Oakland Athletics in the ninth.
	   After Giambi's single, Kawajiri hit Fernando Vina of the
Milwaukee Brewers with a pitch. With one out, Japan sent in
reliever Akinori Otsuka of the Kintetsu Buffaloes.
	   Garciaparra, running for Giambi, stole third and then tried to
score on Kendall's fly to center, but was thrown out by Hideki
Matsui of the Yomiuri Giants, who hit a two-run homer in Japan's
6-2 victory on Tuesday.
	   Kawajiri, 10-5 with a 2.84 earned run average in the regular
season for the Central League's last-place Hanshin Tigers, was
named the game's Most Valuable Player. Schilling took the loss.
	   Game 5 in the seven-game series is scheduled Thursday, also at
Osaka Dome.
	   The Major Leaguers had opened their Japan visit with three
straight victories _ 4-1 over the Central League's third-place
Yomiuri Giants, and then 8-1 and 10-7 in the first two games of the
all-stars series.

	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ One false start and you're out.
	   That's the new rule adopted by the international swimming

	   The rule, eliminating the one false start, will also be used in
the 25-meter world championships in April in Hong Kong and the
25-meter worlds in Athens in 2000.
	   In previous international events, swimmers were allowed one
false start and were disqualified after two.

India was ready to conduct sixth nuclear test in May
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India was ready to conduct a sixth
nuclear test last May, but pulled back at the last minute on
scientists' advice, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee disclosed
Wednesday.
	   ``We could have conducted the sixth test on May 13,'' Press
Trust of India quoted Vajpayee as telling Indian legislators,
discussing the five earlier underground explosions that reshaped
the global nuclear equation.
	   India carried out three tests of different yields on May 11 at a
test site in the western Thar desert, and followed up with two more
on May 13. India's hostile neighbor Pakistan replied with six tests
later that month.
	   Vajpayee said the decision to cancel the sixth test was taken in
consultation with scientists who said the first five explosions had
provided adequate data, PTI reported.
	   ``We are not testing for the sake of testing,'' Vajpayee was
quoted as saying.
	   The London-based Jane's Defense Weekly had said in June quoting
unnamed defense sources that a third test was abandoned on May 13
partly due to a minor technical hitch but largely for political
reasons.
	   ``The unexploded device has reportedly been recovered from the
site and put into ``safekeeping,'' Jane's reported.
	   The test provoked the United States and several other nations to
slap economic sanctions against New Delhi and Islamabad.
	   The U.S. sanctions were partly lifted only last week after
Washington saw some forward movement in its separate discussions
with the two countries to persuade them to sign the nuclear test
ban treaty.

Israel: Spies weren't working on Turkey's behalf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Trying to dispel persistent rumors, Israel's
Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday that two Israelis arrested in
Cyprus last week as suspected spies were not working for Turkey.
	   The statement did not say who had employed the two.
	   Cypriot police had said they suspected the Israelis were spying
on behalf of Turkey, which invaded Cyprus in 1974 and still
occupies the northern third of the island.
	   But the Israeli statement said Wednesday, ``The two Israelis
that were arrested in Cyprus didn't act against Cyprus and didn't
act on Turkey's behalf.''
	   The arrests have strained relations between Israel and Cyprus,
which has grown increasingly suspicious of Israel's military pact
with Turkey. The Foreign Ministry said it would work to maintain
good relations with the island country.
	   ``The friendly relations between the two countries, expressed
recently by the Israeli president's visit to Cyprus, will continue
and will be tightened,'' the statement said.
	   The Foreign Ministry said it would continue to clarify the
issue.

Greek authorities seeking to weed out hemp products

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Hemp was hot. Business was so good that
one tiny shop quickly blossomed into 15 around Greece.
	   Now a police crackdown threatens to close the stores, which sell
products manufactured from European Union-subsidized industrial
hemp, including clothing, beauty products, shoe polishes, furniture
oils, cough lozenges and building insulation.
	   Store owners appear to be fighting a losing battle to convince
police that industrial hemp, or Cannabis sativa, is a drug-free
cousin of the marijuana plant. It contains only traces of
tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the substance that makes pot smokers
high.
	   ``I don't understand why they are confiscating pants, shoes and
other products,'' said Yuli Kalofolia, owner of the first
Kannabishop in central Athens.
	   In the past two weeks, police have raided more than half the
stores, seized merchandise and charged some of the owners on felony
counts of promoting narcotics use. One store, on the island of
Corfu, apparently was closed Tuesday.
	   ``The stores contain no drug paraphernalia, They are organically
oriented,'' said Yiannis Ganiatsas, who imports merchandise for
Kannabishop. ``They are violating European Union laws allowing the
free movement of goods.''
	   Ganiatsas and others feel the crackdown may be part of an effort
to revamp the image of a police force tarnished by a series of
foul-ups and corruption scandals.
	   But conservative attitudes may also play a role.
	   Although officials as senior as European Affairs Minister George
Papandreou have lobbied for the legalization of such soft drugs as
marijuana, Greece has some of the strictest narcotics laws in the
EU.
	   One recent case involved a State Chemistry Laboratory ban on the
import of Cannabis beer, another product freely sold in much of the
EU. The reason: a marijuana-like odor and a label with the cannabis
leaf, which looks like its illicit cousin.
	   ``It creates an addiction in public opinion and in young people.
A familiarity with the word and symbol that could in the future
lead to a desire for use,'' lab director Ageliki Assimaki told a
local radio station.
	   So far, according to Ganiatsas and others, at least eight
Kannabishop locations have been closed. Some larger chains,
including The Body Shop, have stopped selling hemp products in
Greece.
	   ``The Body Shop is waiting for the final legal viewpoint,'' said
Alex Manos, a spokesman for the London-based chain.
	   ``You'd have to smoke a hemp joint the size of a telephone pole
to get the least buzz and you'd die from carbon monoxide first,''
Body Shop founder Anita Roddick was recently quoted as saying in
defense of the hemp products.
	   Hemp fiber also can be used to make paper and panels as strong
as plywood. The seed can be ground for flour and livestock seed.
	   Peter von Lobenthal, a managing partner in Germany's Hanf Haus,
which sells products to Kannabishop, could not understand why
Greece was cracking down on the stores. His company exports to all
the EU, Asia and the United States.
	   ``This is very strange and a little medieval. The growing of
hemp is subsidized,'' von Lobenthal said.
	   Production is legal in nearly all EU states and its growing is
heavily subsidized by the 15-nation Union. Greece's commerce
ministry not only freely allows its import, but the agriculture
ministry has been considering its introduction as a cash crop.
	   ``European farmers and researchers that are dealing with the
issue say that cannabis will save the planet,'' former Agriculture
Minister Stefanos Tzoumakas said in a recent interview with the
Greek trade magazine KannabiStreet.
	   But it is still illegal to grow in the United States, where
opponents claim it can be used to hide the production of marijuana.
Hemp productions can be imported to the United States.
	   Canada decided to let farmers begin planting hemp this year.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Soldiers fired warning shots and beat
students with sticks Wednesday when they blocked protesters from
marching toward Parliament, where a special assembly discussed how
to reform Indonesia's authoritarian political structure.
	   Witnesses said the violence broke out when a car driven by
students rammed into a group of riot officers on a main
thoroughfare near a group of luxury hotels and foreign embassies in
downtown Jakarta.
	   Five soldiers were hospitalized, a police spokesman said. One
was dragged away by fellow troops unconscious, his face bleeding
profusely.
	   Troops fired shots into the air and lashed out with rattan
canes, injuring several protesters and three local news
photographers.
	   The male driver of the car, a student from the University of
Indonesia, was arrested.
	   In May, deadly riots erupted across Jakarta when military
personnel fatally shot four student protesters. This week, the army
announced that troops had been issued only blank ammunition and
plastic bullets.
	   In a separate incident in South Jakarta, two female students
were hospitalized in serious condition after they were run down by
another vehicle. Privately owned RCTI television quoted witnesses
as saying military personnel were in the car.
	   The violence erupted at the end of a day marred by several major
protests against the People's Consultative Assembly, Indonesia's
highest legislative body.
	   The 1,000-member body is dominated by government appointees and
the military. It has promised to deliver democratic reforms when it
meets this week.
	   But students and leading opposition figures fear it won't fully
dismantle the 32-year-old authoritarian legacy of former President
Suharto, who quit after May's riots.
	   The students want the military out of politics and demand that
Suharto be tried for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   Witnesses said the car that hit the soldiers drove at high speed
toward a group of police and soldiers that had blocked several
thousand students from marching.
	   Frustrated by the security clampdown, the students staged a
sit-in street protest in an elite residential area not far from the
home of the U.S. ambassador and other foreign diplomats. Hundreds
of security personnel looked on as night fell.
	   Additional scores of troops gathered near the presidential
palace and the National Monument about one kilometer (half-mile)
away as a precaution against further trouble.
	   Meanwhile, police and soldiers blocked separate protest marches
near the Parliament as the assembly continued its deliberations.
	   One group of 500 students drove in a convoy of buses to within
about a kilometer (half-mile) of the legislature before heavily
armed soldiers stopped them near the studios of state-owned
television.
	   There were no reports of arrests.
	   The students, many of them wearing yellow university jackets,
waved red and white Indonesian flags and chanted anti-government
slogans. Some held up a banner that read: ``Put Suharto on trial.''
	   Hundreds of local teen-agers joined students and taunted police
with obscene gestures.
	   Other students sang the national anthem outside a nearby hotel
where assembly delegates are staying.
	   Students occupied the Parliament building for days before
Suharto quit in May.
	   This week, however, thousands of troops and police have been
guarding the green-domed legislature. About 30,000 security
personnel have been deployed across the capital to safeguard the
assembly.
	   The assembly is to set a date for parliamentary elections,
probably in May. It is also expected to support new laws to
legalize a large number of new political parties.
	   It is likely to back moves to reduce, but not abolish, the
military's representation in Parliament.
	   Many suspect President B.J. Habibie, once a Suharto protege,
will use this week's meeting to bolster his position. He's expected
to be a candidate for the presidency when the assembly chooses a
head of state late next year.
	   When the assembly's session opened Tuesday, pro- and
anti-government groups clashed and threw rocks at one another in
several areas before being dispersed by security personnel.

Pinochet lawyers warn British court against judging his record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Pinochet's lawyers wrapping up case and CORRECTS
that Argentine citizen, not official, attempted to try Thatcher
this year; trims pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet on Wednesday
wrapped up their bid to free the former Chilean dictator from
arrest, insisting that Britain's State Immunity Act offers
protection so wide-ranging that even Adolf Hitler could not be
tried here.
	   Clive Nicholls told the House of Lords, Britain's highest court,
that the 1978 act was broadly drawn to avoid, for example, former
U.S. President George Bush being charged over bombing Iraq or
British prime ministers over the alleged torture of Irish
Republican Army suspects in Northern Ireland.
	   ``One is not concerned with whether that is right or wrong,''
Nicholls said of the act, under which the High Court last month
quashed Pinochet's arrest on grounds that, as a former foreign head
of state, he has immunity from prosecution in this country.
	   Of Pinochet's claim to immunity, Nicholls said, ``It may be a
matter of grave regret from a moral point of view, but that is a
matter for Parliament to intervene (and change the law).''
	   Pinochet, 82, was arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a
Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite him to face charges of
genocide, murder and kidnapping. He is recuperating from back
surgery and remains in hospital under police guard.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of secret police during Pinochet's
17-year-old rule after he ousted Salvador Allende, an elected
Marxist, in a 1973 military coup.
	   The House of Lords is hearing arguments on an appeal by Spanish
and British prosecutors of the Oct. 28 High Court decision.
	   Pinochet's lawyers contend that putting the former dictator on
trial in a foreign court would be unprecedented and invite
retaliation from Chile.
	   The only previous attempt to try a former head of government in
a foreign court failed this year when Argentine judges said they
had no jurisdiction to put Margaret Thatcher on trial for murder,
the lawyers said.
	   A private Argentine citizen had sought to try the former British
prime minister in the deaths of some 600 sailors drowned when a
British submarine sank the Argentine cruiser Belgrano in the 1982
Falkland Islands war.
	   ``Your act in denying immunity ... would engage a breach of
international law and would expose the United Kingdom to suit by
Chile,'' Clare Montgomery, a lawyer for Pinochet, told the five
judges Wednesday.
	   In addition to pressing for immunity, Ms. Montgomery also noted
that torture did not become an offense in Britain until 1988, when
the country adopted the U.N. Convention on Torture.
	   She said all the alleged victims of Pinochet's regime were
tortured before Britain adopted the act except for one _ a
17-year-old girl who died of electric shock treatment after being
picked up by military police in 1989.
	   The senior of the five judges, Lord Gordon Flynn, interjected
that the court had only to decide whether Pinochet has immunity.
	   ``We are not here to decide whether these quite appalling crimes
_ whether committed _ should be tried by somebody sometime,'' he
said.
	   The appeal hearing was scheduled to continue through Wednesday
and perhaps part of Thursday, with judgment likely next week, court
officials said.
	   Later Wednesday, in a rare move, the judges were scheduled to
hear arguments from an independent expert on international law,
David Lloyd-Jones, designated a ``friend of the court.''
	   Lawyers for the prosecutors have argued that Pinochet's crimes
are so horrific that they are beyond immunity.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fourteen Yugoslav Army border guards
have died this year in more than 100 incidents with neighboring
Albania, said an army official in an interview published Wednesday.
	   Col. Rade Cucak, head of the army's border units, released the
statistics in an interview with the pro-governmet Borba daily.
Cucak blamed neighboring Albania for the violence and its
continuing cross-border support of ethnic Albanian separatist
guerrillas in Kosovo, a southern province of Serbia, a republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Border authorities seized a total of 20 tons of various weapons
and ammunition in some 2,000 recorded illegal crossings, mostly by
arms smugglers supplying the rebels in their fight for
independence, Cucak said.
	   Much more of the smuggling has apparently gone unnoticed as some
violence continues in Kosovo between government troops and Serbian
police, despite a de-facto truce agreed to by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   According to Cucak, the agreement ``is clear to all members to
Yugoslav Army border units,'' but it has not and will not change
their duty of guarding the border.

Chinese banks restrict foreign-currency transfers in crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Chinese state banks have begun blocking
most foreign-currency transfers within the country as part of a
crackdown on illegal money trading, bank officials said Wednesday.
	   China is trying to stop the outflow of capital and shore up
confidence in its currency, the yuan, which doesn't trade
internationally. Chinese individuals and companies have been buying
U.S. dollars out of concern the yuan would be devalued _ something
Chinese leaders have promised repeatedly not to do.
	   Banks are rejecting transfers into personal accounts from
corporations and other personal accounts, the officials said.
Withdrawals over dlrs 10,000 require written approval from
foreign-exchange regulators.
	   ``We are now required to keep a close eye on all hard-currency
transfers, and if the individuals aren't immediate family members,
then it can't be done,'' Ma Limin, a banker with the Shanghai
branch of the Bank of China, told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   Such transactions have all but stopped in the past month after a
surge earlier in the year, Ma said.
	   It wasn't clear whether the rules were imposed nationwide or
only in major cities where illicit foreign-currency trading is on
the rise, or how long they would remain in place.
	   Foreign-exchange regulators have begun making surprise
inspections, Dow Jones Newswires quoted an unidentified senior
currency trader at the Agriculture Bank of China as saying. The
trader said regulators told him they might look into the origin of
every foreign-exchange account in China.
	   Regulators have closed loopholes that allowed companies to
acquire foreign currency illicitly, and have arrested black-market
traders.

Albanian president urges international action in Kosovo

 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani
called on the international community Wednesday to move swiftly to
settle the conflict in Kosovo.
	   Serb forces in February cracked down on ethnic Albanian
separatists fighting for independence for Kosovo, which is 90
percent ethnic Albanian. Several hundred other people, mostly
ethnic Albanians, have been killed since, and as many as 300,000
driven from their homes.
	   The violence has continued past the Oct. 12 agreement by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to sharply reduce his forces.
	   ``While Bosnia is wiping the blood of its victims, another
Bosnian tragedy took place in Kosovo, caused by the failure to
fulfill the legitimate demands of the Albanian people in Kosovo,''
Mejdani told a NATO conference in the Scottish capital.
	   ``The efforts of the international community need to be quickly
materialised, using the appropriate ways and means to find a
solution for today and tomorrow to avoid the further aggravation of
the conflict in Kosovo,'' he said.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Britain's queen and France's president presided
Wednesday over an occasion both grand and poignant _ the last major
anniversary of the Great War likely to include actual veterans of
the carnage.
	   The 80th anniversary of when the guns fell silent _ at the 11th
hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 _ was marked with
all the pomp and ceremony the French are famous for, under a
brilliant blue sky.
	   At the stroke of 11, Queen Elizabeth II arrived at Paris'
grandest military site, Napoleon's Arc de Triomphe.
	   She was greeted by President Jacques Chirac, and together they
walked under the arch to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, where the
queen laid a huge red wreath by the eternal flame, inscribed: ``In
Memory of the Glorious Dead.''
	   The two leaders were introduced to four World War I veterans _
101-year-old Gen. Maurice Bourgeois, a lieutenant at Verdun; Abramo
Pellencin, 102; Guy Cohen, 101, and Georges Rideau, 101.
	   France's oldest survivor from the war _ Raymond Abescat, 107 _
was unable to attend.
	   ``There are good and bad memories,'' an emotional Rideau told
reporters. ``I did my duty. I prefer not to talk about it.''
	   He said it was ``painful'' that today's youth did not seem
interested in the Great War.
	   Bruno Manfrini, an 84-year-old World War II veteran, was the
first to jump to attention when the French national anthem, the
Marseillaise, began to play, saluting with his white-gloved hand,
and weeping at the same time.
	   ``It's a magnificent moment for France to have the queen here on
this occasion,'' Manfrini said.
	   Arlette Huiban, 72, a volunteer nurse in World War II, wore her
own medals and those of her husband, a World War II pilot who was
killed in a wartime accident. ``This is a day to remember everyone
who died in all our wars,'' she said.
	   The Great War was supposed to be quick, and a ``war to end all
wars,'' but of course it wasn't. It was a four-year nightmare of
unimaginable brutality, one that killed millions and changed Europe
forever.
	   Precious few are still alive who fought in World War I. And yet
fascination with the conflict remains, evident in the countless
grainy, black-and-white photos gracing newspaper and magazine
covers in France and Britain as the anniversary approached.
	   After lunch with Chirac, where the president called for better
defense cooperation in Europe, the queen unveiled a statue of Sir
Winston Churchill _ on the Avenue Winston Churchill, just off the
Champs-Elysees. The statue is modeled after a photograph of
Churchill marching down the huge avenue on Nov. 11, 1944, at the
side of Gen. Charles de Gaulle.
	   Saying that Churchill had always loved France, the queen,
speaking in French, noted that ``relations between Churchill and de
Gaulle were not always very easy. But they always knew that Great
Britain and France had a lot in common.''
	   Later in the day, the queen was to travel to Ypres in Belgium,
where she was joining King Albert II in remembering the appalling
losses from a four-year war of attrition against the Germans in the
trenches there.
	   There was one major figure missing from the ceremonies:
Germany's new leader, chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, whose
spokesman said last month that he had informed Chirac he couldn't
attend because his calendar was already full with creating a new
government.
	   On Wednesday, another spokesman, Uwe-Karsten Heye, told German
radio there had been ``no direct invitation,'' and any French
interpretation of the action as a snub was a ``misunderstanding.''
	   The war killed 13 million civilians and 8.5 million fighting
men. Germany lost an estimated 1.7 million soldiers; Britain lost
more than 900,000; Italy 650,000; the United States 116,000. France
was proportionally the hardest hit, with 1.3 million dead.
	   The sheer devastation wrought on France can partly be measured
by the 30,000 or so monuments in cities, towns and villages across
the nation. Some villages list more war dead than their current
populations.

Lawmaker urges nationwide Islamic teaching in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government
should come up with a nationwide concept to introduce Islamic
teaching in schools, a lawmaker of Turkish origin said in an
interview published Wednesday.
	   Cem Oezdemir, quoted in the weekly Die Zeit, criticized a Berlin
court ruling allowing Islamic classes in public schools because it
granted one Islamic group the power to organize the curriculum.
	   The ruling, which overturned a lower court decision, intends to
give Muslim families access to voluntary religious classes in
public schools for their children, as are already available for
Roman Catholics and Protestants.
	   But Oezdemir, a Greens lawmaker, said the Islamic Federation's
close ties to a fundamentalist Islamic group had created the danger
of fundamentalism creeping into the curriculum. The Islamic
Federation represents just 12 of the 70 mosques in Berlin.
	   To counter the trend, the government should propose a nationwide
Islamic teaching plan, said Oezdemir. He called on culture minister
Michael Naumann to lead the effort.
	   ``The federal government and the states should draw up proposals
for Islamic instruction which will avoid the danger of
fundamentalism,'' Oezdemir said.
	   ``The goal must be to develop a `German Islam,''' he said. ``We
need teachers of Islam who have been trained in German universities
and who teach in German.''
	   Germany's new center-left Social Democrat-Greens coalition
government is keen to develop new policies acknowledging the
multiethnic quality of modern Germany. It has proposed relaxing
citizenship laws to make it easier for foreign nationals to become
Germans.

Santer urges Clinton to restore peace in banana war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from WTO; TRIMS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Commission President Jacques
Santer, in a letter released Wednesday, asked U.S. President Bill
Clinton not to impose trade sanctions to punish the European Union
for its banana import regime.
	   In his letter, sent late Tuesday, he warned American sanctions
would violate World Trade Organization rules.
	   ``No WTO member has the right unilaterally to determine whether
another member is in compliance with WTO rules,'' a Commission
statement quoted Santer as saying.
	   Late Tuesday, the United States released a five-page list of EU
exports it plans to slap with extra duties. The list covers a wide
range of products from toys and vacuum-cleaners to French wines,
Nigel Gardner, spokesman for the EU's Trade Commissioner Sir Leon
Brittan said.
	   Sanctions on EU exports would affect 1.3 billion ecu's (dlrs 1.6
billion) worth of EU trade in terms of 1997 EU trade figures,
Gardner said.
	   ``We cannot walk around with this gun of unilateralism pointed
at our head,'' Gardner said.
	   He added the EU will take ``rapid WTO action'' unless the United
States step down from its position.
	   WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero said Washington and the EU
``have responsibility for resolving this difficult question. The
two parties can and must resolve this and the answer to the problem
lies within the rules of the WTO.'' Ruggiero's spokesman, Keith
Rockwell, said in Geneva where the WTO is based.
	   Over the weekend, the United States warned of punitive action if
the 15-nation EU does not change its banana trade system, which
Washington claims unfairly favors imports from former European
colonies.
	   The United States says the EU has not done enough to comply with
a WTO verdict last year against the EU's favorable treatment of a
number of African, Caribbean, and Pacific region countries.
	   The EU argues it approved new import regulations to comply with
WTO demands, but the United States and Central and South American
banana producers claim EU banana imports are still discriminatory.

Nordic countries condemn Iraq's weapons inspection stand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The five Nordic countries on Wednesday
jointly condemned Iraq's refusal to cooperate with U.N. inspectors
searching for weapons of mass destruction and demanded that the
country immediately reverse its position.
	   Hundreds of U.N. weapons inspectors from UNSCOM and other staff
left Baghdad on Wednesday, amid preparations for a possible U.S.
military strike against Iraq. The country has said it will not
cooperate with inspectors until the U.N. Security Council moves to
lift an embargo imposed after the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The foreign ministers of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and
Iceland, gathered in Oslo for a regular meeting of their Nordic
Council, ``condemn, as totally unacceptable, Iraq's decision of
Oct. 31 to stop all cooperation with UNSCOM,'' a joint statement
said.
	   The Nordic ministers said they fully supported a U.N. Security
Council resolution of Nov. 5 demanding that Iraq immediately resume
cooperation with UNSCOM and inspectors from the International
Atomic Energy Agency.
	   The Nordic statement did not say whether the countries supported
possible military action against Iraq. The U.N. resolution, which
the five ministers fully endorsed, warned Iraq of ``severest
consequences'' if it failed to allow inspectors unfettered access
to suspected weapons sites.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Raising new hope for an end to
Cambodia's political stalemate, government and opposition party
chiefs exchanged letters Wednesday on conditions for new
negotiations on forming a coalition government.
	   The Cambodian People's Party of Co-Premier Hun Sen won a slight
majority in a July election, but needs opposition cooperation to
attain the two-thirds vote in parliament necessary to approve a new
government.
	   Opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy,
alleging election fraud and intimidation by Hun Sen, led an exodus
of their lawmakers from Cambodia after the ceremonial convening of
parliament Sept. 24, saying they feared arrest.
	   ``With the views of our two parties now close to each other and
with the willingness of you and your colleagues to return home, we
hope that they will be able to join hands to work, under the
clear-sighted guidance of his majesty the king, for the supreme
interests and progress of our nation and people,'' Hun Sen said in
a letter to Ranariddh. It was also signed by Chea Sim, president of
his party.
	   The letter was responding to one from Ranariddh seeking a
``written clarification'' on issues of security and freedom of
movement that he and his fellow lawmakers would like resolved
before they return home.
	   Hun Sen replied that the prince and his colleagues have enjoyed
``full immunity'' since they were sworn as officially elected
members of parliament on Sept. 24.
	   He added that the government takes full ``responsibility in
guaranteeing security for all politicians, including your highness
(Ranariddh) and your colleagues, physically, legally, during stay
and travel within the kingdom of Cambodia.''
	   Hun Sen agreed to Ranariddh's proposal to make the selection of
the National Assembly's president and a political program for the
new government part of the agenda for a political summit meeting
with King Norodom Sihanouk as host.
	   Hun Sen wrote that a proposed ``principle for joint cooperation
between the Cambodian People's Party and FUNCINPEC'' should also be
included on the agenda.
	   Prior agreement on an agenda will ensure a fruitful summit
meeting, Hun Sen said.
	   Opposition fears of politically motivated arrests have been a
major factor holding up talks on forming a new government.
	   The government had said that opposition lawmakers are free to
travel in and out of the country, except some ``who have a prima
facie case to answer to the court.''
	   On Tuesday, Hun Sen's party rejected giving the presidency of
the National Assembly to Ranariddh's party, a concession it had
sought.
	   FUNCINPEC, in a statement released Wednesday, said that by
turning down its demand for parliament's top position, Hun Sen was
hampering progress toward breaking the current impasse.
	   Sam Rainsy said in a statement Wednesday that ``there would be
no chance of bringing about any form of democracy in Cambodia and
the CPP would continue to monopolize all the powers in a communist
style'' if Hun Sen's party took the top positions in both the
legislative and executive bodies.
	   King Sihanouk, who is scheduled to leave Saturday for medical
treatment in Beijing, has offered to hold a political summit
meeting of the three leaders to try to bring an end to the
stalemate.
	   The opposition leaders have been promoting the idea of having a
summit in Beijing, where the 76-year-old monarch maintains a
residence, so they can talk on an equal footing with Hun Sen.

Former foreign minister faces potential new legal trouble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Former Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, already in
hot water over a multi-million-dollar kickback scheme, could face
new legal trouble relating to his management of the estate of the
sculptor Alberto Giacometti, French media reported Wednesday.
	   French prosecutors have opened an investigation into an auction
of Giacometti paintings and sculptures that Dumas helped organize
in July 1994, according to French radio and the daily Le Parisien.
	   The investigation will focus on possibly shady dealings
involving one bronze statue, the newspaper reported.
	   Asked about the auction in a newspaper interview last April,
Dumas replied: ``There was no dirty trick there.''
	   Giacometti's wife, Annette, died in September 1993, leaving
behind a collection worth more than 700 million francs (dlrs 125
million).
	   In a separate affair, Dumas was placed under formal
investigation last April for ``complicity and receiving embezzled
public funds.''
	   Dumas, now head of one of France's highest legal bodies, the
Constitutional Council, has come under increasing political
pressure to resign after his former mistress, Christine
Deviers-Joncour, published a book last month giving her account of
his involvement in the embezzlement scheme.
	   Investigators say Deviers-Joncour, about 20 years Dumas' junior,
was hired to lobby him to secure the state-owned Thomson company's
1991 contract to build frigates for Taiwan. She allegedly shared
some of a dlrs 12 million commission with Dumas.
	   Dumas, who has denied the accusations, said Tuesday he had no
plans to step down from the Constitutional Council.

Report: Reactor aid group to consider Taiwan's request to join
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ An international consortium funding the
construction of nuclear power reactors in North Korea will consider
Taiwan's request to join, U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was
quoted as saying Wednesday.
	   Taiwan's offer to contribute to the project, part of a deal
aimed at keeping North Korea from developing nuclear weapons, will
be considered at an upcoming meeting by members Japan, South Korea,
the United States and the European Union, Richardson was quoted as
saying by Taiwan's official Central News Agency.
	   China, a partner to the four-party talks on resolving tensions
on the Korean Peninsula, already has voiced strong opposition to
Taiwan joining the consortium, called the Korean Peninsula Energy
Development Organization.
	   Taiwan's top China negotiator discussed the issue with Chinese
officials during a watershed visit to the mainland last month, but
China's Foreign Ministry said KEDO membership should be open only
to sovereign states.
	   China claims Taiwan as a renegade province and, at China's
insistence, none of the KEDO members has diplomatic relations with
Taiwan.
	   Richardson was responding to reporters' questions at the end of
a rare visit to Taiwan by a U.S. Cabinet official.
	   China has repeatedly protested his visit, calling it an
inappropriate contact between the United States and Taiwan, and
warning that it could damage relations between Beijing and
Washington.
	   Richardson is just the third Cabinet official to visit since the
Clinton administration sanctioned such trips in 1994 at the urging
of business groups that claimed they were losing contracts to
European competitors who received more support from their
governments.
	   While here, Richardson attended a joint economic conference, met
President Lee Teng-hui, and lobbied for American business on behalf
of companies such as Boeing and Mobil Oil. He expressed
encouragement over Taiwan's plans to liberalize its petroleum
market and energy sector, and applauded joint efforts on behalf of
cleaner energy.
	   ``I hope that my visit this week has contributed to the
strengthening of the economic and cultural ties between our
people,'' Richardson said in a departure statement.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ American Todd Martin defeated
Australia's hard-serving Wayne Arthurs on Wednesday, 6-4 and 6-3,
to advance to the second round of the dlrs 825,000 Stockholm Open
tennis tournament.
	   In later matches, three of the world's top 11-ranked players
were scheduled to play, including world No.`1 Pete Sampras of the
United States.
	   Arthurs, a 27-year-old doubles specialist from Adelaide, got to
face Martin by upsetting tournament second seed and world No. 7
Karol Kucera of Slovakia the evening before. He started sharp with
three aces in his first game, but the more experienced Martin broke
his serve in game three of each set, and wore him down.
	   Martin's play was business-like. He rarely fell behind in the
count, won the big points including service breaks early in each
set, and never lost his serve.
	   Arthurs, ranked No. 168, notched at least one ace in every
service game except one, and had 15 overall.
	   The tournament is being played on the hard composition court of
the Kungliga Tennis Hall.
	   Martin, ranked No. 21, reached the final in the 1996 Stockholm
Open.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel does not consider itself a player in the
new showdown between the United States and Iraq, officials said
Wednesday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the
crisis with senior Cabinet ministers.
	   However, Israel appeared to be at least indirectly involved. One
report said U.S. President Bill Clinton may have urged Netanyahu to
speed up ratification of the peace accord with the Palestinians in
order to help Washington win Arab support for a strike against
Iraq.
	   Clinton called Netanyahu on Tuesday to discuss the
land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians and the Iraq
situation, U.S. officials said.
	   Implementation of the peace accord was to begin Nov. 2, but
Israel has put it on hold pending Cabinet approval of the
agreement. Netanyahu has postponed several Cabinet sessions on the
subject, but ministers were expected to ratify the deal Wednesday.
	   An Israeli official said the United States let it be known that
its policy of being tough on Iraq was encountering problems in the
Arab world because Israel had not moved forward on its
implementation of the Wye agreement. The official spoke on
condition of anonymity.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Four Pakistani government workers
were convicted Wednesday of espionage and sentenced to 10 years in
jail, a private news agency reported.
	   The four foreign ministry employees were said to have passed on
secret information to Pakistan's arch-rival India, against whom it
has fought three wars, the News Network International reported.
	   The men were arrested in 1989 with documents about Pakistan's
foreign policy and intelligence agencies. They were arrested en

U.N. withdraws arms inspectors, ``non-essential'' staff from Iraq

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ At least 400 weapons inspectors and other
U.N. staff left Baghdad Wednesday as the United Nations began
withdrawing all its ``non-essential'' staff amid preparations for a
U.S. military strike.
	   A convoy of 11 buses and vans carrying more than 100 arms
inspectors and their luggage rolled out of the U.N. Special
Commission's headquarters Wednesday morning. About 300 other U.N.
staff _ apparently humanitarian workers _ departed four hours
later.
	   Many of those leaving hugged U.N. workers _ including Iraqi
staffers _ who remained behind. None of U.N. employees would speak
with reporters as they boarded the gold, pink and blue buses.
	   As the vehicles left, U.N. workers were putting screens up over
the windows of the headquarters _ a move apparently aimed at
preventing glass shattering into the building if there were a
military strike.
	   The U.N. special envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, told reporters in
Baghdad the world body had decided to withdraw its personnel
because of a possible military strike.
	   Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs in Iraq,
specified that the withdrawal concerned all non-essential personnel
and was ``precautionary.''
	   ``In view of uncertainties surrounding the current situation and
following instructions from the U.N. headquarters in New York, it
has been decided to temporarily relocate non-essential U.N. staff
to Amman, Jordan,'' Falt said.
	   The United States and Britain have warned that military force
may be used to try to force Baghdad to back down from its decision
to freeze all cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission in
charge of arms inspections.
	   President Clinton met Tuesday with senior Pentagon officials to
explore options for a military attack, and Washington has stepped
up the movement of U.S. ships into the region.
	   Iraq has said it will not cooperate with inspectors until the
U.N. Security Council begins moving to lift an embargo imposed
after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War.
The Security Council maintains the embargo won't be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Shah said when he discussed the withdrawal with Iraq's deputy
prime minister on Wednesday morning, Tariq Aziz had told him Iraq
officials would not change their position.
	   ``They will not be able to desist from their position unless the
Security Council takes some action in regard to the sanctions on
Iraq,'' Shah said, summing up Aziz's views.
	   Before Wednesday's departures, there were about 120 UNSCOM and
IAEA personnel in the country before the evacuation began. There
were about 450 humanitarian workers.
	   Those pulled out Wednesday included not only all UNSCOM staff
but monitors for the International Atomic Energy Agency and other
U.N. workers who run the oil-for-food program supplying aid to the
Iraqi people.
	   The arms inspectors flew to Bahrain, while others were traveling
aboard five buses on the nine- or ten-hour trip across the desert
to neighboring Jordan.
	   Falt described the step as a ``temporary relocation'' and said
it applies to ``all U.N. staff resident in Baghdad,'' which would
include humanitarian workers.
	   Hans von Sponeck, head of the humanitarian operations who also
is security coordinator for U.N. staff in Baghdad, would be
remaining, Falt said. Jaakko Ylitalo, the acting director of UNSCOM
in Baghdad, was among those seen leaving.
	   In Bahrain, Goran Wallen, chief of the UNSCOM field office
there, said no UNSCOM officials would be left in Iraq. He said 11
inspectors for the IAEA, which monitors Iraq's nuclear weapons
programs, were also coming to Bahrain.
	   The current crises began in August when Iraq said it would not
cooperate with the Special Commission. It allowed some personnel
who do long-term monitoring to continue working, but on Oct. 31 it
stopped even that work.
	   Despite warnings of a military strike by the United States and
Britain, Iraqi officials have said they will not back down from
their decision to bar the inspectors from working. Iraq appeared to
be turning to other Arab states to head off any attack.
	   On Tuesday, Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf,
chose an Arab television station _ Qatar's Al-Jazeera _ for his
first interview on the dispute.
	   Al-Sahhaf warned that ``any use of military force against Iraq
would lead to destabilizing the region.''
	   The United States and Britain maintain they have backing in the
Middle East for a military strike, but Arab officials have offered
no public support for using force.
	   Jordan's Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh met Wednesday with Saudi
Arabia's Kind Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah and said later the two
countries ``are in agreement that the crisis ... should be solved
diplomatically.''
	   But he added: ``It appears that attempts to defuse the crisis
could be late.''
	   In New York, Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's ambassador to the United
Nations, said Tuesday that ``we have to prepare ourself for a
strike obviously _ this does not mean that we don't encourage
diplomacy.''
	   He said Iraq has kept channels open through Shah, but that
``nothing really has moved today.''
	   U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler, interviewed on
American television, urged Iraq to face up to the fact that
disarmament is connected to sanctions.
	   ``The key is in its hands _ and it's called full disclosure to
us,'' he said.

	   And although the vast majority of Spaniards earn less than
20,000 dollars a year, in 1997 they inserted an average of 220
dollars each into slot machines, according to Interior Ministry
figures.
	   The meeting in Barcelona brought together officials from all of
Spain's regions to discuss things like the technical modifications
needed so slot machines accustomed to dealing in pesetas can accept
the European single currency.
	   The officials will also talk about regulatory changes. As it
stands now, regional governments have jurisdiction over most
aspects of gambling in Spain. These rules will have to harmonized
and brought into line with European Union ones in time for the
arrival of the European single currency.
	   For example, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's cabinet approved
an EU-mandated norm under which slot machines must carry a signing
warning that gambling is addictive.
	   Although the euro will be launched on Jan. 1, the new coins and
notes won't actually become available to the public until 2002.

Arab foreign ministers to discuss Iraqi crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ The escalating crisis between Iraq and the
United Nations will top the agenda when the foreign ministers of
eight Arab states meet here late Wednesday, Qatari officials said.
	   The ministers from Egypt, Syria and six Gulf states will also
discuss last month's Middle East peace accord and the
Syrian-Turkish agreement over Kurdish separatists, the officials
said.
	   The two-day conference will be the first meeting of the
so-called Damascus-8 since July 1997. The group, which normally
meets twice a year, canceled a meeting last December after a row
between Egypt and Qatar. Egypt had declined to attend an economic
summit in the Qatari capital, Doha, and Qatar had accused the Cairo
government of complicity in a coup plot.
	   By the Damascus Declaration of 1991, Egypt and Syria pledged to
defend the security of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United
Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and Gulf states promised to give
aid to the Cairo and Damascus governments.
	   The meeting takes place a few days after U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen finished a tour of Egypt and the Gulf states in which
he sounded out their governments on a possible military strike
against Iraq. It also comes hours after the United Nations began
withdrawing all its non-essential personnel from Iraq in
anticipation of an attack.
	   Arabs states have reacted cautiously to the Israeli-Palestinian
accord signed in Washington in which Israel promised to withdraw
troops from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank and the
Palestinians promised to crack down further on extremists. Egypt
stressed that the deal would depend on its fulfillment, and
Palestinian Authority officials have already accused Israel of
seeking to delay its implementation.
	   In an agreement with Turkey last month, Syria pledged to shut
down camps of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, in its territory
and in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of Lebanon. Turkey had
hinted Oct. 6 that it could resort to military action if Syria did
not clamp down on the separatist PKK.
	   Qatari officials said the ministers would also discuss an
Egyptian-Syrian initiative to set up a common Arab market.

Parliament rejects no-confidence vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ Moldova's government survived a vote of
no-confidence Wednesday, despite being blamed for falling living
standards, a weakened currency and a nosedive in the economy.
	   Some 38 Communist lawmakers in this former Soviet republic voted
to dismiss the government and 20 lawmakers opposed it. Fifty-one
votes, more than half the legislators in the 101-seat parliament
were needed to pass the motion. The remaining legislators were
absent.
	   The Communists, who brought the no-confidence vote, have accused
the government led by Prime Minister Ion Ciubuc of delaying
pensions and salaries. The national currency, the leu, has lost
almost half its value in recent months, an indirect result of the
crisis in Russia.
	   Communist leader Vladimir Voronin said he expected the motion to
be defeated because the government enjoys the support of a majority
in parliament.
	   The reformist parties that came to power in March promised to
speed up reforms, but the three-party ruling coalition has failed
to make any progress so far.
	   A member of ruling coalition, Dumitru Diacov, Wednesday said
some ministers may be replaced soon to streamline the government.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ American Todd Martin defeated
Australia's hard-serving Wayne Arthurs on Wednesday, 6-4 and 6-3,
to advance to the second round of the dlrs 825,000 Stockholm Open
tennis tournament.
	   In later matches, three of the world's top 11-ranked players
were scheduled to play, including world No. 1 Pete Sampras.
	   Arthurs, a 27-year-old doubles specialist from Adelaide, got to
face Martin by upsetting tournament second seed and world No. 7
Karol Kucera of Slovakia the evening before. He started sharp with
three aces in his first game, but the more experienced Martin broke
his serve in game three of each set, and wore him down.
	   Martin's play was business-like. He rarely fell behind in the
count, won the big points including service breaks early in each
set, and never lost his serve.
	   Arthurs, ranked No. 168, notched at least one ace in every
service game except one, and had 15 overall.
	   The tournament is being played on the hard composition court of
the Kungliga Tennis Hall.
	   Martin, ranked No. 21, reached the final in the 1996 Stockholm
Open.

Vialli: injured Casiraghi will be back `sooner than expected'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Chelsea striker Pierluigi Casiraghi will be back
``sooner than expected'' after suffering a serious knee injury,
player-manager Gianluca Vialli said Wednesday.
	   Casiraghi underwent surgery Tuesday on the damaged ligaments in
his right knee sustained in a collision with goalkeeper Shaka
Hislop and defender Rio Ferdinand at West Ham on Sunday.
	   Casiraghi faces a second, more major operation in four to six
weeks and is still widely expected to be out for the rest of the
season.
	   But fellow Italian Vialli predicted that Casiraghi would make a
swift recovery.
	   ``Gigi is a very strong lad,'' he said. ``This is not the first
time that he has got injured so I think he knows what he has to
face and he can cope with that. I'm sure that he's going to get
over it very soon, sooner than expected, and will wear a Chelsea
shirt very soon.
	   ``At the moment he's a bit down of course but he's really
looking forward to this operation so he can think about the day
when he will be able to play football again.''
	   With Casiraghi sidelined and Brian Laudrup having left to join
FC Copenhagen, Chelsea's remaining strikers are Gianfranco Zola,
Tore Andre Flo and Vialli.
	   Vialli is now expected to play more often.
	   ``I will try to play the way Gigi was playing and try to be the
target man,'' he said.
	   Despite reports linking Chelsea with Inter Milan's Nigerian
striker Nawankwo Kanu, Vialli dismissed the prospect of immediately
signing a big-name replacement.
	   ``We'll keep playing the same way as before Gigi got injured _
good and successful football _ and then after a while if we think
we need to go back on the market and sign somebody else, maybe on
loan, we'll think about that later,'' he said. `But at the moment
we're sure that we're capable of doing well even without Gigi and
Brian.''

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ If oil prices don't improve, Kuwait will be facing
deficits of over 1.2 billion dinars (dlrs 3.97 billion), the
government said in a report published Wednesday.
	   The preliminary report, published in the in Al-Anba daily, said
this will happen even if the returns of foreign investments were
included in the budget.
	   The report mapped out a plan that would introduce new fees and
cut expenses and government subsidies in order to counter the
growing deficits, unpopular steps that the Parliament has been
resisting so far. Legislators say the government has curb wasteful
expenses, such as weapons purchases, and control graft and theft of
public money before it seeks help from its citizens. The report did
not mention income taxes, although government studies have proposed
them.
	   The net shortfall for this fiscal year is estimated at 1.92
billion dinars (dlrs 6.35 billion), calculated at dlrs 12 a barrel,
which is about a dollar more than what Kuwaiti oil is selling for.
	   According to the report, Kuwaitis and foreigners will have to
pay up to 4 dinars (dlrs 13) to see a doctor at a state hospital.
Kuwaitis will have to pay annual taxes on house maids and drivers
they employ, and exit fees will be raised at airports. Subsidies on
electricity, water and gasoline will be cut, and rents for
state-owned lands would be raised, the report said.
	   The pro-government Al-Anba ran a front-page editorial urging
Kuwaitis to ``take the bitter pill'' and keep in mind it was time
to help their country.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The World Bank has agreed to give Jordan a
dlrs 265 million soft loan next year to help the cash-strapped
country carry on its economic reforms.
	   Planning Minister Nabih Amari said Wednesday the loan was agreed
upon in talks with a World Bank team headed by Kamal Darweesh, an
executive director for the Near East and North Africa Department.
	   He said of the total, dlrs 120 million will be spent on
supporting projects under a 1989 restructuring program, while the
rest will be spent on health care, education and water projects.
	   He declined to provide details on the terms of the loan.
	   The World Bank, which is supervising Jordan's restructuring
program along with the International Monetary Fund, gave Jordan
dlrs 130 million in loans this year.
	   The adjustment program comes to an end next February amid a
downturn in the economy blamed on an unfavorable regional
environment, a faltering Middle East peace process and turmoil in
neighboring Iraq.
	   The government said it will ask the IMF to extend the program by
three years starting in 1999 to meet fiscal and monetary targets
and to push ahead on delayed privatization of state assets to
bolster depleted foreign exchange reserves.
	   The reserves had fallen by dlrs 400 million to dlrs 1.3 billion
in August from a peak dlrs 1.7 billion at the end of 1997. Economic
growth also fell from 2.2 percent in 1996 to 0.8 percent in 1997.
Forecast for this year is lower than 1997.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will honor all the oil contracts it
signed with international firms under the current phase of its
oil-for-food deal with the United Nations, the executive chairman
of the State Oil Marketing Organization said Wednesday.
	   Saddam al-Hassan also said Iraq had so far signed 474 contracts
worth dlrs 261 for the purchase of spare parts for its ailing oil
industry.
	   Al-Hassan, in a statement carried by the official Iraqi News
Agency, said Iraq had exported 262 million barrels of oil until
Nov. 5 and the remaining amounts will be shipped before the end of
the present program on Nov. 25.
	   The United Nations has approved 59 oil contracts for a total of
308,455,000 barrels. Iraq's revenues, al-Hassan said, will be below
the dlrs 4 billion ceiling it originally hoped to achieve.
	   Al-Hassan blamed this on weak oil prices in international
markets and also on a delay in the arrival of spare parts.
	   He said it was certain now that no spare parts will arrive in
Iraq before the end of this phase.
	   The current fourth oil leg allows Iraq to export up to dlrs 5.2
billion. The previous limit was dlrs 2 billion.
	   The oil program bypasses U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq
for invading Kuwait in 1990 to allow the government obtain food,
medicine and other urgent needs for its 22 million people.
 &UR; ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Solidere, the dlrs 1 billion company in
charge of rebuilding Beirut's war-wrecked commercial district, has
seen profits drop by 84 percent in the first half of this year,
newspapers said Wednesday.
	   The company's balance sheet for the first six months of 1998
showed that Solidere profits fell to dlrs 2.02 million from dlrs
12.4 million in the corresponding period last year.
	   Revenues dropped from dlrs 22.8 million to dlrs 11.2 million,
while final sale contracts fell from dlrs 22.2 million to dlrs 6.6
million, the Daily Star and others said.
	   The English-language daily said Solidere officials were
unperturbed by the unprecedented slide in profits.
	   Revenues from dlrs 168.5 million worth of land sales and other
deals which have not yet been recorded on the company's accounts
were expected to redress Solidere's balance sheet by the end of the
year, the company said.
	   Solidere in 1997 posted a net profit of dlrs 77.8 million, a 32
percent increase over the 1996 figure of 58.2 million.
	   Solidere, the French acronym for Lebanese Company for
Development and Reconstruction of Beirut Central District, is
entrusted with rebuilding an area that covers 1.6 million square
meters (400 acres) in downtown Beirut.
	   Reconstruction is to be completed in three phases by 2018.

Fourteen guards dead in border incidents this year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to correct to ethnic Albanians in penultimate graf

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fourteen Yugoslav Army border guards
have died this year in more than 100 incidents with neighboring
Albania, said an army official in an interview published Wednesday.
	   Col. Rade Cucak, head of the army's border units, released the
statistics in an interview with the pro-governmet Borba daily.
Cucak blamed neighboring Albania for the violence and its
continuing cross-border support of ethnic Albanian separatist
guerrillas in Kosovo, a southern province of Serbia, a republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Border authorities seized a total of 20 tons of various weapons
and ammunition in some 2,000 recorded illegal crossings, mostly by
arms smugglers supplying the rebels in their fight for
independence, Cucak said.
	   Much more of the smuggling has apparently gone unnoticed as some
violence continues in Kosovo between ethnic Albanians and Serbian
police, despite a de-facto truce agreed to by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   According to Cucak, the agreement ``is clear to all members to
Yugoslav Army border units,'' but it has not and will not change
their duty of guarding the border.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The planned expansion of Bangkok's
bustling Don Muang international airport next year has been delayed
because of bidding and scheduling problems, an airport official
said Wednesday.
	   Phojana Simasathien, deputy managing director of the Airport
Authority of Thailand, confirmed local news reports that the 4
billion baht (dlrs 111 million) project will not be completed until
at least 2001 because of bickering between potential contractors
and the airport.
	   The Bangkok Post, quoting AAT Director General Niphon Sakornyen,
reported Wednesday that the airport agency was unable to find a
construction company that could guarantee credit for the full cost
of the project.
	   Contractors protested the tough terms and the airport authority
recently relented by dropping the credit guarantee to 1 billion
baht (dlrs 28 million), the Post reported, adding that more than 50
contractors have already registered new bids for the project.
	   Phojana downplayed the effects of the bidding problems, saying
the delay was also caused by efforts to schedule the construction
so that it doesn't interfere with the normal flow of passengers and
aircraft.
	   Many planes currently disembark their passengers into shuttle
buses parked on Don Muang's tarmac rather than at gates as air
traffic increases at the airport.
	   Phojana said the planned construction of a new wing would
increase the number of gates at the airport by 25 percent.
	   The delay in construction comes during a regional economic
crisis that hit with particular severity in Thailand. The Thai
currency, formerly pegged to the U.S. dollar, lost more than half
its value during the crisis before making a partial recovery in
recent months.

Ethnic Albanian sentenced to prison term
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An ethnic Albanian, who joined the
rebels fighting for independence of Kosovo from Serbia, was
sentenced Wednesday to two years in prison, the official Tanjug
news agency reported.
	   The district court in Pec, some 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of
Pristina, said that Bujar Goranci, 36, joined the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army last May. As a KLA fighter, Goranci dug trenches
and kept guard in front of a border village to prevent Serb police
from entering, Tanjug said.
	   Dozens of ethnic Albanians have been sentenced on similar
charges. Hundreds are still awaiting trial.

Afghan opposition says Taliban attacked northern province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's northern-based
opposition said Wednesday that the Taliban religious army launched
a punishing offensive in northern Takhar province.
	   Fighter jets belonging to the Taliban army pounded opposition
positions in two districts of Takhar province, 250 kilometers (150
miles) north of the beleaguered Afghan capital, said an opposition
spokesman, who identified himself only as Arif.
	   ``The fighter planes of Taliban are bombing our positions and
intense fighting is going on at Dasht-i-Archi and Bangi
(districts),'' he said.
	   They did not immediately report casualties or whether any ground
was won or lost by either side in Afghanistan's protracted
conflict.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Taliban militia.
	   Until this week the Taliban and their opposition, led by former
military chief Ahmed Shah Massood, had been observing a cease-fire
and were promising to exchange prisoners.
	   The prisoner exchange was expected to go ahead.
	   The cease-fire was brokered by Said Jalal, a close aide of Saudi
Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah and apparently acceptable to both
sides in the civil war that has ravaged this central Asian state.
	   The Taliban, or the students of Islam, control 90 percent of
Afghanistan, including Kabul.
	   They follow a harsh version of Islam that bars women from work
and education, forces men to wear beards and bans all light
entertainment including music.
	   The Taliban are Sunni Muslims and mostly Pashtuns _ the majority
ethnic group of Afghanistan.
	   The opposition, which hold only 10 percent of the country,
comprise mostly of religious and ethnic minorities, including
Shiites, Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras.

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ The head of Bulgaria's state TV has
resigned, stressing the need for new people to head the station
which is facing layoffs and partial privatization, officials said
Wednesday.
	   The National Council on Radio and TV, an independent panel
supervising state media, accepted the resignation of Ivan
Popyordanov late Tuesday.
	   A substitute to Yordanov would be appointed no earlier than
January, said Aleksandar Tomov, head of the Council. Till then the
TV would be run by Yordanov's deputies.
	   State TV has to lay off a still unspecified part of its 3,000
staff due to cuts in government subsidies.. One of the TV's two
programs is slated for sale.

Primakov pledges to pay wages without printing new money
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Lebed predicting hunger, others disagreeing in
new grafs 9-11, CLARIFIES that Primakov proposing ban on importing
raw alcohol, not all alcohol in 16th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Wednesday said
his government is trying to keep a tight lid on spending and
wouldn't print large sums of money to pay debts.
	   ``We guarantee payments of current wages,'' he said at a meeting
with lawmakers. ``We can and will do that without printing new
money.''
	   ``We have hardly printed any money so far, but we have huge
debts,'' Primakov said without elaboration.
	   Primakov acknowledged that the government is short of funds to
pay off all pensions and social subsidies for families with
children.
	   At the same time, Primakov indicated that the government may
print up to 25 billion rubles (dlrs 1.7 billion), saying that
wouldn't fuel high inflation.
	   Primakov claimed the International Monetary Fund wouldn't oppose
money printing as long as it didn't exceed that amount. When other
Russian officials made similar claims in recent weeks, the IMF
denied that, saying it's against issuing new money that could stoke
high inflation.
	   The government received some good news Wednesday when the State
Statistics Committee announced that inflation in October was 4.5
percent, dropping sharply from 38.4 percent in September.
	   Prices gyrated wildly shortly after Russia's latest economic
troubles hit in August _ when the government devalued the ruble and
defaulted on some debts _ but have been relatively stable in recent
weeks.
	   Despite some overall stabilization, however, many are predicting
that the crisis will bring food and energy shortages this winter.
``We are facing a cold and hungry winter,'' Alexander Lebed,
governor of the vast Krasnoyarsk province and a leading
presidential hopeful, said Wednesday.
	   Fearing that the poor grain harvest and higher prices on imports
may lead to food shortages, the government has signed a dlrs 625
million agreement with the United States for food aid. It's working
on a similar deal with the European Union.
	   Arkady Zlochevsky, chairman of the non-government Russian Grain
Union, on Wednesday dismissed predictions of food shortages, saying
the actual grain harvest was higher than the official figure
because grain producers deliberately under-report output so they
can illegally sell the leftovers, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Officials have acknowledged that the government might be forced
to print more money to cover a large budget deficit if the IMF and
other lenders don't release more aid.
	   The IMF arranged a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package to Russia last
summer, but it froze disbursements following the August economic
meltdown.
	   With no foreign loans likely in the near future, Primakov's
government is facing a tough task of boosting tax collection and
other domestic revenues.
	   Primakov said the government plans to introduce criminal
punishment for tax evasion in addition to fines, and wants to ban
imports of raw alcohol as part of an effort to eradicate illegal
booze production.
	   He also spoke of stronger state controls to stem capital flight
abroad.
	   ``We will uproot swindlers who leave their capital in foreign
bank accounts,'' Primakov said.
	   In other economic news Wednesday, Russian crude oil exports rose
9.9 percent in the first nine months of the year, but lower world
oil prices caused revenues to plummet by 28 percent compared with
the same period last year, according to the government statistics.
Oil is one of the country's leading exports.

Israel says it wants to stay out of Iraq crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iraq-UN &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel does not consider itself a player in the
latest showdown between the United States and Iraq, officials said
Wednesday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the
crisis with senior Cabinet ministers.
	   However, Israel appears to be at least indirectly involved. One
report said U.S. President Bill Clinton may have urged Netanyahu to
speed up ratification of the peace accord with the Palestinians in
order to help Washington win Arab support for a strike against
Iraq.
	   Clinton called Netanyahu on Tuesday to discuss the
land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians and the Iraq
situation, U.S. officials said.
	   Israel was to have started implementing the peace accord on Nov.
2 but has delayed action hold pending Cabinet approval of the
agreement. Netanyahu has postponed several Cabinet sessions on the
subject, but ministers were expected to ratify the deal Wednesday.
	   An Israeli official said the United States let it be known that
its policy of playing tough with Iraq was encountering resistance
in Arab countries because Israel had delayed implementation of the
Wye peace accord. The official spoke to The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity.
	   The Haaretz daily said there was speculation that Clinton made
such a point in his phone call Tuesday to Netanyahu.
	   Netanyahu met Wednesday with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon to discuss the current tensions
over Iraq.
	   ``We are not a part of this conflict, except as members of the
United Nations,'' a Foreign Ministry official said after the
meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``And right now, the
issue is between the United States and Iraq.''
	   In the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel in
hopes of breaking up the Arab coalition against Baghdad. However,
Israel did not retaliate, and the coalition held.
	   In a subsequent U.S.-Iraq crisis in February, Iraq did not make
any attempt to draw Israel into the dispute.
	   Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad Anani, meanwhile, arranged to
meet with Sharon and Netanyahu Wednesday afternoon, apparently to
discuss the latest developments in Iraq.
	   The United Nations has ordered most of its weapons inspectors to
leave Iraq and travel to neighboring Jordan.

Anwar's wife plans to meet with Indonesian, Philippine presidents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Trial &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The wife of former Malaysian
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Wednesday she plans to
meet the Indonesian and Philippine presidents next week in Kuala
Lumpur.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, told The Associated Press both
leaders had expressed a wish to see her to discuss her husband's
case.
	   When asked which leaders she plans to meet, Azizah said: ``Mr.
and Mrs. Habibie and Estrada.'' She was referring to the Indonesian
first couple and Philippine President Joseph Estrada.
	   There was no immediate confirmation from the governments in
Jakarta or Manila.
	   But on Tuesday, Estrada said in Manila that he looked forward to
meeting Azizah, adding: ``At least, I'll know from her what is
really happening with her husband.''
	   President B.J. Habibie and Estrada will be in Kuala Lumpur for a
Pacific Rim summit next week.
	   International leaders expressed outrage when Anwar was arrested
Sept. 20 and soon afterward appeared in court with a black eye that
he said came from severe police beatings. Anwar said the events
were politically motivated.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said that as a result, they would not meet their Malaysian
counterpart, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, during the upcoming
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit Nov. 17-18.
	   Estrada and Habibie initially had threatened to boycott the
meeting. They later said they would attend and hoped to meet with
Anwar's wife. Both are close friends of Anwar from his time in
government.
	   ``I understand that Mr. Estrada is open to seeing me and I am
very happy,'' Azizah told the AP after the eighth day of her
husband's trial on corruption and sexual misconduct charges had
adjourned. The trial will be in recess during the APEC summit.
	   Asked if she was aware that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright intended to raise the Anwar issue during APEC meetings,
Azizah replied, ``I am aware of it and I am honored.''
	   Southeast Asian nations in the past have adhered to a policy of
not interfering in each other's politics. The recent exchange
across borders prompted Malaysia's leaders to say they hoped the
policy would remain intact during the APEC summit.
	   Azizah said the summit was the perfect opportunity to discuss
her husband's case.
	   ``We live in a global society,'' said Azizah. ``If you speak
about justice, universal values and human rights, that's not
interference.''

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Soldiers fired warning shots and beat
students with sticks Wednesday when they blocked protesters from
marching toward Parliament, where a special assembly discussed how
to reform Indonesia's authoritarian political structure.
	   Witnesses said the violence broke out when a car driven by
students rammed into a group of riot officers on a main
thoroughfare near a group of luxury hotels and foreign embassies in
downtown Jakarta.
	   Nine soldiers were hospitalized, state-run television reported.
One was dragged away by fellow troops unconscious, his face
bleeding profusely.
	   Troops fired shots into the air and lashed out with rattan
canes, injuring several protesters and three local news
photographers.
	   The male driver of the car, a student from the University of
Indonesia, was arrested.
	   In May, deadly riots erupted across Jakarta when military
personnel fatally shot four student protesters. This week, the army
announced that troops had been issued only blank ammunition and
plastic bullets.
	   In a separate incident in South Jakarta, two female students
were hospitalized in serious condition after they were run down by
another vehicle. Privately owned RCTI television quoted witnesses
as saying military personnel were in the car.
	   The violence erupted at the end of a day marred by several major
protests against the People's Consultative Assembly, Indonesia's
highest legislative body.
	   The 1,000-member body is dominated by government appointees and
the military. It has promised to deliver democratic reforms when it
meets this week.
	   But students and leading opposition figures fear it won't fully
dismantle the 32-year-old authoritarian legacy of former President
Suharto, who quit after May's riots.
	   The students want the military out of politics and demand that
Suharto be tried for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   Witnesses said the car that hit the soldiers drove at high speed
toward a group of police and soldiers that had blocked several
thousand students from marching.
	   Frustrated by the security clampdown, the students staged a
sit-in street protest in an elite residential area not far from the
home of the U.S. ambassador and other foreign diplomats. Hundreds
of security personnel looked on as night fell. The students later
dispersed.
	   Additional scores of troops gathered near the presidential
palace and the National Monument about one kilometer (half-mile)
away as a precaution against further trouble.
	   Meanwhile, police and soldiers blocked separate protest marches
near the Parliament as the assembly continued its deliberations.
	   One group of 500 students drove in a convoy of buses to within
about a kilometer (half-mile) of the legislature before heavily
armed soldiers stopped them near the studios of state-owned
television.
	   There were no reports of arrests.
	   The students, many of them wearing yellow university jackets,
waved red and white Indonesian flags and chanted anti-government
slogans. Some held up a banner that read: ``Put Suharto on trial.''
	   Hundreds of local teen-agers joined students and taunted police
with obscene gestures.
	   Other students sang the national anthem outside a nearby hotel
where assembly delegates are staying.
	   Students occupied the Parliament building for days before
Suharto quit in May.
	   This week, however, thousands of troops and police have been
guarding the green-domed legislature. About 30,000 security
personnel have been deployed across the capital to safeguard the
assembly.
	   The assembly is to set a date for parliamentary elections,
probably in May. It is also expected to support new laws to
legalize a large number of new political parties.
	   It is likely to back moves to reduce, but not abolish, the
military's representation in Parliament.
	   Many suspect President B.J. Habibie, once a Suharto protege,
will use this week's meeting to bolster his position. He's expected
to be a candidate for the presidency when the assembly chooses a
head of state late next year.
	   When the assembly's session opened Tuesday, pro- and
anti-government groups clashed and threw rocks at one another in
several areas before being dispersed by security personnel.

Government trying to address power shortage
</HEADLINE>

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam plans to spend dlrs 1 billion to
dlrs 1.2 billion annually in the years 2001-2005 to meet its
growing electricity needs, Industry Minister Dang Vu Chu said
Wednesday.
	   The country already has six projects in the pipeline that will
add 1,250 megawatts to the national power grid by 2000, Chu told
the National Assembly in response to written questions from
legislators.
	   Several will use thermal energy to reduce from 67 percent to
less than 50 percent the amount of power that is generated by
hydroelectric plants.
	   ``This will increase stability of the power grid, since
hydroelectric plants are dependent on rainfall,'' Chu said.
	   Vietnam, chronically short of electricity, is particularly
susceptible to outages during the annual dry season, when water
levels plunge in the reservoirs and rivers that feed the
hydroelectric plants.
	   Electrical service reaches only 61.9 percent of the households
in the countryside, where 80 percent of the population lives, Chu
said.
	   Demand is expected to continue to grow as more people gain
access to the grid and continue to add electrical appliances to
their households. Industrial growth also will drain the system.
	   Chu said demand is expected to grow by 13 to 15 percent annually
in 2001-2005.
	   Finance Minister Nguyen Sinh Hung told the National Assembly _
televised nationally for the first time since the opening session
Oct. 28 _ that the national debt is within an acceptable percentage
of gross domestic product.
	   He did not specify a figure, but said dlrs 221.4 million in
principal and dlrs 153.5 million in interest were paid last year to

	   Government operating expenses have fallen this year, Hung said.
They had been considerably higher in 1997 because of costs
associated with the establishment of eight new provinces.
	   Hung also said the government will spend 36 billion dong (dlrs
2.6 million) for the care of children next year, including 27
billion dong (dlrs 1.9 million) for programs to fight malnutrition.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A 104-year-old Senegalese man who fought for France
in World War I was awaiting a day of glory Wednesday: he was going
to be awarded the French Legion of Honor, coinciding with the war's
80th anniversary.
	   But Abdoulaye Ndiaye died on Tuesday, in his village of Thiowor
in Senegal, French media reported.
	   He was the last surviving member of a Senegalese battalion that
distinguished itself with its courage during the Great War.
	   More than 600,000 men from France's former colonies in Africa
were enlisted to help France fight the war.
	   The Le Monde daily, which had just interviewed Ndiaye, wrote in
an editorial of France's debt to him and others like him.
	   ``France owes a debt to Africa, to Ndiaye's children and
grandchildren, in Senegal, but also to his children here in
France,'' the newspaper said.
	   ``Europe must not re-create itself by shutting the rest of the
world out, nor by forgetting what it owes to the world.''

Cathay Pacific shares soar on possible deal with Philippine
</HEADLINE>
Airlines &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Shares of Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay
Pacific Airways jumped nearly 8 percent Wednesday on news it is
close to a deal that would bail out ailing Philippine Airlines,
presumably placing Cathay in control of PAL.
	   Analysts were puzzled by the rally, saying too many questions
remained unanswered.
	   The deal is by no means done. And even if it works, it remains
unclear how much Cathay is planning to invest, what size stake it
would get and what would happen to PAL's U.S. dlrs 2.1 billion in
unpaid debts.
	   ``The big question is what happens to the debt,'' said Raymond
Chong of Yamaichi International (Hong Kong) Ltd.
	   Investors seemed untroubled by any such questions. They pushed
Cathay Pacific up by 7.69 percent to 7.70 Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 1) per share.
	   PAL stopped flying on Sept. 23 in a labor dispute but resumed
operations last month.
	   Philippine Finance Minister Edgardo Espiritu said early
Wednesday that Cathay would have to pump in 4 billion pesos (U.S.
dlrs 98 million) of the estimated 6 billion pesos (U.S. dlrs 147
million) necessary to revive PAL.
	   PAL management ``may have to raise the remaining 2 billion pesos
(U.S. dlrs 49 million),'' Espiritu said in an interview on
Philippine radio.
	   Cathay Pacific would not confirm the Philippine government
figures, saying it needed to conduct a careful review of the
situation at PAL, which might take several weeks, before a detailed
proposal could be made.
	   The Philippine government has repeatedly said it was ready to
give up its stake in PAL and would not infuse any additional
capital if a new investor comes in.
	   Although taking over the debt-ridden airline was not likely to
boost Cathay's short-term income, the deal could ``help Cathay
expand its business in Asia,'' said Patrick Yiu of Kingsway
Securities.
	   Late Tuesday, Cathay Pacific announced that PAL management _
with which Cathay was negotiating directly _ had accepted a
conditional offer, though specific terms of the deal haven't been
finalized.
	   Cathay has said it wants management control of the Philippine
flag carrier. It could buy up to 40 percent of the airline under
Philippine law, but it has reportedly been trying find a way to get
in control.

Asia crisis good experience for world trade job, Supachai says

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Thailand's deputy prime minister said Wednesday
that dealing with the Asian economic crisis has provided valuable
experience in his bid to lead the World Trade Organization.
	   Supachai Panitchpakdi told reporters the trade watchdog's leader
should be ``more dynamic and more involved'' in its activities
although members should have the final say.
	   The new director-general should combine private and public
sector experience, knowledge of developed and developing countries
and of the ``process of boom and bust,'' he added.
	   Supachai, 52, is also Thailand's commerce minister and is a
former president of the Thai Military Bank.
	   More clarity is needed on the proceedings for complying with WTO
rulings, he said. ``We have to work on that ... to see how we can
make it work out more satisfactorily.''
	   The organization needs as wide a membership as possible for
forthcoming trade negotiations, possibly considering transitional
arrangements, he added. Some 30 countries have applications under
consideration.
	   Supachai was the second candidate for the post to face trade
delegates in Geneva this week as the process of choosing a
successor to Italy's Renato Ruggiero, who will step down by the end
of April, gets underway.
	   The contest will be decided by consensus rather than a vote and
the WTO general council hopes to confirm the appointment by the end
of this year.
	   Also running are former Moroccan trade minister Hassan Abouyoub,
Michael Moore, former prime minister of New Zealand, and former
Canadian trade minister Roy Maclaren.

Paris Club to meet in Uganda, first time in Third World
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The Consultative Group of the Paris Club
of donor nations will meet in Uganda next month to discuss the East
African nations' financial needs, a World Bank official said
Wednesday.
	   The one-week meeting beginning Dec. 7 will mark the first time
the club, which is comprised of developed nations, will meet in a
Third World country, said Agnes Birinobwa, a spokeswoman for the
World Bank in Uganda.
	   The Consultative Group chose Kampala as a venue to discuss the
country's financial needs for development in order to involve as
many interested parties as possible, she said.
	   ``The participants will include Ugandan officials, the World
Bank, donor agencies, representatives of the civil society and all
stockholders,'' Birinobwa said.
	   Normally, the Consultative Group involves representatives of the
donor and borrowing nations, and multilateral lenders, including
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

Journalists protest over beatings by troops in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of journalists protested
Wednesday after troops and police beat three Indonesian news
photographers covering a student demonstration.
	   The journalists rallied briefly at a sitting of a special
session of the People's Consultative Assembly at the national
Parliament building.
	   The 1,000-member assembly is currently the focus of protesting
students, who fear it won't deliver on promises to introduce
sweeping democratic reforms.
	   The journalists threatened to boycott coverage of the session
unless the military and the government apologize for the violence
and promise to protect members of news organizations.
	   Violence erupted late Wednesday in downtown Jakarta after a
group of students rammed a car into a cordon of riot police.
	   Security officers retaliated with warning shots and a baton
charge.
	   ``I saw one female student trampled on the head by a soldier.
Then suddenly they beat me, though I told them I was a newsman,''
said Saptono, a photographer with the official Antara news agency.
	   He was hospitalized with a broken leg and a hand injury.

Niklas Luhmann, German sociologist, dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIELEFELD, Germany (AP) _ Niklas Luhmann, a well-known German
sociologist who also taught in the United States, has died after a
long illness, the local university said Wednesday. He was 71.
	   Luhmann, born on Dec. 8, 1927 in Lueneburg in northern Germany,
died at home on Friday in Oerlinghausen, near Bielefeld. The delay
in the announcement was made at the request of his family,
Bielefeld University said. No exact cause of death was announced.
	   Appointed to the chair of sociology at Bielefeld in 1968,
Luhmann taught at many other universities during his career,
including Frankfurt, the New School for Social Research in New York
and Northwestern University in Chicago.
	   Luhmann's interest in the functioning of societies was explored
in 40 books and 250 essays, many of them translated into foreign
languages.
	   He summarized his theory in a 1984 book stating that societies
were living organisms defined by the way people communicated within
them.
	   He explored the model in books dealing with topics such as
trust, power, religion, education and love.
	   Luhmann was controversial in academic circles. His works formed
the basis of a theoretical dispute with German philosopher Juergen
Habermas and the so-called Frankfurt School for much of the 1970s.
	   Luhmann is survived by three children, Joerg, Veronika and
Clemens. Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

Police in northern Thailand make big heroin bust
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police said Wednesday they have
made their biggest heroin seizure this year in the northern
province of Phrae, arresting a man allegedly carrying 44.5
kilograms (98 pounds) of the drug.
	   Peng Phimphisarn was arrested Tuesday when police stopped and
searched his pickup truck, said Prakob Panyawansiri, director of
the Northern Narcotics Control Office.
	   Peng told police that he had been hired to transport the drug
from Chiang Rai, Thailand's northernmost province, to Bangkok. He
would not say who hired him, Prakob said.
	   Conviction on a charge of trafficking in heroin can result in a
life sentence or the death penalty. Northern Thailand is part of
the infamous Golden Triangle region where the borders of Thailand,
Laos and Myanmar _ also called Burma _ meet. The area is one of the
world's major producers of opium and its derivative, heroin.

Solution to the Kosovo crisis needs international cooperation,
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Balkan nations do not have enough
strength on their own to solve the Kosovo crisis, so an
international cooperation is vital, Bulgarian Premier Ivan Kostov
said Wednesday.
	   ``We, the neighboring countries, must have a fire extinguisher
in our hands when dealing with the Yugoslav issues,'' Kostov told
reporters after talks with his Hungarian counterpart, Viktor Orban.
	   Kostov said the breakup of the Yugoslav Federation created a bad
image of the Balkans abroad and the region has suffered from this
for too long.
	   ``We hope a peaceful and lasting solution will be found to the
(Kosovo) crisis, with a strong international pressure on
Milosevic,'' he said.
	   ``There is a realistic danger that, unless this crisis is
solved, the Balkans would be even further divided,'' Orban said.
	   During discussions, the two premiers agreed to intensify
bilateral relations, the first step of which was the overwhelming
majority of votes in the Hungarian Parliament Monday to allow
Bulgaria to become member of the Central European Free Trade
Agreement (CEFTA).
	   Kostov said Bulgaria conducts a very rigorous fiscal policy,
pointing out that without this they couldn't have pressed down the
670 percent hyperinflation rate in 1996 to a current 2.6 percent,
and a 300 percent interest rate to 5 percent.
	   Bulgaria hopes to begin European Union admission negotiations by
the year 2001, and Kostov noted that entering CEFTA is good
training for future EU membership.
	   Bilateral trade between Hungary and Bulgaria has increased by 25
percent this year, and a further solid growth is expected, Orban
said.

Government preparing tax holiday for investors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian government is preparing
to offer a tax holiday for investors in refinery projects,
especially outside the main island of Java, a senior official said
Wednesday.
	   ``Indonesia wants to encourage foreign investors, particularly
those from the Middle East countries, to develop refineries in
Indonesia,'' Minister of Investment Hamzah Haz said after a meeting
with President B.J. Habibie.
	   He said the plan, expected to be finalized by the end of this
month, will provide tax reductions for 10 to 12 years.
	   Hamzah said 16 investors from the Middle East have expressed
interest so far but only one, from Kuwait, has declared a serious
intent, to develop a refinery on Selayar Island in southeastern
Sulawesi.
	   He quoted the Kuwaiti investor as saying the prices of his
refinery's products could be 30 percent lower than those of
Indonesia's state-owned Pertamina oil company.
	   Hamzah said he has agreed to review monopoly rights given to
Pertamina to sell fuel in the country.

Survey shows ruling African National Party losing support among
</HEADLINE>
South Africans

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Support for the governing
African National Congress has dropped to an all-time low since it
won elections in 1994 that ended white minority rule, an opinion
poll released Wednesday said.
	   The most comprehensive independent survey so far in the lead-up
to 1999 elections also showed that apartheid's ruling group, the
National Party, has lost many of its former backers.
	   If the elections were held tomorrow, only 51 percent would vote
for the ANC, down from 64 percent in 1995, the poll found. The
National Party would claim 10 percent of the vote, down from 16
percent shortly after the election.
	   The tiny Democratic Party was the only party to show a gain,
going from 1 percent in 1994 to 7 percent.
	   Undecideds rose from 12 percent to 21 percent.
	   The poll, which queried 2,200 eligible voters, was conducted in
September by Markinor research group with the backing of the
nation's public broadcaster, SABC, and the Institute for Democracy
in South Africa.
	   The pollsters cited a margin of error between 0.95 percent and
2.1 percent.
	   The ANC aims to increase its majority in Parliament to
two-thirds in 1999, up from the 60 percent it now holds.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.S. diplomat leading an effort
to carry out a peace deal in Kosovo declared Wednesday that the
mission may be the last chance to avert more violence in the
restive province.
	   The diplomat, William Walker traveled the Pristina, the
provincial capital to plan the startup of the mission of 2,000
verifiers appointed by Europe's security and human rights watchdog.
	   Walker said he was hopeful that inspectors from the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe can create a climate for the
people of Kosovo ``to choose the way of moderation, the way of
sanity, the way of peaceful resolution.''
	   Serb forces in February launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists fighting for independence for Kosovo, which is 90
percent ethnic Albanian. Hundreds have died. As many as 300,000
have been driven from their homes in the province in southern
Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Violence continues despite an Oct. 12 peace deal, in which
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to sharply reduce his
forces. Several incidents have been reported since then. Both sides
claim self-defense.
	   Three Serb policemen were wounded Tuesday night in Glogovac, 20
miles (30 kilometers) west of Pristina, when ethnic Albanians
attacked a police station, the pro-government Serbian Media Center
in Pristina reported.
	   NATO expressed concern about the surge in violence in Kosovo and
condemned the increasing number of incidents, alliance officials
said Wednesday.
	   While the situation on the ground is better than it was prior to
the agreement, alliance officials speaking on condition of
anonymity said they are worried that tit-for-tat attacks could
rekindle the fighting that originally broke out in February.
	   Unwilling to blame either side, one NATO official said Serb
special police forces maintain a heavy presence in some sensitive
areas of the province and that it was clear the KLA has been trying
to exploit the situation and making provocative attacks.
	   Nonetheless, the official stressed, the Serbs are still largely
in compliance with the agreement struck by Milosevic and U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke.
	   Walker said his ambitious mission ever ``might be the last, best
chance to avert an irrational spiral of more violence, more human
suffering.''

Church removed incumbent Patriarch Maxim from his post, church
officials announced Wednesday.
	   At a two-day extraordinary Convention of Clergy and Laity, aimed
to overcome the years-long rift that has plagued the church, the
796 delegates voted unanimously in favour of Maxim's replacement.
Maxim has no chance to appeal the decision.
	   Priests who attended the convention said a patriarch should be
elected next January. The delegates were not unanimous as to who
should head the church prior to election of a new primate.
	   The meeting was called by lower-rank clergymen angered by the
crippling conflict in the church that has disappointed many of the
faithful in this post-communist country.
	   Since 1991, Bulgaria's main church has been split between
supporters of Patriarch Maxim, who served as church leader under
Communist rule, and Pymen, whose followers seceded in 1991 and
proclaimed him patriarch in 1996. Maxim then promptly declared him
expelled from the church.
	   But Patriarch Maxim and his supporters boycotted the convention,
and a statement of the Patriarch's office, issued after the
meeting, calls its decisions ``a spiritual coup.''
	   The statement calls on state leaders ``to reject and distance
themselves from these unprecedented anticanonical actions of the
forum for the sake of the unity of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church
and the unity of the Bulgarian people.''
	   The convention follows a meeting of church leaders of the
Orthodox world who gathered last month in Sofia. trying to bring
together the two feuding wings, but the result was just a fragile
compromise.
	   The seven year-old power struggle has seriously damaged the
image of the Orthodox Church and prevented it from being a moral
authority in post-Communist Bulgaria.
	   The vast majority of Bulgaria's 8.5 million people come from an
Orthodox background, even if they don't practice religion.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A woman carrying 240,000 dollars worth of
drugs was arrested Wednesday at Madrid airport for shoplifting
perfume at a duty-free store, news reports said.
	   The woman was wearing a belt holding 2.4 kilos (5 pounds) of
ecstasy tablets, half a kilo (one pound) of hashish and 110 grams
(4 ounces) of heroin, the state news agency Efe reported.
	   Staff at a duty-free shop spotted her stealing perfume and other
cosmetics and reported her to Civil Guard officers who arrested the
woman later as she waited to board a flight to Buenos Aires.
	   Airport customs officials said the drugs had a street value of
34 million pesetas (dlrs 240,000). The woman's age and nationality
were not given.
	   A spokesman for the Civil Guard at the airport declined to
comment.

	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Rebels in the disputed territory of East
Timor were holding two soldiers captive Wednesday after releasing
11 others they abducted in a deadly raid.
	   Three soldiers and one pro-independence activist were killed in
the raid Monday on a military post, in which guerrillas stole seven
guns, including some M-16 rifles.
	   Col. Tono Suratman, military chief in the former Portuguese
colony, threatened an attack on the rebels if they did not free
their captives.
	   ``If they're not released, then we will have to use force,'' he
said, adding that troops know where the rebel hideout is.
	   The soldiers were abducted in an attack by 50 rebels in
Manufahi, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili, the
capital of East Timor.
	   In recent days, four other soldiers have been killed in attacks
linked to the independence struggle in East Timor, which was
invaded by the Indonesian military in 1975.
	   On Thursday, church Masses and a march are planned to coincide
with the seventh anniversary of a massacre in which at least 50
people were killed when Indonesian troops fired on a
pro-independence protest.
	   Human rights activists claim at least 200 people were killed.
	   On Wednesday, hundreds of people staged a candlelight vigil to
commemorate the massacre anniversary.
	   Dozens of buses also brought people from outlying villagers into
Dili for Thursday's planned ceremonies.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after its troops
intervened in a civil war that broke out during the last days of
Portuguese rule. The United Nations still considers Portugal the
administering power.

Israel: Spies weren't working on Turkey's behalf
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cypriot government refusing comment, final graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Trying to dispel persistent rumors, Israel's
Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday that two Israelis arrested in
Cyprus last week as suspected spies were not working for Turkey.
	   The statement did not say who had employed the two.
	   ``The two Israelis that were arrested in Cyprus didn't act
against Cyprus and didn't act on Turkey's behalf,'' the statement
said.
	   The arrests have strained relations between Israel and Cyprus,
which has grown increasingly suspicious of Israel's military pact
with Turkey. Cypriot police had said they suspected the Israelis
were spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the
northern third of Cyprus in 1974.
	   But the Foreign Ministry said it would work to maintain good
relations with the island country.
	   ``The friendly relations between the two countries, expressed
recently by the Israeli president's visit to Cyprus, will continue
and will be tightened,'' the statement said.
	   Cypriot government spokesman Christos Stylianides said he would
not comment on the Israeli statement while the case was still under
investigation.

Italian premier urges European countries to invest in jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) - Europe needs to invest more in job creation and
reward the people who tightened their belts so their countries
could get into the European Monetary Union, Italian premier Massimo
D'Alema said in an interview published Wednesday.
	   D'Alema, a former Communist who became premier three weeks ago,
urged the monetary union to relax its rules so that investments in
job creation from government budget deficit calculations.
	   ``This is not being scandalous or heretical,'' D'Alema told the
International Herald Tribune. ``I am not proposing that we print
money. All I am saying is that if necessary, Europe could decide to
interpret the stability pact.''
	   The eleven countries selected to participate in the single
currency, the euro, had to meet strict economic criteria, and are
required to maintain that rigor.
	   But D'Alema, like some officials in Germany's new center-left
government, insists it is time to worry more about the people.
D'Alema, who heads a center-left government, says he wants to
reduce the country's 12 percent unemployment rate and stimulate the
economy to counteract a looming recession.
	   ``We have been very, very well-behaved,'' said D'Alema. ``We did
all the homework... Now the European Union and the European people
deserve to be rewarded.''

U.N. withdraws arms inspectors, ``non-essential'' staff from Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ At least 400 weapons inspectors and other
U.N. staff left Baghdad Wednesday and the United Nations began
withdrawing ``nonessential'' staff amid preparations for a possible
U.S. military strike.
	   A convoy of 11 buses and vans carrying more than 100 arms
inspectors and their luggage rolled out of the U.N. Special
Commission's headquarters Wednesday morning. About 300 other U.N.
staff _ apparently humanitarian workers _ departed four hours
later.
	   Many of those leaving hugged U.N. workers _ including Iraqi
staffers _ who remained behind. None of U.N. employees would speak
with reporters as they boarded the gold, pink and blue buses.
	   As the vehicles left, U.N. workers were putting screens up over
the windows of the headquarters _ a move apparently aimed at
preventing glass shattering into the building if there were a
military strike.
	   The U.N. special envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, told reporters in
Baghdad the world body had decided to withdraw its personnel
because of a possible military strike.
	   Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs in Iraq,
specified that the withdrawal of all nonessential personnel was
``precautionary.''
	   ``In view of uncertainties surrounding the current situation and
following instructions from the U.N. headquarters in New York, it
has been decided to temporarily relocate nonessential U.N. staff to
Amman, Jordan,'' Falt said.
	   The United States and Britain have warned that military force
may be used to try to force Baghdad to back down from its decision
to freeze all cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission in
charge of arms inspections.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton met Tuesday with senior Pentagon
officials to explore options for a military attack, and Washington
has stepped up the movement of U.S. ships into the region.
	   Iraq has said it will not cooperate with inspectors until the
U.N. Security Council begins moving to lift an embargo imposed
after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War.
The Security Council maintains the embargo won't be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Shah said when he discussed the withdrawal with Iraq's deputy
prime minister on Wednesday morning, Tariq Aziz had told him Iraq
officials would not change their position.
	   ``They will not be able to desist from their position unless the
Security Council takes some action in regard to the sanctions on
Iraq,'' Shah said, summing up Aziz's views.
	   Before Wednesday's departures, there were about 120 UNSCOM and
IAEA personnel in the country. There were about 450 humanitarian
workers.
	   Those pulled out Wednesday included not only all UNSCOM staff
but monitors for the International Atomic Energy Agency and other
U.N. workers who run the oil-for-food program supplying aid to the
Iraqi people.
	   The arms inspectors flew to Bahrain, while others were traveling
aboard five buses on the nine- or ten-hour trip across the desert
to neighboring Jordan.
	   The current crisis began in August when Iraq said it would not
cooperate with the Special Commission. It let some personnel
continue long-term monitoring, but on Oct. 31 it stopped even that
work.
	   Despite warnings of a military strike by the United States and
Britain, Iraqi officials have said they will not back down from
their decision to bar the inspectors from working. Iraq appeared to
be turning to other Arab states to head off any attack.
	   On Tuesday, Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf
warned that ``any use of military force against Iraq would lead to
destabilizing the region.''
	   The United States and Britain maintain they have backing in the
Middle East for a military strike, but Arab officials have offered
no public support for using force.
	   Jordan's Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh, after meeting Wednesday
with Saudi Arabia's Kind Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah, said the
two countries ``are in agreement that the crisis ... should be
solved diplomatically.''
	   But he added: ``It appears that attempts to defuse the crisis
could be late.''
	   In New York, Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's ambassador to the United
Nations, said Tuesday that ``we have to prepare ourself for a
strike obviously _ this does not mean that we don't encourage
diplomacy.''
	   U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler, interviewed on U.S.
television, urged Iraq to face up to the fact that disarmament is
connected to sanctions.
	   ``The key is in its hands _ and it's called full disclosure to
us,'' he said.

Cabinet convenes to ratify peace agreement with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu adviser saying troop withdrawal likely

approval for each stage of the agreement &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After two weeks of repeated delays and bitter
disputes with the Palestinians over security issues, Israel's
Cabinet convened Wednesday to ratify the Wye peace accord.
	   However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attached several
stipulations to the land-for-security agreement that could cause
new disruptions and threaten implementation in the future.
	   If a slim majority of the 17 ministers approves the accord, as
is expected, by Wednesday evening, parliament could begin its
debate on Monday and hold a vote by Tuesday.
	   Despite the renewed ratification efforts, a Netanyahu adviser
said it was unlikely Israel would meet its first key commitment, a
pullback from 2 percent of the West Bank, by Monday's deadline.
	   The troop redeployment might be delayed by as much as a week,
said the adviser, David Bar-Illan. He said the pullback could not
take place until parliament has approved the deal.
	   In a new possible snag, Israel radio quoted Netanyahu as telling
the ministers that the Cabinet would be asked to approve each stage
of the 12-week agreement and to ascertain that the Palestinians
have lived up to their security commitments. Bar-Illan said he was
not aware of such a plan, but would check further.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Police fired tear gas to disperse
demonstrators and shot a rioter dead in the eastern border city of
Mutare during a one-day national strike to protest price increases
Wednesday.
	   State radio said police fought running battles with about 25,000
strikers in townships around Mutare, 270 kilometers (168 miles)
east of Harare on the border with Mozambique.
	   Police also fired tear gas to disperse strikers in the farming
center of Marondera, 75 kilometers (45 miles) east of Harare,
witnesses said.
	   Witnesses said mobs stormed a farmhouse near Marondera, torching
it and killing the single occupant, a middle-aged woman.
	   There was no official confirmation of the incidents.
	   State radio said most other provincial centers, including the
second city of Bulawayo, were brought to a standstill by the
national strike.
	   In Harare, most factories and businesses shut down and police
and army troops, backed by helicopters, patrolled township suburbs
around the capital, where riots erupted last Wednesday because of a
67 percent rise in gasoline prices.
	   Workers across the nation appeared mostly to be heeding a call
by the main labor federation to stay home and not take part in
protest marches.
	   In Harare's townships, a few small groups of workers gathered on
street corners, trying to hitch rides into Harare. A state-owned
bus company scaled back services after some of its crews joined the
strike.
	   Strikers scuffled with police in the western Harare township of
Kuwadzana when police were clearing makeshift barricades put up by
strikers, witnesses said. There were no immediate reports of
arrests or injuries there.

Thailand to ask WTO about arsenic levels in chicken trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will ask the World Trade
Organization to urge member countries not to use arsenic levels in
chicken as an excuse to put up trade barriers, an official at the
commerce ministry said Wednesday.
	   The move is in response to a ban on imports of Thai chicken
imposed by the Czech Republic because it found arsenic levels in
the poultry exceeded the benchmark level of 0.1 parts per million,
said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Though member countries have the right to set their own
standards for health reasons, the issue should not be an excuse to
put up trade barriers, he said.
	   Thailand permits a maximum arsenic content of one part per
million in all food products, an official from the medical science
division at the health ministry told The Associated Press.
	   The official, who also asked for anonymity, said it was
impossible to define what is an acceptable arsenic level because
the average amount of chicken consumed by people in each country
varies greatly.
	   Another health expert was quoted in the newspaper Bangkok Post
as saying setting up benchmarks for arsenic is very complicated
because it involves a number of factors.
	   ``For Thais, one PPM is not considered dangerous because we
don't consume a whole chicken a meal, like people in the West, and
we don't eat it every day,'' Charnphen Choopraphawan, an official
at the National Health Foundation, was quoted as saying.

Israel arrests five Palestinians in ambush on Israeli troops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli troops arrested five Palestinians on
Wednesday in connection with a West Bank shooting ambush in which
two Israeli soldiers were wounded.
	   The arrests were made in the village of Raboud, south of the
West Bank town of Hebron. The army placed the village under curfew.
	   The ambush took place at about 11:30 p.m. (2130 gmt) Tuesday
near the Jewish settlement of Otniel. Soldiers said the attackers
waited by the roadside and then escaped into nearby Palestinian-run
territory, out of the army's reach.
	   Palestinian security officials said they were cooperating with
their Israeli counterparts in tracking down the gunmen.
	   A crackdown by the Palestinian Authority on groups who carry out
such acts is a key demand by the Israeli government in order to go
through with a Wye land-for-security deal signed on Oct. 23.

Secretary-general urges Iraq to resume coopertion with inspectors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed
to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday to immediately
resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors for the good of the
Iraqi people and the world.
	   Saying he was ``saddened and burdened'' by Iraq's decision to
halt dealings with the inspectors, the U.N. chief reiterated that
economic sanctions against Baghdad can only be lifted if Iraq fully
cooperates with the U.N. Security Council.
	   Iraq barred the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which
is charged with eliminating its weapons of mass destruction, from
carrying out spot inspections on Aug. 5. After the council offered
Baghdad a comprehensive review of its compliance with U.N.
resolutions _ without linking it to the possible lifting of
sanctions _ Iraq halted all dealings with UNSCOM on Oct. 31.
	   A statement from Annan, who is traveling in north Africa, was
issued at the United Nations shortly after more than 400 personnel
from UNSCOM, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and other U.N.
agencies were pulled out of Baghdad amid preparations for U.S. air
strikes.
	   Annan, who helped defuse the last crisis with Iraq in February,
said he wants to see sanctions lifted ``so that Iraq can regain its
place among the community of nations.''
	   The Security Council's offer of a comprehensive review was the
way forward, he said.
	   ``I firmly believe that this offers Iraq a genuine opportunity.
The comprehensive review will map out the remaining steps, provided
Iraq cooperates, thus allowing them to see light at the end of the
tunnel,'' Annan said.
	   ``I strongly urge President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi
government to rescind its decision and resume immediate cooperation
with UNSCOM and IAEA inspectors,'' he said.
	   The secretary-general said he was surprised at the Iraqi
leadership's decision not to cooperate with UNSCOM at a time when
the Security Council was discussing a comprehensive review.
	   ``I therefore appeal once again to President Saddam Hussein and
the Iraqi leadership to take this opportunity to resume cooperation
with UNSCOM and the IAEA. This would be good for the Iraqi people,
for the region and for the world,'' he said.

Shell retains exploration and production holding in Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ After receiving no attractive offers
for its Thai exploration and production subsidiary, Shell announced
Wednesday that it had decided to retain its interest in the
company.
	   The subsidiary operates an offshore concession in the Gulf of
Thailand and an onshore concession.
	   ``While we received considerable interest following our
announcement last February to approach the market, Shell has not
been able to secure an offer in line with our expectations,'' Thai
Shell Executive Director Martin Bradshaw said in a statement.
	   Thai Shell reported a 50 percent increase in onshore oil
reserves over the last year, and said total oil production has
risen to more than 24,000 barrels of crude oil a day.
	   The Anglo-Dutch petroleum giant's branch in Thailand forecast
similar production levels in coming years.
	   ``We have consistently maintained that if we did not receive the
right offer from the right buyer we would be happy to continue to
own and operate (the local subsidiary),'' Bradshaw said.

Nordic countries condemn Iraq's weapons inspection stand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The five Nordic countries on Wednesday
jointly condemned Iraq's refusal to cooperate with U.N. inspectors
searching for weapons of mass destruction and demanded that the
country immediately reverse its position.
	   Hundreds of U.N. weapons inspectors from UNSCOM and other staff
left Baghdad on Wednesday, amid preparations for a possible U.S.
military strike against Iraq. The country has said it will not
cooperate with inspectors until the U.N. Security Council moves to
lift an embargo imposed after the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The foreign ministers of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and
Iceland, gathered in Oslo for a regular meeting of their Nordic
Council, ``condemn, as totally unacceptable, Iraq's decision of
Oct. 31 to stop all cooperation with UNSCOM,'' a joint statement
said.
	   The Nordic ministers said they fully supported a U.N. Security
Council resolution of Nov. 5 demanding that Iraq immediately resume
cooperation with UNSCOM and inspectors from the International
Atomic Energy Agency.
	   The Nordic statement did not say whether the countries supported
possible military action against Iraq. The U.N. resolution, which
the five ministers fully endorsed, warned Iraq of ``severest
consequences'' if it failed to allow inspectors unfettered access
to suspected weapons sites.

Pakistan resumes stalled talks with IMF for rescue package
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Poor Pakistan, scrambling to raise
funds to pay off its huge debt, resumed stalled talks Wednesday
with the International Monetary Fund, an IMF official said.
	   ``An IMF team has arrived Islamabad and will resume the talks
with Pakistan today,'' said Ahsan Mansur, the IMF resident
director.
	   But Mansur refused to say more.
	   Pakistan is seeking a bailout package worth dlrs 5 billion from
global donor agencies to avoid a default on the repayment of a
whopping dlrs 32 billion debt.
	   Pakistan is optimistic of a breakthrough following a decision
last week by U.S. President Bill Clinton to waive some sanctions,
imposed after last May's underground nuclear tests, as well as his
offer of one-time support to Pakistan for this bail out package.
	   Without it Pakistan will be forced to default on its debt, its
imports would dry up and the country would be ruined economically.
	   Already Pakistan is behind dlrs 1.4 billion and is currently on
a 30 day grace period after which time the bill has to be paid or a
default declared.
	   The IMF package is said to include dlrs 2 billion of debt
rescheduling and dlrs 3 billion in loans.
	   Talks with the IMF and World Bank stalled last month over a
dispute between the Pakistan government and privately run power
companies.
	   The government is accusing some of the country's biggest power
companies of brokering deals with former prime minister Benazir
Bhutto to charge inflated power rates. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
accused the companies, many owned and financed by foreign companies
and guaranteed by the World Bank, of paying massive kickbacks to
Ms. Bhutto's government.
	   Both Ms. Bhutto and the power companies deny the charge.
	   A government decision to slash power rates by 30 percent also
caused the talks to stall.
	   According to several sources the IMF wants Pakistan to end its
feud with the power companies, revamp its ailing state power
utility which means increasing, not decreasing rates.
	   Last week Sharif changed his economic team, appointing Ishaq Dar
as Finance Minister and ousting technocrat Hafeez Pasha from the
post of financial advisor.
	   But finance ministry officials, who didn't want to be
identified, said the changes won't effect negotiations.
	   ``The main outlines of the program have already been chalked
out. We hope to wrap up talks in the coming few days,'' he said.

Swiss hand over formal extradition request for Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's embassy in London on
Wednesday handed over a formal request for the extradition of
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, the Swiss Office of
Police Affairs said.
	   The office last week said Switzerland had prepared the official
request but was awaiting a similar move from Spain before passing
it on to Britain.
	   Switzerland says the Spanish effort to extradite Pinochet should
be given priority.
	   Pinochet was arrested at a London clinic last month on an arrest
warrant from Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon, who is seeking his
extradition on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism during
his 17-year rule which ended 1990.
	   Switzerland subsequently requested Pinochet's arrest with a view
to extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture.
	   The move followed a criminal complaint filed in Geneva by the
widow of Alexis Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean dual
nationality who disappeared in Argentina in May 1977.
	   Britain's highest court, the House of Lords, is considering an
appeal against an Oct. 28 ruling by the High Court that Pinochet
has diplomatic immunity as a former foreign head of state.

Rival Buddhist monks clash in Seoul temple
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Rival monks hurled trash, furniture
and curses Wednesday on the eve of an election to choose the new
head of Chogye Chong, South Korea's largest Buddhist denomination.
	   ``Hey! You dirty monks! Are you monks or hoodlums?'' several
housewives shouted while watching the clash at Chogye Temple in
central Seoul, which houses headquarters of the denomination.
	   As worshipers urged them to end their brawling and shoving
matches, the rival monks turned the usually serene temple into a
battleground strewn with trash and broken chairs.
	   For years, Chogye has been plagued by internal conflicts.
	   The simmering conflicts erupted again ahead of Thursday's
election to select the next head of Chogye's General Secretariat, a
powerful post in charge of naming chief monks at the denomination's
1,700 temples across the country.
	   Incumbent General Secretary Song Wol-joo is seeking a third
consecutive four-year term.
	   This week, Wol Ha, the supreme monk of the Chogye denomination,
urged Song to step down, but Song ignored him.
	   Song hired dozens of black-clothed bodyguards to prevent rival
monks from storming the five-story pagoda-shaped concrete building
where he and his followers were holed up.
	   Outside the building, about 300 monks and worshipers gathered to
demand Song's resignation and a postponement of the election.
	   They used ropes to rip off steel-framed windows and doors.
Song's followers sprayed fire extinguishers and used water hoses to
stymie several monks trying to crawl inside the building on
ladders.
	   Hundreds of riot police were dispatched with batons and shields,
but did not intervene.
	   The monks did not shout slogans and refused to be interviewed by
reporters. But their leaflets accused each other of corruption.
	   Chogye claims 8 million worshipers. South Korea has a population
of 44 million.

Former ski champion to raise money for young skiers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Alberto Tomba used to race for Olympic medals and
World Cup titles. Now he'll be racing for kids.
	   Tomba, who retired last summer after a 13-year World Cup career
highlighted by 50 victories and five Olympic medals, will begin the
Tomba Tour in the United States this winter. It is designed to
raise money for junior racing programs, the same path Tomba took on
the way to becoming a three-time Olympic champion.
	   ``I like good performers, things that accelerate fast, like
me,'' he said.
	   At Deer Valley in Utah (Jan. 23-24), Stratton, Vermont, (Jan.
30-31) and Squaw Valley, California, (March 6-7) Tomba will race
along with individuals and four-member teams. The best from each
stop will join Tomba and several TV and movie personalities for the
finals March 20-21 in Aspen, Colorado.
	   In December, Tomba will be in Palm Springs, California, to play
in the Lexus Challenge golf tournament.
	   ``I was a good player, but I haven't played golf in four
years,'' Tomba said. ``But I will practice for an hour, two hours
before starting and maybe I'll be great.''

Tribunal condemns Belgrade in letter to Security Council
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The president of the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal harshly criticized Belgrade authorities anew for
refusing to let U.N. investigators probe alleged atrocities in
Kosovo.
	   In a letter to the United Nations Security Council released
Wednesday by the tribunal, presiding judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald
of the United States said the failure of Yugoslav officials to
grant visas to investigators is ``an affront.''
	   ``The intentional and continuous refusal by the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia to comply with its clear and incontrovertible legal
obligations to the tribunal is an affront to the Security Council
and all law-abiding nations,'' she said.
	   The Texas judge fired off the letter last Friday following the
refusal of Belgrade authorities to allow tribunal Chief Prosecutor
Louise Arbour of Canada and a team of investigators to visit
Kosovo.
	   McDonald asked the Security Council to impose ``measures which
are sufficiently compelling to bring the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia into the fold of law-abiding nations.''
	   Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed,
and as many as 300,000 driven from their homes since February, when
Serb forces began a crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in
Kosovo.
	   The tribunal wants to look into allegations of war crimes on
both sides of the conflict.

New Zealand fumbles on one-China policy, apologizes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand expressed regret
Wednesday that it had failed to inform China it intends to give
Taiwanese trade officials diplomatic-style privileges.
	   In a government paper, New Zealand gave notice this week that it
intends to extend privileges and immunity from prosecution similar
to those given diplomats to officials at the Taiwan Economic and
Cultural Office.
	   Officials at the Chinese Embassy learned of the move Wednesday
from reporters, and formally expressed concern over the move. China
claims Taiwan as a breakaway province.
	   New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said the move had no
impact on the one-China policy, under which New Zealand
acknowledges that Taiwan is a Chinese territory.
	   ``The links we maintain with Taiwan are of an economic and
cultural nature only and the extension of certain facilities to the
Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office does not depart from that,'' he
said.
	   Rosemary Banks, director of the foreign affairs office's north
Asia division, said she told Chinese diplomats that ``we regret
they learned of it through the media. It is not the normal way we
operate.''
	   The government never considered the move would be a problem in
terms of the one-China policy, she said.
	   ``What we're talking about here is an administrative
facilitation. We're not in any way talking about giving diplomatic
status or recognition to the (Taiwan Economic and Cultural
Office).''
	   New Zealand law allows for privileges and immunities to be
extended to entities like states or provinces, and the extension
``in no way suggests that this is necessarily a country you're
dealing with or that it necessarily has full diplomatic status,''
she said.
	   ``If ... the Guangdong province of China decided that it wanted
to set up a promotional office in New Zealand, then this is the
same sort of set of immunities and privileges we would be able to
extend to that office.''
	   New Zealand's Labor opposition leader Helen Clark accused the
government of a clumsy blunder.
	   ``The direct snub to China this week in failing to inform it of
the decision ... will raise questions about the competence of the
conduct of New Zealand's foreign relations,'' Clark said.

Indian security forces kill five militants in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Indian security forces rained rockets and
mortar shells on a house in Kashmir's capital where Muslim
militants were holed up Wednesday, killing three rebels after a
five-hour gun battle, police said.
	   The killings in the Wanabal neighborhood outside Srinagar, the
summer capital of India's northern Jammu-Kashmir state, came two
days after the military killed four suspected rebels in a similar
attack in the city.
	   Also Wednesday, two other militants were killed in a gun battle
with government troops in Doda district, 275 kilometers (170 miles)
north of Srinagar, a police spokesman said.
	   Police said all five militants were foreign mercenaries, hired
by some of the nearly one dozen Muslim guerrilla outfits that are
fighting Indian forces to carve out a separate state or merge with
Pakistan.
	   India accuses Pakistan, with which it has fought three wars, of
funding and arming the insurgency. Pakistan denies the charge,
saying it provides only ideological support.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After two weeks of repeated delays and bitter
disputes with the Palestinians over security issues, Israel's
Cabinet convened Wednesday to ratify the Wye peace accord.
	   However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attached several
stipulations to the land-for-security agreement that could cause
new disruptions and threaten future implementation.
	   If a slim majority of the 17 ministers approves the accord, as
is expected, by Wednesday evening, parliament could begin its
debate on Monday and hold a vote by Tuesday.
	   Despite the renewed ratification efforts, a Netanyahu adviser
said it was unlikely Israel would meet its first key commitment, a
pullback from 2 percent of the West Bank, by Monday's deadline.
	   The troop redeployment might be delayed by as much as a week,
said the adviser, David Bar-Illan. He said the pullback could not
take place until parliament has approved the deal.
	   In a new possible snag, Israel radio quoted Netanyahu as telling
the ministers that the Cabinet would be asked to approve each stage
of the 12-week agreement and to ascertain that the Palestinians
have lived up to their security commitments. Bar-Illan said he was
not aware of such a plan, but would check further.

U.S. preliminary ruling on steel imports to affect Korea little
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean stainless steel makers
said Wednesday a preliminary U.S. ruling against them would not
seriously affect their exports to the American market.
	   The U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has found
evidence that some stainless steel products from France, Italy and
South Korea are illegally subsidized.
	   Under the ruling, the U.S. Customs Service will require
importers to begin posting a bond or cash deposit to cover any
retroactive duties that may be imposed later.
	   ``The U.S. ruling concerns only a small amount of products by a
few steel makers. It won't affect our exports much,'' said Kim
Sung-woo, a spokesman for the Korean Iron and Steel Association.
	   The ruling applies to stainless steel sheets and strips in coil
sold by three companies, including bankrupt Sammi Steel Co., Inchon
Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. and Taihan Electric Wire Co. Ltd.
	   Sold in flat sheets rolled up like carpet, the products are used
in kitchen sinks, dishwashers, chemical tanks and a wide range of
other appliances and products.
	   In this year's first nine months, South Korea exported 2 million
tons of steel products worth dlrs 900 million to the United States.
The stainless steel under question was worth dlrs 28 million.
	   U.S. steel makers long have complained that government subsidies
and other practices let foreign companies sell goods in the United
States at cut-rate prices, violating trade laws.
	   The Commerce Department will make a final decision early next
year.

Israel: Spies weren't working on Turkey's behalf
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES last graf with Cypriot government refusing comment. No
Pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Trying to dispel persistent rumors, Israel's
Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday that two Israelis arrested in
Cyprus last week as suspected spies were not working for Turkey.
	   The statement did not say who had employed the two.
	   Cypriot police had said they suspected the Israelis were spying
on behalf of Turkey, which invaded Cyprus in 1974 and still
occupies the northern third of the island.
	   But the Israeli statement said Wednesday, ``The two Israelis
that were arrested in Cyprus didn't act against Cyprus and didn't
act on Turkey's behalf.''
	   The arrests have strained relations between Israel and Cyprus,
which has grown increasingly suspicious of Israel's military pact
with Turkey. The Foreign Ministry said it would work to maintain
good relations with the island country.
	   ``The friendly relations between the two countries, expressed
recently by the Israeli president's visit to Cyprus, will continue
and will be tightened,'' the statement said.
	   The Foreign Ministry said it would continue to clarify the
issue.
	   Cypriot government spokesman Christos Stylianides said he would
not comment on the Israeli statement while the case was still under
investigation.

New markets help Australian exporters survive Asian crisis:
</HEADLINE>
government &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Big new sales to the United States
and Europe have outweighed the impact of the Asian economic crisis
on Australia's exports, Trade Minister Tim Fischer said Wednesday.
	   ``Our exporters are doing extremely well in very difficult
circumstances,'' Fischer told Parliament.
	   He said diversification had been the key to exporters' success.
	   The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade released a report
Wednesday that showed the value of Australia's exports in the first
eight months of 1998 was 7.1 percent higher than in the same period
last year.
	   Australia's exports to the United States had risen by 41 percent
and to the European Union by 44 percent in that time, Fischer said.
	   But East Asia remained among the most important of Australia's
trading partners, taking more than half Australia's exports in the
12 months to the end of June this year, the report said.
	   Fischer said Australia's wine exporters had been particularly
successful in increasing their sales to European countries.
	   Australia's exports to Japan, its biggest customer, in the first
eight months of 1998 were worth 11.5 billion Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 7.2 billion), a rise of 7.3 percent from January-August
the previous year.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Eighteen-year-old Justin Rose, a surprise fourth
in the British Open in July, has landed a major sponsorship deal as
he attempts next week to win his European tour card.
	   Rose, the South African-born Englishman, has signed a three-year
deal with Maxfli that a spokesman said could be worth 600,000
pounds (dlrs 1 million).
	   The deal is performance-related with Rose first needing to win
his European tour card in qualifying school Nov. 18-23 at the
Valderrama and San Roque clubs in southern Spain.
	   Rose finished only two shots behind winner Mark O'Meara in
July's British Open at Royal Birkdale, but then missed the cuts in
all eight events he played in Europe and Australia.
	   He faces a field of 180 players next week in Spain with the top
35 and ties earning the card.

Japanese honeymooners caught taking Australian wildlife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ A Japanese couple on honeymoon in
Australia were arrested trying to leave with three live turtles and
six lizards in their luggage, a court heard Wednesday.
	   Shinji Sugimoto, 28, and his 27-year-old wife Mikako Segami
appeared in Perth Magistrates Court charged with breaches of
Australia's Wildlife Protection Act.
	   Prosecutor Stephen Davies said Australian Customs officers found
the reptiles late Tuesday as the couple boarded a Tokyo-bound
Qantas Airways flight in Perth, capital of Western Australia state.
	   ``Found in their hand luggage, wrapped up as presents, were
three oblong turtles, four shingle-back lizards, one (thorny)
mountain devil lizard and one gecko,'' Davies said.
	   The animals were valued at 30,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs
19,000) on the international market, he said.
	   Davies said Sugimoto and Segami probably face more charges
following the death of the thorny mountain devil overnight.
	   ``There is some prospect of the charges being changed to reflect
that element of cruelty,'' he said.
	   The couple were married in Brisbane, capital of the eastern
state of Queensland, soon after arriving in Australia Oct. 29.
	   They were not required Wednesday to enter a plea. They were
ordered to surrender their passports, to report daily to police in
Perth, and to reappear in Perth Magistrates Court on Nov. 16.

Central bank chief says lower rates will cut problem loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank governor said
Wednesday that cutting lending rates will help Thai commercial
banks reduce their problem loans, which now make up 40 percent of
outstanding loans.
	   Chatu Mongol Sonakul spoke at a news conference amid increasing
pressure on Thai commercial banks _ beset by the financial crisis
that has engulfed Thailand since July 1997 _ to narrow the
difference between high lending and low deposit rates.
	   Chatu Mongol said he believed prime lending rates at major
commercial banks could be cut to as low as 12 percent by the end of
the year.
	   ``In the short term, this will help solve their problem loans
and benefit the general economy as a whole,'' Chatu Mongol said.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and other leaders have been urging
Thai banks to cut their lending rates, hoping to save more of the
country's troubled businesses from going under.
	   Only Thai Farmers Bank, the country's third-largest, has cut its
prime rate, or minimum lending rate, to 12.0 percent. Bangkok Bank,
the biggest commercial bank, is still charging 12.75 percent.
	   Minimum lending rates of major commercial banks were in a range
of 15.5 percent in July. Banks have been reluctant to make new
loans due to their heavy burdens of problems loans following the
economic crash.
	   Chatu Mongol, speaking to reporters after a meeting with top
commercial bank executives, said every drop of 500 basis points in
lending rates will reduce problem loans by about 10 percent.
	   Thai Farmers Bank President Banthoon Lamsam told reporters that
declining lending rates will allow cash-strapped borrowers to repay
loans and hence help banks to recoup some of their losses.
	   Banthoon said this will eventually cut the need for banks to
seek massive fresh capital for loan-loss provisioning.
	   But analysts feel many Thai banks still need to raise capital to
cope with their rising non-performing loans.
	   Only Bangkok Bank and Thai Farmers Bank have successfully raised
capital by selling new shares to foreign investors earlier this
year.
	   Two medium-size banks _ Bank of Asia and Thai Danu Bank _ had to
find new strategic partners to raise capital.

Santer urges Clinton to restore peace in banana war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Commission President Jacques
Santer has asked U.S. President Bill Clinton not to impose trade
sanctions to punish the European Union for its banana import
regime.
	   In his letter, sent late Tuesday and released Wednesday, Santer
warned that American sanctions would violate World Trade
Organization rules.
	   ``No WTO member has the right unilaterally to determine whether
another member is in compliance with WTO rules,'' a Commission
statement quoted Santer as saying.
	   On Tuesday, the United States released a five-page list of EU
exports it plans to slap with extra duties. The list covers a wide
range of products from toys and vacuum cleaners to French wines,
said Nigel Gardner, spokesman for the EU's Trade Commissioner Sir
Leon Brittan.
	   Sanctions on EU exports would affect 1.3 billion ecus (dlrs 1.6
billion) worth of EU trade in terms of 1997 EU trade figures,
Gardner said.
	   ``We cannot walk around with this gun of unilateralism pointed
at our head,'' Gardner said.
	   He added the EU will take ``rapid WTO action'' unless the United
States steps down from its current position.
	   WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero said Washington and the EU
``have responsibility for resolving this difficult question. The
two parties can and must resolve this and the answer to the problem
lies within the rules of the WTO,'' Ruggiero's spokesman, Keith
Rockwell, said in Geneva where the WTO is based.
	   Over the weekend, the United States warned of punitive action if
the 15-nation EU does not change its banana trade system, which
Washington claims unfairly favors imports from former European
colonies.
	   The United States says the EU has not done enough to comply with
a WTO verdict last year against the EU's favorable treatment of a
number of African, Caribbean, and Pacific region countries.
	   The EU argues it approved new import regulations to comply with
WTO demands, but the United States and Central and South American
banana producers claim EU banana imports are still discriminatory.

Singapore: Hong Kong must solve any problems over access to stock

prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Singapore futures exchange said Wednesday
it has no need to talk to Hong Kong about how it's going to get
instant prices for its planned market in Hong Kong stock futures,
intensifying a feud between the rival financial centers.
	   Hong Kong market bosses want to stop Singapore from trading
contracts on a stock index that virtually mirrors the blue-chip
Hang Seng, fearing lost business and the possibility that Hong Kong
shares could be manipulated by overseas traders they cannot
regulate.
	   The main thrust of Hong Kong's defense has been to tell
providers of real-time financial information, such as Reuters, that
they need permission before selling real-time stock prices that
could help the Singapore market succeed.
	   The chief executive of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Alec Tsui,
says nobody has even sought his blessing.
	   ``So far no one has come to ask any consent whatsoever,'' Tsui
said Tuesday at a financial seminar in Singapore. ``I'm still
waiting for any proposal from anybody saying that it is good for
both parties; I haven't seen any so far.''
	   The Singapore exchange, known as SIMEX, responded Wednesday by
saying it needs no clearance from Hong Kong to gain access to the
stock prices.
	   A SIMEX spokesman said Wednesday that Morgan Stanley Capital
International has signed a contract to provide Singapore with
real-time values for its HiMSCI index _ a 99.995 percent carbon
copy of the Hang Seng.
	   ``SIMEX has received no indication from MSCI that it is not able
to do so,'' the spokesman said. ``It is up to MSCI to respond to
the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, if MSCI considers it necessary to
enter into any commercial arrangement ... to get the real-time
price feed.''
	   MSCI declined comment.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A four-year chase across the globe for
a banker accused of in a dlrs 700 million fraud ended Wednesday in
Australia with the arrest of a man allegedly posing as a wine and
cheese seller.
	   Carlos Cabal Peniche, 45, was arrested in the southeastern city
of Melbourne, said police spokesman Keith Livingstone.
	   Cabal Peniche appeared in court Wednesday on a Mexican warrant
on ``a number of fraud-related offenses,'' Livingston said. A judge
ordered him held for another hearing Dec. 17.
	   Livingston said Mexican authorities ``will be seeking to have
him extradited.''
	   He said Australia worked with Mexican officials, Interpol and
the FBI to track him down.
	   The Mexican attorney general's office, calling him ``Mexico's
most-wanted fugitive,'' said he was carrying a passport from the
Dominican Republic in the name of Rafael Cerit Meritt.
	   Mexican investigators said they had chased him from Mexico to
Spain and now to Australia under a variety of aliases.
	   The attorney general's office said Cabal Peniche was dealing in
wines, cheeses and Italian olive oil in Australia, where he was
living in a mansion in Prighoen, which it identified as a luxurious
suburb of Melbourne.
	   He had been living in Australia for at least a year, according
to Australian police quoted by the Mexican daily Reforma.
	   Cabal Peniche rose from obscurity to the top levels of Mexico's
business world, hobnobbing with presidents and governors in the
early 1990s and winning control of two formerly state-owned banks,
Banco Union and Banca Cremi.
	   But regulators seized his two banks in 1994 and accused him of
misappropriating dlrs 700 million. He fled Mexico hours after the
warrants were issued.
	   His name has surfaced repeatedly in political scandals. Critics
accuse government officials of failing to adequately screen the
banker before he was allowed to take control of the banks.
	   Many also have protested that Cabal Peniche's bad loans would be
backed by the government under a proposal by President Ernesto
Zedillo's administration to absorb bad loans in a bank bailout fund
into the national debt.
	   Among those loans were dlrs 4 million that allegedly went to a
ruling-party election campaign in Cabal Peniche's home state of
Tabasco.
	   The son of a local supermarket owner, Cabal Peniche began to
build a business empire in the early 1980s in the Gulf coast state
of Tabasco based on seafood and fruit.
	   Cabal bought Del Monte Fresh Produce in 1993 for about dlrs 550
million from a London bankruptcy court. In 1992, it was one of the
world's two leading marketers of fresh pineapples and the third
largest supplier of bananas.
	   Cabal also tried to buy San Francisco-based Del Monte Foods Co.
but failed in his bid when talks ended without an agreement in
1994.

Bride is arrested during wedding for stealing her dress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ It's a Romanian custom for guests to
``steal'' the bride, but not for the bride to steal her wedding
dress.
	   Cristina Barcea, 28, was sentenced to six months in prison after
she failed to pay for her wedding gown, daily Evenimentul Zilei
reported Wednesday. Police were unavailable for comment.
	   Before the wedding, Barcea purchased a dress on credit from a
shop in the Transylvanian city of Sibiu 225 kms (140 miles)
northwest of Bucharest. The shop owner later discovered the
soon-to-be bride had left a false name and address.
	   She only had one thing to go on _ the date of the wedding,
Saturday, October 24.
	   On the evening of the wedding, the shop owner and police
officers combed all possible wedding party venues in the city,
eventually finding the bride dressed in her stolen finery.
	   Police took her away for questioning. Last Monday, she was
charged with theft, creating a false identity and fraud.
	   Traditionally, the bride in Romania is ``stolen'' or secreted
away by guests and the groom has to pay a forfeit for his bride's
return if he cannot find her.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ No one can be looking forward to
playing Greg Rusedski at this year's 825,000 dollars Stockholm Open
tennis tournament.
	   On Wednesday, Rusedski demolished Tommy Haas in straight sets,
6-1 and 6-4. The Briton broke Haas' first four service games and
closed out the first set in a quick 20 minutes.
	   For most of the way it was all Rusedski. Game four of the second
set was four aces and a double fault.
	   ``I couldn't be playing much better tennis if I tried,'' he said
after the match. Asked if he had ever won every point of an
opponent's service game in an entire set, he joked, ``It must be my
new improved returns.''
	   Haas, of course, is no slouch. By the latest ATP rankings, there
aren't 35 better players in the world. On Wednesday, Rusedski made
him look way overmatched.
	   Rusedski is ranked No. 11 in the world and scrambling to qualify
for one of the last spots in the ATP Tour Championships in Hanover,
Germany.
	   ``I think I've got to get to the finals'' at the Stockholm Open,
he said. ``I'm just thinking about my tennis and everything else
will take care of itself.... If it works, it works. If it doesn't,
it doesn't.''
	   Rusedski is on a roll. Last week he beat world No. 1 Pete
Sampras at the Paris Open, a win he considers ``probably my
greatest accomplishment in tennis, by far.''
	   In other matches Wednesday, American Todd Martin defeated
Australia's hard-serving Wayne Arthurs, 6-4 and 6-3, to advance to
the second round.
	   In later matches, Sampras was scheudled to play Australia's
Jason Stoltenberg, and Briton Tim Henman, world No. 10, to play
South Africa's Wayne Ferreira.
	   Arthurs, a 27-year-old doubles specialist from Adelaide, got to
face Martin by upsetting tournament second seed and world No. 7
Karol Kucera of Slovakia the evening before. He started sharp with
three aces in his first game, but the more experienced Martin broke
his serve in game three of each set, and wore him down.
	   Martin's play was business-like. He rarely fell behind in the
count, won the big points including service breaks early in each
set, and never lost his serve.
	   Arthurs, ranked No. 168, notched at least one ace in every
service game except one, and had 15 overall.
	   The tournament is being played on the hard composition court of
the Kungliga Tennis Hall.

Council of Europe delegation in Croatia to check progress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Members of the Council of Europe's
parliamentary assembly met Croatian officials and media
representatives Wednesday, at the start of their three-day visit to
assess the country's adaption to European standards.
	   Croatia, which declared independence from former Yugoslavia in
1991 and was immediately engulfed in war with Serb rebels, was
admitted to the Council of Europe in July 1997.
	   The Council struggled for months over whether to admit Croatia.
When it eventually did, the 40-member organization listed 21
requirements that Croatia has to meet. The Council said Croatia
must improve its record on democracy, media freedom and treatment
of minorities and opposition political parties.
	   On Wednesday, Council officials Jerzy Jaskierny and Maria
Stoyanova met Croatian deputy foreign minister Ivo Sanader. They
also met with two reporters, representing independent and state-run
media to discuss media freedom issues.
	   A ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that the delegation were pleased to learn that 50,000 Serbs _ about
a quarter of those who fled Croatia in 1995 during the government's
offensive to recapture lands that rebels seized in the 1991 war _
have returned. But they still worried the pace of returns was too
slow, the official said.
	   In the coming days, the delegation is to meet President Franjo
Tudjman's ruling party members and other government officials, as
well as representatives of human rights groups and foreign
ambassadors.
	   Following their visit, the delegation will prepare report on
Croatia for the Council's parliamentary assembly. They are not
expected to give statements before then.

Jewish school opens in Sofia

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's first full-fledged Jewish
school opened Wednesday, the latest result of an American
foundation's efforts to revive Jewish education in Eastern Europe.
	   The Jewish School of Sofia is the 12th such institution to open
in this post-communist region, backed by the Ronald S. Lauder
Foundation.
	   Some 350 students are enrolled in grades 1 through 8, studying
Jewish history and learning Hebrew as a second language along with
their regular secular curriculum.
	   Lauder, the American cosmetics heir and former U.S. ambassador
to Austria, provided dlrs 300,000 in funding and renovated the
86-year-old building where the school is located, in a traditional
Jewish neighborhood of Sofia.
	   The New York-based foundation's executive vice president,
Marjorie S. Sederbush, addressed the opening ceremony and read a
message from Lauder.
	   ``It's our responsibility to reach out to the Jewish children in
Central and Eastern Europe who have been isolated from their
heritage for so many years and to provide them with opportunities
through Jewish education to develop into proud and informed Jewish
adults,'' Lauder said.
	   Bulgaria has a relatively small Jewish community of some 5,000.
Its members trace their ancestry to Sephardic Jews, who came to
this Balkan country after being expelled from Spain in 1492.
	   Last week Dan Tihon, speaker of the Knesset, Israel's
parliament, said that ``unlike other states in Eastern Europe,
Bulgaria has never seen anti-Semitism.''
	   ``Jews have always been an organic part of the life of Bulgarian
society,'' Tihon said in an address to Bulgaria's parliament.
	   Though an ally of Germany in World War II, Bulgaria and its
parliament refused to let their 50,000 Jews to be deported to Nazi
death camps.
	   After 1948, Bulgarian authorities let 45,000 Jews emigrate to
Israel.
	   In 1992, the Bulgarian government granted the country's Jewish
community the rights to dozens of buildings nationalized by the
communist government in the late 1950s and '60s.

Baggio rusty in return, Inter squeaks past Serie C club
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be updated with five night games. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ With Roberto Baggio showing signs of rust Wednesday
in his return from a long injury absence and Brazil's Ronaldo held
out as a precaution, Internazionale of Milan could only muster a
1-1 comeback draw at third-division Castel di Sangro, but that was
good enough to sneak into the Italian Cup quarterfinals on a 2-1
aggregate.
	   Castel di Sangro, a small-town club which upset Serie A sides
Perugia and Salernitana in earlier rounds of the competition, took
a 1-0 lead Wednesday in the 75th minute on striker Alberto
Bernardi's header off a free kick.
	   Inter pulled even just two minutes later when Youri Djorkaeff, a
member of France's World Cup champions, connected on a penalty kick
awarded for a foul on Nicola Ventola.
	   Before that, the visitors had rarely threatened to score.
	   Baggio played 60 occasionally effective minutes and was replaced
by playmaker Andrea Pirlo. The 31-year-old Baggio had been
sidelined with an inflamed knee tendon since a Sept. 20 league
game.
	   Ronaldo returned last weekend from his own extended layoff due
to knee tendinitis and is expected to play in Sunday's Serie A game
against Sampdoria of Genoa.
	   Castel di Sangro played the final five minutes with 10 men,
because defender David Bianchini was expelled for dissent.
	   In the quarterfinals, scheduled for Dec. 2 and Jan. 27, Inter
will face the winner of the third-round pairing of AC Milan and
Lazio of Rome, a rematch of last year's cup final. Defending
champion Lazio held a 3-1 first-leg lead heading into their
encounter at Milan Wednesday night.
	   Other third-round second-leg games Wednesday saw Juventus of
Turin at Venezia, Bari at AC Parma, Vicenza at Udinese, and
Sampdoria at Bologna.
	   AS Roma hosts Atalanta of Bergamo Thursday night.
	   Serie A leader Fiorentina advanced Tuesday by routing Lecce 4-0
_ with all the goals in the second half _ to win 5-0 on aggregate.

Strict Greek spending plan keeps eye on EU single currency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with union planning strikes,
CORRECTS EU inflation formula. No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The Greek government unveiled a
cost-cutting 1999 budget Wednesday aimed at clearing fiscal hurdles
to reach the European Union's single currency group.
	   The government's austerity measures have led to labor protests
and strikes against plans to trim services, sell state companies
and limit wage hikes. The governing Socialists also lost ground to
the opposition conservatives in municipal elections last month.
	   Greece's largest labor union, which covers private and state
employees, said it will call strikes to coincide with parliamentary
debate on the budget. A vote by lawmakers is expected next month.
	   Despite the backlash, Premier Costas Simitis has so far refused
to budge from the drive to join the single currency club by 2001.
Failure could leave the EU's poorest nation as an economic
backwater in the 15-nation bloc, Simitis insists.
	   Greece was the only EU member not to qualify for the inaugural
group using the single currency, which is scheduled to be
introduced in January. Britain, Denmark and Sweden opted not to
take part.
	   The 1999 budget seeks to reduce the general deficit to 1.9
percent of gross domestic product from an expected 2.2 percent at
the end of this year. This is well below an EU requirement of 3
percent.
	   Inflation, however, remains Greece's main challenge. The
government has reduced prices on some consumer goods, such as cars,
and seeks to hold down wage increases in an attempt to lower
inflation, which stood at 4.7 percent in October.
	   EU single currency guidelines set an inflation ceiling based on
the top performing countries, which is expected to be about 2.5
percent next year.

Roy Evans' job in jeopardy as English giants disentegrate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ The co-management partnership of Roy
Evans and Gerard Houllier appears doomed as Liverpool, one of
English soccer's most storied clubs, slides deeper into crisis.
	   Pressure was mounting Wednesday for Evans to resign or be fired
following two straight humiliating home defeats _ 2-1 to Derby in
the league last Saturday and 3-1 to Tottenham in the League Cup
Tuesday night.
	   To make things worse, 18-year-old star striker Michael Owen
injured his hamstring while scoring the consolation goal Tuesday
night. He's doubtful for Saturday's game against Leeds and
England's friendly against the Czech Republic next Wednesday.
	   What's more, midfielder Steve McManaman is out for at least six
weeks with a recurrence of an Achilles injury.
	   Liverpool fans jeered and booed the team off the Anfield pitch
Tuesday night. The headlines in Wednesday's tabloids blared: ``End
of the Roy Ride,'' ``Evans: the End,'' and ``Can it get any
worse?''
	   There was widespread speculation that Evans would soon be
ousted, leaving Houllier in sole charge of a club which lags 11th
in the Premier League standings, nine points behind leader Aston
Villa.
	   It's all a far cry from the glory days at Liverpool, one of the
world's most famous and decorated clubs. The Reds have won a record
18 English league championships, five FA Cups, five League Cups,
four European Cups and two UEFA Cups.
	   But little has gone right since Evans, who has been with the
club as a player or in management for 30 years, took over as
manager in January 1994. The only trophy the club has won under
Evans is the lightly-regarded League Cup in 1995.
	   Evans' position was already considered weakened when Houllier,
the former French national coach and technical director, was
brought in as co-manager this season.
	   While there has been no open hostility or disagreement between
the two, the consensus has always been that the arrangement would
not last and Houllier would be the one to survive.
	   The two presented a united front to the media after Tuesday's
defeat.
	   ``It is the situation at the club that worries me and everyone
else here more than anything else,'' Evans said. ``It's more
important than my scenario. I can come into press conferences and
keep saying the same thing, it doesn't change at the end of the
day.
	   ``Of course, I am disappointed, but the only way out of this
decline is hard work. We have to try to rebuild the confidence with
the players. We have to battle through this, and we may end up
stronger for it.''
	   Evans, however, may not be around to witness it.

Pay up for Porsches: Ex-communists want German luxury tax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germans should pay a special tax on
expensive cars, yachts and other luxury goods, the former East
German communists say.
	   A parliamentary motion presented by the party Wednesday suggests
a 6-percent surcharge on cars costing 75,000 marks (dlrs 45,000) or
more and on fur coats starting at 15,000 marks (dlrs 3,000). Other
items include airplanes, helicopters and jewelry.
	   Germany's new center-left government supports a fairer
distribution of wealth but is wary of radical measures, so no one
expects the motion by the opposition Party of Democratic Socialism
to become law.
	   But the party has heightened its profile since September, when
it posted its best showing in national elections. Based almost
exclusively in economically struggling eastern Germany, the PDS won
5.1 percent of the national vote, up from 4.4 percent in 1994.
	   A luxury tax would be ``a step toward social justice'' and
reversing the growing gap between rich and poor, the party's
lawmakers said.

Poland's independence celebrations marred by military jet crash

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's celebrations to mark the 80th
anniversary of regaining independence were marred by the fatal
crash of an air force training jet Wednesday.
	   The two-man, Polish-built Iskra jet went down in a small park in
the town of Otwock, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) southeast of
Warsaw. The body of one pilot was recovered, the other was missing,
a police spokeswoman said. The cause of the crash was unknown.
	   The jet was checking weather conditions in advance of an aerial
ceremony in which a dozen planes were to fly over the Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier, said defense ministry spokesman Edward Mleczak.
	   All 10 Iskras that were to fly in the air parade were grounded
after the crash and only two other jets took part.
	   The crash was the third this year of an Iskra, which was
designed in the 1960s. The Polish air force has about 150 of that
type and uses them as its main training jet.
	   Poland has been considering replacing its old Polish and
Soviet-built jets with modern fighters as it prepares to join NATO,
but the decision has been delayed because of the nation's limited
defense budget.
	   President Aleksander Kwasniewski called Wednesday's crash a
tragedy.
	   Earlier, he laid flowers at the statue of Marshall Jozef
Pilsudski, considered a father of the fight for independence.
	   Presidents from Hungary, Lithuania, Romania and Ukraine watched
the celebrations together with thousands of Warsaw residents.
	   After being partitioned for 123 years by Austria, Russia and the
German state of Prussia _ Poland was unified in 1918 as an
independent country after World War I. It was re-partitioned by
Germany and the Soviet Union during World War II before taking its
present form in 1945.

Yemeni Cabinet approves budget with dlrs 411 million deficit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen's Cabinet on Wednesday approved a
budget for 1999 with a deficit of 41.18 billion riyals (dlrs 411
million), officials said.
	   The budget projects total expenditures of 335.59 billion riyals
(dlrs 3.35 billion), with 294.41 billion riyals (2.94 billion) in
revenues.
	   Yemen's fiscal year begins Jan. 1 and the budget must be
approved by Parliament, which will begin discussing it next week.
	   A government official said the government will focus on
increasing maintenance budgets for government departments and
completing health and educational institutions to improve services.
	   The budget for 1998 projected a deficit of 14 billion riyals
(dlrs 140 million).
	   Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East.
	   The government is running the economy under a sweeping
liberalization program supervised by the International Monetary
Fund.

	   Earlier Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed
the crisis with senior Cabinet ministers.
	   ``We are not a part of this conflict, except as members of the
United Nations,'' a Foreign Ministry official said after the
meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``And right now, the
issue is between the United States and Iraq.''
	   A special envoy of Jordan's King Hussein, Jawad Annani, met with
Netanyahu and Sharon on Wednesday, and officials in Amman said the
envoy apparently asked Israel to stay out of the Iraq crisis.
	   In the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel in
hopes of breaking up the Arab coalition against it. However, Israel
did not retaliate and the coalition held.
	   In a subsequent U.S.-Iraq crisis in February, Iraq did not make
any attempt to draw Israel into the dispute.
	   However, Israel appeared to be at least indirectly involved this
time. One report said U.S. President Bill Clinton may have urged
Netanyahu to speed up ratification of the peace accord with the
Palestinians in order to help Washington win Arab support for a
strike against Iraq.
	   Clinton called Netanyahu on Tuesday to discuss the
land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians and the Iraq
situation, U.S. officials said.
	   Implementation of the peace accord was to begin Nov. 2, but
Israel has put it on hold pending Cabinet approval of the
agreement. Netanyahu has postponed several Cabinet sessions on the
subject, but ministers were expected to ratify the deal Wednesday.
	   An Israeli official said the United States let it be known that
its policy of being tough on Iraq was encountering problems in the
Arab world because Israel had not moved forward on its
implementation of the Wye agreement. The official spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The Haaretz daily said there was speculation that Clinton told
Netanyahu in Tuesday's phone call that the Cabinet's failure to
ratify the agreement has made it difficult for the United States to
win support from Arab states against Iraq.

U.S. envoy resumes efforts to end Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ A former U.S. security adviser
resumed efforts Wednesday to resolve a six-month border conflict
between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
	   Anthony Lake was scheduled to talk with Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi at the beginning of a one-week mission, then fly to
Asmara on Thursday to meet Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
	   Although fighting between the two nations has subsided, both
sides have steadily massed troops and weapons along their border,
bracing for battles that threaten to erode stability throughout
northeast Africa.
	   Lake's mission is part of an ongoing effort by the Organization
of African Unity to peacefully settle the dispute, the State
Department said in a statement.
	   The OAU presented an 11-point peace proposal to the two sides in
Burkina Faso last weekend.
	   Ethiopia said Monday it accepted a key OAU proposal calling for
Eritrea to withdraw to positions it held before May 12, when
Ethiopian militia shot Eritrean soldiers they claimed had occupied
Ethiopian territory.
	   Eritrea again refused, saying it wants an international
monitoring force in place before it will withdraw troops from the
contested Badme and Shiraro areas.
	   The OAU gave Eritrea until the end of December to respond to its
proposals. The United States and Rwanda previously advanced a
similar plan.
	   Lake last visited Asmara and Addis Ababa on Oct. 7-8.
	   Eritrea fought a 30-year war against Ethiopia and was granted
independence in 1993, but the border between the two countries was
never officially declared.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's first full-fledged Jewish
school opened Wednesday, the latest result of an American
foundation's efforts to revive Jewish education in Eastern Europe.
	   The Jewish School of Sofia is the 12th such institution to open
in this post-communist region, backed by the Ronald S. Lauder
Foundation.
	   Some 350 students are enrolled in grades 1 through 8, studying
Jewish history and learning Hebrew as a second language along with
their regular secular curriculum.
	   Lauder, the American cosmetics heir and former U.S. ambassador
to Austria, provided dlrs 300,000 in funding and renovated the
86-year-old building where the school is located, in a traditional
Jewish neighborhood of Sofia.
	   The New York-based foundation's executive vice president,
Marjorie S. Federbush, addressed the opening ceremony and read a
message from Lauder.

Rusedski demolishes Haas, 6-1, 6-4; Martin also advances
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Rusedski defeating Haas; will be updated with
later matches &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ No one can be looking forward to
playing Greg Rusedski at this year's 825,000 dollars Stockholm Open
tennis tournament.
	   On Wednesday, Rusedski demolished Tommy Haas in straight sets,
6-1 and 6-4. The Briton broke Haas' first four service games and
closed out the first set in a quick 20 minutes.
	   For most of the way it was all Rusedski. Game four of the second
set was four aces and a double fault.
	   ``I couldn't be playing much better tennis if I tried,'' he said
after the match.
	   Rusedski is ranked No. 11 in the world and scrambling to qualify
for one of the last spots in the ATP Tour Championships in Hanover,
Germany.
	   ``I think I've got to get to the finals'' at the Stockholm Open,
he said. ``I'm just thinking about my tennis and everything else
will take care of itself.... If it works, it works. If it doesn't,
it doesn't.''
	   Rusedski is on a roll. Last week he beat world No. 1 Pete
Sampras at the Paris Open, a win he considers ``probably my
greatest accomplishment in tennis, by far.''
	   In other matches Wednesday, American Todd Martin defeated
Australia's hard-serving Wayne Arthurs, 6-4 and 6-3, to advance to
the second round.
	   In later matches, Sampras was scheduled to play Australia's
Jason Stoltenberg, and Briton Tim Henman, world No. 10, to play
South Africa's Wayne Ferreira.
	   Arthurs, a 27-year-old doubles specialist from Adelaide, got to
face Martin by upsetting tournament second seed and world No. 7
Karol Kucera of Slovakia the evening before. He started sharp with
three aces in his first game, but the more experienced Martin broke
his serve in game three of each set, and wore him down.
	   Martin's play was business-like. He rarely fell behind in the
count, won the big points including service breaks early in each
set, and never lost his serve.
	   Arthurs, ranked No. 168, notched at least one ace in every
service game except one, and had 15 overall.
	   The tournament is being played on the hard composition court of
the Kungliga Tennis Hall.

Yeltsin orders stop to bankruptcy proceedings against defense
</HEADLINE>
plants &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin ordered the government
Wednesday to stop bankruptcy proceedings against insolvent defense
plants.
	   In a decree, Yeltsin specifically instructed the government to
spare the Radio Instrument Research Institute, the Myasishchev
Experimental Machine-Building Plant and other companies producing
equipment crucial to national security, Yeltsin's office said in a
statement Wednesday.
	   The government has launched bankruptcy proceedings against
several dozen companies over their tax debts in an effort to boost
sluggish tax collection, which is crippling the cash-starved
country.
	   The Kremlin statement, carried by Russian news agencies, said
many companies have failed to pay their taxes primarily because of
the government's inability to pay its own debts to the companies.
	   Also, the bankruptcy proceedings effectively mean the companies
are being sold off, which contradicts the Russian law that bans
privatization of key defense plants, the statement said.
	   Yeltsin also told the Cabinet to draft a bill that would
specifically ban bankruptcy proceedings against major defense
plants.

Abubakar: Nigeria moves toward genuine economic reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria has started to privatize key
state-controlled industries as part of a government move toward
economic reform, the country's military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar said Wednesday.
	   ``Our privatization program kicked off last month,'' Abubakar
told delegates attending an economic forum in the capital Abuja.
``The responses are most encouraging as some 46 domestic and
foreign organizations have expressed interest in eight of the
advertised public enterprises.''
	   The state-controlled firms to either be fully or partially sold
off to the private sector include enterprises in
telecommunications, mining and energy.
	   Companies from the United States, Canada, Europe and South
Africa have expressed interest in investing in Nigeria, Abubakar
said of new investment opportunities created by the privatization
plan.
	   Under the privatization program, the government is offering 40
percent of government-owned companies to investors.
	   ``Investors, both domestic and foreign are therefore now free to
invest in the various sectors,'' Abubakar said.

Fiorentina lodges appeal against UEFA Cup exclusion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Fiorentina on Wednesday appealed the
decision to kick it out of the UEFA Cup because of an explosion
that injured a match official at last week's game against
Switzerland's Grasshoppers, UEFA said.
	   UEFA's appeals body will meet in Geneva Sunday to deal with the
case.
	   European soccer's governing body announced the ruling last
Sunday. The game was played on Nov. 3 in Salerno and not in
Florence, and the fan who tossed the explosive device from the
stands was apparently a supporter of rival Italian club
Salernitana.
	   UEFA ruled that Fiorentina was responsible for order and
security both inside and around the stadium, but said the
``mitigating circumstances'' stopped it being excluded from future
UEFA club competitions.
	   The game was being played in Salerno because Fiorentina was
paying the second and last round of suspension of its Franchi
stadium as a result of fan violence during a 1997 Cup Winners Cup
game.
	   UEFA said Fiorentina's previous bad record had been taken into
account in deciding on the expulsion.
	   Fiorentina and Salerno fans have a history of bitterness. But
Fiorentina wanted to raise funds for victims of recent flooding in
southern Italy and so played at the grounds of its rival.
	   Fiorentina, the Italian league leader, was 2-1 ahead after the
first 45 minutes of play. Having won the first leg against the
Swiss side 2-0, it expected easily to advance to the third round of
the UEFA Cup.
	   But the match was suspended after a Belgian off-field official
was injured by the device hurled from the stands at the interval.
	   Grasshoppers will face Bordeaux of France in the third round if
the ruling is upheld.

Strike by 100,000 government workers threatens Indian economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A nationwide strike by 100,000 revenue
workers threw exports into chaos Wednesday, and businessmen warned
of an industrial shutdown in an economy already struggling with a
slump.
	   The strike for higher wages by officers and other employees of
customs and tax departments began Tuesday, and its organizers vowed
to remain off work indefinitely if their demands were not met by
Thursday.
	   Trade-related operations were paralyzed at international
airports, cargo depots and ports across the country on the first
day, media reports said.
	   ``It will have a tremendously damaging impact,'' said M. Roy, a
director with the Confederation of Indian Industry. ``Imports and
exports will come to a grinding halt.''
	   The Federation of Indian Export Organizations said the strike
could send shock waves through India's economy, which faced
negative growth in the first six months of this fiscal year.
	   The economic losses on the first three days of the strike were
projected at 5 billion rupees (dlrs 120 million), Federation
president Ramu Deora said.
	   But federal Commerce Minister Ramakrishna Hegde struck an
optimistic note Wednesday, saying exports were set to grow by 15
percent this year, despite the slump. He promised new policies to
spur exports further.
	   ``I'm not a person to give up hope,'' Hegde told reporters
during a meeting of an Indo-Kenyan joint business council.
	   But the government's own estimates do not support Hegde's
optimism.
	   India's provisional trade deficit widened to dlrs 5 billion
during April-September, the first half of the fiscal year ending
March 31, compared with dlrs 2.5 billion in the same period a year
earlier, the Commerce Ministry said last week.
	   Exports fell 4.9 percent to dlrs 2.8 billion in September, the
latest month reported, from dlrs 2.9 billion in September 1997.
Imports for the same month rose more than 20 percent, according to
government estimates.

Cultural employees picket the government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ Employees of libraries, theaters and
the Kishinev Philharmonic picketed Moldova's government Wednesday
to protest unpaid salaries and a proposed slash in next year's
budget.
	   ``The government has to take us seriously, otherwise we will be
forced to close all these cultural establishments,'' said union
leader Serafim Fonari. He said employees will continue to picket
until the government resolves their problems.
	   On average, a librarian or a musician in the philharmonic in
this former Soviet republic makes 110 lei (dlrs 15) a month. Many
haven't been paid for months.
	   Late Tuesday, a group of protesters met with government
officials to negotiate unpaid salaries and to try to persuade the
government to keep the 1999 culture budget at the same level as
this year.
	   However, government officials, facing a plunging currency and
other economic problems indirectly connected the Russian crisis,
told the protesters they plan to cut the culture budget by 35
percent. This year it was 20 million lei (worth about dlrs 4
million at the beginning of 1998), but only half of the money has
been paid so far.
	   The government this year fired half the 18,000 workers in
Moldova's state-funded cultural institutions to save money.
	   ``I do not think we ought to be condemned to famine because we
work with the world's cultural values as music or literature,''
said Vasile Corojan, a librarian.

Fiorentina lodges appeal against UEFA Cup exclusion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in 2nd graf that Fiorentina wants game replayed. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Fiorentina on Wednesday appealed the
decision to kick it out of the UEFA Cup because of an explosion
that injured a match official at last week's game against
Switzerland's Grasshoppers, UEFA said.
	   UEFA's appeals body will meet in Geneva Sunday to deal with the
case. Fiorentina is hoping to have the game replayed.
	   European soccer's governing body announced the ruling last
Sunday. The game was played on Nov. 3 in Salerno and not in
Florence, and the fan who tossed the explosive device from the
stands was apparently a supporter of rival Italian club
Salernitana.
	   UEFA ruled that Fiorentina was responsible for order and
security both inside and around the stadium, but said the
``mitigating circumstances'' stopped it being excluded from future
UEFA club competitions.
	   The game was being played in Salerno because Fiorentina was
paying the second and last round of suspension of its Franchi
stadium as a result of fan violence during a 1997 Cup Winners Cup
game.
	   UEFA said Fiorentina's previous bad record had been taken into
account in deciding on the expulsion.
	   Fiorentina and Salerno fans have a history of bitterness. But
Fiorentina wanted to raise funds for victims of recent flooding in
southern Italy and so played at the grounds of its rival.
	   Fiorentina, the Italian league leader, was 2-1 ahead after the
first 45 minutes of play. Having won the first leg against the
Swiss side 2-0, it expected easily to advance to the third round of
the UEFA Cup.
	   But the match was suspended after a Belgian off-field official
was injured by the device hurled from the stands at the interval.
	   Grasshoppers will face Bordeaux of France in the third round if
the ruling is upheld.

Survey shows ruling African National Party losing support among
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Support for President Nelson
Mandela's governing African National Congress has suffered a major
drop in support while the number of undecided voters has increased,
an opinion poll released on Wednesday said.
	   The most comprehensive independent survey so far in the lead-up
to 1999 elections also showed that apartheid's ruling group, the
National Party, has lost many of its former backers.
	   The upswing in undecideds represented increasing dissatisfaction
with a struggling economy and the lack of viable alternatives to
the ANC, analysts said. The party led the struggle against white
minority rule for decades and dominates government.
	   ``Normally the support would go to other parties,'' said Bob
Mattes, an analyst at the Institute for Democracy in South Africa
that co-sponsored the poll. ``But opposition parties are not seen
as credible alternatives by (many) South Africans.''
	   If the elections were held tomorrow, only 51 percent would vote
for the ANC, down from 64 percent in 1995, a year after it won
democratic elections that ended white minority rule, the poll
found.
	   The National Party would claim 10 percent of the vote, down from
16 percent shortly after the election.
	   The tiny Democratic Party was the only party to show a gain,
going from 1 percent in 1994 to 7 percent.
	   Undecideds rose from 12 percent to 21 percent.
	   The poll, in which 2,200 eligible voters were queried, was
conducted in September by Markinor research group with the backing
of the nation's public broadcaster, SABC and the democracy
institute.
	   The pollsters cited a margin of error between 0.95 percent and
2.1 percent.
	   The ANC aims to increase its majority in Parliament to
two-thirds in 1999, up from the 60 percent it now holds.
	   But in a sign of increasing voter dissatisfaction, a majority of
those queried _ 56 percent _ said they had no strong identification
with any political party, a drastic shift from only 12 percent who
remained aloof from the ANC, NP and other parties in 1994.
	   The shift was important because voters who failed to identify
with one party were less likely to go out and vote, Markinor said.
	   With South Africa's 34 percent unemployment rate and the loss of
half a million jobs over recent years, the ANC's popularity is
closely linked to a declining economic situation, said Helen
Taylor, a democracy institute analyst assigned to study the 1999
elections.
	   ``It could be a general sense of dissatisfaction with the lack
of delivery in terms of 1994 election promises,'' she said in a
telephone interview. ``It could also be a sense of dissatisfaction
with the multiparty system.''

State Department says U.S. citizens may want to leave Mideast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a new travel advisory, U.S. citizens were
told Wednesday they may want to leave Israel and the Palestinian
areas because of the growing tensions between the United States and
Iraq.
	   The U.S. State Department has also authorized the departure
departure of employees in non-essential positions, the advisory
said. It was not clear whether employees of the U.S. Embassy in Tel
Aviv and the Consulate in Jerusalem were preparing to leave.
	   The advisory said that the United States has not ruled out any
options in trying to get Iraq to comply with a U.N.-mandated
weapons inspections program.
	   ``Iraq's continued defiance of the will of the international
community ... is heightening the level of risk to American citizens
in the Middle East,'' the statement said.
	   In previous crises surrounding Iraq, there was concern about
chemical and biological warfare and ``although such a risk is
remote, it cannot be excluded,'' the advisory said.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed
the crisis with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon to discuss the situation in Iraq.
	   Israel is trying to stay out of the confrontation, officials
said. ``We are not a part of this conflict, except as members of
the United Nations,'' a Foreign Ministry official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``And right now, the issue is between the
United States and Iraq.''
	   A special envoy of Jordan's King Hussein, Jawad Annani, met with
Netanyahu and Sharon on Wednesday, and officials in Amman said the
envoy apparently asked Israel to remain on the sidelines.
	   In the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel in
hopes of breaking up the Arab coalition against it. However, Israel
did not retaliate and the coalition held.
	   In a subsequent U.S.-Iraq crisis in February, Iraq did not make
any attempt to draw Israel into the dispute.
	   However, Israel appeared to be at least indirectly involved this
time.
	   One report said U.S. President Bill Clinton may have urged
Netanyahu to speed up ratification of the peace accord with the
Palestinians in order to help Washington win Arab support for a
strike against Iraq.
	   Clinton called Netanyahu on Tuesday to discuss the
land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians and the Iraq
situation, U.S. officials said.
	   Implementation of the peace accord was to begin Nov. 2, but
Israel has put it on hold pending Cabinet approval of the
agreement. Netanyahu has postponed several Cabinet sessions on the
subject, but ministers were expected to ratify the deal Wednesday.
	   An Israeli official said the United States let it be known that
its policy of being tough on Iraq was encountering problems in the
Arab world because Israel had not moved forward on its
implementation of the Wye agreement. The official spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The Haaretz daily said there was speculation that Clinton told
Netanyahu in Tuesday's phone call that the Cabinet's failure to
ratify the agreement has made it difficult for the United States to
win support from Arab states against Iraq.

Italian premier urges European countries to invest in jobs

	   ROME (AP) - Europe needs to invest more in job creation and
reward the people who tightened their belts so their countries
could get into the European Monetary Union, Italian premier Massimo
D'Alema said in an interview published Wednesday.
	   D'Alema, a former Communist who became premier three weeks ago,
urged the monetary union to relax its rules to exempt investments
in job creation from government budget deficit calculations.

Lareau upsets Kremlin Cup top seed Corretja
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Canadian Sebastien Lareau upset top-seeded Alex
Corretja of Spain in the second round of the dlrs 1.1 million
Kremlin Cup on Wednesday.
	   For Lareau, a 25-year-old doubles specialist, it was the second
upset of a top-ten player since 1996, when he downed Michael Stich
of Germany, ranked fourth at that time.
	   After trading serve breaks early in the first set, both players
held serve in the next two games, when Lareau broke Corretja three
more times in the first set to win it 6-3.
	   ``I played very well, I was returning very well,'' Lareau told
reporters. ``It was my last big tournament of the year, so I just
wanted to go out and play as wise as I can.''
	   The Canadian closed the second set 6-3.
	   ``He was a tough opponent today. He was playing much better then
me,`` Corretja, who has already qualified for the ATP Championship
in Hanover, Germany, later this month, said.
	   In other action Wednesday, German qualifier Lars Burgsmuller
made his way to the quarterfinals as he ousted Sjeng Schalken of
the Netherlands, 6-3, 5-7 while Guillaume Raoux of France defeated
Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands, 6-2, 7-5.

French league chief speaks out against new Confederations Cup dates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS _ The president of the French league says that the new
dates for the controversial Confederations Cup will create as many
problems as those originally proposed by world governing body FIFA,
according to French press reports Wednesday.
	   FIFA originally planned the Confederations Cup for January 1999,
but rescheduled it to August after complaints that the competition
would fall during European domestic leagues.
	   But that hasn't reduced opposition to the event.
	   ``I don't understand,'' said Noel Le Graet, in French sports
daily L'Equipe. ``The new dates pose the same problems as January,
perhaps even more.''
	   Le Graet, speaking in Geneva after a UEFA working group on
television rights, said that the new dates would mean players
missing the start of the 1999-2000 season.
	   He added that the proposed new structure of the European
Champions league only adds to the pressure on schedules in August.
	   Le Graet suggested that the competition take place in June.
	   ``In July and August the big clubs will complain like they did
about January,'' he said.
	   France pulled out of the competition last month after many
European clubs and domestic leagues made it clear they didn't want
to release their French players for the event.
	   Many European leagues and clubs belittle the Confederations Cup
but FIFA, which is looking to expand its influence by promoting
more of its own tournaments, is determined that the tournament go
ahead.
	   FIFA says that a decision on a possible change of date will be
taken next Tuesday.
	   Apart from France, FIFA invited Brazil, Mexico, Bolivia, the
United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Australia to appear in the
competition.

Internet afficionados protest price hikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Internet users urged Czechs to
stay off the phone for a day, to protest planned price hikes from
Czech Telecom, organizers said Wednesday.
	   In a move already approved by the Finance Ministry, Czech
Telecom announced plans to raise costs of local phone calls by 62
percent in 1998.
	   In 1995, TelSource a Dutch-Swiss consortium acquired the company
for dlrs 1,32 billion. The government issued a guarantee of
monopoly until the year 2000 as part of the deal.
	   Telecom's monopoly and its alleged abuse has often been
criticized, but the current move is seen as undermining widespread
internet use.
	   While average users now pay about dlrs 50 per month to get
online, the price hike will make it dlrs 180, turning the internet
into a luxury in a country where the average monthly income is dlrs
320.
	   ``On Nov. 18 we plan to boycott the use of phones for one day,''
said Ondrej Neff, one of the protest's organizers. According to
Neff, over 40,000 users have already signed a petition protesting
the planned increase.
	   There are some 80,000 private internet users in the Czech
Republic, but the number of those with access to the web is
estimated at 200,000. Internet use amounts to some 2 percent of
Czech Telecom's turnover.
	   ``We know it won't hurt them economically, but we wish to show
them we don't like what they do,'' Neff said.

	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   The remains of a cold front continue to hover over the Virgin

	   High seas and swells are adding to this unsafe marine situation.
An intensifying storm in the central Atlantic is producing the
northeast swells.
	   Small craft advisories remain in effect for the coastal waters.
The marine conditions will progressively get worse the rest of this
week and the weekend. Heavy surf advisories may later be issued for
the exposed beach areas.

China protests US moves on Taiwan, Dalai Lama
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Claiming interference in its domestic affairs,
China on Wednesday protested U.S. decisions to allow the Dalai Lama
meet the president in Washington and to approve a Cabinet
minister's official visit to Taiwan.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's meeting with the Dalai Lama and
U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson's visit to Taiwan, both on
Tuesday, violated U.S. commitments to recognize Beijing's rule over
Tibet and to refrain from political ties with Taiwan, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said.
	   The meetings raised Chinese fears that Washington would support
either of the two regions resisting Beijing's control.
	   For the first decades of the Cold War, Washington was an ally of
Taiwan, an island China claims as a rebel province, and provided
funding for separatist guerrillas inside Tibet, the Himalayan
region Beijing has ruled often harshly for 48 years.
	   China has tried to woo and pressure foreign governments to keep
Taiwan diplomatically isolated to deny its government international
legitimacy and to undermine credibility and popularity abroad of
the exiled Dalai Lama.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu criticized Washington for going
ahead with the meetings despite ``strong opposition'' from China.
	   ``The Chinese government expressed its serious concern and
strong displeasure over these erroneous U.S. moves on the part of
the U.S. side and made a protest against the U.S. government,'' Zhu
said in a statement released by the official Xinhua News Agency.
	   ``What the U.S. side has done is in total contravention of the
basic principles governing international relations such as
noninterference in other countries' internal affairs,'' Zhu said.
	   He urged Washington to restrict relations with Taiwan to
unofficial ties and called Richardson's trip a ``serious
violation'' of previous agreements.
	   The Chinese spokesman also called the Dalai Lama a campaigner
for Tibetan independence and accused the exiled leader of ``trying
to conduct propaganda, shape international public opinion and cover
up his deceptive tricks.''
	   The invective was part of a barrage of criticism China unleashed
over the past week as the exiled Tibetan leader began a 10-day U.S.
trip. During his Washington stay, the Dalai Lama had been expected
to offer a conciliatory response to Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
offer to hold talks.
	   But the Dalai Lama delivered a muted assessment Tuesday. He
repeated that he sought true autonomy, not independence, for Tibet,
but acknowledged that there was ``deep distrust'' between Tibetans
and the Chinese government.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Friday the 13th will be a lucky
day for Dutch hares.
	   The hares have recently become sitting ducks as they huddle on
high ground because the low-lying fields they usually call home
have been flooded by heavy rainfall.
	   But as of this Friday _ the 13th _ hunters in the northern
Netherlands will have to abide by a two-week cease fire imposed by
the government or face prosecution.
	   ``Hares are forced to head for the high ground where they become
an easy target,'' the government said Wednesday in a press release
explaining the decision.
	   Wild hare is traditionally dished up as a Christmas Day delicacy
in many Dutch homes.

Burundian army expresses regret for killing innocent civilians

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Burundi's army, in a rare apology,
Wednesday expressed regret for killing innocent civilians in an
operation to hunt down rebels.
	   The army said early reports indicated 30 people were wrongly
killed, but investigators would determine the exact number and who
was to blame.
	   Survivors said the minority Tutsi-led army killed more than 100
mostly Hutu civilians in retaliation for a Hutu rebel attack on a
nearby camp for Tutsis.
	   Rebels attacked the camp at Maramvya, 35 kilometers (20 miles)
southeast of the capital, Bujumbura, the night of Oct. 30-31,
killing five people, survivors told independent radio Studio
Ijambo.
	   The army said the Force for the Defense of Democracy, FDD, and
the National Liberation Front, FNL, were to blame.
	   ``The innocent civilians were killed following confusion when
the army was tracking down FDD and FNL armed groups in the
region,'' an army statement said.
	   The army attack early last week was the deadliest since a third
round of peace talks ended in October with little progress.
	   Hutu rebels are fighting to topple the military government of
Pierre Buyoya, a member of the Tutsi minority, which accounts for
14 percent of Burundi's population of 6 million. Hutus account for
85 percent.
	   Soldiers in the Tutsi-dominated military in the past have killed
Hutu civilians in retaliation for rebel attacks, especially those
on Tutsi civilians and army patrols and outposts.
	   More than 200,000 people died in violence that broke out in
Burundi in 1993, after Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Burundi's
first democratically elected president, Melchoir Ndadaye, a Hutu.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Security Council to meet on Iraq, adds

 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council called an
emergency meeting on Iraq Wednesday as Secretary-General Kofi Annan
appealed to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to immediately resume
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Russia requested the council meeting after more than 400 U.N.
personnel were pulled out of Iraq amid preparations for airstrikes
by the United States, which is considering the attack to compel
Iraq to allow inspections of its weapons programs to go forward.
	   The United States, which holds the rotating presidency of the
Security Council, scheduled the meeting for 2030 GMT, the U.S.
Mission to the United Nations said.
	   A statement from Annan, who is traveling in north Africa, was
issued at the United Nations shortly after the U.N. personnel left
Baghdad. He urged Iraq to allow the inspectors to carry out their
work for the good of the Iraqi people and the world.
	   Saying he was ``saddened and burdened'' by Iraq's decision to
halt dealings with the inspectors, the U.N. chief reiterated that
economic sanctions against Baghdad can only be lifted if Iraq fully
cooperates with the Security Council.
	   Iraq has said it will not cooperate with inspectors until the
Security Council begins to lift the debilitating embargo imposed
after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War.
	   Iraq barred the U.N. commission known as UNSCOM, which is
charged with ensuring that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction, from carrying out spot inspections on Aug. 5. After
the council offered Baghdad a comprehensive review of its
compliance with U.N. resolutions _ without linking it to the
possible lifting of sanctions _ Iraq halted all dealings with
UNSCOM on Oct. 31.
	   Annan, who helped defuse the last crisis with Iraq in February,
said he wants to see sanctions lifted ``so that Iraq can regain its
place among the community of nations.''
	   The Security Council's offer of a comprehensive review was the
way forward, he said.
	   ``I firmly believe that this offers Iraq a genuine opportunity.
The comprehensive review will map out the remaining steps, provided
Iraq cooperates, thus allowing them to see light at the end of the
tunnel,'' Annan said.
	   ``I strongly urge President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi
government to rescind its decision and resume immediate
cooperation'' with inspectors, he said. ``This would be good for
the Iraqi people, for the region and for the world.''

Campbell leads Zimbabwe to 205 against India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Captain Alistair Campbell
hammered an unbeaten 83 Wednesday as Zimbabwe reached 205 against
India in the Coca Cola Trophy.
	   Campbell hit five boundaries and two sixes in his 110-ball knock
in a game whose outcome had no bearing on the result of the
three-nation tournament. Zimbabwe and India are already in final,
which will be held Friday. Sri Lanka was knocked out earlier.
	   On Wednesday, Zimbabwe and India rested some of their key
players. The Africans batted without Paul Strang, Eddo Brandes and
Heath Streak, while India fielded without Captain Mohammed
Azharuddin and key bowlers Javagal Srinath and Anil Kumble.
	   Campbell came to Zimbabwe's rescue when it was reeling at five
for 65 in 18.5 overs. He shared a 55-run partnership with Gavin
Rennie (28) for the sixth-wicket.
	   Campbell also was involved in the seventh wicket partnership of
81 with Andrew Whittall (29). India's fast bowler Venkatesh Prasad
dismissed two for 42 runs, while off-spinner Nikhil Chopra was the
most economical, conceding just 24 runs in his 10 overs spell.
	   Sri Lanka, which failed to qualify for the final of the dlrs

Greece publishes historical archives on Jewish community
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By PATRICK QUINN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ In dry official documents and evocative
private letters, the passages chronicle the life and death of one
of the most vibrant Jewish communities in the Balkans.
	   But the vivid details contained in some the foreign ministry's
archives, released Wednesday in a 472-page book, may not just help
illuminate one of Europe's least researched Jewish populations.
	   Delving into the Greek archives could also aid those trying to
trying fit together the jigsaw of looted Nazi gold.
	   ``We come to the real problem that the appearance of this volume
punctures like a lance in the boil of denial. Nazis expropriated,
exploited and then killed the Jews. But after the war _ who got the
loot?'' asked Steven Bowman, a professor of Judaic studies at the
University of Cincinnati, who helped compile the English-language
volume.
	   More than 90 percent of Greece's 80,000 or so Jews perished in
Nazi death camps and less than 5,000 remain today.
	   Bowman said it contained many previously unpublished official
documents that languished in the foreign ministry archives until
three years ago.
	   At that time, Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos decided to put
some order to the thousands of documents gathering dust in his
ministry's catacomb-like basements.
	   The first compilation of archives, published last year,
concerned the Dodacanese islands obtained from Italy following War
War II.
	   The Jewish volume is also an act of contrition of sorts for
Greece.
	   Although it was one of the only countries to return all the
Jewish properties lost during the Holocaust, it also took more than
50 years to fully honor the Jewish community. Pangalos unveiled
Greece's first Holocaust memorial one year ago.
	   The foreign ministry will ship 25 crates full of archival
documents to the Holocaust Museum in Washington for study. The
papers could open new avenues for Nazi gold investigators.
	   Among the nuggets in the archives are the official dispatches
from Greek diplomats who attended 1946 talks between the victorious
Allies and the Swiss government on Nazi German funds held in its
banks.
	   Switzerland stayed out of the war, but was subsequently accused
by Jewish groups of profiting from the Holocaust and retaining the
assets of slain Jews and acting as banker to the Nazis.
Switzerland's two biggest banks agreed in August to pay dlrs 1.25
billion in settlement of survivors' claims.
	   Both the book and the documents will be used at a December
conference in Washington on plundered Nazis treasure. Some 40
countries have been invited to attend the four-day conference.
	   The book's 159 documents from 1903 to 1957 also contain rare
insights into Greek Jews _ a community with roots dating back
nearly 3,000 years.
	   They provide a glance into the hopes, aspirations and later
death throws of the community in the northern port of Salonica _
once known as the ``Pearl of Israel'' and home to the Sephardic
Jews who fled there from Spain following the Inquisition in the
15th century.
	   Pangalos also said the change of government in Germany may spur
Greece to claim dlrs 7.2 billion in war reparations. That money was
given to Germany as a loan by then-occupied Greece.
	   ``There will be new discussion and the return of this loan, this
theft, will be raised so this demand can be satisfied,'' said
Pangalos.

State Department says U.S. citizens may want to leave Mideast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with U.S. State Department authorizing
departure of diplomatic personnel. No Pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a new travel advisory, U.S. citizens were
told Wednesday they may want to leave Israel and the Palestinian
areas because of the growing tensions between the United States and
Iraq.
	   The U.S. State Department has also authorized the departure of
employees in nonessential positions, the advisory said. It was not
clear whether employees of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv and the
Consulate in Jerusalem were preparing to leave.
	   The U.S. advisory said that the United States has not ruled out
any options in trying to get Iraq to comply with a U.N.-mandated
weapons inspections program.
	   ``Iraq's continued defiance of the will of the international
community ... is heightening the level of risk to American citizens
in the Middle East,'' the statement said.
	   In previous crises surrounding Iraq, there was concern about
chemical and biological warfare and ``although such a risk is
remote, it cannot be excluded,'' the advisory said.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed
the crisis with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon to discuss the situation in Iraq.
	   But officials said Israel is trying to stay out of the
confrontation, officials said. ``We are not a part of this
conflict, except as members of the United Nations,'' a Foreign
Ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``And
right now, the issue is between the United States and Iraq.''
	   A special envoy of Jordan's King Hussein, Jawad Annani, met with
Netanyahu and Sharon on Wednesday, and officials in Amman said the
envoy apparently asked Israel to remain on the sidelines.
	   In the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel in
hopes of breaking up the Arab coalition against it. However, Israel
did not retaliate and the coalition held.
	   In a subsequent U.S.-Iraq crisis in February, Iraq did not make
any attempt to draw Israel into the dispute.
	   However, Israel appeared to be at least indirectly involved this
time.
	   One report said U.S. President Bill Clinton may have urged
Netanyahu to speed up ratification of the peace accord with the
Palestinians in order to help Washington win Arab support for a
strike against Iraq.
	   Clinton called Netanyahu on Tuesday to discuss the
land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians and the Iraq
situation, U.S. officials said.
	   Implementation of the peace accord was to begin Nov. 2, but
Israel has put it on hold pending Cabinet approval of the
agreement. Netanyahu has postponed several Cabinet sessions on the
subject, but ministers were expected to ratify the deal Wednesday.
	   An Israeli official said the United States let it be known that
its policy of being tough on Iraq was encountering problems in the
Arab world because Israel had not moved forward on its
implementation of the Wye agreement. The official spoke on
condition of anonymity.

Joint German-French military brigade marks Armistice Day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With France-Great War-Anniversary &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WEISSWASSER, Germany (AP) _ A joint German-French military
brigade marked Armistice Day, the 80th anniversary of the end of
World War I, with a roll call Wednesday symbolizing the
reconciliation between two former enemies.
	   ``Living in peace is the highest honor we can pay those who died
for their countries during the Great War,'' said the unit's
commander, Gen. Alain Lefevre.
	   The bilingual brigade, set up in 1987, is a symbol of the
friendship ``that is lived by our two, reconciled countries,''
Lefevre said.
	   Soldiers in the brigade must speak both French and German. It is
stationed in the southwest German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, near
the border with France, and has been part of NATO's rapid reaction
force since 1995.
	   Armistice Day is not officially celebrated in Germany, which was
defeated in the two world wars of this century. But the brigade's
deputy commander, Claude Kawka, said the day had changed from one
of anti-German feeling in France to joint remembrance of the war
dead.
	   The day symbolized ``that we are making progress on the road to
Europe,'' said Kawka.
	   Holding the ceremony in the former East German state of Saxony,
close to the Polish border, gave added meaning to the ceremony,
said Kawka, as it symbolized the end of another great rivalry of
this century _ between communist East Germany and the capitalist
west.

Lareau upsets Kremlin Cup top seed Corretja

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Canadian Sebastien Lareau upset top-seeded Alex
Corretja of Spain in the second round of the dlrs 1.1 million
Kremlin Cup on Wednesday.
	   For Lareau, a 25-year-old doubles specialist, it was the second
upset of a top-ten player since 1996, when he downed Michael Stich
of Germany, ranked fourth at that time.
	   After trading serve breaks early in the first set, both players
held serve in the next two games, when Lareau broke Corretja three
more times in the first set to win it 6-3.
	   ``I played very well, I was returning very well,'' Lareau told
reporters. ``It was my last big tournament of the year, so I just
wanted to go out and play as wise as I can.''
	   The Canadian closed the second set 6-3.
	   ``He was a tough opponent today. He was playing much better then
me,'' Corretja, who has already qualified for the ATP Championship
in Hanover, Germany, later this month, said.
	   In other action Wednesday, German qualifier Lars Burgsmuller
made his way to the quarterfinals as he ousted Sjeng Schalken of
the Netherlands, 6-3, 5-7 while Guillaume Raoux of France defeated
Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands, 6-2, 7-5.

	   MESEN, Belgium (AP) _ In ceremony packed with symbolism for
efforts to end conflict in today's Ireland, the British monarch and
the Irish president on Wednesday jointly unveiled a monument to
50,000 Irishmen _ Catholics and Protestants _ who died in World War
I.
	   The monument ``seeks to use their tremendous sacrifice as the
basis on which to forge a deeper understanding and respect between
traditions,'' Irish President Mary McAleese wrote in the program to
Wednesday's ceremony.
	   Queen Elizabeth II, McAleese and Belgium's King Albert II opened
the Island of Ireland Peace Park, crowned with a replica of a
Celtic round tower, on the 80th anniversary of the armistice that
ended the First World War.
	   It was built on the site of the battle of Messines Ridge where
in 1917 Catholic and Protestant Irishmen serving in the British
army battled shoulder-to-shoulder against the Germans.
	   Built by young Irish people from both sides of the religious
divide, the tower is the first monument to the fallen of World War
I paid by the Irish government, which for decades ignored the
ultimate sacrifice of those who fought for Britain.
	   Though men of the 36th Ulster division and the 16th Irish
Division fought and died in the same trenches, they returned home
after the armistice to very different receptions.
	   Protestant Ulstermen were welcomed as heroes. Their suffering
helped forge the identity of the pro-British community in Northern
Ireland.
	   But in the south of Ireland, marked by the failed 1916 Easter
uprising against British rule, the veterans who fought under
British colors were often denounced as traitors.
	   Now Irish leaders hope that by honoring the 30,000 Catholics and
20,000 Protestants who perished in the war they can help heal the
scars of the more recent conflict in Northern Ireland and
strengthen the peace process there.
	   The men behind the peace park themselves symbolized that spirit
of reconciliation.
	   Paddy Harte is Catholic. For 35 years, he served as a lawmaker
in the Irish parliament. Glen Barr is an Ulster Protestant who
strongly defended British rule in the province.
	   ``As Catholics and Protestants we apologize for the terrible
deeds we have done to each other,'' the two men said, reading
simultaneously from a statement. ``Let us remember the solidarity
and trust of Catholic and Protestant soldiers as they fought
together in these trenches.''
	   In the fading autumn sunlight, the heads of state laid wreaths
at the foot of the tower as buglers played Taps, or The Last Post
as it is know in Britain.
	   A few meters (yards) away in the little red-brick village of
Mesen, rebuilt after the war, local people draped their homes with
Britain's Union Jack and the green, white and orange tricolor of
Ireland.

French league chief speaks out against new Confederations Cup dates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The president of the French league says that the
new dates for the controversial Confederations Cup will create as
many problems as those originally proposed by world governing body
FIFA, according to French press reports Wednesday.
	   FIFA originally planned the Confederations Cup for January 1999,
but rescheduled it to August after complaints that the competition
would fall during European domestic leagues.
	   But that hasn't reduced opposition to the event.
	   ``I don't understand,'' said Noel Le Graet, in French sports
daily L'Equipe. ``The new dates pose the same problems as January,
perhaps even more.''
	   Le Graet, speaking in Geneva after a UEFA working group on
television rights, said that the new dates would mean players
missing the start of the 1999-2000 season.
	   He added that the proposed new structure of the European
Champions league only adds to the pressure on schedules in August.
	   Le Graet suggested that the competition take place in June.
	   ``In July and August the big clubs will complain like they did
about January,'' he said.
	   France pulled out of the competition last month after many
European clubs and domestic leagues made it clear they didn't want
to release their French players for the event.
	   Many European leagues and clubs belittle the Confederations Cup
but FIFA, which is looking to expand its influence by promoting
more of its own tournaments, is determined that the tournament go
ahead.
	   FIFA says that a decision on a possible change of date will be
taken next Tuesday.
	   Apart from France, FIFA invited Brazil, Mexico, Bolivia, the
United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Australia to appear in the
competition.

	   YPRES, Belgium (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II completed a day of
World War 1 commemorations in France and Belgium with an act of
remembrance at a monumental arch in this Flanders Fields town that
bears the names of 55,000 Commonwealth soldiers whose remains were
never found.
	   And in a ceremony of equal historic resonance in nearby Mesen,
she and Irish President Mary McAleese dedicated a monument to
50,000 Irishmen _ Catholics and Protestants _ who died in the Great
War.
	   Their sacrifice has been ignored at home for decades because
they fought for Britain while Ireland revolted against British
rule.
	   The Island of Ireland Peace Park was inaugurated amid hopes it
will help reconciliation across the religious divide of today's
Ireland.
	   The two ceremonies here capped a day of grand, poignant events
marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War that began in
Paris under a bright blue sky.
	   It was the last major anniversary of the Great War likely to
include actual veterans of the carnage.
	   That scope of that carnage becomes painfully clear at the Menin
Gate.
	   The queen joined Belgian King Albert II at the 30-meter tall
stone archway inscribed with the names of 55,000 soldiers who died
in the battlefield trenches around Ypres.
	   The area has been made famous by a poem by John McCrae, a
Canadian soldier, after a friend was killed during a 1915 battle
here.
	   It begins with the memorable lines: ``In Flanders fields the
poppies blow, Between the crosses, row on row...''
	   The gateway _ at which a local fire department bugler still
plays the mournful Last Post daily _ is dedicated ``to the armies
of the British Empire who stood here from 1914 to 1918 and to those
of their dead who have no known graves.''
	   As Queen Elizabeth and King Albert II and veterans from various
nations observed a minute of silence under the arch, thousands of
poppy petals rained down from the cavernous gateway as the sun
bathed the site in the last light of day.
	   The 80th anniversary of when the guns fell silent _ at the 11th
hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 _ was marked in
Paris with all the pomp and ceremony the French stage so well.
	   At the stroke of 11, Queen Elizabeth arrived at the Arc de
Triomphe where she was greeted by President Jacques Chirac. Under
the arch she laid a wreath by the eternal flame at the Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier.
	   The two leaders met with four World War I veterans _
101-year-old Gen. Maurice Bourgeois; Abramo Pellencin, 102; Guy
Cohen, 101, and Georges Rideau, 101.
	   The Great War was to be 0ver quick, a ``war to end all wars.''
But it became a four-year nightmare of unimaginable brutality in
which millions died.
	   Today, the French-Belgian border is strewn with cemeteries
holding the remains of soldiers of many nations who died in a war
that saw the introduction of poison gas with appalling efficiency.
	   Germany's new chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder was absent from the
ceremonies here and in France. Last month his office cited a heavy
workload. On Wednesday it let it be known there been ``no direct
invitation'' and any French interpretation of his no-show as a snub
was a ``misunderstanding.''
	   The war killed 13 million civilians and 8.5 million fighting
men. Germany lost an estimated 1.7 million soldiers; Britain lost
more than 900,000; Italy 650,000; the United States 116,000. France
was proportionally the hardest hit, with 1.3 million dead.
	   The sheer devastation wrought on France can partly be measured
by the 30,000 or so monuments in cities, towns and villages across
the nation. Some villages list more war dead than their current
populations.

Ukraine's defense minister pleads for more money for the military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's military may be virtually without
money next year if the government does not allocate more funds in
the 1999 budget to support the army and pay off its debts, the
defense minister warned Wednesday.
	   Oleksandr Kuzmuk said the government earmarked only 1.6 billion
hryvna (dlrs 485 million) for the Defense Ministry for 1999, while
the army would need at least twice that much.
	   The army's debt for energy supplies and other services is 936
million hryvna (dlrs 274 million), he said. If those debts are
paid, Ukraine's military would ``exist no more than a month in
1999'' unless more money is allocated, Kuzmuk said, according to
the Interfax news agency.
	   He said Ukraine spends only 1.4 percent of its gross domestic
product on the military, which is much less than in other Eastern
European states.
	   Ukraine's army, like those in other former Soviet republics, has
been struggling since the 1991 Soviet collapse and the loss of huge
Soviet-era defense funding.
	   Ukraine's military comprises about 320,000 people, down from its
pre-independence level of 900,000.

Government will not fund de Klerk's case against truth panel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela's office
on Wednesday said it will refuse to pay the legal fees for former
President F.W. de Klerk's court battle against a panel which found
him guilty of human rights abuses during apartheid.
	   ``We will not give him the money for this,'' Mandela's spokesman
Parks Mankahlana told the Associated Press.
	   De Klerk is seeking to stop the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission from publishing its finding that he was guilty.
	   The commission's final report was to have found de Klerk an
``accessory after the fact'' to bombings in the 1980s of the
headquarters of a church group and of a labor federation, which
housed anti-apartheid organizations.
	   The commission handed over its final report to Mandela last
month, but a passage on de Klerk was blacked out after a last
minute legal challenge.
	   Though the panel has vowed to fight de Klerk, the court case has
been postponed until March.
	   De Klerk's spokesman, David Steward, told the Associated Press
he would continue to press Mandela to fund the case, but would
still take the matter to court even if he had to pay for it
himself.
	   ``With or without the money we will still fight this case,'' he
said ``Mr. de Klerk believes he has a very strong case.''
	   As a former state official, de Klerk believes he qualifies for
government funding because the case involves acts carried out on
behalf of the state.
	   The Truth Commission was set up a year after 1994's all race
elections ended white rule and dumped de Klerk from power.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Exposure to frigid temperatures killed two people
in Moscow overnight as record cold temperatures chilled the Russian
capital, a news report said Wednesday.
	   Twenty-seven people were hospitalized in 24 hours with
cold-related ailments, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Nine other people have died from hypothermia over the past week
in Moscow.
	   After a relatively warm October, temperatures dipped to -19
degrees C (-2 F) in parts of Moscow overnight. That was the coldest
for this date in 30 years, the Moscow Times quoted meteorologists
as saying. Temperatures rose to -10 degrees C (14 F) during the day
Wednesday.
	   Dozens of people die on the streets of Moscow each winter. Most
of the victims are homeless or people who passed out while drunk.
	   In Vladivostok, the main city on Russia's east coast,
authorities have shut several schools in recent days or reduced the
duration of classes because they cannot afford to heat the
buildings.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Rain and hail brought an early
end to a visit Wednesday to Soweto by Brian Lara's West Indies
cricket team, starting a historic first official tour of South
Africa since the end of apartheid.
	   The rain-out was in keeping with the team's bad luck, which
arrived late in the country after a holdout over pay. A last-minute
agreement allowed the team to arrive Tuesday.
	   The Caribbean cricketers went up a Gauteng provincial 11 without
star batsman Jimmy Adams, who was being sent home because of a cut
finger.
	   Adams cut his right pinky with a bread knife during the flight
over from London Monday night. Manager Clive Lloyd said a doctor
predicted that it would take six weeks to heal, so Adams would
leave South Africa. No replacement was named.
	   Then the game started late because some team uniforms were lost
at the airport. The gear was recovered and brought out to the
Soweto cricket oval with pacemen Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh,
who had missed Tuesday's flight but came in Wednesday morning.
	   The early wash-out also ended hopes the locals had of a glimpse
of President Nelson Mandela, who was to have visited the grounds
briefly.
	   But the small crowd of mainly black fans in a country where
cricket is followed by whites was enthusiastic. They turned out in
a festive mood to welcome the West Indian players, who were
besieged by young fans who ran on to the field after the match was
called off. Brian Lara was mobbed more like a pop star than a
cricketer as he made his way around the grounds.
	   Officials said roughly 1,000 schoolchildren were bused in to the
oval, and several hundred other fans also attended.
	   This fixture, now a permanent part of any international cricket
tour, is part of the United Cricket Board of South Africa's drive
to take cricket into the underprivileged areas.
	   Lara, Carl Hooper, Philo Wallace and company did their bit on
the field too. Lara with a hard-hit 65, Hooper with 60 not out and
Wallace with a typically pugnacious 22 (which included four
boundaries) gave the plans plenty to be happy about.
	   With rain ending the day early, the Gauteng XI was unable to bat
in response to the West Indies' 258 for eight in 47 overs, so there
was no result.
	   For the home side there were some good bowling performances.
	   Left-arm spinner Goolam Bodi, from the Azaadville club, took
three wickets for just 38 in 10 overs with a fine display of flight
and guile while fast bowler Malan Morkel weighed in with two for
62.
	   Lara said it was his hope that the visit by his team would
ensure that the enthusiasm for cricket remained in these areas.
	   ``That is our main purpose in these games and if we can achieve
that, then we will have done well,'' he said.
	   The long-awaited tour should decide the No. 2 team after
Australia. The first test begins Nov. 26.
	   The West Indies dominated during the 1980s and 1990s until
slumping several years ago. It lost to Australia in 1995 and
1996-1997, and this year was blanked by Pakistan 3-0, though the
team beat England 3-1.

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina offered Wednesday at a
U.N. global warming summit to lead the developing world's efforts
to embrace voluntary cuts in their greenhouse gas output.
	   Major industrialized nations agreed last year in Kyoto, Japan,
to cut their pollution output by 2012, but the historic global
warming treaty merely asked poorer nations to do their best to
restrain their own emissions.
	   ``Not only can highly advanced countries contribute to a new
world order, but also emerging nations. We all have a
responsibilty,'' said President Carlos Menem, opening the last
phase of the 160-nation summit.
	   The role of developing nations is crucial to the fate of the
treaty, which requires the 38 industrialized nations that signed to
cut emissions, by 2012, to 5 percent below 1990 levels. But the
U.S. Senate says it will not ratify the treaty unless it leads to
emission reductions in the developing world.
	   When 160 nations kicked off the summit Nov. 2 in the Argentine
capital, Buenos Aires, delegates rebuffed the host country's effort
to add to the agenda pollution limits in the developing world. The
U.S.-backed proposal was blocked by several developing nations,
including India and China.
	   Undeterred, Menem said he would take up the initiative when
climate negotiators meet again.
	   ``We want to establish goals within the framework of the
convention. We haven't been able to do that until now but we will
work toward the goal at the next conference,'' Menem said.

Roy Evans' job in jeopardy as English giants disentegrate

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ The co-management partnership of Roy
Evans and Gerard Houllier appears doomed as Liverpool, one of
English soccer's most storied clubs, slides deeper into crisis.
	   Pressure was mounting Wednesday for Evans to resign or be fired
following two straight humiliating home defeats _ 2-1 to Derby in
the league last Saturday and 3-1 to Tottenham in the League Cup
Tuesday night.
	   To make things worse, 18-year-old star striker Michael Owen
injured his hamstring while scoring the consolation goal Tuesday
night. He's doubtful for Saturday's game against Leeds and
England's friendly against the Czech Republic next Wednesday.
	   What's more, midfielder Steve McManaman is out for at least six
weeks with a recurrence of an Achilles injury.
	   Liverpool fans jeered and booed the team off the Anfield pitch
Tuesday night. The headlines in Wednesday's tabloids blared: ``End
of the Roy Ride,'' ``Evans: the End,'' and ``Can it get any
worse?''
	   The evening edition of the Liverpool Echo ran the front-page
banner headline: ``Evans Set to Quit.''
	   Reports suggested Houllier could be in sole charge of the club
before Saturday's game at Leeds, with Evans given another job in
the organization.
	   Evans said the pressure was getting to him.
	   ``The speculation has been very difficult to live with,'' he
said. ``I have done this job with honesty and integrity and seeing
the club suffer affects me badly.''
	   Liverpool lags 11th in the Premier League standings, nine points
behind leader Aston Villa. Since going to the top of the table on
Sept. 9, the Reds have won only three games _ against Fulham in the
League Cup, Kosice in the UEFA Cup and Nottingham Forest in the
Premiership.

U.N. withdraws inspectors, relief workers from Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations evacuated all of its
weapons inspectors and most of its humanitarian workers from Iraq
on Wednesday, blaming fears of ``possible military action'' against
President Saddam Hussein's regime.
	   The hasty withdrawal _ conducted amid drenching rainstorms _
involved more than 400 U.N. staffers and raised fears that a
military strike by the United States and Britain is imminent.
	   Iraq showed no sign of backing down from its refusal to deal
with the arms inspectors, the nub of the crisis. The evacuation was
not reported by the Iraqi media, and there was little evidence of
Iraqis panicking or rushing to stock up on food.
	   Prakash Shah, the special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, said the withdrawal was ``in the background of possible
military action against Iraq. This is what we learned in our
consultations with New York.''
	   The United States and Britain have been threatening military
action since Iraq announced Oct. 31 that it was halting the
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   UNSCOM officials in Baghdad did not learn of plans to evacuate
until chief weapons inspector Richard Butler called from New York
at 4 a.m. Baghdad time Wednesday and ordered the entire staff out,
said UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross.
	   Speaking from Bahrain where she was evacuated, She said 103
staffers of UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency had
pulled out. UNSCOM field officer in Baghdad, Goran Wallen, said no
one from the commission was left behind in Iraq.
	   In addition, at least 300 of the 450 humanitarian workers in
Iraq withdrew Wednesday and were headed to the Jordanian capital of
Amman by road.
	   The departing U.N. workers gave hugs to colleagues remaining
behind _ including Iraq staff _ but refused to talk to reporters.
	   As the buses were leaving, U.N. workers were hanging mesh
screens over the glass windows of the U.N. headquarters on the
outskirts of Baghdad _ likely a precaution against flying glass in
the event of a military strike.
	   Iraq says it will not resume cooperation with UNSCOM unless the
U.N. Security Council moves to begin lifting trade sanctions
imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Shah told reporters he was in close contact with Iraq's Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   The Iraqis ``will not be able to desist from their position
unless the Security Council takes some action with regard to
sanctions against Iraq,'' Shah quoted Aziz as saying.
	   The U.N. employees left in two convoys of buses and a fleet of
white U.N. cars and vans. The first was led by a white van flying
the blue-and-white U.N. flag.
	   Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs here, said
that only ``a number of core (U.N.) officials will remain in
Baghdad.'' He declined to give figures.
	   U.N. officials said some of the humanitarian workers were en
route Wednesday to Baghdad from assignments in southern Iraq and in
Kurdish areas in the north. There were reports of a further U.N.
evacuation Thursday for these people.
	   Falt told reporters that the withdrawal was ``precautionary ...
temporary'' and ``solely with the safety of U.N. staff in mind.''
	   Most of the relief workers monitored the United Nation's
oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities
of crude oil to buy needed food and medicine for its 22 million
people.
	   It is not clear how the withdrawal will effect the program even
though Iraq has food in its warehouses. The pullout, however, is
likely to halt the work of other specialized agencies such as the
U.N. Children's Fund, the U.N. Development Program and the World
Health Organization.
	   Among those staying in the country were Shah and Hans von
Sponeck, the head of U.N. humanitarian operations who took up his
post in Iraq on Monday.
	   The first convoy of three buses, which appeared to carry mainly
U.N. weapons experts, left U.N. headquarters at about 10 a.m. (0700
gmt) The buses were accompanied by about 10 U.N. vans and cars.
	   The second convoy set out four hours later with five buses
carrying mainly relief workers across the desert to neighboring
Jordan.
	   Some U.N. people staying behind were seen carrying their
suitcases into U.N. headquarters, and it appeared they would both
work and sleep in the building. It's a brick structure, painted in
the blue and white colors of the United Nations, that bristles with
antennas for international communications.
	   The crisis had been simmering since Aug. 5 when Iraq said it was
halting the work of U.N. inspectors, who carried out unannounced
spot checks of suspected weapons sites. On Oct. 31, Iraq expanded
its work ban to UNSCOM monitors, who conduct long-term surveillance
to ensure Iraq doesn't rearm.
	   Iraq is required to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction
under U.N. resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War by U.S.-led
allies to evict Iraq out of Kuwait.
	   In the current crisis, Iraq has remained adamant about keeping
out UNSCOM despite threats of military strikes.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency on Wednesday quoted Abdel-Ghani
Abdel-Ghafour, a senior member of Saddam's ruling Baath party, as
saying that ``Arab nations _ both on popular and official
government levels _ reject continuing U.S. threats to launch a new
military aggression on Iraq.''
	   He said this showed ``how serious the Arabs are in their
solidarity with Iraq to lift the sanctions.''

Russian official proposes lowering tobacco import taxes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's cash-strapped government should reduce
the already low taxes on imported tobacco and increase taxes on
cigarettes to promote cigarette manufacturing in Russia, a top
official said Wednesday.
	   Since the 1991 Soviet collapse, Western tobacco companies have
found a friendly market in Russia, where many people smoke,
restrictions on cigarette advertising are negligible, and taxes are
low.
	   Many health-minded people have complained about the practice.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov said he has proposed to
the Cabinet that tobacco import taxes be further lowered, but
import taxes on cigarettes increased, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax
news agencies reported.
	   The move would encourage foreign cigarette manufacturers to stay
or even expand their operations in Russia, said Gustov, who was
touring the Khanty-Mansiisk region in the Urals on Wednesday.
	   Many foreign businesses have fled Russia since the latest
economic crisis hit in mid-August, causing many jobs for Russians
to disappear and the government's tax revenues to shrink.
	   Russia's government is eager to tighten control on all sources
of tax money, a large share of which now bypasses tax inspectors
through smuggling and evasion.
	   Lowered taxes on imported tobacco would help phase out
smuggling, by making the practice unprofitable, Gustov said.
	   He did not specify by how much the taxes should be changed.

Crisis in Iraq is at watershed, British military officials say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The crisis over weapons inspections in Iraq has
reached a ``watershed,'' with the international community united in
the belief that Saddam Hussein must be forced to comply, British
military officials said Wednesday.
	   Speaking after a trip to Kuwait and Bahrain to meet with Gulf
leaders, advisers to Defense Secretary George Robertson said the
tone of Arab nations appears changed since the standoff between the
Iraqi dictator and U.N. weapons inspectors in February.
	   During that crisis, most of the Arab governments were reluctant
to support any U.S. military action because they thought there was
still room for diplomacy to resolve the issue.
	   ``The mood is very different,'' said Bernard Gray, Robertson's
special adviser. ``Those in the region who argued in February that
we should give Saddam another chance and that he would comply have
been embarrassed by his flagrant flouting of the U.N.''
	   ``People are clear that a continuation of what's been going on
so far will not get results and one way or another we have to break
the logjam,'' Gray said.
	   ``I think everybody was united out there in seeing this as a
watershed moment,'' he added, warning Saddam not to
``miscalculate'' the intentions of the international community.
	   Britain and the United States have not ruled out military
strikes on Iraq to retaliate for its Oct. 31 decision to halt all
work by the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the dismantling
of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons program and long-range
missiles.
	   Iraq is required to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction
before U.N. sanctions can be lifted.
	   Baghdad says the disarmament work cannot resume until the U.N.
Security Council gives a timetable for lifting the economic
sanctions imposed after the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The Arab governments have always said publicly that they do not
support any military strike against Iraq for fear that they will
harm civilians.
	   But during the current crisis, there have no statements by any
Arab government expressing full support for Iraq and some even
criticized Iraq and urged flexibility.
	   Gray highlighted two conditions that he attributed to the
toughened stance of Arab nations.
	   ``People can see now that the United States is now pressing
Israel hard on progress on the peace process,'' he said. ``People
in the region are much happier now that the West is being
evenhanded in approaching regional issues and that we aren't simply
being tough on Saddam and letting Israel effectively do whatever it
wants to.''
	   Arab leaders also are ``much clearer'' that the suffering in
Iraq is the fault of Saddam, not the United Nations, he said.

After threat, most newspapers abandon sex ads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Most Greek newspapers left out ads for
phone sex lines and escorts Wednesday after authorities threatened
prosecution for notices deemed linked to prostitution.
	   At least one newspaper, the Athens daily Apoyevmatini, defied
the ban and ran over 150 ads. The paper called the threats of
prosecution a blow to press freedom.
	   Many daily newspapers usually carry several pages of ads for
escorts, phone sex lines and massages.
	   Athens' chief prosecutor Tuesday sent an order to police
demanding the arrest of the publisher and editor of any newspaper
that prints advertisements encouraging ``another's vice.''
	   Greek authorities are struggling with a growing corruption
scandal that includes allegations of police protection for
prostitution rings. Some government opponents have called for a
moral crusade in the traditionally conservative nation.
	   Prostitution is legal in Greece at state-sanctioned brothels.
But there are an estimated 20,000 unregistered prostitutes.

Head of Kosovo verification mission arrives as violence continues

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Peaceful resolution of the Kosovo
conflict is a long way off, the American head of a new foreign
mission to the Serbian province acknowledged Wednesday amid reports
of more violence.
	   NATO officials also voiced concern about continuing clashes in
Kosovo a month after an agreement aimed at halting the unrest.
	   U.S. diplomat William Walker, chief of a verification mission
still being put together, arrived in Pristina the day after three
Serb policemen were injured in an attack on their police station,
presumably by ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   The mission, organized by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, will send as many as 2,000 unarmed monitors
into the field to check whether Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic is complying with agreements he signed on ending the
hostilities.
	   Walker called it perhaps the last chance ``to avert an
irrational spiral of more violence'' in Kosovo, where the ethnic
Albanian majority seeks independence from Serb rule.
	   Serb forces in February launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists. Several hundred people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have
been killed and as many as 300,000 were driven from their homes.
	   The violence has continued past the Oct. 12 agreement by
Milosevic, under the threat of NATO airstrikes on his forces, to
sharply reduce the number of police and soldiers in Kosovo.
	   In the past week, at least two Serb policemen have been killed
and three injured, while six guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation
Army have died from police gunfire.
	   ``It is obvious that we have a long way to go from this
battlefield to the negotiating table,'' Walker said.
	   Western powers led by the United States believe the verification
mission will restore stability in Kosovo by having the unarmed
foreigners roaming the region to report on any violence or
violations of the agreements Milosevic reached with U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke and the OSCE.
	   Walker was unable to provide a firm date for launching the
mission, which will absorb a previous Kosovo observer mission that
started in July. He called it the most ambitious undertaking to
date of the 54-nation OSCE.
	   Security for the verifiers depended on guarantees given by
Milosevic and the rebels, Walker said.
	   Foreign nations sending verifiers to Kosovo ``gambling with the
lives of their citizens that the overwhelming majority of people in
Kosovo want the violence to end,'' he said.
	   But there was little sign of abating violence Wednesday.
	   In Glogovac, 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of Pristina, police
showed damaged walls at their station caused by a rocket fired
during an attack Tuesday night. Three policemen were injured.
	   Belgrade's Tanjug news agency also reported the guerrillas fired
grenades at police in Srbica, north of Glogovac, on Tuesday night.
No injuries were reported.
	   Police accuse the rebels of launching repeated attacks in recent
weeks to try to provoke a harsh response that could prompt world
leaders to order military attacks.
	   NATO officials fear that the recent incidents could lead to a
renewal of outright fighting in Kosovo.
	   ``There is a great deal of concern about the deteriorating
situation ... and the deaths that have occurred, and obviously we
condemn these incidents,'' a NATO official told reporters on
condition of anonymity after the weekly meeting of alliance
ambassadors in Brussels, Belgium.

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Japanese-born American geneticist
Susumo Ohno on Wednesday received the first-ever Royal Danish
Academy of Science and Letters' Research Prize for his
groundbreaking theories on the evolution of genes.
	   Lennart Olsson, of the Danish academy, said the 70-year-old
scientist's was picked for the award for producing a fundamental
theory that became part of the basic reasoning used by scientists
seeking to understand genetics.
	   The dlrs 100,000 award was presented to Ohno by Queen Margrethe,
Denmark's figurehead monarch, at a ceremony in Copenhagen.
	   ``In simple terms, Dr. Ohno argued that all new genes arise from
already existing genes through mutations and various changes,''
Olsson said in a speech honoring to Ohno, a native of Tokyo.
	   Ohno also coined the term ``junk DNA'' to underscore that most
of the chromosomes found in cells have no known function, and may
be irrelevant understanding why some traits are passed on between
generations.
	   Ohno graduated from the Tokyo University of Agriculture and
Technology with a degree in veterinary medicine. He went on to take
advanced degrees, including separate doctorates in 1956 and 1961,
from the University of Hokkaido, Japan.
	   During the 1950s, he was also a guest lecturer at the University
of California-Los Angeles, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in
1957, the academy said. He retired in 1996, but is still is
attached to the City of Hope National Medical Center in Los
Angeles, California.
	   The government-funded Royal Danish Academy of Science and
Letters' prize will be awarded annually to researchers for basic
scientific contributions that are recognized worldwide.

	   SAINT SYMPHORIEN, Belgium (AP) - Private George Lawrence Price,
killed two minutes before the Armistice, was honored by allied
forces Wednesday before fellow Canadian Fred Evans entered nearby
Mons again, 80 years after liberating the city.
	   Frail, yet alert, 101-year-old Private Evans was wheeled into
Mons' ornate Grand Place and laid a wreath under a bronze plaque
commemorating Canada's Nov. 11, 1918 liberation of the city.
	   ``Here was fired the last shot of the Great War,'' the plaque
reads. And Private Price, 25, was one of the last victims of four
years of unprecedented bloodshed.
	   ``It made it even more tragic that Pvt. Price was killed by a
sniper at 10:58, two minutes before the Armistice,'' said Canada's
Minister of Veterans Affairs Fred J. Mifflin.
	   Now Pvt. Price lies buried in the third row of an unassuming
plot of the military cemetery here among the remains of 528 enemy
German and allied British, Canadian and Irish soldiers.
	   Illuminated by a milky, early-morning light coming in through
the trees, Price's headstone briefly became an international center
of attention when Belgian Prince Laurent, Mifflin and Allied
military officials stood at attention when Taps, the Last Post, was
played by a solitary bugle.
	   Crowds were standing on the banks of a German and Canadian war
memorial alongside Price's grave.
	   The headstone was fully covered in wreaths, including one from
Price's sister. Belgian Geert Leeuwerck took his three children to
Price's grave and told them about the futility of war.
	   ``It's better to think first than to start shooting at one
another,'' said his 9-year-old son Gregoire.
	   The 17 Canadian veterans, many past 100, are nearing the end of
a week-long tour of the battlefields of northern France and Belgium
where they fought and canceled the visit to Price's grave at the
last moment because of fatigue.
	   They did attend the ceremonies in Mons, where they were the
center of attention _ especially Evans.
	   Evans was a runner for the 23rd Reserve Battalion, carrying
messages to and from the frontline. In November 1918 he was part of
the Pursuit to Mons, as the Germans quickly withdrew with the
allies in hot pursuit.
	   Then, as now at Price's cemetery, silence dominated on November
11.
	   ``It was nice to hear the shelling stop,'' said Evans Wednesday.
But he refused to drop his guard and celebrate too much that day,
having seen too much misery already.
	   ``We didn't dare rejoice too far,'' he said. Of the 650,000
soldiers Canada sent into Europe to fight with the allies, one out
of ten died.
	   Sixteen-year-old Torrey Swan of Calgary, Alberta, was especially
impressed when Evans joined the ceremonies in Mons.
	   ``I don't want the memory to die with their generation,'' Swan
said as the veterans were seated outside Mons city hall. ``It's
important that we remember,'' he said.

Talbott says U.S. pressuring India, Pakistan to reduce nuclear
</HEADLINE>
threat

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The United States is stepping up pressure on
India and Pakistan to reduce the threat of nuclear conflict, a
senior U.S. official told the Far Eastern Economic Review, the
magazine said in a press release Wednesday.
	   ``We're under no illusions that either country will alter or
constrain their defense programs under duress or simply because
we've asked them to,'' Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
said in the interview.
	   Instead, Washington is asking India and Pakistan to take ``five
practical steps'' which he says are fully consistent with their
security requirements, the magazine said.
	   The U.S. is urging the two countries to sign and ratify the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, tighten export controls on sensitive
materials and technologies, and hold talks to resolve their
long-standing dispute. Washington also wants the countries to halt
all production of weapons-grade nuclear material pending the
signing of the Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty. It is also asking
India and Pakistan to adopt prudent constraints on development and
deployment of missiles and aircraft capable of carrying weapons of
mass destruction, the release said.
	   ``Unless both India and Pakistan exercise genuine restraint and
great care, the delivery systems themselves could become a source
of tension and could, by their nature and disposition, increase the
incentive to attack first in a crisis,'' Talbott told the magazine.
	   Washington officials are quoted by the magazine as privately
acknowledging it is unrealistic to demand that India and Pakistan
halt their missile tests, but they want to adopt certain measures
that could reduce tension and the risk of accident.

Germany's new foreign minister wants to run a marathon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Joschka Fischer wants to be the first
German foreign minister to run in a marathon, preferably in New
York.
	   ``I want to run a marathon in what is a good time for someone my
age,'' the 50-year-old minister was quoted as saying Wednesday in
an interview with Gala magazine.
	   Fischer, a once-chubby member of the environmental Greens party,
became an avid jogger and disciple of healthy eating after
separating from his third wife in 1996.
	   He has lost about 35 kilos (77 pounds) since then and completed
his first marathon in Hamburg last April.
	   Fischer said he has managed to keep up his training since taking
office last month, and he even fit in a jog along the Mall in
Washington while on an official visit last week.
	   ``Nothing will change in my normal jogging training, except that
now it has to take place in deepest night. My days have grown very
long,'' Fischer was quoted as saying.

Birmingham selected as site for Davis Cup tie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ The National Indoor Arena in
Birmingham was selected Wednesday as the venue for the first-round
World Group Davis Cup tie between Britain and the United States
next April 2-4.
	   Britain, which returned to the top tier of the Davis Cup for the
first time since 1992, will feature a strong singles lineup of Greg
Rusedski and Tim Henman.
	   The United States, which has won more Davis Cup titles (31) than
any other country, fielded a second-string team and lost 4-1 to
Italy in the 1998 semifinals in September.
	   U.S. captain Tom Gullikson may have a hard time convincing his
top players, Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, to play against
Britain. Sampras does not consider Davis Cup a priority, and Agassi
refused to play against Italy in a dispute with USTA officials.

Turkey criticizes EU membership talks with Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Criticizing the European Union for
membership talks with Greek Cypriots, Turkey said Wednesday it
would move toward closer integration with the breakaway Turkish
Cypriot state.
	   ``Turkey and Turkish Cypriots have declared that they would
bring about a similar integration to that being realized between
Greece and Greek Cypriots through the EU,'' a Foreign Ministry
statement said. ``Turkey and Turkish Cypriots are determined to
press ahead with that policy.''
	   The statement was in response to the opening this week of EU
membership talks with Cyprus and five Eastern European nations.
	   Turkey and Turkish Cypriots oppose Cyprus' membership saying it
would raise tensions on the island and amount to integration with
EU-member Greece. Turkey has already signed a series of cooperation
agreements with the breakaway state designed to integrate their
economies.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek and Turkish sectors since
Turkey invaded the north of the island in 1974, following a
short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece. The Turkish
Cypriot state is only recognized by Ankara, which has 35,000 troops
there.

Fiorentina lodges appeal against UEFA Cup exclusion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Fiorentina on Wednesday appealed its
expulsion from the UEFA Cup, imposed by the organization because of
a security lapse in which a match official was injured by an
explosion at a game last week.
	   UEFA's appeals body was to meet in Geneva on Sunday to deal with
the case.
	   European soccer's governing body announced the ruling last
Sunday, after a fan tossed an explosive device from the stands
during the Nov. 3 Fiorentina match against Switzerland's
Grasshoppers. A Belgian off-field official was injured.
	   Though the match was played in Salerno and not at Fiorentina's
home city of Florence and though the fan who tossed the bomb
apparently was a Salerno fan, UEFA said that Fiorentina was
responsible for security at the game.
	   It expelled Fiorentina from the current UEFA Cup, but said the
team would be not excluded from future UEFA competitions becuase of
``mitigating circumstances.''
	   UEFA said Fiorentina's previous poor security record, including
fan violence during a 1997 Cup Winners Cup game, had been taken
into account in deciding the expulsion.
	   Fiorentina, the Italian league leader, was ahead 2-1 against the
Swiss side when the game was suspended due to the explosion. Having
won the first leg against the Grasshoppers 2-0, it was expected to
easily advance to the third round of the UEFA Cup.
	   The Grasshoppers will face Bordeaux of France in the third round
if the expulsion ruling is upheld.

Leaner and still favored, but Iraq's military far weaker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iraq-UN &QL; 
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Considered one of the Third World's most
feared armies before the Gulf War, Iraq's military suffered a
humiliating _ and quick _ defeat in 1991. Today, it is far leaner,
but less powerful, less equipped and less of a threat.
	   About 375,000 men serve in the army, significantly fewer than
the 500,000 mobilized during the Gulf War. But sanctions and a lack
of money and spare parts have left much of it in shambles, even
though its smaller size means it requires less upkeep.
	   ``It's quite a mess,'' Peter Felstead, editor of Jane's
Intelligence Review in London, said in an interview. ``I don't
think there's much of a conventional threat there.''
	   The one exception is the Republican Guard _ but it's a qualified
exception. Long considered the key to President Saddam Hussein's
power, it performed poorly in the Gulf War, only to regroup in time
to save him by crushing a Kurdish rebellion in the north and a
Shiite Muslim revolt in the south in the weeks after the war ended.
	   By far the best equipped and best paid, the Republican Guard has
between seven and eight divisions, although estimates differ on
total manpower. Of Iraq's total tank force of 2,000 _ far fewer
than the 5,500 it had before the Gulf War _ 800 are believed to be
in its hands, including 500 high-quality T-72s.
	   It is thought as well to have 1,000 armored fighting vehicles
and 500 artillery pieces, Felstead said.
	   Since the war, the government has set up a special guard under
the command of Saddam's son Qusai. Thought to have 15,000 men, the
battalions are well armed and believed to be extremely loyal.
	   ``He is well protected by these elite units,'' said Sean Boyne,
a military analyst in Ireland who has written on Iraq's military.
	   ``The only way to get to him would be to get inside one of their
more trusted units,'' he said in an interview.
	   Like everything else in Iraq, the military has wrestled, usually
unsuccessfully, with the impact of eight years of U.N. sanctions,
particularly in securing spare parts for aging armaments.
	   Nevertheless, Iraq still produces parts for the T-72 tank, small
arms like AK-47s, ammunition, some artillery and rocket launchers
and artillery shells, Boyne said. Other pieces are kept going by
smuggling in parts or cannibalizing other equipment, he said.
	   In addition to the special guard, Iraq has spent much of its
scarce resources on upgrading its defense against bombing and
cruise missile attacks, most of it Soviet-designed.
	   But while advanced for the Third World, it is not considered a
match for U.S. forces, especially radar-evading, stealth aircraft
or cruise missiles.
	   The rest of Iraq's military poses little threat.
	   The army relies on conscripts whose loyalty is doubted. The 17
or so divisions have nearly 2,000 pieces of artillery and a
significant number of anti-tank weapons. But the equipment _ T-55
and T-62 tanks, for instance _ is outdated and often unserviceable.
	   It's a similar story with the air force. It once boasted 700
aircraft. Some 350 remain, but only about half are fit to fly,
military analysts say. A lack of spare parts keeps on the ground
many of the best aircraft, such as the MiG-29s.
	   ``I think they're unlikely to put them up in the air because
they're just going to be shot down,'' Felstead said.
	   The military has about 500 helicopters as well, but again, a
lack of spare parts makes them largely ineffective except in
operations against guerrillas fighting in the north and south.
	   In any last-ditch effort to keep power, the government might
call on Saddam's Fedayeen, a paramilitary force of 40,000 also run
by Saddam's son Qusai. The ruling Baath Party's 1 million members
are armed, too, with light weapons, rifles and grenades.

French Barbarians beats Argentina 38-30
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOURGOIN, France (AP) _ In the first match of its European tour,
Argentina lost an exciting match against France's Barbarians 38-30.
	   Christophe Dominici, the Stade-Francais winger, scored two vital
tries for the French team.
	   Continuing the Barbarians' record of high-scoring matches, it
led 24-15 at halftime.
	   But it needed to beat off a strong late challenge from the
tourists.
	   Midway through the second half, the Pumas trailed by only one
point, at 24-23, after a penalty and try from Argentine flyhalf
Juan Fernandez-Miranda.
	   In front of 5,000 spectators, Dominici scored two tries, while
Christophe Laussucq, Pascal Giordani, Marc Raynaud and Olivier
Toulouze got a try each.
	   For Argentina, Francisco Garcia, Juan Fernandez-Miranda, Nicolas
Fernandez-Miranda and Felipe Contepomi scored a try apiece.
	   Argentina faces France in a test match in Saint-Denis on
Saturday.

Commerzbank says avoided major losses through cautious approach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS to reflect Commerzbank less affected than
other German banks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German bank Commerzbank said Wednesday
a cautious approach to investment in Russia and emerging markets
kept it out of major trouble and able to ratchet up increased
profits in the first nine months of the year.
	   ``We were careful not to get involved in the market for state
ruble papers or derivatives with Russian contracting parties,''
said bank chairman Martin Kohlhaussen.
	   Commerzbank, Germany's fourth-largest private bank, expected
record profits in 1998, said Kohlhaussen.
	   The bank reported a nine-month net income of 1.37 billion marks
(dlrs 856 million,) up from 1.3 billion in the year-earlier period
and at the higher end of analysts' expectations.
	   The bank wasn't entirely trouble-free, noting in a statement
that ``the economic difficulties in many newly industrializing
countries and the global financial crisis have affected Commerzbank
group's earnings in the third quarter.''
	   Trading profits in the first three quarters declined 19 percent
to 504 million marks (dlrs 315 million.)
	   Compared to other banks, and to analysts' forecasts, Commerzbank
did well.
	   Dresdner Bank earlier reported a trading loss in the third
quarter, compared to Commerzbank's third quarter trading profit of
108 million marks (dlrs 67.5 million.)
	   And analysts had forecast a steeper drop in nine-month trading
profit to between 420 million or 450 million marks.
	   Deutsche and Dresdner banks, Germany's two biggest, both
reported recently they were increasing provisions for possible bad
loan writeoffs due to the financial crises in Asia and Russia.
	   Commerzbank raised its risk provision to 1.6 billion marks (dlrs
1 billion) from 1.2 billion (dlrs 750 million) earmarked in the
first three quarters, ``to account for ongoing problems in Asia and
Russia.'' In 1997, it earmarked a higher annual risk provision _ a
total of 2 billion marks (dlrs 1.25 billion.)

State Department says U.S. citizens may want to leave Mideast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Wednesday Israel was closely monitoring growing tensions between
the United States and Iraq and would take the necessary steps to
defend its citizens should a confrontation arise.
	   In a new travel advisory, U.S. citizens were told they may want
to leave Israel and the Palestinian areas because of the situation
in the Gulf.
	   In Washington, the State Department authorized the departure of
employees in non-essential positions, the advisory said. It was not
clear whether employees of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv and the
Consulate in Jerusalem were preparing to leave.
	   The advisory said that the United States has not ruled out any
options in trying to get Iraq to comply with a U.N.-mandated
weapons inspections program.
	   ``Iraq's continued defiance of the will of the international
community ... is heightening the level of risk to American citizens
in the Middle East,'' the statement said.
	   In previous crises surrounding Iraq, there was concern about
chemical and biological warfare and ``although such a risk is
remote, it cannot be excluded,'' the advisory said.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed
the crisis with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon to discuss the situation in Iraq.
	   ``We're examining now the situation, the various implications of
what is developing, and we'll take the precautions as necessary,''
Netanyahu told reporters. ``Israel understands it has a grave
responsibility to take all the steps to defend itself and its
citizens and it never fails to do so.''
	   Israel is trying to stay out of the confrontation, officials
said. ``We are not a part of this conflict, except as members of
the United Nations,'' a Foreign Ministry official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``And right now, the issue is between the
United States and Iraq.''
	   A special envoy of Jordan's King Hussein, Jawad Annani, met with
Netanyahu and Sharon on Wednesday, and officials in Amman said the
envoy apparently asked Israel to remain on the sidelines.
	   In the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel in
hopes of breaking up the Arab coalition against it. However, Israel
did not retaliate and the coalition held.
	   In a subsequent U.S.-Iraq crisis in February, Iraq did not make
any attempt to draw Israel into the dispute.
	   However, Israel appeared to be at least indirectly involved this
time.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton called Netanyahu on Tuesday to
discuss the land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians and the
Iraq situation, American officials said.
	   The Haaretz daily wrote Wednesday that there was speculation
Clinton told Netanyahu in the call that the Cabinet's failure to
ratify the agreement has made it difficult for the United States to
win support from Arab states against Iraq. The Cabinet was expected
to approve the deal later Wednesday.
	   An Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the United States let it be known that its policy of being tough on
Iraq was encountering problems in the Arab world because Israel had
not moved forward on its implementation of the Wye agreement. The
official spoke on condition of anonymity.

Russian Communist resumes anti-Semitic slurs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Communist lawmaker resumed his virulent
anti-Semitic attacks Wednesday, and Russia's Communist Party leader
refused to speak out against a proposal for introducing quotas on
the number of Jews in government jobs.
	   Several prominent businessmen and politicians have called for
banning the Communist Party because it would not censure lawmaker
Albert Makashov for anti-Semitic remarks. In speeches last month,
Makashov, a retired general, blamed the country's problems on
``zhidy'' or ``yids,'' a slur against Jews.
	   Makashov was at it again Wednesday, telling a Russian journalist
with the NTV television station he was ``acting worse than the
worst of the yids,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Makashov has also told the Italian newspaper La Stampa that he
wants quotas introduced on the number of Jews in Russia's state
organizations, Interfax said.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, who had tried to smooth
over the harshest of Makashov's earlier attacks, refused to comment
on the call for quotas, Interfax reported.
	   Many of the Communist Party's voters hold anti-Semitic views.
Also, Zyuganov's party considers itself the main successor to the
Soviet Union's Communist Party, which imposed such quotas on Jews
in government.
	   Meanwhile, the speaker of the lower house of parliament, Gennady
Seleznyov, a moderate Communist, tried to play down the controversy
Wednesday, saying Makashov's statements were ``his personal view.''
	   ``This has nothing to do with the Communist party or its
parliamentary faction,'' Seleznyov said.
	   Communists in parliament blocked a resolution last week
condemning Makashov's comments, and several of his Communist
colleagues defended him in speeches this weekend celebrating the
81st anniversary of the 1917 Russian revolution, which brought the
Communist Party to power.
	   Several leading politicians and business people have said the
incident showed the party had evolved into fascism and have called
for the party to be banned.
	   A prominent political commentator and former ambassador to
Israel, Alexander Bovin, said in a column published Wednesday that
Russia should ``thank comrade Zyuganov ... because he let everybody
see the true face of his party.''
	   President Boris Yeltsin condemned the party for its stance on
Makashov, but Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov strongly opposed the
calls for a ban on the party.
	   Facing mounting opposition from the Communist-dominated
parliament as the economy began collapsing this fall, Primakov
invited some prominent Communists into his government and is
unwilling to antagonize the party.
	   Meanwhile, a poll released Wednesday showed that 51 percent of
Muscovites were outraged by Makashov's remarks, while 15 percent
approved of them. Another 24 percent said they were unaware of the
remarks.
	   Also, 30 percent of those polled said they believed Makashov
should be prosecuted, while 29 percent said he should face no
repercussions. Makashov enjoys immunity from prosecution as a
lawmaker.
	   Interfax, which carried results of the poll conducted by the
independent All-Russian Center for the Public Opinion Study over
the weekend, gave no margin of error.

Lithuanian parents arrested for burying their newborns alive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - A poverty-stricken Lithuanian couple
has been arrested on charges of murdering two of their newborn
children by burying them alive in a forest, a prosecutor said
Wednesday.
	   Police discovered the bodies of two newborns buried in a forest
near the town of Prienai, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of
the capital city, Vilnius, Vincas Bisikirskas, a local prosecutor,
told The Associated Press.
	   He identified the couple as Ruta Alaburdiene, 37, and her
36-year-old husband Rimas Alaburda, and said they had admitted the
killings.
	   The murders occurred in 1994 and 1995. In each case, the couple
went to the woods near their home, where the mother gave birth and
the father buried each of the newborns in a ditch, where they died,
said the Lithuanian Lietuvos Rytas newspaper.
	   According to the newspaper, the couple, who already had two
children, claimed they were too poor to care for the infants. It
was not clear why they did not offer the infants for adoption, or
resort to abortions, which are legal and affordable in Lithuania.
	   Bisikirskas, the prosecutor, said the father will be charged
with murder, and could face the death penalty if convicted. He said
the mother will be charged as an accomplice, and could face up to
five years in prison.
	   Police did not rule out the possibility that the couple had
killed more infants in the same way, the newspaper report said. The
couple's two living children had been placed with relatives.

Iraqi Kurdish leader mends relations with Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The leader of an Iraqi Kurdish group that
controls part of northern Iraq on Wednesday tried to mend relations
with Ankara by promising to oust Kurdish rebels from Turkey from
his territory.
	   Turkey has long accused Jalal Talabani of harboring rebels from
the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been fighting for
autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
	   But on Wednesday, Talabani, head of the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan, pledged to help Turkey secure its border with Iraq.
	   ``We are committed to end any presence of the PKK in Iraqi
Kurdistan,'' Talabani said. ``We are committed to securing the
border for Turkey and we will do this by all means.''
	   Talabani spoke with reporters before heading for Damascus and
Tehran on his way to northern Iraq.

Egypt arrests train officials for negligence in crash that killed
</HEADLINE>
47 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police on Wednesday arrested a deputy train
driver and two railway officials accused of negligence that led to
a train crash that killed 47 people last month, officials said.
	   The arrest came one day after the release of a report that said
the accident, in which a train flew off its tracks and smashed into
a town square in the Nile Delta, was caused by human error.
	   The report said the train was speeding and that brakes were
faulty or missing when it crashed in Kafr el-Dawar, 30 kilometers
(20 miles) southeast of the port city of Alexandria.
	   Police arrested the train's assistant driver, Hosni Mohammed
Abdel-Latif, and two railway officials in the town, Hamdi Ibrahim
Faqr and Mohammed Sayed Ibrahim, police officials said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Following the accident, the government suspended five top
railway officials, including the national head of railways and the
managers in the province where the accident occurred.

Security Council to meet on Iraq as Annan appeals to Saddam

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council called an
emergency meeting on Iraq Wednesday as Secretary-General Kofi Annan
appealed to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to immediately resume
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Russia requested the council meeting after more than 200 U.N.
personnel were pulled out of Iraq because of the possibility of
airstrikes by the United States to compel Iraq to allow inspections
of its weapons programs.
	   The United States, which holds the rotating presidency of the
Security Council, scheduled the meeting for 2030 GMT, the U.S.
Mission to the United Nations said.
	   Annan, who is traveling in north Africa, cut short his trip and
was expected to return to U.N. headquarters in New York on
Thursday, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said. Annan was in Morocco
and had been scheduled to visit the Western Sahara, Tunisia and
Algeria before returning Tuesday to New York.
	   Saying he was ``saddened and burdened'' by Iraq's decision to
halt dealings with the inspectors, the U.N. chief reiterated that
economic sanctions against Baghdad can only be lifted if Iraq fully
cooperates with the Security Council.
	   ``I strongly urge President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi
government to rescind its decision and resume immediate
cooperation'' with inspectors, he said in a statement issued at the
United Nations.
	   ``This would be good for the Iraqi people, for the region and
for the world,'' he said.
	   Iraq has said it will not cooperate with inspectors until the
Security Council begins to lift the debilitating embargo imposed
after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War.
	   Iraq barred the U.N. commission known as UNSCOM, which is
charged with ensuring that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction, from carrying out spot inspections on Aug. 5.
	   After the council offered Baghdad a comprehensive review of its
compliance with U.N. resolutions _ without linking it to the
possible lifting of sanctions _ Iraq halted all dealings with
UNSCOM on Oct. 31.
	   Annan, who helped defuse the last crisis with Iraq in February,
said he wants to see sanctions lifted ``so that Iraq can regain its
place among the community of nations.''
	   The Security Council's offer of a comprehensive review was the
way forward, he said.
	   ``I firmly believe that this offers Iraq a genuine opportunity.
The comprehensive review will map out the remaining steps, provided
Iraq cooperates, thus allowing them to see light at the end of the
tunnel,'' Annan said.
	   The sudden withdrawal of weapons inspectors and other U.N.
personnel heightened speculation that the U.S. would launch
airstrikes in the next few days.
	   U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said 92 members of UNSCOM flew
from Baghdad to Bahrain on Wednesday along with 11 people from the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   In addition, 130 U.N. personnel from the U.N. Children's Fund,
the World Food Program, the World Health Organization and the U.N.
Development Program left Baghdad by bus for Amman, Jordan, he said.
Another 40 employees of these agencies were scheduled to leave
Baghdad on Thursday, he said.
	   The departures will leave 40 essential U.N. staff members in
Baghdad, including the secretary-general's special envoy Prakash
Shah and Hans von Sponeck, the new coordinator for U.N.
humanitarian programs in Iraq, Wimhurst said.
	   More than 230 U.N. humanitarian aid workers are also remaining
in three northern Iraqi provinces, where they are involved in food
distribution, U.N. officials said.

Worker feared abducted reappears after Angolan diamond mine attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ An Angolan worker believed to have been
abducted by gunmen during a brutal attack on a Canadian-owned
diamond mine arrived safely in a nearby village Wednesday.
	   Franco Antunes escaped during Sunday's pre-dawn attack and
walked to the town of Lucapa, 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of the
Yetwene mine in northeast Angola, Vancouver-based DiamondWorks said
in a statement.
	   Atunes had no information about the four other workers _ two
Filipinos, a Briton and a South African _ who were still missing
and thought to have been abducted, the statement said.
	   No ransom demand has been received from the gunmen, officials
said.
	   An estimated 150 gunmen killed at least eight workers, including
two Britons and a South African, and wounded 16 others in the raid
on the remote mine which is located about 600 kilometers (370
miles) east of the capital, Luanda.
	   Troops and police were tracking the group but no new information
was available Wednesday, a public holiday in Angola.
	   A DiamondWorks executive held talks here Wednesday with
officials on the first day of a three-day visit aimed at finding
the missing men and restarting mining operations.
	   The company's chief executive officer Bruce Walsham met with
officials from state diamond company Endiama, which had a stake in
the mine, but declined to speak reporters after the meeting.
	   The attackers took food and other consumables from the mine but
did not steal any diamonds or damage any of the major mining
equipment.
	   Officials blamed the former rebel group UNITA for the raid,
claiming it wanted to destabilize the country as part of its
continuing hostility towards the government despite signing a 1994
peace pact to end a two-decade civil war.
	   However, gangs of armed bandits, mostly demobilized soldiers,
roam the countryside of the vast southwest African nation and
regularly have pillaged outlying towns in recent months.

	   YPRES, Belgium (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II completed a day of
World War 1 commemorations in France and Belgium Wednesday with an
act of remembrance at a monumental arch in this Flanders Fields
town that bears the names of 55,000 Commonwealth soldiers whose
remains were never found.
	   And in a ceremony of equal historic resonance in nearby Mesen,
she and Irish President Mary McAleese dedicated a monument to
50,000 Irishmen _ Catholics and Protestants _ who died in the Great
War.
	   Their sacrifice has been ignored at home for decades because
they fought against Germany for Britain while Ireland revolted
against British rule.
	   The Island of Ireland Peace Park was inaugurated amid hopes it
will help reconciliation across the religious divide of today's
Ireland.
	   The two Belgian ceremonies capped a day of poignant events
marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War that began in
Paris under a bright blue sky.
	   It was the last major anniversary of the Great War likely to
include actual veterans of the carnage.
	   The scope of that carnage becomes clear at the Menin Gate.
	   The queen joined Belgian King Albert II at the 30-meter tall
stone archway inscribed with the names of 55,000 soldiers who died
in battlefield trenches around Ypres.
	   Three major battles were fought at Yprus, known as Ieper in
Dutch. In one, in October, 1914, the British Expeditonary Force of
100,000 was cut in half. In another _ on April 22, 1915 _ the
Germans used poison gas for the first time in warfare.
	   The area has been made famous by a poem by John McCrae, a
Canadian soldier, after he lost a friend in a 1915 battle. It
begins with the memorable lines:
	   ``In Flanders fields the poppies blow, between the crosses, row
on row ...''
	   The Menin gate _ at which a local fire department bugler still
plays the mournful Last Post daily _ is dedicated ``to the armies
of the British Empire who stood here from 1914 to 1918 and to those
of their dead who have no known graves.''
	   As Queen Elizabeth, King Albert II and veterans from various
nations observed a minute of silence, thousands of poppy petals
rained down from the cavernous gateway as the sun bathed the site
in the last light of day.
	   The 80th anniversary of when the guns fell silent _ at the 11th
hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 _ was marked in
Paris with all the pomp and ceremony the French stage so well.
	   At the stroke of 11, Queen Elizabeth arrived at the Arc de
Triomphe where she was greeted by President Jacques Chirac. Under
the arch she laid a wreath by the eternal flame at the Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier.
	   The two leaders met with four World War I veterans _
101-year-old Gen. Maurice Bourgeois; Abramo Pellencin, 102; Guy
Cohen, 101, and Georges Rideau, 101.
	   The Great War was to be over quickly but became a four-year
nightmare of unimaginable brutality in which millions died.
	   Today, the French-Belgian border is strewn with cemeteries
holding the remains of soldiers of many nations who died in a war
that saw the introduction of poison gas with appalling efficiency.
In both Belgium and France, bodies and unexploded bombs are still
retrieved each year from former battlefields.
	   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was absent from the
ceremonies. His office said he was not invited and that any
interpretation of his no-show as a snub was a ``misunderstanding.''
	   But in Weisswasser, Germany, a Franco-German brigade marked
Armistice Day with a roll call in a sign of reconciliation of
former enemies. ``Living in peace is the highest honor we can pay
those who died for their countries during the Great War,'' said
Gen. Alain Lefevre, the commander of the unit that is part of
NATO's rapid reaction force.
	   Armistice Day is not officially celebrated in Germany, which was
defeated in the two world wars of this century.
	   The First World War killed 13 million civilians and 8.5 million
fighting men. Germany lost an estimated 1.7 million soldiers;
Britain lost more than 900,000; Italy 650,000; the United States
116,000. France was proportionally the hardest hit, with 1.3
million dead.
	   The sheer devastation wrought on France can partly be measured
by the 30,000 or so monuments in cities, towns and villages across
the nation. Some villages list more war dead than their current
populations.

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The defense ministers of Turkey and
Belarus signed an agreement Wednesday on cooperation in military
expertise.
	   Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin also visited a military
academy, an air force base and an aircraft repair plant during his
three-day visit to this former Soviet republic.
	   He and Belarusian Defense Minister Alexander Chumakov signed an
agreement on defense cooperation ``in the sphere of know-how,''
Sezgin told reporters. ``We were greatly impressed by what we saw
at the military base.''
	   He said Turkey was not considering buying any aircraft supplies
from Belarus.
	   Sezgin and Chumakov also discussed European security and
bilateral relations.
	   Sezgin's trip included meetings with Belarusian President
Alexander Lukashenko and Prime Minister Sergei Ling.

Yassin warns pressure on Hamas could lead to violent backlash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Under house arrest, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the
spiritual leader of the militant group Hamas confided in a
colleague that his organization is suffering under a crackdown by
Yasser Arafat and it could create a violent backlash.
	   Palestinian legislator Hatem Abdel Qader said Wednesday that the
ailing shiek made the remarks during a visit between the two men
Friday. Banned by Arafat's Palestinian Authority from giving
interviews, the account was the first indication that Hamas is
feeling the pressure placed on it by Arafat.
	   The crackdown on Islamic militants began Oct. 29, after a Hamas
suicide bomber tried to ram his explosive-laden car into a school
bus of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip. Sweeping arrests were
made and Yassin was placed under house arrest and his phone line
was cut. Palestinian police and undercover security officers stand
guard outside of Yassin's home in Gaza allowing only immediate
family members to enter.
	   Police granted Abdel Qader permission almost immediately after
he requested to see Yassin. Abdel Qader said the initiative was
personal and that he was not representing any one.
	   ``The sheik was very distraught and disappointed over the
measures taken against Hamas,'' Abdel Qader told The Associated
Press.
	   As part of the land-for-security deal reached in Wye River, the
Palestinians are expected to fight Islamic militant and their
infrastructure in exchange for Israeli troop withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   ``Yassin said the Authority was choking Hamas and such pressure
was explosive,'' Abdel Qader said.
	   Hamas opposes Israeli-Palestinian peace-making and has claimed
reponsibility for dozens of deadly attacks on Israelis over the
past five years.
	   But the group enjoys wide street support among Palestinians for
the badly needed social services it provides including free clinics
and schools.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Juventus of Turin coach Marcello Lippi will
miss his club's big Serie A clash at AS Roma this weekend through
suspension, the league said Wednesday.
	   Lippi was punished for yelling at the referee at the end of last
Sunday's 2-2 draw against Udinese. The coach and several players
argued that the tying goal, scored in injury time, should have been
waved off for a hand ball.
	   Juventus, the two-time defending league champion and currently
second behind Fiorentina in the standings, was already heading to
Rome without its top player, Alessandro Del Piero, the striker
expected to miss five months with a torn knee ligament.

	   BOURGOIN, France (AP) _ In the first match of its French tour,
Argentina lost an exciting match against France's Barbarians 38-30.
	   Christophe Dominici, the Stade-Francais winger, scored two vital

	   Continuing the Barbarians' record of high-scoring matches, it

tourists.
	   Midway through the second half, the Pumas trailed by only one
point, at 24-23, after a penalty and try from Argentine flyhalf
Juan Fernandez-Miranda.
	   In front of 5,000 spectators, Dominici scored two tries, while
Christophe Laussucq, Pascal Giordani, Marc Raynaud and Olivier
Toulouze got a try each.
	   For Argentina, Francisco Garcia, Juan Fernandez-Miranda, Nicolas
Fernandez-Miranda and Felipe Contepomi scored a try apiece.

Slovakia's new premier says economy in crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Slovakia's economy is seriously
short of funds for health, education, agriculture and even heat to
get through the winter, the nation's new prime minister said
Wednesday.
	   Premier Mikulas Dzurinda blamed the problems on overspending and
financial mismanagement by the previous government of Vladimir
Meciar.
	   ``There are many reasons why the state of the economy is
critical,'' Dzurinda told reporters after his Cabinet met to
discuss the crisis. ``We talked about how this country will survive
until the end of 1998.''
	   He said the country needs 4.266 billion crowns (dlrs 122
million) to meet basic needs.
	   The Cabinet adopted an amendment officially raising the state
budget deficit for 1998 by more than double to 19.2 billion crowns
(dlrs 549 million), in light of the extra spending.
	   Dzurinda also said the government would do everything it could
to save the 26,000 jobs of Slovakia's largest steel mill, VSZ
Holding, based in Kosice, the nation's second-largest city. The
private firm failed to make a payment of dlrs 35 million to banks
on Monday, and according to analysts it may face default.
	   Government officials have held talks with company
representatives this week.
	   VSZ Holding is troubled by recent unprofitable investments,
including unprofitable steel mills abroad and two soccer clubs. The
company announced it will sell the Czech soccer team Sparta Praha.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese President Elias Hrawi was
recovering Wednesday from a mild heart attack, hospital officials
said Wednesday.
	   A statement issued by Sacre Coeur Hospital in suburban Beirut
said the life of the 73-year-old leader was not in danger.
	   ``He is recuperating steadily,'' the statement said.
	   Hrawi, who is due to step down as president on Nov. 24, fell ill
at the presidential palace in Baabda on Tuesday night and was taken
to the hospital for medical tests.
	   He spent the night in intensive care, with his wife Mona at his
bedside, presidential aides said.
	   He was removed from intensive care at around noon Wednesday,
presidential aides said.
	   The first lady said the president would undergo further tests
within the next 48 hours.
	   ``We hope the president will leave hospital either Saturday
evening or Sunday morning,'' she added.
	   The presidential palace said in a statement that Hrawi's
condition ``does not warrant any worry.''
	   Hrawi's heart attack came less than two weeks before he hands
over power to President-elect Emile Lahoud at the end of an
extended nine years in office.
	   Media reports said the president's illness would not delay the
transition of power between Hrawi and Lahoud.
	   Hrawi appeared on television Tuesday evening awarding a
decoration to a Lebanese bank executive for his community work.
Three days ago, Hrawi traveled to Damascus for a farewell meeting
with his ally, Syrian President Hafez Assad.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ At least 400 weapons inspectors and other
U.N. staff left Baghdad on Wednesday in a major pullout of
``nonessential'' U.N. workers amid preparations for a possible U.S.
military strike against Iraq.
	   A convoy of 11 buses and vans carrying more than 100 arms
inspectors and their luggage rolled out of the U.N. Special
Commission's headquarters Wednesday morning. About 300 other U.N.
staff, apparently humanitarian workers, departed four hours later.
	   Many of those leaving hugged U.N. workers _ including Iraqi
staffers _ who remained behind. None of the U.N. employees would
speak with reporters as they boarded the buses.
	   As the vehicles left, U.N. workers were installing screens over
the windows of the headquarters, a move apparently aimed at
preventing glass from shattering into the building during a
military strike.
	   The U.N. Security Council called an emergency meeting Wednesday
as Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed to Saddam Hussein to
immediately resume cooperation with the U.N. inspectors. Annan said
he was ``saddened and burdened'' by Iraq's decision to halt the
inspections.
	   The U.N. envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, told reporters in Baghdad
that the world body had decided to withdraw its personnel because
of a possible military attack.
	   Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs in Iraq,
told reporters the withdrawal was ``precautionary'' and taken
``solely with the safety of U.N. staff in mind.''
	   The United States and Britain have warned that they may use
military force to try to force Baghdad to back down from its
decision to freeze all cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission
in charge of arms inspections.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton met Tuesday with senior Pentagon
officials to explore options for a military attack, and Washington
has stepped up the movement of U.S. ships into the region.
	   Iraq has said it will not cooperate with inspectors until the
Security Council begins to lift an embargo imposed after Iraqi
forces invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War. The Security
Council maintains the embargo won't be lifted until U.N. inspectors
certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The U.S. State Department issued travel advisories on Wednesday,
telling U.S. citizens to consider leaving Kuwait, Israel and
Palestinian areas in light of the growing tensions.
	   The department also began withdrawing nonessential personnel and
their families Wednesday from embassies in Israel and Kuwait. It
cited no specific threat in urging the employees to leave.
	   Israeli officials said Wednesday that Israel, the target of
Iraqi missiles during the Gulf War, does not consider itself to be
a player in the current showdown.
	   Attitudes toward Baghdad appeared to be hardening elsewhere.
Foreign ministers from Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland
jointly condemned Iraq's refusal to cooperate with U.N. inspectors,
according to statement issued today in Oslo, Norway.
	   In Moscow, Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist party failed
Wednesday to win approval for a parliamentary motion calling for
sanctions against Iraq to be lifted.
	   However, Shah said Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told
him today that Iraqi officials would not change their position.
	   ``They will not be able to desist from their position unless the
Security Council takes some action in regard to the sanctions on
Iraq,'' Shah said, summarizing Aziz's views.
	   Before Wednesday's departures, there were about 120 personnel
from UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency in the
country, along with about 450 humanitarian workers.
	   Those withdrawn Wednesday included not only all UNSCOM staff but
monitors for the IAEA and other U.N. workers who run the
oil-for-food program supplying aid to the Iraqi people.
	   The arms inspectors flew to the Gulf sheikdom of Bahrain, while
others were traveling aboard five buses for the nine- or 10-hour
trip to neighboring Jordan.
	   The current crisis began Aug. 5 when Iraq said it would not
cooperate with the Special Commission. It let some personnel
continue long-term monitoring, but on Oct. 31 it stopped even that
work.
	   A leading Arabic newspaper quoted diplomats Wednesday as saying
the United States and Britain have planned a three-phase strike
against Iraq that could involve the deployment of troops in the
country.
	   The London-based daily Al-Hayat reported that after each phase
of military action, the allies would present Iraq with a list of
demands pending further strikes. The diplomats, who spoke on
condition of anonymity from Amman, Jordan, did not specify the
demands, the paper reported.
	   The United States and Britain maintain they have backing in the
Middle East for a military strike, but Arab officials have offered
no public support for using force.
	   Jordan's Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh met Wednesday with Saudi
Arabia's Kind Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah and said later the two
countries ``are in agreement that the crisis ... should be solved
diplomatically.''
	   But he added: ``It appears that attempts to defuse the crisis
could be late.''

Lithuanian parents arrested for burying their newborns alive

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - A poverty-stricken Lithuanian couple
has been arrested on charges of murdering two of their newborn
children by burying them alive in a forest, a prosecutor said
Wednesday.
	   Police discovered the bodies of two newborns buried in a forest
near the town of Prienai, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of
the capital city, Vilnius, Vincas Bisikirskas, a local prosecutor,
told The Associated Press.
	   He identified the couple as Ruta Alaburdiene, 37, and her
36-year-old husband Rimas Alaburda, and said they had admitted the
killings.
	   The murders occurred in 1994 and 1995. In each case, the couple
went to the woods near their home, where the mother gave birth and
the father buried each of the newborns in a ditch, where they died,
said the Lithuanian Lietuvos Rytas newspaper.
	   According to the newspaper, the couple, who already had two
children, claimed they were too poor to care for the infants. It
was not clear why they did not offer the infants for adoption, or
resort to abortions, which are legal and affordable in Lithuania.
	   Bisikirskas, the prosecutor, said the father will be charged
with murder, and could face the death penalty if convicted. He said
the mother will be charged as an accomplice, and could face up to
five years in prison.
	   Police did not rule out the possibility that the couple had
killed more infants in the same way, the newspaper report said. The
couple's two living children had been placed with relatives.

	   SAINT SYMPHORIEN, Belgium (AP) _ Canadian Pvt. George Lawrence
Price, killed two minutes before the Armistice, was honored
Wednesday by allied forces for his role in liberating the city of
Mons.
	   His 101-year-old countryman, Pvt. Fred Evans, frail yet alert,
was wheeled into Mons' ornate Grand Place on Wednesday to lay a
wreath under a bronze plaque marking Canada's Nov. 11, 1918
liberation of the city.
	   ``Here was fired the last shot of the Great War,'' the plaque
reads.
	   Evans also paid respects to Pvt. Price, who at 25 was one of the
last victims of four years of unprecedented bloodshed.
	   Sixteen-year-old Torrey Swan of Calgary, Alberta, was especially
impressed when Evans joined the ceremonies in Mons.
	   ``I don't want the memory to die with their generation,'' Swan
said as the veterans were seated outside Mons city hall.
	   The remains of Pvt. Price are buried in the third row of an
unassuming plot of the military cemetery here along with those of
528 enemy German and allied British, Canadian and Irish soldiers.
	   Illuminated by a milky, early morning light coming in through
the trees, Price's headstone was surrounded by Belgian Prince
Laurent, Canada's Minister of Veterans Affairs Fred J. Mifflin and
Allied military officials, who listened as a military bugle played
Taps.
	   ``It made it even more tragic that Pvt. Price was killed by a
sniper at 10:58, two minutes before the Armistice,'' Mifflin said.
	   Crowds stood on the banks of a German and Canadian war memorial
alongside Price's grave, which was covered in wreathes, including
one from Price's sister.
	   Belgian Geert Leeuwerck took his three children to Price's grave
and told them about the futility of war.
	   ``It's better to think first than to start shooting at one
another,'' said his 9-year-old son Gregoire.
	   A group of 17 Canadian veterans, many past 100, are nearing the
end of a weeklong tour of the French and Belgian battlefields where
they fought and canceled the visit to Price's grave because of
fatigue.
	   They did attend the ceremonies in Mons, where they were the
center of attention _ especially Evans.
	   Evans was a runner for the 23rd Reserve Battalion, carrying

of the Pursuit to Mons, as the Germans quickly withdrew with the

But ``we didn't dare rejoice too far.''

Report: Becker and Ecclestone trying to gain control of tennis

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone has
joined forces and resources with Boris Becker and a German media
mogul in a renewed attempt to gain control of the men's tennis
tour, a German magazine reported Wednesday.
	   Their plans have been rejected by the ATP Tour and major
tournament directors, according to the tour's chief executive
officer.
	   The idea would be to create a Formula One-like tennis circuit,
with fewer events and a No. 1 at the end of the season, the
Sport-Bild weekly said.
	   In addition to Ecclestone and Becker, the third partner is the
London-based Prisma marketing agency, a subsidiary of the German
media mogul Leo Kirch, a pioneer in Germany of pay TV and digital
subscription TV.
	   The ATP Tour, which runs the men's circuit, said it had talked
to Ecclestone, Becker and Prisma but decided not to pursue their
plans ``for a variety of reasons.''
	   The alliance is ready to invest more than 300 million marks
(dlrs 180 million) in the project and has approached the directors
of the top-tier ``Super 9'' tournaments, Sport-Bild said.
	   Prisma officials have rejected reports that their deal was based
on pay-per-view telecasts, according to Sport-Bild.
	   But ATP sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Becker
and Prisma had failed to come up with a guarantee for minimum
viewing time on free TV.
	   The directors of the four Grand Slam events rejected the deal
when they were approached by Becker and Prisma, according to news
reports this summer during Wimbledon.
	   Becker, a three-time Wimbledon champion, is winding down his
career and is increasingly turning to his business interests.
	   The ATP Tour announced four-year marketing agreements Wednesday
with ISL, a Swiss company that handles World Cup marketing, and
Octagon, a London business involved in sports marketing. The deals
will increase revenue for men's tennis by about 30 percent, the ATP
said.
	   The agreements, reportedly worth dlrs 25 million a year, are
less lucrative than Prisma's proposal. Sport-Bild said the
directors of the Super 9 events have told ATP chief executive
officer Mark Miles that they will switch sides unless he is able to
renegotiate a better deal by the end of November.
	   Miles denied that.
	   ``The ATP Tour flatly rejects suggestions ... that there is any
deadline for its negotiations with tournament directors, or that
there is no solidarity between the tournament directors and the ATP
Tour,'' Miles said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press.
	   Since Wimbledon, Becker and Prisma ``have twice tried to pursue
their plans, failing firstly at Wimbledon with the ITF and the
Grand Slam committee and more recently at a meeting with tournament
directors and the ATP Tour in London, where the Prisma proposal was
unanimously rejected,'' Miles said.
	   He said the Tour was working closely with ISL/Octagon and the
Super 9 directors to ``refine and finalize'' plans for 2000 and is
``unconcerned about proposals from any other parties about plans
for any new `tour.'''
	   The ATP Tour has announced more modest changes in its format
starting in the year 2000, with a streamlined calendar and a
simplified ranking system.
	   Sport-Bild's report came two weeks after another German
magazine, Der Spiegel, reported that Becker and Prisma have failed
in their plan.
	   But their partnership has landed a three-year deal television
deal with Wimbledon for 30 million marks (dlrs 18 million), Spiegel
said.

After threat, most newspapers abandon sex ads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Most Greek newspapers left out ads for
phone sex lines and escorts Wednesday after authorities threatened
prosecution for notices deemed linked to prostitution.
	   At least one newspaper, the Athens daily Apoyevmatini, defied
the ban and ran over 150 ads. The paper called the threats of
prosecution a blow to press freedom.
	   Many daily newspapers usually carry several pages of ads for
escorts, phone sex lines and massages.
	   Athens' chief prosecutor Tuesday sent an order to police
demanding the arrest of the publisher and editor of any newspaper
that prints advertisements encouraging ``another's vice.''
	   Greek authorities are struggling with a growing corruption
scandal that includes allegations of police protection for
prostitution rings. Some government opponents have called for a
moral crusade in the traditionally conservative nation.
	   Prostitution is legal in Greece at state-sanctioned brothels.
But there are an estimated 20,000 unregistered prostitutes.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A bus rolled down a mountain in a remote
northeastern state Wednesday, killing at least 40 passengers, a
domestic news agency reported.
	   The bus fell down a gorge near Pachin Koto village in Arunachal
Pradesh that borders China and Myanmar.
	   The accident occurred when the bus was making a sharp turn on
the narrow mountain road, Press Trust of India news agency
reported.
	   Details of the accident were sketchy because of poor
communications in the area, which is about 1,750 (1, 085 miles)
southeast of New Delhi.

Russian Communists call for media censorship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Communist Party chief and other
hard-liners have asked the Cabinet to introduce censorship of
Russian television, which they called ``the main destabilizing
force in the society,'' news reports said Wednesday.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov and leaders of two allied
parties in parliament have sent a letter to Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov urging him to set up ``public observatory councils'' at
``every television station, without exception.''
	   These boards ``should have the necessary powers to control and
regulate the contents of all TV programs in the interests of the
majority of the population,'' the Interfax news agency quoted the
letter as saying.
	   Communists in the Russian parliament earlier this year blocked a
bill that would have banned fascist propaganda, because they said
the bill would infringe on freedom of speech.
	   Yet the Communists have long called for more control of the
media, which they say is too pro-government.
	   The calls have flared up in the past few days, after Russian
television channels gave much coverage to criticism of the
Communist Party for its failure to condemn a member's outspoken
anti-Semitism.
	   Communists in parliament blocked a resolution last week
condemning lawmaker Albert Makashov's slurs against Jews, and
several of his Communist colleagues defended him in speeches this
weekend.
	   In the letter to Primakov, the party leaders accused television
stations of ``cynically manipulating public opinion against the
interests of the state'' and becoming ``the main destabilizing
force in the society,'' Interfax reported.
	   The head of Russia's ORT public television station, Igor
Shabdurasulov, lambasted the calls, saying that if Communists
``want to get jurisdiction over the mass media, let them introduce
changes in the law on the media and ... announce to the country and
the whole world the establishment of censorship in the country.''
	   Any legal amendments would need to be approved by President
Boris Yeltsin, who has sharply criticized the Communists' calls for
censorship and is certain to veto any such bill.
	   Responding to the Communists allegations of TV's
``destabilizing'' influence, Shabdurasulov also said that ``it is
some of the deputies of (parliament) who really introduce a
significant element of destabilization in the country,'' Interfax
reported.

Diana memorial garden scaled down after resident protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The committee overseeing memorials to Princess
Diana announced Wednesday that it has scaled down plans for an
elaborate project in Kensington Gardens after angry protests from
area residents.
	   British treasury chief Gordon Brown, the committee's chairman,
said the original proposal for an elaborate 2.7-acre site costing
10 million pounds (dlrs 16.5 million) had been replaced by a more
understated plan involving a smaller garden and memorial walk.
	   The most significant aspect will be a walkway connecting four of
London's great parks _ Kensington, Hyde, Green and St. James's _
but the walkway no longer will follow Diana's funeral procession
route, Brown said.
	   The parks will be connected in a figure-eight shape, with Hyde
Park in the center, allowing people to start and finish the walk
however they choose.
	   ``This will be one of the most magnificent urban parkland walks
in the world,'' Brown said.
	   A cost estimate for the new project was not provided.
	   Residents and local legislators had overwhelming opposed the
original plans centering on Kensington Gardens _ located outside
the palace where Diana had lived _ fearing the damage inflicted on
the neighborhood by the millions of extra visitors expected each
year.
	   Brown said the committee's other three main proposals were on
track, including a commemorative 5-pound coin (worth about dlrs
8.35) that will be released for general circulation next July 1,
which was Diana's birthday.
	   The other two projects are community children's nursing teams,
dubbed Diana's Angels, and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial
Award, to be given to youths between the ages of 11 and 18 for
community service or overcoming personal problems.
	   ``The memorial committee feels that together these will form a
fitting, long-lasting tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales which
will recognize her unique contribution and the example she set,''
Brown said.
	   The committee members include Diana's sister, Lady Sarah
McCorquodale, and her butler, Paul Burrell.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Hormones released during pregnancy and
nursing enrich parts of the mother's brain involved in learning and
memory, a study of animals suggests.
	   The findings, released Tuesday at a Society for Neuroscience
meeting, may help in understanding the effects that higher hormone
levels have on the brain during childbearing.
	   The results of the study of mice, however, are inconsistent with
research at the University of Southern California indicating that
pregnant women perform poorly on cognitive tests designed to test
memory, perceptual speed and learning ability.
	   Some researchers have attributed feelings of fuzzy-mindedness
among many expectant mothers to emotional stress from pregnancy,
which provokes higher levels of a hormone called cortisol that
interferes with memory.
	   The new animal study by neuroscientists at the University of
Richmond and Randolph Macon College in Virginia suggested that a
pregnant animal's behavior changes because of a permanent shift in
the brain.
	   ``We are seeing significant changes,'' said Richmond
neuropsychologist Craig Kinsley, who conducted the study with
Randolph Macon psychologist Kelly Lambert. ``Pregnancy, a perfectly
natural biological experience for the female, appears to mark the
brain for a lifetime.''
	   Special brain cell structures called dendrites _ necessary for
communication between neurons _ doubled in pregnant and nursing lab
mice, the research indicates. At the same time, the number of the
brain's glial cells, which act as scaffolding and communication
conduits, also doubled.
	   The pregnant mice were bolder, more curious and energetic. They
learned mazes more quickly, made fewer mistakes and retained their
new knowledge longer. And the effects appeared to be long-lasting,
researchers found.
	   ``In a way, the brain of a late-pregnant female resembles a toy
factory at Christmas time, receiving orders and gearing up for the
increased demands about to be placed on it,'' Kinsley said in
Tuesday's Los Angeles Times.

Northern town is calm after clashes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with OSCE comment; trims

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The northern town of Shkodra was calm but
tense Wednesday, a day after armed men shot in the air and entered
a government building in protest of several arrests.
	   The unrest in Shkodra, 85 kilometers (50 miles) north of Tirana,
and a stronghold of the opposition Democratic Party, began late
Tuesday after police arrested three men _ all members of an
anti-Communist union _ on charges of theft.
	   Two of the men were later released, but a third, identified as
Marjan Zef Gryka, 27, remained in custody.
	   Local media reported Wednesday that Gryka was a former bodyguard
of Azem Hajdari, a popular opposition leader who was killed Sept.
12. Hajdari's death sparked a week of violent protests in the
capital.
	   The reports said Gryka was arrested for confronting President
Rexhep Mejdani during a visit to Shkodra last week while carrying
weapons. But an Interior Ministry spokesman later said he was only
charged with theft.
	   A crowd of anti-Communists gathered in the town's main square
late Tuesday, demanding the detained be released. They blocked off
part of the town and started shooting into the air. State
television later said some of the men had gained entry into the
main local government building.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said its
office in Shkodra had been looted of computers and other equipment
and a vehicle had been stolen during the violence. Nobody was
injured, said the organization.
	   Late Wednesday, the OSCE condemned the theft and lootings,
saying they ``raise serious concerns about the security situation
in northern Albania.''
	   By Wednesday Shkodra appeared calm. Shops opened and people
moved freely through the streets.
	   Interior Ministry officials said special police units have were
sent from Tirana to reinforce local officers.
	   But the situation remained tense, with anti-Communist unions
demanding Gryka's release by Wednesday evening as well as the
replacement of Shkodra's police chief and several local government
officials.

FIFA suggests compromise over players' release for European match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA on Wednesday moved to calm a
dispute over the release of players for next week's rescheduled
European Championship qualifier between Yugoslavia and Ireland in
Belgrade.
	   A FIFA committee suggested clubs make their players available to
the national sides after this weekend's round of league matches,
the world governing body said in a statement.
	   It called for a ``flexible approach'' from the two associations
``by discussing with (the clubs involved) a reduction of the
release period.''
	   Ireland manager Mick McCarthy on Tuesday named a 20-man squad
for the match and invoked the five-day rule on the release of
players for competitive international games.
	   That plan, which would see players assembling in Dublin on
Saturday, would mean none of the squad would be available to their
clubs for this weekend's English Premier League and First Division
games.
	   The clubs of players involved asked FIFA to treat the game as a
special case.
	   The Group Eight match was originally scheduled for Oct. 10 but
was postponed because of the crisis in Kosovo and threat of NATO
air strikes.
	   With the easing of tensions, UEFA last week gave the go-ahead
for the match on Nov. 18.
	   English Premier League club Charlton said it wouldn't release
two of its players _ one each from Ireland and Yugoslavia _ until
after its league game Saturday.
	   It claimed the two countries had breached FIFA regulations by
not providing it with the required written notice.

Government expected to lower interest rates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated after Central Bank announcement expected after
2000 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ With exorbitantly high interest rates
strangling South America's largest economy, Brazil's Central Bank
is expected to heed President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's call to
start lowering the country's key lending rate.
	   The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled to set
the new lending rate on Wednesday evening.
	   A recently announced fiscal austerity package, last week's
congressional approval of a social security reform bill and an
expected International Monetary Fund rescue package ``justify a
lowering of interest rates,'' said presidential spokesman Sergio
Amaral.
	   ``The president expects interest rates to fall,'' Amaral said at
a briefing Tuesday night.
	   He did not say by how much Cardoso is expecting the lending rate
to fall, but added that for next year, the government was
projecting annual interest rates of 21 percent, compared to today's
50 percent.
	   Most analysts expect the Central Bank's decision will point to a
gradual, rather than sudden drop in interest rates.
	   Luciana Fagundes, an economist at Lloyds Bank, told the O Estado
de Sao Paulo newspaper she expected the new lending rate to be
between 37 percent and 40 percent.
	   Marcel Solimeo, chief economist of the Sao Paulo Chamber of
Commerce, said that even a small reduction would ``have a positive
psychological effect on the consumer and help stimulate sales.''
	   With more than 50 percent of retail sales made on installment
plans, any drop in interest rates would be welcome news to both
consumers and store owners.
	   Solimeo recently predicted a somber Christmas season, with sales
during the final two months of the year expected to drop by almost
10 percent compared to the same period in 1997.
	   Brazil's key lending rate was nearly doubled to 49.75 percent in
September as investors fled the country following Russia's default
and devaluation in August. The country's foreign reserves have
fallen to around dlrs 45 billion from the dlrs 70 billion posted at
the end of July.
	   ``With interest rates like these, it's impossible to draw up any
coherent investment or expansion plan,'' Aldo Lorenzetti, president
of a large electrical appliance factory, said earlier this week.
	   Business leaders have warned that the success of the
government's fiscal austerity package depends on lower interest
rates.
	   A document prepared by the National Confederation of Industries
points out that continued high interest rates will increase the
public deficit _ now at 7 percent of gross domestic product _ and
lower tax collection as economic output dwindles.
	   The belt-tightening measures unveiled Oct. 28 area mix of taxes
and spending cuts in a bid to save nearly dlrs 24 billion in 1999
and some dlrs 80 billion by 2002. The measures must be approved by
Congress.
	   The government hopes the measures will qualify Brazil for an IMF
rescue package, expected to be announced within the next few days.
	   The IMF has insisted on a tough plan to slash Brazil's deficit
before going ahead with an estimated dlrs 30 billion to dlrs 40
billion aid program.
	   Analysts say the austerity measures are likely to aggravate the
country's economic slowdown and push unemployment above its current
official rate of 7.8 percent. Independent economists say
unemployment is closer to 20 percent.
	   The latest official figures released Wednesday show that the
country's industrial output declined for the fourth consecutive
month in September, falling 2.4 percent from August.
	   The government-run Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics said production in September was also down 6 percent
compared with the same month in 1997.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ The wife of the U.S. vice president
pledged new hurricane aid Wednesday in Nicaragua, after bringing
medical supplies and a promise of dlrs 10 million in additional
U.S. aid to the hurricane-devastated countries of Central America.
	   Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, announced Wednesday
that the United States will send 12 additional helicopters to help
with relief efforts and donate dlrs 1.5 million to the Pan-American
Health Organization to help buy medicines for victims of the deadly
storm Mitch.
	   She and a U.S. congressional delegation planned to visit refugee
camps and survey relief efforts in Nicaragua before returning to
Washington.
	   As Mrs. Gore examined the devastation in Central America,
governments and lending institutions around the world moved to help
the region pick up the pieces.
	   France canceled debts owed by Nicaragua and Honduras, while
Ireland announced it was doubling aid to countries ravaged by the
storm. Britain said it wanted to contribute to a trust fund for the
region and added its support to calls for a moratorium on debt
payments by all affected countries.
	   Cuba announced it was canceling Nicaraguan debts of dlrs 50
million, and the World Bank announced it was making dlrs 200
million in assistance available from existing projects.
	   Mitch formed as a tropical storm Oct. 22 in the Caribbean and
became a hurricane three days later, battering Honduras while
stalled just off the coast. It moved inland as a tropical storm on
Oct. 27 and continued to dump rain.
	   The storm knocked out hundreds of bridges, leaving many
communities isolated. It devastated power and sewer lines
throughout Honduras and ravaged the nation's farms.
	   Mrs. Gore flew to the Nicaraguan capital from neighboring
Honduras, where she spent Tuesday night in a pup tent in a
schoolyard. She had helped clean the school and feed hungry
children in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa on Tuesday.
	   ``This is a tragedy of Biblical proportions,'' she said after
meeting with residents of Tegucigalpa's El Chile neighborhood,
which was ripped apart by a torrent of mud. ``They're telling me
stories of entire villages being washed away.''
	   Mrs. Gore's visit did much to heighten spirits in El Chile.
Hundreds of children followed her through the streets, and a few
pushed past security to hold her hand.
	   ``The important people never come to this neighborhood,'' said
27-year-old Claudia Boquin, who put her daughter on her shoulders
for a better view.
	   Mrs. Gore delivered an aid shipment that included blankets,
sheets and drinking water for residents who have had little since
Mitch killed an estimated 6,600 Hondurans last month.
	   Central American presidents say the storm killed an additional
3,400 people in the region.
	   Honduran President Carlos Flores welcomed the international
support, including the contributions of Mrs. Gore. With her boots
and pants still caked with mud, the president invited her to his
home Tuesday night for a pizza dinner.
	   ``The example is something that's not forgotten,'' Flores told
Mrs. Gore.
	   Mrs. Gore said U.S. military engineers would help repair
Honduran roads and bridges and ensure that fuel and food reached
the country's stricken towns.
	   The dlrs 10 million in new U.S. aid comes on top of the dlrs 70
million the U.S. government already has committed to Central
America.
	   Mrs. Gore was joined on her trip by Brian Atwood, who heads the
U.S. Agency for International Development; Dennis Martinez, a
Nicaraguan who pitches for the Atlanta Braves baseball team; and
John Leonard, deputy assistant secretary of state for Latin
America.

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS 11th graf to clarify that ATP's deal with ISL and
Octagon was announced during Wimbledon, not Wednesday &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone has
joined forces and resources with Boris Becker and a German media
mogul in a renewed attempt to gain control of the men's tennis
tour, a German magazine reported Wednesday.
	   Their plans have been rejected by the ATP Tour and major
tournament directors, according to the tour's chief executive
officer.
	   The idea would be to create a Formula One-like tennis circuit,
with fewer events and a No. 1 at the end of the season, the
Sport-Bild weekly said.
	   In addition to Ecclestone and Becker, the third partner is the
London-based Prisma marketing agency, a subsidiary of the German
media mogul Leo Kirch, a pioneer in Germany of pay TV and digital
subscription TV.
	   The ATP Tour, which runs the men's circuit, said it had talked
to Ecclestone, Becker and Prisma but decided not to pursue their
plans ``for a variety of reasons.''
	   The alliance is ready to invest more than 300 million marks
(dlrs 180 million) in the project and has approached the directors
of the top-tier ``Super 9'' tournaments, Sport-Bild said.
	   Prisma officials have rejected reports that their deal was based
on pay-per-view telecasts, according to Sport-Bild.
	   But ATP sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Becker
and Prisma had failed to come up with a guarantee for minimum
viewing time on free TV.
	   The directors of the four Grand Slam events rejected the deal
when they were approached by Becker and Prisma, according to news
reports this summer during Wimbledon.
	   Becker, a three-time Wimbledon champion, is winding down his
career and is increasingly turning to his business interests.
	   During Wimbledon, the ATP Tour announced four-year marketing
agreements with ISL, a Swiss company that handles World Cup
marketing, and Octagon, a London business involved in sports
marketing. The deals will increase revenue for men's tennis by
about 30 percent, the ATP said.
	   The agreements, reportedly worth dlrs 25 million a year, are
less lucrative than Prisma's proposal. Sport-Bild said the
directors of the Super 9 events have told ATP chief executive
officer Mark Miles that they will switch sides unless he is able to
renegotiate a better deal by the end of November.
	   Miles denied that.
	   ``The ATP Tour flatly rejects suggestions ... that there is any
deadline for its negotiations with tournament directors, or that
there is no solidarity between the tournament directors and the ATP
Tour,'' Miles said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press.
	   Since Wimbledon, Becker and Prisma ``have twice tried to pursue
their plans, failing firstly at Wimbledon with the ITF and the
Grand Slam committee and more recently at a meeting with tournament
directors and the ATP Tour in London, where the Prisma proposal was
unanimously rejected,'' Miles said.
	   He said the Tour was working closely with ISL/Octagon and the
Super 9 directors to ``refine and finalize'' plans for 2000 and is
``unconcerned about proposals from any other parties about plans
for any new `tour.'''
	   The ATP Tour has announced more modest changes in its format
starting in the year 2000, with a streamlined calendar and a
simplified ranking system.
	   Sport-Bild's report came two weeks after another German
magazine, Der Spiegel, reported that Becker and Prisma have failed
in their plan.
	   But their partnership has landed a three-year deal television
deal with Wimbledon for 30 million marks (dlrs 18 million), Spiegel
said.

Peru drops 1998 economic growth estimate to 2 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Peru's economy will grow by less than 2
percent in 1998, sharply down from earlier projections, government
officials said.
	   The government had projected the gross domestic product to grow
by 5 percent in 1998, but lowered it to 3-4 percent in mid-1998 as
the damage from the global economic crisis and the El Nino weather
phenomenon to Peru's economy became apparent.
	   Finance Minister Jorge Baca announced the lower growth figure
late Tuesday at a meeting of investors in Brussels, Belgium.
Newspaper reports of his comments were confirmed Wednesday by
officials at Peru's Finance Ministry.
	   Economic analysts in Peru said they were not surprised by the
new growth projection, which is in line with private sector
estimates.
	   With Peru's population growing by 2.1 percent in 1998, the low
growth rate means per capita income will contract this year,
analysts said.
	   ``The average people in Peru will be a little worse off this
year than they were last year,'' said Javier Noriega, senior
analyst at Hildebrandt and Ferrar stock brokerage house.
	   Despite high economic growth rates over the past six years under
President Alberto Fujimori's free market program, unemployment and
poverty remain high, with one in two Peruvians living below the
poverty line.
	   Peru's exports have been badly hurt by El Nino, which reduced
its fish catch and devastated its road infrastructure, and the
global economic crisis, which has led to falling metals prices.
Mining and fishing are Peru's top two exports.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Gunmen who massacred 19 people in a northern
Mexican town were employed by a drug gang sought by authorities in
the United States and Mexico, prosecutors say.
	   Gen. Guillermo Alvarez, who coordinates antidrug efforts for the
Federal Judicial Police, said Tuesday that the gunmen have
connections to Ramon Arellano Felix, an alleged drug trafficker on
the FBI's list of 10 most wanted crime suspects.
	   American and Mexican officials believe that Arellano Felix and
his brothers, based in the border city of Tijuana, have killed
dozens of people in recent years to protect their drug-trafficking
empire.
	   On Sept. 17, gunmen rousted from bed an alleged drug trafficker
and 18 members of his family _ including eight children _ and lined
them up against a wall and shot them near the Baja California beach
resort of Ensenada.
	   The gunmen's intended target, a Pei Pei Indian named Fermin
Castro, died two weeks later of complications from two bullet
wounds.
	   Three suspects had been arrested, said Deputy Attorney General
Jose Luis Ramos Rivera. Warrants have been issued for 10 others,
one of whom may be hiding in the United States, he said.
	   Alvarez said the gunmen were members of a gang led by a man
known as Lino Quintana, who works for Arellano Felix.
	   U.S. federal authorities have offered a dlrs 2 million reward
for information leading to Arellano Felix's arrest.
	   Authorities say he and three of his brothers are fugitives who
control major routes for smuggling cocaine, marijuana and other
drugs across the border into California. Mexican authorities have
sought the brothers since 1993.
	   Alvarez and federal prosecutors said Quintana's gang killed
Castro to stop his marijuana-smuggling operation from becoming too
competitive with theirs.
	   Authorities said they solved the case after two people were
killed Oct. 29 by gunmen wearing the same military-style uniforms
as those worn by the gunmen in the massacre near Ensenada.
	   Descriptions gathered from survivors of the two attacks led to
the arrest of Armando Villegas, who said he was present during both
killings. Villegas directed authorities to a ranch in Rosarito,
Baja California, where investigators found guns and uniforms
allegedly used by the gunmen at Ensenada.
	   Alvarez insisted that Mexican soldiers were not involved in the
Ensenada massacre, as local media have speculated. Five soldiers
held under house arrest during the investigation have been cleared
of any involvement in the killings and released, he said.

Group fears ailing Syrian dissident will die without medical

treatment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Syrian dissident Nizar Nayouf could
die in a Syrian jail unless his government relents and allows him
immediate medical attention, a Copenhagen-based human rights group
said Wednesday.
	   The 36-year-old journalist, writer and activist is serving a
10-year jail sentence in Syria for ``practicing his internationally
recognized right to free expression,'' the Euro-Mediterranean Human
Rights Network said in a statement said.
	   The group claimed that Syrian authorities have refused medical
treatment for Nayouf ``unless he pledges to refrain for political
activities and renounces alleged 'false statements' he made about
the human rights situation in Syria.''
	   ``He may die unless he receives immediate treatment for
Hodgkin's disease, a form of cancer that can be cured with proper
treatment,'' said group, which also asked to be allowed to visit
Nayouf in jail.
	   Nayouf was a founding member of the Committee for the Defense of
Democratic Freedoms and Human Rights in Syria, according to an
earlier statement by the New York-based Human Rights Watch.
	   Nayouf was arrested in January 1992 as part of a Syrian
government crackdown on the country's nascent human rights
movement. Three months later, he was sentenced by the Supreme State
Security Court to 10 years in prison and has been incarcerated at
the Mezze military prison in the Syrian capital Damascus, Human
Rights Watch recently said.

FIFA suggests compromise over players' release for European match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA on Wednesday moved to calm a
dispute over the release of players for next week's rescheduled
European Championship qualifier between Yugoslavia and Ireland in
Belgrade.
	   A FIFA committee suggested clubs make their players available to
the national sides after this weekend's round of league matches,
the world governing body said in a statement.
	   It called for a ``flexible approach'' from the two associations
``by discussing with (the clubs involved) a reduction of the
release period.''
	   Ireland manager Mick McCarthy on Tuesday named a 20-man squad
for the match and invoked the five-day rule on the release of
players for competitive international games.
	   That plan, which would see players assembling in Dublin on
Saturday, would mean none of the squad would be available to their
clubs for this weekend's English Premier League and First Division
games.
	   The clubs of players involved asked FIFA to treat the game as a
special case.
	   The Group Eight match was originally scheduled for Oct. 10 but
was postponed because of the crisis in Kosovo and threat of NATO
air strikes.
	   With the easing of tensions, UEFA last week gave the go-ahead
for the match on Nov. 18.
	   English Premier League club Charlton said it wouldn't release
two of its players _ one each from Ireland and Yugoslavia _ until
after its league game Saturday.
	   It claimed the two countries had breached FIFA regulations by
not providing it with the required written notice.

Reports: Kurdish rebels ambush troops in southeast Turkey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with two homemade bombs exploding killing alleged
rebel and injuring two civilians

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Kurdish rebels ambushed Turkish troops and
village guards in the southeastern province of Sirnak, Turksih
newspapers reported Wednesday, killing up to 22 people.
	   A Kurdish group based in Brussels confirmed that rebels of the
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), fighting for autonomy in Turkey's
southeast, killed 22 soldiers and village guards who are helping
troops fight Kurdish rebels on Mount Gabar near Sirnak.
	   Another 30 members of security forces were injured, said a
member of the Kurdish Committee which includes members of the PKK.
It was unclear when the operation took place.
	   Military sources refused to comment on the reports.
	   According to daily Hurriyet, the ambush occurred in the early
hours of Tuesday. The rebels killed 13 soldiers and six village
guards, Hurriyet said.
	   Meanwhile, two homemade bombs exploded in the eastern city of
Dogubeyazit Wednesday, the Anatolia news agency reported.
	   A couple was severely injured when they opened a bag left
unattended in the street, the report said. The man reportedly lost
an arm in the explosion and both were rushed to hospital.
	   An alleged rebel was killed in the same town as he manipulated a
second makeshift device, Anatolia said.
	   Close to 37,000 people have died since the Kurdish insurgency
erupted in 1984. Turkish forces are currently engaged in an
operation against the rebels in neighboring northern Iraq.

Drug raids net 23 suspects in St. Croix
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Simultaneous police
raids across the island of St. Croix netted 23 drug suspects,
authorities said Wednesday.
	   Police said three minors were among those arrested during the
raids at housing projects and drug-selling points on Monday.
	   Some of the arrests had been planned for months, with police
spending more than dlrs 1,800 on drug buys and sting operations,
police commissioner Ramon Davila said.
	   The defendants face charges ranging from drug trafficking to
drug use. Authorities confiscated an unspecified amount of cocaine
and crack cocaine, Davila said.
	   Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
aided in the raids, police said.

Russian Communist resumes anti-Semitic slurs

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Communist lawmaker resumed his virulent
anti-Semitic attacks Wednesday, and Russia's Communist Party leader
refused to speak out against a proposal for introducing quotas on
the number of Jews in government jobs.
	   Several prominent businessmen and politicians have called for
banning the Communist Party because it would not censure lawmaker
Albert Makashov for anti-Semitic remarks. In speeches last month,
Makashov, a retired general, blamed the country's problems on
``zhidy'' or ``yids,'' a slur against Jews.
	   Makashov was at it again Wednesday, telling a Russian journalist
with the NTV television station he was ``acting worse than the
worst of the yids.''
	   Makashov has also told the Italian newspaper La Stampa that he
wants quotas introduced on the number of Jews in Russia's state
organizations.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, who had tried to smooth
over the harshest of Makashov's earlier attacks, refused to comment
on the call for quotas.
	   Many of the Communist Party's voters hold anti-Semitic views.
Also, Zyuganov's party considers itself the main successor to the
Soviet Union's Communist Party, which imposed such quotas on Jews
in the government and other jobs.
	   Meanwhile, the speaker of the lower house of parliament, Gennady
Seleznyov, a moderate Communist, tried to play down the controversy
Wednesday, saying Makashov's statements were ``his personal view.''
	   ``This has nothing to do with the Communist party or its
parliamentary faction,'' Seleznyov said.
	   Communists in parliament blocked a resolution last week
condemning Makashov's comments, and several of his Communist
colleagues defended him in speeches this weekend celebrating the
81st anniversary of the 1917 Russian revolution, which brought the
Communist Party to power.
	   Several leading politicians and business people have said the
incident showed the party had evolved into fascism and have called
for the party to be banned.
	   A prominent political commentator and former ambassador to
Israel, Alexander Bovin, said in a column published Wednesday that
Russia should ``thank comrade Zyuganov ... because he let everybody
see the true face of his party.''
	   President Boris Yeltsin condemned the party for its stance on
Makashov, but Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov strongly opposed the
calls for a ban on the party.
	   Facing mounting opposition from the Communist-dominated
parliament as the economy began collapsing this fall, Primakov
invited some prominent Communists into his government and is
unwilling to antagonize the party.
	   Meanwhile, a poll released Wednesday showed that 51 percent of
Muscovites were outraged by Makashov's remarks, while 15 percent
approved of them. Another 24 percent said they were unaware of the
remarks.
	   Also, 30 percent of those polled said they believed Makashov
should be prosecuted, while 29 percent said he should face no
repercussions. Makashov enjoys immunity from prosecution as a
lawmaker.
	   The Interfax news agency, which carried results of the poll
conducted by the independent All-Russian Center for the Public
Opinion Study over the weekend, gave no margin of error.

Yeltsin orders premier to find money to destroy chemical weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin ordered his prime minister
Wednesday to step up efforts to attract private funding to help
Russia destroy its massive stockpile of chemical weapons.
	   Yeltsin's decree came amid mounting concerns about the costs of
destroying Russia's 44,000 tons of deteriorating chemical weapons _
the largest stockpile in the world _ which it promised to get rid
of when it ratified the international Chemical Weapons Convention
last year.
	   On Tuesday, a prominent analyst warned that Russia's
cash-starved government may resort to burning the chemical weapons
if it cannot come up with the money for more environmentally safe
and internationally condoned methods of dismantling and disposal.
	   The cost of destroying the weapons is estimated at dlrs 5.7
billion. The United States has given Russia dlrs 200 million to
help.
	   Yeltsin ordered Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to ``step up
work to attract Russian and foreign investments in the construction
of plants where chemical weapons are disposed of.''
	   Russia says it stopped producing chemical weapons in 1987.

Voet lawyer accuses Festina of involvement in doping scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - The lawyer for Willy Voet, the physiotherapist at
the center of the doping scandal that plagued last summer's Tour de
France, accused the Festina company of ``facilitating and inciting
doping,'' according to French news reports Wednesday.
	   Tour organizers threw the Festina-sponsored team out of the race
after revelations that it was using banned doping products.
	   ``So far there has only been an enquiry into the subordinates,''
Jean-Louis Bessis told French sports daily L'Equipe, referring to
Voet, team doctor Eric Ryckaert and team manager Bruno Roussel.
	   ``Voet, Ryckaert and Roussel are subordinates and salaried
employees of Festina, which inevitably supplied the money for the
acquisition of doping products,'' he said.
	   ``It is indecent that Festina today pretends to be a white
knight in the fight against doping,'' he said.
	   Festina denied the charges, saying that it had no knowledge of
the use of banned substances within the team that it sponsors.

Budget talks collapse, Norway's coalition turns to Labor for
</HEADLINE>
support &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The risk of a government crisis in Norway
increased Wednesday when negotiations between the minority
coalition and two right-wing parties on a proposed national budget
collapsed in a dispute over tax increases.
	   The three-party coalition, with 42 seats in the 165-seat
parliament, had been seeking a compromise with the Conservatives
and the Party of Progress to ensure the support it needs to pass
its budget and remain in office.
	   ``The will to negotiate was there on both sides, but such a big
gap has been exposed that it would be impossible to reach an
agreement,'' Einar Steenaes, parliamentary leader of the Christian
Democrats, said after the breaks.
	   The talks foundered on proposed tax hikes. The coalition of the
Christian Democrats, the Center Party and the Liberals had proposed
about 4 billion kroner (dlrs 533 million) in tax hikes. The right
wing parties refused to accept any tax hikes.
	   The coalition now has to turn to the Labor, Norway's largest
party with 62 seats in parliament, in hopes of winning support for
a compromise budget in next month's final vote.
	   The Labor government stepped down just over a year ago after a
disappointing national election, and surrendered power to the
coalition. However, in recent weeks Labor has harshly criticized
the minority government, and has hinted that Labor is willing to
return to power.
	   However, neither the Conservatives nor the Party of Progress
want a Labor government, a stand that could force them to support
the minority coalition if it called a vote of confidence.
	   ``We have no wish to see a change of government,'' said Carl I.
Hagen, leader of the Party of Progress.
	   The coalition plans to open talks Thursday with Labor, which has
already flatly refused to support the government's increases in
funding for a paid parenting program. The program provides economic
support to parents who choose to stay home with their very small
children.
	   Hill-Marta Solberg, of the Labor Party, said the government
would have to show a real willingness to compromise or ``it would
be pointless to negotiation.
	   ``We are not going to be a lifesaving buoy for the government,''
she was quoted as telling the Norwegian news agency NTB.
	   If the coalition fails to reach a compromise with Labor, it
could attempt to force the budget through with a vote of
confidence. It could also seek to pass elements of the budget with
alternating support from the left and right.
	   A final vote on the 1999 national budget is scheduled for Dec.
15.

Jackson visits family of martyred political prisoner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria AP) _ U.S. special envoy to Africa Jesse Jackson
paid tribute Wednesday to Nigeria's most prominent political
prisoner, the late Moshood Abiola, calling his memory a symbol of
hope for Africa's most populous nation.
	   After meeting with Abiola's family in Nigeria's commercial
capital of Lagos, Jackson said the former politician and
president-elect stood for a united Nigeria.
	   ``Every day Abiola was in jail he believed in one Nigeria and he
lost his life trying to save the nation,'' Jackson said.
	   Abiola, a powerful southern Nigerian businessman, was the
apparent winner of 1993 presidential elections, which were
subsequently annulled.
	   Abiola went ahead and declared himself president and was
imprisoned and charged with treason.
	   The five-year dictatorship of Sani Abacha ended with the
general's death in June, raising hope that Abiola would be freed by
Nigeria's new military leader Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar. Just days
before his anticipated release, Abiola also died _ one month after
his rival Abacha.
	   Jackson urged Nigerians to remember Abiola and to ensure that
his death was not in vain. Jackson has been a vocal advocate of
political and economic reform in Nigeria, calling for elections and
a return to civilian rule.
	   Nigeria has been ruled by the military for most of its 38 years
of independence.
	   Abubakar is moving Nigeria toward multiparty democracy and plans
to hold presidential elections in February. He has also released
many political prisoners and vowed to clamp down on government
corruption.
	   Warning Abubakar to follow through on his pledge to return power
to a civilian administration, Jackson said the United States would
no longer tolerate military rule in Nigeria.
	   ``The military should have no business with leadership, it
should protect national integrity,'' Jackson said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton has appealed to Abubakar to free the
country's remaining political prisoners, Jackson said.
	   Jackson, a Baptist minister and civil rights leader, arrived
Monday in Nigeria. He was scheduled to travel to Guinea on
Wednesday and also plans to visit restive Sierra Leone and Ghana
during his weeklong visit to West Africa.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Britain's Tim Henman advanced to the
quarterfinals in the dlrs 825,000 Stockholm Open tennis tournament
Wednesday with a straight-set victory over Wayne Ferreira of South
Africa.
	   Henman's fellow countryman Greg Rusedski was more convincing,
demolishing Tommy Haas, 6-1, 6-4, in a quick 52 minutes in a
first-round match. The German failed to hold his first four service
games, winning a scant two points along the way.
	   ``I couldn't be playing much better tennis if I tried,''
Rusedski said after the match. Asked if he had ever won every point
of an opponent's service game in an entire set, he joked, ``It must
be my new improved returns.''
	   Henman's was much more evenly matched. He started fast, breaking
Ferreira's serve in game two, losing five of the next six games,
and then breaking Ferreira's serve to force a tiebreak. He won 7-6
(7-3), 6-4.
	   ``It was an up-and-down first set,'' Henman said. ``My serving
was erratic at that point.''
	   In later matches Wednesday, world No. 1 Pete Sampras of the
United States was to face Australia's Jason Stoltenberg, and Jonas
Bjorkman took on Magnus Gustafsson, both Swedish.
	   Henman and Rusedski, ranked Nos. 10 and 11 in the world, are
trying to qualify for the last spots in the ATP Tour Championships
in Hanover, Germany, later this month.
	   ``I think I've got to get to the finals'' at the Stockholm Open,
Rusedski said. ``I'm just thinking about my tennis and everything
else will take care of itself.... If it works, it works. If it
doesn't, it doesn't.''
	   Rusedski is on a roll. Last week he beat Sampras at the Paris
Open, a win he considers ``probably my greatest accomplishment in
tennis, by far.''
	   In other matches Wednesday, American Todd Martin defeated
Australia's hard-serving Wayne Arthurs, 6-4, 6-3, to join Henman in
the quarterfinals.
	   Arthurs, a 27-year-old doubles specialist from Adelaide, got to
face Martin by upsetting tournament second seed and world No. 7
Karol Kucera of Slovakia the evening before. He started sharp with
three aces in his first game, but the more experienced Martin broke
his serve in game three of each set, and wore him down.
	   Martin's play was business-like. He rarely fell behind in the
count, won the big points including service breaks early in each
set, and never lost his serve.
	   Arthurs, ranked No. 168, notched at least one ace in every
service game except one, and had 15 overall.
	   The tournament is being played on the hard composition court of
the Royal Tennis Hall.

Spanish crown prince to tour Central America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Crown Prince Felipe of Spain will visit the
four Central American countries worst hit by Hurricane Mitch to
show Spanish solidarity with the victims of the disaster, a palace
spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The heir to the Spanish throne was to begin his tour in Honduras
on Friday, continuing on to Nicaragua, El Salvador and finally
Guatemala before leaving for Spain on Monday, palace spokesman Blas
Fernandez said.
	   Prince Felipe was hoping to meet with the president in each
country, Fernandez said.
	   Also Wednesday, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar announced that
the government will make available to the area soft-term financing
totaling 18.5 billion pesetas (dlrs 132 million).
	   Some Spanish relief organizations, such as Itermon, criticized
the promised aid package, stressing that the stricken countries
needed donations rather than credit, however soft the terms, the
state-owned news agency EFE reported.
	   The storm killed an estimated 10,000 people, left hundreds of
thousands homeless and destroyed economic infrastructure making
reconstruction even more difficult.
	   The worst hit were Honduras and Nicaragua who appealed for help
with their foreign debts during a summit of Central American
presidents Monday.
	   Aznar said the Spanish government would also pardon about 9
billion pesetas (dlrs 64 million) _ nearly 30 percent of what is
owned to Spain by the four countries _ by waving payments due
before the year 2002.
	   Meanwhile, money continued to pour into Spanish relief
organizations. The Spanish Red Cross said Wednesday it had
collected over 5 billion pesetas (dlrs 36 million) in a little over
a week.

Cabinet convenes to ratify peace agreement with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with TV report saying Netanyahu has trouble getting
the agreement approved, with only eight of 17 ministers supporting
it &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After two weeks of repeated delays and bitter
disputes with the Palestinians over security issues, Israel's
Cabinet convened Wednesday to ratify the Wye peace accord.
	   However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attached several
stipulations to the land-for-security agreement that could cause
new disruptions and threaten implementation in the future.
	   Netanyahu's office said Wednesday evening that the vote was
expected shortly and that Netanyahu would then convene an 8 p.m.
(1800 gmt) news conference. However, the news conference was
delayed amid reports by Israel TV's Channel Two that only eight of
17 ministers were willing to back the agreement.
	   Attempting to persuade some of the hardliners, Netanyahu
promised to begin construction of the Jewish neighborhood of Har
Homa in disputed east Jerusalem shortly, the report said. The
Palestinians claim east Jerusalem as a future capital, and have
responded angrily to the construction of Jewish neighborhoods.
	   If the Cabinet in the end approves the accord Wednesday evening,
parliament could begin its debate on Monday and hold a vote by
Tuesday.

Russian parliament asks U.S. to avoid anti-dumping measures on
</HEADLINE>
metal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian lawmakers sent a letter to U.S. Vice
President Al Gore on Wednesday urging him to avoid anti-dumping
sanctions on Russian metal imports, a news report said.
	   The Communist-dominated lower house of parliament, the State
Duma, warned about the possibility of ``serious problems in
Russian-American economic relations due to the start of dumping
action against Russian suppliers of metal products to the U.S.
market,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Prices for foreign steel in the United States have fallen
sharply because of the weakened economies of Russia and Asia.
	   Leading U.S. steel companies have accused Japan, Russia and
Brazil of dumping steel on the U.S. market at prices dramatically
below production costs, causing layoffs and lower profits at
American plants.
	   Russian steel workers have insisted that Russian steel is more
expensive in the United States than in Russia, so there are no need
for trade sanctions. They have also appealed to Gore not to impose
the anti-dumping measures.
	   The Russian lawmakers' appeal, which was supported by 290
deputies in the 450-seat house, also suggested a meeting between
members of the Duma and the U.S. Congress to find a solution.
	   Meanwhile, Governor Vyacheslav Pozgalev of the central Russian
region of Vologda announced an agreement on steel delivery to
Belarus from Russian steel giant Severostal.
	   The deal to provide 500,000 tons of steel to Belarus in exchange
for tractors will ``almost completely make up for the losses caused
by the shrinking export of steel to the United States due to the
campaign launched there to introduce anti-dumping tarriffs on
imported Russian metal,'' Pozgalev was quoted by the ITAR-Tass news
agency as saying.

Turkish premier pressured to quit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with premier vowing to stay on, comment from Taner;
Corrects that minister resigned two months ago, sted last month &QL; 
 &UR; By SUZAN FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Opposition parties lodged no-confidence
motions Wednesday against Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz after
allegations he interfered in the privatization of a bank and helped
a businessman linked to a mobster.
	   Yilmaz' minority government could go down if the the small,
center-left Republican Party, which usually gives him the majority
he needs in parliament, votes against him.
	   The leader of the Republicans, Deniz Baykal, urged Yilmaz to
resign. ``Turkey is in shock,'' he said. ``The prime minister must
do the right thing.''
	   But Yilmaz vowed to stay on, saying he was the victim of a
conspiracy.
	   ``This is a plot and it can't be a reason for a resignation,''
Yilmaz said, adding that he intended to continue the ``struggle
against organized crime.''
	   The True Path party, led by Yilmaz' chief center-right rival,
former Premier Tansu Ciller, and the main opposition group, the
pro-Islamic Virtue party, submitted no-confidence motions accusing
the premier of abusing his powers and having alleged links to
organized crime.
	   It will take more than a week for the motions to come to the
floor.
	   Yasar Okuyan, a close aide of Yilmaz, came to his defense
Wednesday accusing the businessman who incriminated the premier of
presenting a ``one-sided version of events.''
	   The allegations were made by businessman Korkmaz Yigit, who
claimed that Yilmaz and Gunes Taner, the economy minister, had
encouraged him to buy the state-run bank Turkbank, offering him
loans from other state banks to ensure that his offer was the
highest bid.
	   Yigit's allegations were carried Tuesday night on two of his TV
channels which showed a videotape he had made to explain his
version of the story before his detention Monday evening for
questioning about the bidding.
	   Yigit bought the bank at a public auction in August for dlrs 600
million. The government suspended the privatization last month
after a lawmaker released an audio tape of a conversation
supposedly between Yigit and mobster Alaattin Cakici.
	   On that earlier tape, Cakici was heard assuring Yigit that he
will fend off rival bidders. It was not clear who made the tape,
which got into the hands of an opposition deputy.
	   Yigit claimed Yilmaz and Taner were aware of Cakici's
involvement in the bidding for the bank but urged him nevertheless
to go ahead with the bidding. Taner denied Yigit's allegations.
	   Yilmaz has said that an intelligence report revealing Yigit's
ties with Cakici only reached him after Yigit won the tender.
	   Yigit said the premier had also encouraged him to buy
mass-circulation national newspaper Milliyet, apparently to ensure
the paper's backing to his center-right Motherland party in
elections next year. Milliyet's sale to Yigit was canceled after
the scandal.
	   Cakici was arrested in France in August. Turkey has requested
his extradition.
	   State Minister Eyup Asik resigned two months ago after
allegations he had been in close contact with Cakici.

	   YPRES, Belgium (AP) _ Head bowed in silence, Queen Elizabeth II
completed a day of World War 1 commemorations Wednesday under a
vast arch bearing the names of 55,000 Commonwealth soldiers slain
in the mud of Flanders Fields and whose remains were never found.
	   And in a ceremony of equal historic resonance in nearby Mesen,
she and Irish President Mary McAleese dedicated a monument to
50,000 Irishmen _ Catholics and Protestants _ who died in the Great
War.
	   Their sacrifice has been ignored at home for decades because
they fought for Britain against Germany as Ireland revolted against
British rule.
	   The Irish monument _ a Celtic stone tower _ also symbolizes
reconciliation in today's Ireland after this year's Ulster peace
accord.
	   At Ypres _ in the dying autumn sunlight and to the strains of
buglers playing Taps (Last Post) _ the British monarch met with
survivors of the war that ended 80 years ago.
	   A scarlet shower of 55,000 poppy petals _ one for each missing
soldier whose name is carved into the arch _ fell from the 30-meter
tall stone structure during a minute's silence.
	   The ceremonies here and in Paris earlier were likely the last
major anniversary of the Great War including veterans of the
carnage.
	   ``It is not easy to tell people about how it was or how we felt.
Sometimes it was just overwhelming,'' said William Cotgrove, 102,
who fought at Ypres.
	   In Paris, the queen met with four World War I veterans, all 101
or older.
	   The exact anniversary of when the guns fell silent _ at the 11th
hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 _ was marked there
with pomp and ceremony.
	   At the stroke of 11, the queen arrived at the Arc de Triomphe
where she was greeted by President Jacques Chirac and laid a wreath
by the eternal flame at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
	   ``It is exactly 80 years ago today, that the arms fell silent in
Europe after four terrible years of fire and blood,'' she said.
``Eight million men were dead.''
	   While France remembered the slaughter at Verdun, where 250,000
French and German soldiers fell, the British made Ypres the center
of its remembrance. British and Commonwealth soldiers battled for
almost the whole of the War in trenches around here.
	   Tens of thousands flocked here for the ceremony. They came from
France, Belgium and all corners of Britain and its former Empire _
from Scots in kilts to Sikhs in turbans.
	   ``It's important that we let our children know that our
forefathers also fought in the First World War,'' said Jatinder
Singh, 44, a Sikh who brought his daughter here from their home in
the Netherlands.
	   In Britain, 43 million people observed a two-minute silence at
11 AM (1000 GMT) to pay homage to the fallen of both world wars.
	   The scope of the First World War death toll becomes clear at the
Menin Gate and areas around this West Belgian town made famous by
John McCrae. The Canadian soldier penned a poem starting with the
memorable lines: ``In Flanders fields the poppies blow, between the
crosses, row on row...''
	   Three major battles were fought at Ypres. In one, in October,
1914, the British Expeditionary Force of 100,000 was cut in half.
In another _ in April, 1915 _ the Germans used poison gas for the
first time in warfare.
	   Starting in 1914, the Great War was a four-year nightmare of
unimaginable brutality in which millions died.
	   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was absent from the
ceremonies. His office said he was not invited and any
interpretation of his no-show as a snub was a ``misunderstanding.''
	   But in Weisswasser, Germany, a Franco-German brigade marked
Armistice Day with a roll call in a sign of reconciliation of
former enemies. Armistice Day is not celebrated in Germany, which
was defeated in the two world wars of this century.
	   The First World War killed 13 million civilians and 8.5 million
soldiers. Germany lost 1.7 million soldiers; France, 1.3 million,
Britain more than 900,000; Italy 650,000 and the United States
116,000.

Prime minister expands cooperation with third party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The governing Labor Party and the small Liberal
Democrat party will work together in several areas of domestic
policy, building on their cooperation on constitutional reform, the
two party leaders said Wednesday.
	   Their cooperation, they said, was intended in part to prevent a
return to power by the Conservative Party, which governed for 18
consecutive years before losing the 1997 election.
	   A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said, however, that
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown would not be given a seat in
the Cabinet.
	   Blair's spokesman, Alistair Campbell, said possible areas of
cooperation included European issues and social policy, such as
welfare reform, education and health.
	   Blair, whose party won 418 of the 659 seats in the House of
Commons in the last election, has no immediate need for support
from the Lib Dems, who had their best-ever showing with 46 seats.
But the Liberal Democrats have supported Blair's moves to
decentralize power in Britain by creating new legislatures in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; both parties support greater
integration within the European Union, and the two parties have few
differences on the broad sweep of domestic policy.
	   ``Of course we are two sovereign and independent parties working
together where we agree and opposing each other where we do not,''
Blair and Ashdown said in a joint statement.
	   ``Our parties will continue to offer different choices to the
British people in the ballot box whenever the appropriate
opportunity arises.''
	   Among their goals, they said, was ``to ensure the ascendancy of
progressive politics in Britain, against a Conservative Party which
seems determined to travel further and further to the right.''

said the adviser, David Bar-Illan. He said the pullback could not

JERUSALEM: the deal.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke with Netanyahu on Tuesday
night about the land-for-security agreement and about the U.S.
showdown with Iraq over weapons inspections.
	   An Israeli official said the United States has let it be known
that its policy of being tough on Iraq was encountering problems in
the Arab world because Israel had not moved forward on its
implementation of the Wye agreement.
	   Over the past two weeks, with Netanyahu postponing Cabinet
debate four times, the United States urged Israel to try and stick
to the original time table of the agreement. Israel is to hand over
13 percent of the West Bank over a period of 12 weeks that
concludes at the end of January. In exchange, the Palestinians are
to step up their campaign against Palestinians militants.
	   Jewish settlers who oppose the agreement, saying it will isolate
more than a dozen of settlements in the West Bank, staged a protest
rally in Tel Aviv on Wednesday evening.
	   Netanyahu decided to attach several stipulations to the accord
that seemed aimed mainly at winning the support of hardline Cabinet
ministers.
	   A key Israeli demand concerns the procedure for revoking clauses
of the PLO founding charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   The Wye agreement says that the Palestine National Council and
other Palestinian organizations will convene in mid-December to
``reaffirm'' a January letter by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to Clinton that lists the clauses considered annulled.
	   Israel insists that the Palestinian delegates hold a vote and
Netanyahu said Tuesday that the agreement would only be carried out
if the Palestinians comply. Palestinian officials have said only
approval by acclamation was required.
	   The Maariv daily said the dispute has been resolved quietly by
the United States. Under the compromise, the delegates will vote by
a show of hands, but not all members of the PNC, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, will have to be present and there will be no
need for a two-thirds majority, Maariv said.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel ordered the army to reopen gas mask
distribution centers Wednesday and a special adviser to Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said chances were high that the United
States would strike at Iraq soon.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with U.S. President Bill
Clinton Tuesday and discussed the growing crisis with Iraq over
United Nations weapons inspections.
	   As a result of the conversation, the Haaretz newspaper said
there was speculation Netanyahu then moved to convene his Cabinet
and approve the Mideast peace accord in order to remove any
obstacles for the U.S. in gathering support from the Arab world for
possible strikes.
	   An Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the United States let it be known that its policy of being tough on
Iraq was encountering problems in the Arab world because Israel had
not moved forward on its implementation of the Wye agreement.
	   Mordechai was absent for most of Wednesday's Cabinet session,
according to Israeli radios, dealing with the latest Gulf crisis
from military headquarters in Tel Aviv.
	   His special adviser, Gen. David Ivri, who headed Israel's
defense ministry for over 20 years said in a statement Wednesday
that the current situation ``indicates a high probability of an
American attack on Iraq.''
	   In a new travel advisory, U.S. citizens were told they may want
to leave Israel and the Palestinian areas because of the situation
in the Gulf.
	   In Washington, the State Department authorized the departure of
employees in non-essential positions, the advisory said. It was not
clear whether employees of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv and the
Consulate in Jerusalem were preparing to leave.
	   The advisory said that the United States has not ruled out any
options in trying to get Iraq to comply with a U.N.-mandated
weapons inspections program.
	   ``Iraq's continued defiance of the will of the international
community ... is heightening the level of risk to American citizens
in the Middle East,'' the statement said.
	   In previous crises surrounding Iraq, there was concern about
chemical and biological warfare and ``although such a risk is
remote, it cannot be excluded,'' the advisory said.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Netanyahu discussed the crisis with Mordechai
and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon. Israel radio reported that the
three men ordered the army to begin preparing the public in case of
any strikes against Iraq. Gas mask and information centers were to
reopen Thursday.
	   In the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles with
conventional warheads at Israel in hopes of breaking up the Arab
coalition against it. However, Israel did not retaliate and the
coalition held.
	   In a subsequent U.S.-Iraq crisis in February, Iraq did not make
any attempt to draw Israel into the dispute.
	   ``We're examining now the situation, the various implications of
what is developing, and we'll take the precautions as necessary,''
Netanyahu told reporters. ``Israel understands it has a grave
responsibility to take all the steps to defend itself and its
citizens and it never fails to do so.''
	   Israel is trying to stay out of the confrontation, officials
said. ``We are not a part of this conflict, except as members of
the United Nations,'' a Foreign Ministry official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``And right now, the issue is between the
United States and Iraq.''
	   A special envoy of Jordan's King Hussein, Jawad Annani, met with
Netanyahu and Sharon on Wednesday, and officials in Amman said the
envoy apparently asked Israel to remain on the sidelines.

treatment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Syrian dissident Nizar Nayouf could
die in a Syrian jail unless his government relents and allows him
immediate medical attention, a Copenhagen-based human rights group
said Wednesday.
	   The 36-year-old journalist, writer and activist is serving a
10-year jail sentence in Syria for ``practicing his internationally
recognized right to free expression,'' the Euro-Mediterranean Human
Rights Network said in a statement said.
	   The group claimed that Syrian authorities have refused medical
treatment for Nayouf ``unless he pledges to refrain for political
activities and renounces alleged 'false statements' he made about
the human rights situation in Syria.''
	   ``He may die unless he receives immediate treatment for
Hodgkin's disease, a form of cancer that can be cured with proper
treatment,'' said group, which also asked to be allowed to visit
Nayouf in jail.
	   Nayouf was a founding member of the Committee for the Defense of
Democratic Freedoms and Human Rights in Syria, according to an
earlier statement by the New York-based Human Rights Watch.
	   Nayouf was arrested in January 1992 as part of a Syrian
government crackdown on the country's nascent human rights
movement. Three months later, he was sentenced by the Supreme State
Security Court to 10 years in prison and has been incarcerated at
the Mezze military prison in the Syrian capital Damascus, Human
Rights Watch recently said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Canadian Sebastien Lareau upset top-seeded Alex
Corretja of Spain in the second round of the dlrs 1.1 million
Kremlin Cup on Wednesday.
	   For Lareau, a 25-year-old doubles specialist, it was the second
upset of a top-ten player since 1996, when he downed Michael Stich
of Germany, ranked fourth at that time.
	   After trading serve breaks early in the first set, both players
held serve in the next two games, when Lareau broke Corretja three
more times in the first set to win it 6-3.
	   ``It was my last big tournament of the year, so I just wanted to
go out and play as wise as I can,'' Lareau told reporters.
	   The Canadian closed the second set 6-3.
	   Corretja has already qualified for the ATP Championship in
Hanover, Germany, later this month.
	   Another upset came later in the day when Jan Kroslak of Slovakia
ousted fourth-seeded Byron Black of Zimbabwe 6-4, 6-4.
	   Defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, seeded second,
lost the first set to Sebastien Grosjean of France but gained
control in the second and won the match 2-6, 6-3, 6-2.
	   Former Kremlin Cup champion Croatian Goran Ivanisevic won the
first set and was ahead 3-2 in the second when his opponent Jerome
Golmard of France withdrew on an injury.
	   In other action Wednesday, German qualifier Lars Burgsmuller
made his way to the quarterfinals as he ousted Sjeng Schalken of
the Netherlands, 6-3, 5-7.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A car carrying student activists
plowed into a group of riot officers Wednesday, injuring nine and
prompting enraged soldiers to fire warning shots and club
protesters demonstrating against a controversial government
assembly.
	   It was the second day of violence during a meeting of
Indonesia's highest legislative body, once an instrument of former
President Suharto's authoritarian rule and now the self-appointed
promoter of a transition to democracy.
	   Protesters say the People's Consultative Assembly is not serious
about reform and is only using the promise of democratic change to
maintain the old political order.
	   After nightfall, troop presence was heavy in some areas of
Jakarta, with dozens of soldiers deployed near the opulent home of
U.S. Ambassador Stapleton Roy and other streets where protesters
had marched.
	   Earlier, several thousand students tried to march to Parliament,
but hundreds of troops blocked their way on a main thoroughfare
near luxury hotels and foreign embassies.
	   The standoff turned violent when a red Volkswagen driven at high
speed by a student hit the soldiers. Nine soldiers were
hospitalized, state-run television reported. One was dragged away
unconscious by fellow officers, his face bleeding profusely.
	   Troops then fired shots and lashed out with clubs, injuring
several protesters and three local news photographers. About 40
Indonesian journalists later protested at Parliament against the
treatment of their colleagues, demanding that the officers who beat
them be put on trial.
	   The male driver of the car, a student from the prestigious
University of Indonesia, was arrested. It was not immediately known
why he careened into the line of security forces.
	   At another protest, two female students were hospitalized in
serious condition after they were run down by a car. Privately
owned RCTI television quoted witnesses as saying military personnel
were in the vehicle.
	   The incidents were likely to heighten tension in the Indonesian
capital, where about 30,000 police and soldiers are safeguarding
the assembly as it draws up rules for parliamentary elections in
1999.
	   President B.J. Habibie, a one-time protege of Suharto who has
legalized political parties and made other democratic reforms,
opened the four-day meeting Tuesday. Critics suspect that Habibie,
who is expected to stand as a presidential candidate next year, may
be maneuvering to consolidate his power.
	   In May, deadly riots erupted across Jakarta when military
personnel shot to death four student protesters. The unrest, fueled
by discontent over Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades,
helped oust Suharto after 32 years in power.
	   This week, the army said troops had only been issued with blanks
and plastic bullets. But on Tuesday, military-backed civilian
guards carrying sharpened bamboo staves brawled with students and
neighborhood youths in several areas.
	   The military has managed to keep most student protesters away
from Parliament, where assembly delegates are debating demands to
scale back the armed forces' prominent role in politics.
	   The students want the military, which has 75 appointed seats in
the 500-seat Parliament, to be banned altogether from the chamber.
They also demand that Suharto be tried for alleged corruption and
human rights abuses.
	   Student protesters are deeply skeptical that the 1,000-member
assembly, which includes legislators and presidential appointees,
is willing to shake off its legacy as a defender of the political
elite.
	   ``It's not possible to trust the assembly, because its agenda is
to maintain the status quo,'' said Reindhart, a student who marched
down an avenue lined with mansions in an elite residential
district.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations evacuated all of its
weapons inspectors and many of its humanitarian workers from
Baghdad on Wednesday, blaming fears of ``possible military action''
against President Saddam Hussein's regime.
	   The hasty withdrawal _ conducted amid drenching rainstorms _
involved more than 200 U.N. staffers and raised fears that a
military strike by the United States and Britain is imminent.
	   Iraq showed no sign of backing down from its refusal to deal
with the arms inspectors, the nub of the crisis. The evacuation was
not reported by the Iraqi media, and there was little evidence of
Iraqis panicking or rushing to stock up on food.
	   Prakash Shah, the special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, said the withdrawal was ``in the background of possible
military action against Iraq. This is what we learned in our
consultations with New York.''
	   The United States and Britain have been threatening military
action since Iraq announced Oct. 31 that it was halting the
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   UNSCOM officials in Baghdad did not learn of plans to evacuate
until chief weapons inspector Richard Butler called from New York
at 4 a.m. Baghdad time Wednesday and ordered the entire staff out,
said UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross.
	   Speaking from Bahrain where she was evacuated, She said 103
staffers of UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency had
pulled out. UNSCOM field officer in Baghdad, Goran Wallen, said no
one from the commission was left behind in Baghdad.
	   In addition, about 130 of the 450 humanitarian workers in Iraq
withdrew Wednesday and were headed to the Jordanian capital of
Amman by road. There was confusion over the numbers, and earlier
U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, estimated 300
were leaving.
	   U.N. officials said about 40 more humanitarian workers would
leave on Thursday, but apparently UNSCOM monitors will remain in
the northern Kurdish areas.
	   The departing U.N. workers gave hugs to colleagues remaining
behind _ including Iraq staff _ but refused to talk to reporters.
	   As the buses were leaving, U.N. workers were hanging mesh
screens over the glass windows of the U.N. headquarters on the
outskirts of Baghdad _ likely a precaution against flying glass in
the event of a military strike.
	   Iraq says it will not resume cooperation with UNSCOM unless the
U.N. Security Council moves to begin lifting trade sanctions
imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Shah told reporters he was in close contact with Iraq's Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   The Iraqis ``will not be able to desist from their position
unless the Security Council takes some action with regard to
sanctions against Iraq,'' Shah quoted Aziz as saying.
	   The U.N. employees left in two convoys of buses and a fleet of
white U.N. cars and vans. The first was led by a white van flying
the blue-and-white U.N. flag.
	   Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs here, said
that only ``a number of core (U.N.) officials will remain in
Baghdad.'' He declined to give figures.
	   Falt told reporters that the withdrawal was ``precautionary ...
temporary'' and ``solely with the safety of U.N. staff in mind.''
	   Most of the relief workers monitored the United Nation's
oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities
of crude oil to buy needed food and medicine for its 22 million
people.
	   It is not clear how the withdrawal will effect the program even
though Iraq has food in its warehouses. The pullout, however, is
likely to halt the work of other specialized agencies such as the
U.N. Children's Fund, the U.N. Development Program and the World
Health Organization.
	   Among those staying in the country were Shah and Hans von
Sponeck, the head of U.N. humanitarian operations who took up his
post in Iraq on Monday.
	   The first convoy of three buses, which appeared to carry mainly
U.N. weapons experts, left U.N. headquarters at about 10 a.m. (0700
gmt) The buses were accompanied by about 10 U.N. vans and cars.
	   The second convoy set out four hours later with four buses
carrying mainly relief workers across the desert to neighboring
Jordan. A fifth bus accompanied the convoy in case of a breakdown.
	   Some U.N. people staying behind were seen carrying their
suitcases into U.N. headquarters, and it appeared they would both
work and sleep in the building. It's a brick structure, painted in
the blue and white colors of the United Nations, that bristles with
antennas for international communications.
	   The crisis had been simmering since Aug. 5 when Iraq said it was
halting the work of U.N. inspectors, who carried out unannounced
spot checks of suspected weapons sites. On Oct. 31, Iraq expanded
its work ban to UNSCOM monitors, who conduct long-term surveillance
to ensure Iraq doesn't rearm.
	   Iraq is required to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction
under U.N. resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War by U.S.-led
allies to evict Iraq out of Kuwait.
	   In the current crisis, Iraq has remained adamant about keeping
out UNSCOM despite threats of military strikes.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency on Wednesday quoted Abdel-Ghani
Abdel-Ghafour, a senior member of Saddam's ruling Baath party, as
saying that ``Arab nations _ both on popular and official
government levels _ reject continuing U.S. threats to launch a new
military aggression on Iraq.''
	   He said this showed ``how serious the Arabs are in their
solidarity with Iraq to lift the sanctions.''

Saudis draw 0-0 with Qatar, jeopardize chances for Gulf Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Saudi Arabia played Qatar to a 0-0 draw
Wednesday, missing a chance to grab the Gulf Cup before the last
day of the tournament.
	   Second-place Kuwait, an eight-time champion, can now win the
title again if it beats the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, the
last day of the match. A draw or loss would give the Saudis the
cup.
	   Thousands of disappointed Saudi fans wreaked havoc after the end
of the match tearing out chairs and throwing them on to the soccer
field, witnesses said.
	   Dozens of police were called in to bring the Saudi fans under
control.
	   Some 20,000 spectators attended the match.
	   Saudi Arabia leads the standings with 11 points and a victory
would have given the Saudis the cup.
	   Saudi Arabia dominated most of the first half of Wednesday's
match, with striker Obaid al-Dossary and forward Khalid al-Timawi
penetrating the Qatari defense. There were, however, not able to
score.
	   In the second half, both sides were reduced to 10 men following
red cards in the final minutes, but neither team was able to
dominate.

Cabinet ratifies peace agreement with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, UPDATES with Israeli stipulations &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli Cabinet on Wednesday ratified the
peace agreement with the Palestinians after a two-week delay and
some U.S. prodding, setting the stage for an Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January.
	   The accord was narrowly approved by eight of the 17 ministers.
Five abstained and four voted against.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attached four stipulations to
the land-for-security agreement that could cause new disruptions
and threaten implementation in the future.
	   Among other things, Netanyahum said Israel reserved the right to
annex areas of the West Bank if Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
goes ahead with plans to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state
in May, at the end of the five-year autonomy period.
	   The vote came at the the end of a seven-hour Cabinet session.
Parliament is to begin its debate on Monday and to hold a vote by
Tuesday.
	   Despite the ratification, a senior Netanyahu adviser said it was
unlikely Israel would meet its first key commitment, a pullback
from 2 percent of the West Bank, by Monday's deadline.
	   The troop redeployment might be delayed by as much as a week,
said the adviser, David Bar-Illan. He said the pullback could not
take place until parliament has approved the deal.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke with Netanyahu on Tuesday
night about the land-for-security agreement and about the U.S.
showdown with Iraq over weapons inspections.
	   An Israeli official said the United States has let it be known
that its policy of being tough on Iraq was encountering problems in
the Arab world because Israel had not moved forward on its
implementation of the Wye agreement.
	   Over the past two weeks, with Netanyahu postponing Cabinet
debate four times, the United States urged Israel to try and stick
to the original time table of the agreement. Israel is to hand over
13 percent of the West Bank over a period of 12 weeks that
concludes at the end of January. In exchange, the Palestinians are
to step up their campaign against Palestinians militants.
	   While the Cabinet voted, thousands of Jewish settlers staged a
protest rally in Tel Aviv. Under the banner ``We remain faithful to
the Land of Israel,'' speakers sharply criticized the government
for agreeing to hand over land to the Palestinians. Settlers say
the troop pullback will isolate more than a dozen of settlements.
	   Netanyahu decided to attach several stipulations to the accord
that seemed aimed mainly at winning the support of hardline Cabinet
ministers.
	   A key Israeli demand concerns the procedure for revoking clauses
of the PLO founding charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   The Wye agreement says that the Palestine National Council and
other Palestinian organizations will convene in mid-December to
``reaffirm'' a January letter by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to Clinton that lists the clauses considered annulled.
	   Israel insists that the Palestinian delegates hold a vote and
Netanyahu said Wednesday that the agreement would only be carried
out if the Palestinians comply. Palestinian officials have said
only approval by acclamation was required.
	   The Maariv daily said the dispute has been resolved quietly by
the United States. Under the compromise, the delegates will vote by
a show of hands, but not all members of the PNC, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, will have to be present and there will be no
need for a two-thirds majority, Maariv said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Canada's visiting Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy
held talks Wednesday on Russia's economic crisis, a development
that prompted the postponement of the Canadian prime minister's
trip to Moscow.
	   Axworthy discussed Russia's economic woes and international
problems during a meeting Wednesday with Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, Russian news
agencies reported.
	   There have also been media reports that Canada was considering
humanitarian aid to Russia's vast Arctic regions.
	   Axworthy had originally been scheduled to lay the groundwork for
a visit by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who was to lead a
delegation of Canadian business executives to Russia in January.
	   But Chretien's visit was first scaled back and then put off
altogether two weeks ago because of Russia's economic crisis.
	   Axworthy discussed future Russian-Canadian cooperation during
the meeting with Primakov.
	   ``We are interested in developing relations with Canada,''
Primakov said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Axworthy also met with Russian regional leaders and the
government's economic officials during his one-day stay in Moscow.
	   Axworthy and Ivanov discussed the problems in Iraq and Kosovo,
and Canada's upcoming two-year term on the U.N. Security Council,
ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported.
	   ``This circumstance gives additional importance to Canada's
position in the international arena,'' Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin was quoted as saying by Interfax.
	   Axworthy flew back home later Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Opposition parties lodged no-confidence
motions Wednesday against Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz after
allegations he interfered in the privatization of a bank and helped
a businessman linked to a mobster.
	   Yilmaz' minority government could go down if the the small,
center-left Republican Party, which usually gives him the majority
he needs in parliament, votes against him.
	   The leader of the Republicans, Deniz Baykal, urged Yilmaz to
resign. But the premier vowed Wednesday to stay on, saying he was
the victim of a conspiracy.
	   ``This is a plot and it can't be a reason for a resignation,''
Yilmaz said, adding that he intended to continue the ``struggle
against organized crime.''
	   Afterward, Baykal said the Republicans would support a
no-confidence motion.
	   The leader of the Democratic Turkey Party, Husamettin Cindoruk,
said his party might withdraw from the governing coalition. He said
the party would announce its decision Thursday.

	   The accord was narrowly approved by eight of the 17 ministers.
Five abstained and four voted against.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attached four stipulations to
the land-for-security agreement that could cause new disruptions
and threaten implementation in the future.
	   Among other things, Netanyahu said Israel reserved the right to
annex areas of the West Bank if Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
goes ahead with plans to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state
in May, at the end of the five-year autonomy period.
	   The vote came at the end of a seven-hour Cabinet session.
Parliament is to begin its debate on Monday and to hold a vote by
Tuesday.
	   Despite the ratification, a senior Netanyahu adviser said it was
unlikely Israel would meet its first key commitment, a pullback
from 2 percent of the West Bank, by Monday's deadline.
	   The troop redeployment might be delayed by as much as a week,
said the adviser, David Bar-Illan. He said the pullback could not
take place until parliament has approved the deal.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke with Netanyahu on Tuesday
night about the land-for-security agreement and about the U.S.
showdown with Iraq over weapons inspections.
	   An Israeli official said the United States has let it be known
that its policy of being tough on Iraq was encountering problems in
the Arab world because Israel had not moved forward on its
implementation of the Wye agreement.
	   Over the past two weeks, with Netanyahu postponing Cabinet
debate four times, the United States urged Israel to try and stick
to the original time table of the agreement. Israel is to hand over
13 percent of the West Bank over a period of 12 weeks that
concludes at the end of January. In exchange, the Palestinians are
to step up their campaign against Palestinian militants.
	   While the Cabinet voted, thousands of Jewish settlers staged a
protest rally in Tel Aviv. Under the banner ``We remain faithful to
the Land of Israel,'' speakers sharply criticized the government
for agreeing to hand over land to the Palestinians. Settlers say
the troop pullback will isolate more than a dozen of settlements.
	   Netanyahu decided to attach several stipulations to the accord
that seemed aimed mainly at winning the support of hard-line
Cabinet ministers.
	   A key Israeli demand concerns the procedure for revoking clauses
of the PLO founding charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   The Wye agreement says that the Palestine National Council and
other Palestinian organizations will convene in mid-December to
``reaffirm'' a January letter by Arafat to Clinton that lists the
clauses considered annulled.
	   Israel insists that the Palestinian delegates hold a vote and
Netanyahu said Wednesday that the agreement would only be carried
out if the Palestinians comply. Palestinian officials have said
only approval by acclamation was required.
	   The Maariv daily said the dispute has been resolved quietly by
the United States. Under the compromise, the delegates will vote by
a show of hands, but not all members of the PNC, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, will have to be present and there will be no
need for a two-thirds majority, Maariv said.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli Cabinet on Wednesday ratified the
peace agreement with the Palestinians after a two-week delay and
some U.S. prodding, setting the stage for an Israeli troop

Athens organizers seek an early start to image making

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The 2004 Olympics may be six years away,
but the International Olympic Committee on Wednesday launched a
design conference on how that and future summer games should look
and be marketed.
	   ``It's a lot more than than just coming up with an emblem,
sticking it on sponsors' products,'' said Michael Payne,
International Olympic Committee Marketing Director.
	   He was here to help conduct a one-day design conference to
educate advertisers and marketers on how to develop the Olympic
image. Adding their expertise were members of the Barcelona,
Lillihammer, Atlanta, Nagano and Sydney organizing committees.
	   Athens organizers say they want an early start in order to be
able to keep a pledge made before Athens was given the Games to rid
the Olympics of the ``rampant commercialism'' that marred Atlanta.
	   And it's not just the IOC and organizers who say they want to
keep such commercialization away from the event.
	   Greeks have one of the world's highest rates of intolerance to
commercialization, 85 percent compared to the global average of 63
percent, according to Brad Copeland, an IOC marketing
representative.
	   ``But,'' said Athens Organizing Committee President Stratis
Stratigis, ``without commercialization, there can be no Games.''
	   That's why design and image play a critical role in the overall
presentation of the Games, Payne explained to an audience of 200
Greek and international marketing and advertising representatives.
	   ``The Olympic Games are primarily a visual experience for
everyone,'' Payne said. ``It is the image of the Games that is
spread over various venues around the city that provides the visual
continuity of the experience.''
	   He added that the Games' theme or message should convey the
cultural character and personality of the host city.
	   ``Nothing has the potential to change or to enhance people's
perceptions of a country like the Olympic Games,'' Payne said. ``It
is a truly unique opportunity. The image that is created by the
host committee must speak to the world.''
	   The advertising and marketing representatives will participate
in contests to design, among other things, the logo, mascot, torch
and medals for the 2004 Olympics. The open call for entries for the
Athens logo will be in January 1999.
	   Payne said that many people around the world were anticipating
the Games' return to their birthplace and that the expectations are
high.
	   ``We have to take advantage of it, but in a way that won't be
chauvinistic or kitsch,'' Stratigis said.

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Saudi Arabia played Qatar to a 0-0 draw
Wednesday, missing a chance to grab the Gulf Cup before the last
day of the tournament and sparking a melee by fans disappointed by
the draw.
	   Second-place Kuwait, an eight-time champion, can now win the
title again if it beats the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, the
last day of the match. A draw or loss would give the Saudis the
cup.
	   Thousands of disappointed Saudi fans wreaked havoc after the end
of the match tearing out chairs and throwing them onto the soccer
field, witnesses said.
	   Dozens of police were called in to bring the Saudi fans under
control.
	   Some 20,000 spectators attended the match.
	   Saudi Arabia leads the standings with 11 points and a victory
would have given the Saudis the cup.
	   Saudi Arabia dominated most of the first half of Wednesday's
match, with striker Obaid al-Dossary and forward Khalid al-Timawi
penetrating the Qatari defense. There were, however, not able to
score.
	   In the second half, both sides were reduced to 10 men following
red cards in the final minutes, but neither team was able to
dominate.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese President Elias Hrawi was
recovering Wednesday from a mild heart attack, hospital officials
said Wednesday.
	   A statement issued by Sacre Coeur Hospital in suburban Beirut
said the life of the 73-year-old leader was not in danger.
	   ``He is recuperating steadily,'' the statement said.
	   Hrawi, who is due to step down as president on Nov. 24, fell ill
at the presidential palace in Baabda on Tuesday night and was taken
to the hospital for medical tests.
	   He spent the night in intensive care, with his wife Mona at his
bedside, presidential aides said.
	   He was removed from intensive care at around noon Wednesday,
presidential aides said.
	   The first lady said the president would undergo further tests
within the next 48 hours.
	   ``We hope the president will leave hospital either Saturday
evening or Sunday morning,'' she added.
	   The presidential palace said in a statement that Hrawi's
condition ``does not warrant any worry.''
	   Hrawi's heart attack came less than two weeks before he hands
over power to President-elect Emile Lahoud at the end of an
extended nine years in office.
	   Media reports said the president's illness would not delay the
transition of power between Hrawi and Lahoud.
	   Hrawi appeared on television Tuesday evening awarding a Lebanese
bank executive for his community work. Three days ago, Hrawi
traveled to Damascus for a farewell meeting with his ally, Syrian
President Hafez Assad.

Cannon blast kills man at start of Germany's carnival season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NIEDERNHAUSEN, Germany (AP) _ A 63-year-old man was killed by an
explosion Wednesday while tamping gunpowder into a cannon meant to
signal the start of the Christian carnival season.
	   The cannon exploded prematurely, causing fatal head injuries.
Police in this southwestern town, near Wiesbaden, did not release
the man's name.
	   Rooted in ancient pagan rituals that pre-date Christianity,
carnival _ or fasching _ marks three months of revelry before the
fasting period of Lent, which falls this year on Feb. 17.
	   Carnival begins on the 11th of November _ the 11th month _ at 11
a.m. Thousands of people celebrated in the streets of German towns
and cities, mostly in the west along the Rhine River and in the
southern state of Bavaria.

	   YPRES, Belgium (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II stood at a Flanders
Field arch bearing the names of 55,000 Commonwealth soldiers whose
remains were never found and remembered their sacrifice during
Wednesday's ceremonies in Belgium and France marking the
anniversary of World War I.
	   And in a ceremony of equal historic resonance in nearby Mesen,
she and Irish President Mary McAleese dedicated a monument to
50,000 Irishmen _ Roman Catholics and Protestants _ who died in the
Great War.
	   Their sacrifice has been ignored at home for decades because
they fought against Germany for Britain while Ireland revolted
against British rule.
	   The Island of Ireland Peace Park was inaugurated amid hopes it
will help reconciliation across the religious divide of today's
Ireland.
	   The two Belgian ceremonies capped a day of poignant events
marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War that began in
Paris under a bright blue sky.
	   It was the last major anniversary of the Great War likely to
include actual veterans of the carnage.
	   The scope of that carnage becomes clear at the Menin Gate.
	   The queen joined Belgian King Albert II at the 30-meter
(100-foot) stone archway inscribed with the names of 55,000
soldiers who died in battlefield trenches around Ypres.
	   Three major battles were fought there. In one, in October, 1914,
the British Expeditonary Force of 100,000 was cut in half. In
another _ on April 22, 1915 _ the Germans used poison gas for the
first time in warfare.
	   The area has been made famous by a poem by John McCrae, a
Canadian soldier, after he lost a friend in a 1915 battle. It
begins with the memorable lines:
	   ``In Flanders fields the poppies blow, between the crosses, row
on row.''
	   The Menin gate _ at which a local fire department bugler still
plays the mournful Last Post daily _ is dedicated ``to the armies
of the British Empire who stood here from 1914 to 1918 and to those
of their dead who have no known graves.''
	   As Queen Elizabeth, King Albert II and veterans from various
nations observed a minute of silence, thousands of poppy petals
rained down from the cavernous gateway as the sun bathed the site
in the last light of day.
	   The 80th anniversary of when the guns fell silent _ at the 11th
hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 _ was marked in
Paris with all the pomp and ceremony the French stage so well.
	   At the stroke of 11, Queen Elizabeth arrived at the Arc de
Triomphe where she was greeted by President Jacques Chirac. Under
the arch she laid a wreath by the eternal flame at the Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier.
	   The two leaders met with four World War I veterans _
101-year-old Gen. Maurice Bourgeois; Abramo Pellencin, 102; Guy
Cohen, 101, and Georges Rideau, 101.
	   The Great War was to be over quickly but became a four-year
nightmare of unimaginable brutality in which millions died.
	   Today, the French-Belgian border is strewn with cemeteries
holding the remains of soldiers of many nations who died in a war
that saw the introduction of poison gas with appalling efficiency.
In both Belgium and France, bodies and unexploded bombs are still
retrieved each year from former battlefields.
	   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was absent from the
ceremonies. His office said he was not invited and that any
interpretation of his no-show as a snub was a ``misunderstanding.''
	   But in Weisswasser, Germany, a Franco-German brigade marked
Armistice Day with a roll call in a sign of reconciliation of
former enemies. ``Living in peace is the highest honor we can pay
those who died for their countries during the Great War,'' said
Gen. Alain Lefevre, the commander of the unit that is part of
NATO's rapid reaction force.
	   Armistice Day is not officially celebrated in Germany, which was
defeated in the two world wars of this century.
	   The First World War killed 13 million civilians and 8.5 million
fighting men. Germany lost an estimated 1.7 million soldiers;
Britain lost more than 900,000; Italy 650,000; the United States
116,000. France was proportionally the hardest hit, with 1.3
million dead.
	   The sheer devastation wrought on France can partly be measured
by the 30,000 or so monuments in cities, towns and villages across
the nation. Some villages list more war dead than their current
populations.

	   YPRES, Belgium (AP) _ Head bowed in silence, Queen Elizabeth II
completed a day of World War 1 commemorations Wednesday under a
vast arch bearing the names of 55,000 Commonwealth soldiers slain
in the mud of Flanders Fields and whose remains were never found.
	   And in a ceremony of equal historic resonance in nearby Mesen,
she and Irish President Mary McAleese dedicated a monument to
50,000 Irishmen _ Catholics and Protestants _ who died in the Great
War.
	   Their sacrifice has been ignored at home for decades because
they fought for Britain against Germany as Ireland revolted against
British rule.
	   The Irish monument _ a Celtic stone tower _ also symbolizes
reconciliation in today's Ireland after this year's Ulster peace
accord.
	   At Ypres _ in the dying autumn sunlight and to the strains of
buglers playing Taps (Last Post) _ the British monarch met with
survivors of the war that ended 80 years ago.
	   A scarlet shower of 55,000 poppy petals _ one for each missing
soldier whose name is carved into the arch _ fell from the 30-meter
(100-foot) stone structure during a minute's silence.
	   The ceremonies here and in Paris earlier were likely the last
major anniversary of the Great War including veterans of the
carnage.
	   ``It is not easy to tell people about how it was or how we felt.
Sometimes it was just overwhelming,'' said William Cotgrove, 102,
who fought at Ypres.
	   In Paris, the queen met with four World War I veterans, all 101
or older.
	   The exact anniversary of when the guns fell silent _ at the 11th
hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 _ was marked there
with pomp and ceremony.
	   At the stroke of 11, the queen arrived at the Arc de Triomphe
where she was greeted by President Jacques Chirac and laid a wreath
by the eternal flame at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
	   ``It is exactly 80 years ago today, that the arms fell silent in
Europe after four terrible years of fire and blood,'' she said.
``Eight million men were dead.''
	   While France remembered the slaughter at Verdun, where 250,000
French and German soldiers fell, the British made Ypres the center
of its remembrance. British and Commonwealth soldiers battled for
almost the whole of the War in trenches around here.
	   Tens of thousands flocked here for the ceremony. They came from
France, Belgium and all corners of Britain and its former Empire _
from Scots in kilts to Sikhs in turbans.
	   ``It's important that we let our children know that our
forefathers also fought in the First World War,'' said Jatinder
Singh, 44, a Sikh who brought his daughter here from their home in
the Netherlands.
	   In Britain, 43 million people observed a two-minute silence at
11 AM (1000 GMT) to pay homage to the fallen of both world wars.
	   The scope of the First World War death toll becomes clear at the
Menin Gate and areas around this West Belgian town made famous by
John McCrae. The Canadian soldier penned a poem starting with the
memorable lines: ``In Flanders fields the poppies blow, between the
crosses, row on row.''
	   Three major battles were fought at Ypres. In one, in October,
1914, the British Expeditionary Force of 100,000 was cut in half.
In another _ in April, 1915 _ the Germans used poison gas for the
first time in warfare.
	   Starting in 1914, the Great War was a four-year nightmare of
unimaginable brutality in which millions died.
	   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was absent from the
ceremonies. His office said he was not invited and any
interpretation of his no-show as a snub was a ``misunderstanding.''
	   But in Weisswasser, Germany, a Franco-German brigade marked
Armistice Day with a roll call in a sign of reconciliation of
former enemies. Armistice Day is not celebrated in Germany, which
was defeated in the two world wars of this century.
	   The First World War killed 13 million civilians and 8.5 million
soldiers. Germany lost 1.7 million soldiers; France, 1.3 million,
Britain more than 900,000; Italy 650,000 and the United States
116,000.

Deadly disco fire started in stairway, investigators say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ The fire that killed 63 young people in
a second-floor dance hall began in the emergency exit stairway, but
what caused the fire to start is still unknown, investigators said
Wednesday.
	   The fire just before midnight on Oct. 29 blocked one of two
exits from the hall where teen-agers had organized a dance, forcing
the panicked crowd to try to flee down the remaining stairway or
jump out of windows.
	   Investigators said they would question workers who had redone
some of the building's electrical wiring in recent years, including
wiring in the emergency exit.
	   The fire's quick spread has led to speculation that it may have
been arson.

Yassin warns pressure on Hamas could lead to violent backlash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The spiritual leader of the militant group
Hamas said that his organization is suffering under a crackdown by
Yasser Arafat and it could create a violent backlash, a Palestinian
official said Wednesday.
	   Palestinian legislator Hatem Abdel Qader said Wednesday that the
ailing leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, made the remarks during a visit
between the two men Friday. Under house arrest and banned by
Arafat's Palestinian Authority from giving interviews, Yassin's
reported conversation was the first indication that Hamas is
feeling the pressure placed on it by Arafat.
	   The crackdown on Islamic militants began Oct. 29, after a Hamas
suicide bomber tried to ram his explosives-laden car into a school
bus of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip. Sweeping arrests were
made and Yassin was placed under house arrest and his phone line
was cut. Palestinian police and undercover security officers stand
guard outside of Yassin's home in Gaza allowing only immediate
family members to enter.
	   Police granted Abdel Qader permission almost immediately after
he requested to see Yassin. Abdel Qader said the initiative was
personal and that he was not representing any one.
	   ``The sheik was very distraught and disappointed over the
measures taken against Hamas,'' Abdel Qader told The Associated
Press.
	   As part of the new land-for-security deal, the Palestinians are
expected to fight Islamic militant and their infrastructure in
exchange for Israeli troop withdraw from 13 percent of the West
Bank.
	   ``Yassin said the Authority was choking Hamas and such pressure
was explosive,'' Abdel Qader said.
	   Hamas opposes Israeli-Palestinian peace-making and has claimed
responsibility for dozens of deadly attacks on Israelis over the
past five years.
	   But the group enjoys wide street support among Palestinians for
the badly needed social services it provides including free clinics
and schools.

Head of Kosovo verification mission arrives as violence continues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Peaceful resolution of the Kosovo
conflict is a long way off, the American head of a new foreign
mission to the Serbian province acknowledged Wednesday amid reports
of more violence.
	   NATO officials also voiced concern about continuing clashes a
month after an agreement aimed at halting the unrest in Serbia, the
dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   U.S. diplomat William Walker, chief of a verification mission
still being put together, arrived in Pristina the day after three
Serb policemen were injured in an attack on their police station,
presumably by ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   The mission, organized by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, will send as many as 2,000 unarmed monitors
into the field to check whether Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic is complying with agreements aimed at ending the
hostilities.
	   Walker called it perhaps the last chance ``to avert an
irrational spiral of more violence'' in Kosovo, where the ethnic
Albanian majority seeks independence from Serb rule.
	   Serb forces in February launched a crackdown on Kosovo Albanian
separatists. Several hundred people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have
been killed and as many as 300,000 were driven from their homes.
	   The violence has continued past the Oct. 12 agreement by
Milosevic to sharply reduce the number of police and soldiers in
Kosovo. NATO had threatened airstrikes to force an end to the
crackdown.
	   In the past week, at least two Serb policemen have been killed
and three injured, while six guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation
Army have died from police gunfire.
	   ``It is obvious that we have a long way to go from this
battlefield to the negotiating table,'' Walker said.
	   Western powers led by the United States believe the verification
mission will restore stability in Kosovo by having the unarmed
foreigners roaming the region to report on any violence or
violations of the agreement Milosevic reached with U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke and the OSCE.
	   Walker was unable to provide a firm date for launching the
mission, which he called the most ambitious undertaking to date of
the 54-nation OSCE.
	   There was little sign Wednesday of violence abating.
	   In Glogovac, 20 miles (35 kilometers) west of Pristina, police
showed damaged walls at their station caused by a rocket fired
during an attack Tuesday night. Three policemen were injured.
	   Police accuse the rebels of attacking to try to provoke a harsh
response that could prompt world leaders to order military strikes.
	   NATO officials fear that the recent incidents could lead to a
renewal of outright fighting in Kosovo.
	   ``There is a great deal of concern about the deteriorating
situation ... and the deaths that have occurred, and obviously we
condemn these incidents,'' a NATO official told reporters on
condition of anonymity after the weekly meeting of alliance
ambassadors in Brussels, Belgium.

Government committee supports medical marijuana use
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A House of Lords committee report released
Wednesday recommended that doctors be legally allowed to prescribe
marijuana for pain relief. But convincing the British government
could prove difficult.
	   The report from Parliament's upper house said marijuana should
be used to relieve the suffering of those with cancer and multiple
sclerosis.
	   The government responded, however, that clinical trials and
safety tests would have to be conducted before cannabis could be
offered by prescription _ a process that could take several years.
	   ``It would be totally irresponsible to say, `It's OK to use it,
but there is no scientific evidence it will work,' '' Home Office
Minister George Howarth said.
	   The British Medical Society, which represents Britain's doctors,
rejected the report, saying the move could prevent new, more
effective drugs from being developed.
	   Currently listed as a Schedule 1 drug, cannabis can only be used
in research. The Lords Science and Technology committee believes it
should be switched to Schedule 2, allowing doctors and pharmacists
to dispense it.
	   They recommended it be made available immediately rather than
waiting years for the results of clinical trials.

Singer sentenced, fined for sexually abusing minor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egyptian court sentenced a pop singer to
three months in prison Wednesday for sexually assaulting a
15-year-old boy, police officials said.
	   The court, however, suspended the sentence on Ali Hemeidah after
he paid a 1,000 pound (dlrs 295) fine, the officials said, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Hemeidah, a 50-year-old singer whose career has waned in recent
years, was accused of sexual assault and performing an indecent act
in public.
	   Hemeidah had a major hit in the 1980s with the song ``Lolaky''
or ``Were It Not For You.''
	   He has stopped producing songs, but continues to perform at
weddings and occasional shows at hotels.

Cabinet ratifies peace agreement with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu quotes, details from news conference,
Palestinian reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli Cabinet on Wednesday ratified the
peace agreement with the Palestinians after a two-week delay and
some U.S. prodding, setting the stage for an Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January.
	   The accord was narrowly approved by eight of the 17 ministers at
the end of a seven-hour debate. Five ministers abstained and four
voted against in what appeared to be a political blow for Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who had expected broader support.
	   Saying that it was difficult to ``part with even on square
centimeter'' of the land, Netanyahu attached four stipulations to
the land-for-security agreement that could cause new disruptions.
	   Netanyahu said he would bring each stage of the phased pullback
over the next three months to the Cabinet for a separate approval.
Ministers will be asked to determine whether the Palestinians have
met their security obligations under the accord, he said.
	   The agreement would stop in its tracks if the Palestine National
Council does not hold a formal vote by mid-December to revoke
clauses in the PLO founding charter that call for Israel's
destruction, Netanyahu said.
	   The prime minister also said Israel reserved the right to annex
areas of the West Bank if Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat went
ahead with plans to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state in
May, at the end of the five-year autonomy period.
	   In a fourth clause, Netanyahu said that in an additional
pullback to which Israel committed itself last year, the
Palestinians would receive no more than 1 percent of the West Bank.
	   Despite the new conditions, Netanyahu pledged to go ahead with
implementing the agreement. Israel has already fallen behind in the
12-week time table negotiated at least month's Mideast summit.
	   Netanyahu said he would permit the opening of the Palestinian
airport next week and would also begin releasing Palestinian
security prisoners at that time. In all, 750 Palestinians held by
Israel for security offenses are to be freed by January.
	   Another key Israeli commitment, to withdraw from 2 percent of
the West Bank by Monday, will likely not be carried out on time,
said Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan. The troop redeployment
cannot take place until parliament as approved the deal Tuesday and
will likely be carried out a week late.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said he believed Netanyahu
attached new conditions to please Israeli hard-liners.
	   ``We appreciate the Cabinet approval, but we will close our ears
and eyes to the conditions because they are for them and not for
us,'' Asfour told The Associated Press.
	   Over the past two weeks, with Netanyahu postponing Cabinet
debate four times, the United States urged Israel to try and stick
to the original time table of the agreement.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke with Netanyahu on Tuesday
night about the land-for-security agreement and about the U.S.
showdown with Iraq over weapons inspections.
	   An Israeli official said the United States has let it be known
that its policy of being tough on Iraq was encountering problems in
the Arab world because Israel had not moved forward on its
implementation of the Wye agreement.
	   While the Cabinet voted, thousands of Jewish settlers staged a
protest rally in Tel Aviv. Far-right opposition legislator Rehavam
Zeevi said the pullback ``will endanger Jews in the Holy Land and
bring war closer to their homes.''
	   A key Israeli stipulation attached to the accord concerns the
procedure for revoking clauses of the PLO founding charter.
	   The Wye agreement says that the Palestine National Council and
other Palestinian organizations will convene in mid-December to
``reaffirm'' a January letter by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to Clinton that lists the clauses considered annulled.
	   Israel insists that the Palestinian delegates hold a vote and
Netanyahu said Wednesday that the agreement would only be carried
out if the Palestinians comply. Palestinian officials have said
only approval by acclamation was required.
	   The Maariv daily said the dispute has been resolved quietly by
the United States. Under the compromise, the delegates will vote by
a show of hands, but not all members of the PNC, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, will have to be present and there will be no
need for a two-thirds majority, Maariv said.

Russian lawmakers fail in bid to lift sanctions against Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with German foreign minister urging Russia to
intervene in Iraq standoff, US troop buildup, UN emergency
meeting. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist party
launched a motion Wednesday that called for lifting sanctions
against Iraq, but it failed to win approval.
	   The vote came hours before Russia requested an emergency meeting
of the U.N. Security Council because of a growing crisis over
inspections of suspected Iraqi weapons sites. U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen ordered a major buildup Wednesday of U.S.
military force in the Persian Gulf.
	   Also in Moscow on Wednesday, visiting German Foreign Minister
Joshka Fischer appealed to Russia to use its influence with Baghdad
to help resolve the standoff.
	   The Russian government has called for the early lifting of
international sanctions against Iraq, but has not moved to act
unilaterally. The sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait, and the United Nations says they will not be
lifted until inspectors verify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons
of mass destruction.
	   In the State Duma, the Russian parliament's lower house, 156
lawmakers voted Wednesday for lifting the sanctions and only 36
voted against, but the motion was well short of the 226 votes
needed for a simple majority.
	   Even if it had passed, the motion would have been non-binding,
because parliament has little say over foreign policy, which is
crafted almost entirely by President Boris Yeltsin's government.
	   Zhirinovsky has visited Iraq on several occasions and expressed
his support for Iraq leader Saddam Hussein.
	   Iraq owes Moscow billions of dollars from Soviet times, when the
Arab nation was a big arms buyer.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Wednesday reiterated
Moscow's opposition to any possible strikes against Iraq.
	   Fischer urged Ivanov to use Russia's influence in the standoff,
saying the situation was considered very serious in Western
capitals.
	   Russia's Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, an Arab affairs
expert, successfully negotiated with Saddam during previous
disputes, when Primakov was foreign minister.
	   But the latest Iraqi crisis comes amid Russia's worst economic
turmoil since the Soviet collapse, and Moscow has been preoccupied
with domestic affairs.
	   Fischer spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and his French and British counterparts before meeting with Ivanov.
	   Fischer said that it must be made clear to Saddam Hussein that
the United States is considering all options, including a military
attack.
	   Ivanov said after a meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy on Wednesday that strikes against Iraq ``would cancel the
immense work done by the international community over the past
seven years and complicate the situation in the region.''
	   Still, Ivanov urged Iraq to ``fully resume'' cooperation with
U.N. weapons experts.

Swiss tourist dies in Mexican train robbery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A Swiss tourist was killed when he attempted
to videotape a train robbery in the northern border state of
Chihuahua, state police said Wednesday.
	   Ernest Schmidt, 68, was shot three times in the chest and head
by gunmen who also injured three other foreign tourists, identified
as Louise Wintworth of Australia, Rodolfo Lagazzi of Italy and
Michael Rosarth of Germany.
	   Schmidt was a native of Arbon, Switzerland, according to a Swiss
Embassy spokeswoman.
	   The robbery took place Tuesday on the Chihuahua-Pacific Railway,
a popular attraction that runs through the spectacular Copper
Canyon.
	   The three injured tourists were taken to a hospital in the
coastal city of Los Mochis, where they were treated for minor
injuries. In Mexico City, embassies for their respective countries
said they had no information on their ages or hometowns.
	   A special task force is investigating the murder and police were
conducting an aerial survey of the vast Sierra Tarahumara around
the area where the robbery took place, said police spokesman Victor
Gonzalez. He said it was the first train robbery in three years.

State Department says U.S. citizens may want to leave Mideast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with Netanyahu comment; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Wednesday that Israel was closely monitoring growing tensions
between the United States and Iraq and would take the necessary
steps to defend its citizens should a confrontation arise.
	   In a new travel advisory, U.S. citizens were told they may want
to leave Israel and the Palestinian areas because of the situation
in the Gulf.
	   In Washington, the State Department authorized the departure of
employees in non-essential positions, the advisory said. It was not
clear whether employees of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv and the
Consulate in Jerusalem were preparing to leave.
	   The advisory said that the United States has not ruled out any
options in trying to get Iraq to comply with a U.N.-mandated
weapons inspections program.
	   ``Iraq's continued defiance of the will of the international
community ... is heightening the level of risk to American citizens
in the Middle East,'' the statement said.
	   In previous crises surrounding Iraq, there was concern about
chemical and biological warfare and ``although such a risk is
remote, it cannot be excluded,'' the advisory said.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed
the crisis with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon to discuss the situation in Iraq.
	   ``We're examining now the situation, the various implications of
what is developing, and we'll take the precautions as necessary,''
Netanyahu told reporters. ``Israel understands it has a grave
responsibility to take all the steps to defend itself and its
citizens and it never fails to do so.''
	   Israel is trying to stay out of the confrontation, officials
said. ``We are not a part of this conflict, except as members of
the United Nations,'' a Foreign Ministry official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``And right now, the issue is between the
United States and Iraq.''
	   A special envoy of Jordan's King Hussein, Jawad Annani, met with
Netanyahu and Sharon on Wednesday, and officials in Amman said the
envoy apparently asked Israel to remain on the sidelines.
	   In the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel in
hopes of breaking up the Arab coalition against it. However, Israel
did not retaliate and the coalition held.
	   In a subsequent U.S.-Iraq crisis in February, Iraq did not make
any attempt to draw Israel into the dispute.
	   However, Israel appeared to be at least indirectly involved this
time.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton called Netanyahu on Tuesday to
discuss the land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians and the
Iraq situation, American officials said.
	   The Haaretz daily wrote Wednesday that there was speculation
Clinton told Netanyahu in the call that the Cabinet's failure to
ratify the agreement has made it difficult for the United States to
win support from Arab states against Iraq. The Cabinet approved the
deal later Wednesday.

Crisis in Iraq is at watershed, British military officials say

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new travel advisory for Kuwait grafs 8-9 and new
warning from Blair in graf 10; UPPICKS graf 8 pvs &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The crisis over weapons inspections in Iraq has
reached a ``watershed,'' with the international community united in
the belief that Saddam Hussein must be forced to comply, British
military officials said Wednesday.
	   Speaking after a trip to Kuwait and Bahrain to meet with Gulf
leaders, advisers to Defense Secretary George Robertson said the
tone of Arab nations appears changed since the standoff between the
Iraqi dictator and U.N. weapons inspectors in February.
	   During that crisis, most of the Arab governments were reluctant
to support any U.S. military action because they thought there was
still room for diplomacy to resolve the issue.
	   ``The mood is very different,'' said Bernard Gray, Robertson's
special adviser. ``Those in the region who argued in February that
we should give Saddam another chance and that he would comply have
been embarrassed by his flagrant flouting of the U.N.''
	   ``People are clear that a continuation of what's been going on
so far will not get results and one way or another we have to break
the logjam,'' Gray said.
	   ``I think everybody was united out there in seeing this as a
watershed moment,'' he added, warning Saddam not to
``miscalculate'' the intentions of the international community.
	   Britain and the United States have not ruled out military
strikes on Iraq to retaliate for its Oct. 31 decision to halt all
work by the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the dismantling
of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons program and long-range
missiles.
	   In response to rising tensions, the Foreign Office warned
British nationals on Wednesday against ``non-essential'' travel to
Kuwait, and said non-essential diplomats had been told they could
leave if they wish.
	   British nationals living in Kuwait who choose to stay there are
being advised to stock up on food and water supplies and take extra
safety precautions.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair on Wednesday night warned that Saddam
must comply ``immediately'' or face the use of force.

Deadly disco fire started in stairway, investigators say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ The fire that killed 63 young people in
a second-floor dance hall began in the emergency exit stairway, but
what caused the fire to start is still unknown, Swedish
investigators said Wednesday.
	   The fire just before midnight on Oct. 29 blocked one of two
exits from the hall where teen-agers had organized a dance, forcing
the panicked crowd to try to flee down the remaining stairway or
jump out of windows.
	   Investigators said they would question workers who had redone
some of the building's electrical wiring in recent years, including
wiring in the emergency exit.
	   The fire's quick spread has led to speculation that it may have
been arson.

Chechen official says feuding leaders should face death penalty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in bottom 3 grafs with Russian government planning aid
for Chechnya. &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's outspoken vice president said
Wednesday that leaders of the breakaway territory, including
himself, should go before an Islamic court and face a possible
death sentence for constantly quarreling among themselves.
	   Vakha Arsanov said the Chechen government and its political
rivals have been guided by personal ambitions, and have failed to
combat lawlessness that has plagued the territory in the aftermath
of the 1994-96 war with Russia.
	   ``We all fought together against the Russian invasion, but now
we can't find accord,'' he said in an interview. ``Our ambitions
and inability to listen to each other have brought Chechnya to the
present state.''
	   Arsanov said the Chechen leaders should face the death penalty
if convicted in the Shariah courts, or Islamic courts, that have
been set up throughout Chechnya.
	   Arsanov made similar statements during a television broadcast
Tuesday. In those remarks, he also proposed setting up gallows and
guillotines for public executions.
	   He said it would require ``boundless cruelty'' to crush the
current crime wave, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Arsanov is given to making controversial statements, though in
the past his comments have usually been aimed at Russia.
	   Chechen authorities have carried out several public executions
of convicted criminals, and some have been shown on television. The
government halted the practice following international criticism.
	   Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov has come under increasing
criticism recently from a number of prominent Chechens who fought
alongside him in the war against Russia.
	   The critics say Maskhadov has been unable to bring about law and
order and should resign, or be impeached.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdrew two years ago. But no country has recognized its
independence, and Moscow insists the territory is still part of
Russia.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian government has drafted a resolution on
financial aid to Chechnya, and will ask parliament to include the
expenses in the 1999 budget, Russian Nationalities Minister Ramazan
Abdulatipov said.
	   He also said Russia wants to rebuild several plants in Chechnya
that were destroyed during the war, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news
agencies reported.
	   Abdulatipov defended Maskhadov, saying he is ``the most
acceptable figure for us'' in Chechnya. Maskhadov has often been
accused by the Chechen opposition of being too soft in dealing with
Moscow.

Head of Kosovo verification mission arrives as violence continues

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Peaceful resolution of the Kosovo
conflict is a long way off, the American head of a new foreign
mission to the Serbian province acknowledged Wednesday amid reports
of more violence.
	   NATO officials also voiced concern about continuing clashes in
Kosovo a month after an agreement aimed at halting the unrest.
	   U.S. diplomat William Walker, chief of a verification mission
still being put together, arrived in Pristina the day after three
Serb policemen were injured in an attack on their police station,
presumably by ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   The mission, organized by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, will send as many as 2,000 unarmed monitors
into the field to check whether Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic is complying with agreements he signed on ending the
hostilities.
	   Walker called it perhaps the last chance ``to avert an
irrational spiral of more violence'' in Kosovo, where the ethnic
Albanian majority seeks independence from Serb rule.
	   Serb forces in February launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists. Several hundred people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have
been killed and as many as 300,000 were driven from their homes.
	   The violence has continued past the Oct. 12 agreement by
Milosevic, under the threat of NATO airstrikes on his forces, to
sharply reduce the number of police and soldiers in Kosovo.
	   In the past week, at least two Serb policemen have been killed
and three injured, while six guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation
Army have died from police gunfire.
	   ``It is obvious that we have a long way to go from this
battlefield to the negotiating table,'' Walker said.
	   Western powers led by the United States believe the verification
mission will restore stability in Kosovo by having the unarmed
foreigners roaming the region to report on any violence or
violations of the agreements Milosevic reached with U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke and the OSCE.
	   Walker was unable to provide a firm date for launching the
mission, which will absorb a previous Kosovo observer mission that
started in July. He called it the most ambitious undertaking to
date of the 54-nation OSCE.
	   The OSCE's Permanent Council on Wednesday estimated costs for
the year-long mission at dlrs 200 million. The council, meeting in
Vienna, Austria, approved expenditures of dlrs 64 million for the
rest of 1998, with 1999 outlays to be decided later, spokeswoman
Melissa Fleming said.
	   Security for the verifiers depends on guarantees given by
Milosevic and the rebels, Walker said.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel ordered the army to reopen gas mask
distribution centers Wednesday and a special adviser to Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said chances were high that the United
States would strike at Iraq soon.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with U.S. President Bill
Clinton Tuesday and discussed the growing crisis with Iraq over
United Nations weapons inspections.
	   As a result of the conversation, the Haaretz newspaper said
there was speculation Netanyahu then moved to convene his Cabinet
and approve the Mideast peace accord in order to remove any
obstacles for the U.S. in gathering support from the Arab world for
possible strikes.
	   An Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the United States let it be known that its policy of being tough on
Iraq was encountering problems in the Arab world because Israel had
not moved forward on its implementation of the Wye agreement.
	   The Cabinet narrowly approved the accord later Wednesday.
	   Mordechai was absent for most of the Cabinet session, according
to Israeli radios, dealing with the latest Gulf crisis from
military headquarters in Tel Aviv.

Security Council to meet on Iraq as Annan appeals to Saddam
</HEADLINE>

inspectors; comments from British ambassador and U.N. humanitarian
official; adds details on pullout; edits to trim &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council called an
emergency meeting on Iraq Wednesday while Secretary-General Kofi
Annan appealed to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to immediately resume
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Russia requested the council meeting after more than 200 U.N.
personnel were pulled out of Iraq because of the possibility of
airstrikes by the United States to compel Iraq to allow inspections
of its weapons programs.
	   The United States, which holds the rotating presidency of the
Security Council, scheduled consultations on Iraq for 3:30 p.m. EST
(2030 GMT). British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said that while
diplomacy remains active, a military solution is now ``a serious
option.''
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler said he ordered all
inspectors to leave Baghdad because of a strong recommendation from
the United States and an ``increasingly hostile'' atmosphere in
Iraq.
	   ``This is a precautionary move only ... and I sincerely hope
it's temporary,'' he said.
	   He said he spent almost all day Tuesday dealing with ``an
absolutely unfounded allegation'' by Iraq that an inspector had
committed an act of espionage. He would not disclose the
nationality of the inspector, except to say he was not American.
	   Calling Iraq's Oct. 31 decision to halt inspections and
monitoring ``very wrongheaded,'' Butler said: ``Iraq knows quite
well what needs to be done to complete the disarmament work and
move towards the removal of sanctions. ... The course that they're
on now is only extending sanctions.''
	   Greenstock said he did not foresee a return visit to Baghdad by
Annan, who flew to the Iraqi capital during the last crisis in
February and signed a memorandum of understanding with the Iraqis
that resumed inspections and averted U.S. and British airstrikes.
	   ``His memorandum of understanding from February has been thrown
back in his face,'' Greenstock said.
	   Annan cut short a trip through north Africa and was expected to
return to U.N. headquarters in New York on Thursday, U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said. Annan was in Morocco and had been scheduled to
visit the Western Sahara, Tunisia and Algeria before returning to
New York on Tuesday.
	   Saying he was ``saddened and burdened'' by Iraq's decision to
halt dealings with the inspectors, the U.N. chief reiterated that
economic sanctions against Baghdad can only be lifted if Iraq fully
cooperates with the Security Council.
	   ``I strongly urge President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi
government to rescind its decision and resume immediate
cooperation'' with inspectors, he said in a statement issued at the
United Nations.
	   ``This would be good for the Iraqi people, for the region and
for the world,'' he said.
	   Iraq says it will not cooperate with inspectors until the
Security Council begins to lift the debilitating embargo imposed
after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War.
	   Iraq barred the U.N. commission known as UNSCOM, which is
charged with ensuring that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction, from carrying out spot inspections on Aug. 5.
	   After the council offered Baghdad a comprehensive review of its
compliance with U.N. resolutions _ without linking it to the
possible lifting of sanctions _ Iraq halted all dealings with
UNSCOM on Oct. 31.
	   Annan called the Security Council offer of a comprehensive
review ``a genuine opportunity'' to move towards lifting sanctions.
	   ``The comprehensive review will map out the remaining steps,
provided Iraq cooperates, thus allowing them to see light at the
end of the tunnel,'' Annan said.
	   But the sudden withdrawal of weapons inspectors and other U.N.
personnel heightened speculation that the U.S. would launch
airstrikes in the next few days.
	   U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said 92 members of UNSCOM flew
from Baghdad to Bahrain on Wednesday along with 11 people from the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   Butler said he was satisfied that UNSCOM had taken adequate
security precautions at its monitoring center in Baghdad before
leaving.
	   In addition, 130 non-essential U.N. staff from the oil-for-food
program, the U.N. Children's Fund, the World Food Program, the
World Health Organization and the U.N. Development Program left
Baghdad by bus for Amman, Jordan, U.N. spokesman Eckhard said.
	   Another 41 U.N. international staff and their dependents are
scheduled to leave Baghdad on Thursday, he said.
	   The departures will leave about 40 essential U.N. staff members
in Baghdad, Eckhard said. He said 231 U.N. personnel will also
remain in three northern Iraqi provinces, including 69 guards. They
are involved in food distribution.
	   The United Nations launched an oil-for-food program in December
199 which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to buy
needed food and medicine for its 22 million people.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ The wife of the U.S. vice president
flew Wednesday to Nicaragua, carrying a U.S. pledge for an
additional dlrs 1.5 million in medical aid and a dozen helicopters
to help relief efforts in countries devastated by Hurricane Mitch.
	   Tipper Gore announced the aid upon her arrival in Nicaragua from
neighboring Honduras.
	   The United States will donate dlrs 1.5 million to the
Pan-American Health Organization to help buy medicine for victims
of the storm, she said. The money will come on top of a dlrs 10
million U.S. aid package that the wife of Vice President Al Gore
announced Tuesday in Honduras.
	   Mrs. Gore briefly joined an assembly line on Wednesday filling
aid packages for disaster victims. A U.S. congressional delegation
planned to visit refugee camps and survey relief efforts in
Nicaragua before returning to Washington.
	   Mrs. Gore delivered an aid shipment that included blankets,
sheets and 500 gallons of drinking water for residents who have had
little since Mitch killed an estimated 6,600 Hondurans last month.
	   Central American presidents said an additional 3,400 people died
in the region.
	   As Mrs. Gore surveyed the devastation in Central America,
governments and lending institutions around the world moved to help
the region pick up the pieces.
	   France canceled debts owed by Nicaragua and Honduras, while
Ireland announced it was doubling aid to countries ravaged by the
storm. Britain said it wanted to contribute to a trust fund for the
region and added its support to calls for a moratorium on debt
payments by all affected countries.
	   Cuba announced it was canceling Nicaraguan debts of dlrs 50
million, and the World Bank announced it was making dlrs 200
million in assistance available from existing projects.
	   Mitch formed as a tropical storm Oct. 22 in the Caribbean and
became a hurricane three days later, battering Honduras while
stalled just off the coast. It moved inland as a tropical storm on
Oct. 27 and continued to dump rain.
	   The storm knocked out hundreds of bridges, leaving many
communities isolated. It devastated power and sewer lines
throughout Honduras and ravaged the nation's farms.
	   In Honduras, she spent Tuesday night in a pup tent in a
schoolyard, after helping to clean the school and feed hungry
children in the capital, Tegucigalpa.
	   ``This is a tragedy of biblical proportions,'' she said after
meeting with residents of Tegucigalpa's El Chile neighborhood,
which was ripped apart by a torrent of mud. ``They're telling me
stories of entire villages being washed away.''
	   Mrs. Gore's visit did much to heighten spirits in El Chile.
Hundreds of children followed her through the streets, and a few
pushed past security to hold her hand.
	   ``The important people never come to this neighborhood,'' said
27-year-old Claudia Boquin, who put her daughter on her shoulders
for a better view.
	   Honduran President Carlos Flores welcomed the international
support, including the contributions of Mrs. Gore. With her boots
and pants still caked with mud, the president invited her to his
home Tuesday night for a pizza dinner.
	   ``The example is something that's not forgotten,'' Flores told
Mrs. Gore.
	   Mrs. Gore said U.S. military engineers would help repair
Honduran roads and bridges and ensure that fuel and food reached
the country's stricken towns.
	   The dlrs 10 million in new U.S. aid comes on top of the dlrs 70
million the U.S. government already has committed to Central
America.
	   Mrs. Gore was joined on her trip by Brian Atwood, who heads the
U.S. Agency for International Development; Dennis Martinez, a
Nicaraguan who pitches for the Atlanta Braves; and John Leonard,
deputy assistant secretary of state for Latin America.

Judges face deciding if `official torture' gives Pinochet immunity

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's highest court must decide whether
torture can legally be part of state policy, an independent expert
said Wednesday after lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet insisted
immunity laws are so broad that even Adolf Hitler could not be
tried here.
	   ``Hitler would have been protected,'' Clive Nicholls, a lawyer
for the former Chilean dictator, told a five-judge tribunal in the
House of Lords, citing Britain's 1978 State of Immunity Act.
	   England's High Court last month cited the act in quashing
Pinochet's arrest, saying he enjoys immunity from arrest in this
country as a former foreign head of state.
	   Pinochet, taken into custody Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant to
face charges of genocide, torture and kidnapping, remains under
police guard in a London hospital after undergoing back surgery.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of secret police during his 17-year
rule after he ousted Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist, in a
1973 military coup.
	   The tribunal is hearing an appeal of the High Court's ruling by
the Spanish government and Spanish and British prosecutors.
	   In a rare move underlining the complexity and importance of the
case, the five judges heard an independent expert on international
law, David Lloyd-Jones _ designated a ``friend of the court'' _
give both sides of the argument.
	   ``It is essentially a question of interpretation,'' said
LLoyd-Jones, adding that a strict reading of the immunity act might
give protection from arrest for acts that were ``part of some state
policy, however terrible that policy might be.''
	   Nicholls said the immunity act was broadly drawn to avoid, for
example, former U.S. President George Bush being charged over
bombing Iraq or British prime ministers over the alleged torture of
Irish Republican Army suspects in Northern Ireland.
	   ``One is not concerned with whether that is right or wrong,''
Nicholls said of the act.
	   Pinochet's lawyers contend that putting the former dictator on
trial in a foreign court would be unprecedented and invite
retaliation from Chile.
	   But lawyers for the prosecutors, citing trials by special courts
of Nazi leaders at the end of World War II and of Bosnian Serbs and
Rwandan Hutus this decade, say international law now recognizes
some crimes are beyond immunity.
	   The senior judge, Lord Gordon Slynn, interjected that the court
had only to decide whether Pinochet has immunity.
	   ``We are not here to decide whether these quite appalling crimes
_ whether committed _ should be tried by somebody sometime,'' he
said.
	   The hearing was expected to end Thursday, its sixth day, with
judgment possible next week.
	   On Wednesday, the Spanish government delivered a formal request
for Pinochet's extradition to Home Secretary Jack Straw.
	   If the Lords uphold Pinochet's arrest, Straw has until Dec. 2 to
decide whether to allow extradition to go ahead, aides said.
	   If Straw says extradition can start, Pinochet, 82, faces a long
battle against it in British courts. If he loses, Straw will have
the final say on whether he is actually sent to Spain.

	   MALAGA, Spain (AP) _ Spanish authorities arrested three Britons
and three Albanians who allegedly transported drugs and money
between Spain and Central Europe hidden inside cargos of scrap
metal, police said Wednesday.
	   The group allegedly fronted its network with a scrap metal
business based in the southern coastal city of Malaga, a police
statement said.
	   Police raided the Malaga offices on Nov. 6 and discovered
special containers believed designed to hide drugs inside the
scrap, as well as about 60 million pesetas (dlrs 428,000), and
falsified identification documents from Britain and Italy, the
statement said.
	   The three arrested Britons were identified only by their
initials and ages: 32-year-old J. J. F., 36-year-old I.D., and
27-year-old C.B.
	   No further information was available, police spokesman Juan
Antonio O'Donnell said.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations evacuated all of its
weapons inspectors and many of its humanitarian workers from
Baghdad on Wednesday, blaming fears of ``possible military action''
against President Saddam Hussein's regime.
	   The hasty withdrawal _ conducted amid drenching rainstorms _
involved more than 200 U.N. staffers and raised fears that a
military strike by the United States and Britain is imminent.
	   Iraq showed no sign of backing down from its refusal to deal
with the arms inspectors, the nub of the crisis. The evacuation was
not reported by the Iraqi media, and there was little evidence of
Iraqis panicking or rushing to stock up on food.
	   Prakash Shah, the special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, said the withdrawal was ``in the background of possible
military action against Iraq. This is what we learned in our
consultations with New York.''
	   The United States and Britain have been threatening military
action since Iraq announced Oct. 31 that it was halting the
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   UNSCOM officials in Baghdad did not learn of plans to evacuate
until chief weapons inspector Richard Butler called from New York
at 4 a.m. Baghdad time Wednesday and ordered the entire staff out,
said UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross.
	   Speaking from Bahrain, where she was evacuated, Cross said 103
staffers of UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency had
pulled out. UNSCOM's field officer in Baghdad, Goran Wallen, said
no one from the commission was left behind.
	   In addition, about 130 of the 450 humanitarian workers in Iraq
withdrew Wednesday and were headed to the Jordanian capital of
Amman by road. There was confusion over the numbers, and earlier
U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, estimated 300
were leaving.
	   U.N. officials said about 40 more humanitarian workers would
leave Thursday, but apparently UNSCOM monitors will remain in the
northern Kurdish areas.
	   The departing U.N. workers gave hugs to colleagues remaining
behind _ including Iraqi staff _ but refused to talk to reporters.
	   As the buses were leaving, U.N. workers were hanging mesh
screens over the glass windows of the U.N. headquarters on the
outskirts of Baghdad _ likely a precaution against flying glass in
the event of a military strike.
	   Iraq says it will not resume cooperation with UNSCOM unless the
U.N. Security Council moves to begin lifting trade sanctions
imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Shah told reporters he was in close contact with Iraq's Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   The Iraqis ``will not be able to desist from their position
unless the Security Council takes some action with regard to
sanctions against Iraq,'' Shah quoted Aziz as saying.
	   Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs here, said
that only ``a number of core (U.N.) officials will remain in
Baghdad.'' He declined to give figures.
	   Falt told reporters that the withdrawal was ``precautionary ...
temporary'' and ``solely with the safety of U.N. staff in mind.''
	   Most of the relief workers monitored the United Nation's
oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities
of crude oil to buy needed food and medicine for its 22 million
people.
	   It is not clear how the withdrawal will effect the program even
though Iraq has food in its warehouses. The pullout, however, is
likely to halt the work of other specialized agencies such as the
U.N. Children's Fund, the U.N. Development Program and the World
Health Organization.
	   Among those staying in the country were Shah and Hans von
Sponeck, the head of U.N. humanitarian operations who took up his
post in Iraq on Monday.
	   The first convoy of three buses, which appeared to carry mainly
U.N. weapons experts, left U.N. headquarters at about 10 a.m. (0700
gmt) The buses were accompanied by about 10 U.N. vans and cars.
	   The second convoy set out four hours later with four buses
carrying mainly relief workers across the desert to neighboring
Jordan. A fifth bus accompanied the convoy in case of a breakdown.
	   Some U.N. people staying behind were seen carrying their
suitcases into U.N. headquarters, and it appeared they would both
work and sleep in the building. It's a brick structure, painted in
the blue and white colors of the United Nations, that bristles with
antennas for international communications.
	   The crisis had been simmering since Aug. 5 when Iraq said it was
halting the work of U.N. inspectors, who carried out unannounced
spot checks of suspected weapons sites. On Oct. 31, Iraq expanded
its work ban to UNSCOM monitors, who conduct long-term surveillance
to ensure Iraq doesn't rearm.
	   Iraq is required to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction
under U.N. resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War by U.S.-led
allies to evict Iraq out of Kuwait.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel ordered the army to reopen gas mask
distribution centers Wednesday and a special adviser to Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said chances were high that the United
States would strike at Iraq soon.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke Tuesday with U.S.
President Bill Clinton and discussed the growing crisis with Iraq
over United Nations weapons inspections.
	   As a result of the conversation, the Haaretz newspaper said
there was speculation Netanyahu then moved to convene his Cabinet
and approve the Mideast peace accord in order to remove any
obstacles for the U.S. in gathering support from the Arab world for
possible strikes.
	   An Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the United States let it be known that its policy of being tough on
Iraq was encountering problems in the Arab world because Israel had
not moved forward on its implementation of the Wye agreement.
	   The Cabinet narrowly approved the accord later Wednesday.
	   Mordechai was absent for most of the Cabinet session, according
to Israeli radios, dealing with the latest Gulf crisis from
military headquarters in Tel Aviv.
	   His special adviser, Gen. David Ivri, who headed Israel's
defense ministry for over 20 years said in a statement Wednesday
that the current situation ``indicates a high probability of an
American attack on Iraq.''
	   In a new travel advisory, U.S. citizens were told they may want
to leave Israel and the Palestinian areas because of the situation
in the Gulf.
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department authorized the
departure of employees in non-essential positions, the advisory
said. It was not clear whether employees of the U.S. Embassy in Tel
Aviv and the Consulate in Jerusalem were preparing to leave.
	   The advisory said that the United States has not ruled out any
options in trying to get Iraq to comply with a U.N.-mandated
weapons inspections program.
	   ``Iraq's continued defiance of the will of the international
community ... is heightening the level of risk to American citizens
in the Middle East,'' the statement said.
	   In previous crises surrounding Iraq, there was concern about
chemical and biological warfare and ``although such a risk is
remote, it cannot be excluded,'' the advisory said.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Netanyahu discussed the crisis with Mordechai
and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon. Israel radio reported that the
three men ordered the army to begin preparing the public in case of
any strikes against Iraq. Gas mask and information centers were to
reopen Thursday.
	   In the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles with
conventional warheads at Israel in hopes of breaking up the Arab
coalition against it. However, Israel did not retaliate and the
coalition held.
	   In a subsequent U.S.-Iraq crisis in February, Iraq did not make
any attempt to draw Israel into the dispute.
	   Israel is trying to stay out of the confrontation, officials
said. ``We are not a part of this conflict, except as members of
the United Nations,'' a Foreign Ministry official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``And right now, the issue is between the
United States and Iraq.''
	   A special envoy of Jordan's King Hussein, Jawad Annani, met with
Netanyahu and Sharon on Wednesday, and officials in Amman said the
envoy apparently asked Israel to remain on the sidelines.

Security Council to meet on Iraq as Annan appeals to Saddam
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council called an
emergency meeting on Iraq Wednesday while Secretary-General Kofi
Annan appealed to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to immediately resume
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Russia requested the council meeting after more than 200 U.N.
personnel were pulled out of Iraq because of the possibility of
airstrikes by the United States to compel Iraq to allow inspections
of its weapons programs.
	   The United States, which holds the rotating presidency of the
Security Council, scheduled consultations on Iraq for 3:30 p.m. EST
(2030 GMT). British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said that while
diplomacy remains active, a military solution is now ``a serious
option.''
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler said he ordered all
inspectors to leave Baghdad because of a strong recommendation from
the United States and an ``increasingly hostile'' atmosphere in
Iraq.
	   ``This is a precautionary move only ... and I sincerely hope
it's temporary,'' he said.
	   He said he spent almost all day Tuesday dealing with ``an
absolutely unfounded allegation'' by Iraq that an inspector had
committed an act of espionage. He would not disclose the
nationality of the inspector, except to say he was not American.
	   Calling Iraq's Oct. 31 decision to halt inspections and
monitoring ``very wrongheaded,'' Butler said: ``Iraq knows quite
well what needs to be done to complete the disarmament work and
move towards the removal of sanctions. ... The course that they're
on now is only extending sanctions.''
	   Greenstock said he did not foresee a return visit to Baghdad by
Annan, who flew to the Iraqi capital during the last crisis in
February and signed a memorandum of understanding with the Iraqis
that resumed inspections and averted U.S. and British airstrikes.
	   ``His memorandum of understanding from February has been thrown
back in his face,'' Greenstock said.
	   Annan cut short a trip through north Africa and was expected to
return to U.N. headquarters in New York on Thursday, U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said. Annan was in Morocco and had been scheduled to
visit the Western Sahara, Tunisia and Algeria before returning to
New York on Tuesday.
	   Saying he was ``saddened and burdened'' by Iraq's decision to
halt dealings with the inspectors, the U.N. chief reiterated that
economic sanctions against Baghdad can only be lifted if Iraq fully
cooperates with the Security Council.
	   ``I strongly urge President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi
government to rescind its decision and resume immediate
cooperation'' with inspectors, he said in a statement issued at the
United Nations.
	   ``This would be good for the Iraqi people, for the region and
for the world,'' he said.
	   Iraq says it will not cooperate with inspectors until the
Security Council begins to lift the debilitating embargo imposed
after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War.
	   Iraq barred the U.N. commission known as UNSCOM, which is
charged with ensuring that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction, from carrying out spot inspections on Aug. 5.
	   After the council offered Baghdad a comprehensive review of its
compliance with U.N. resolutions _ without linking it to the
possible lifting of sanctions _ Iraq halted all dealings with
UNSCOM on Oct. 31.
	   Annan called the Security Council offer of a comprehensive
review ``a genuine opportunity'' to move towards lifting sanctions.
	   ``The comprehensive review will map out the remaining steps,
provided Iraq cooperates, thus allowing them to see light at the
end of the tunnel,'' Annan said.
	   But the sudden withdrawal of weapons inspectors and other U.N.
personnel heightened speculation that the U.S. would launch
airstrikes in the next few days.
	   U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said 92 members of UNSCOM flew
from Baghdad to Bahrain on Wednesday along with 11 people from the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   Butler said he was satisfied that UNSCOM had taken adequate
security precautions at its monitoring center in Baghdad before
leaving.
	   In addition, 130 non-essential U.N. staff from the oil-for-food
program, the U.N. Children's Fund, the World Food Program, the
World Health Organization and the U.N. Development Program left
Baghdad by bus for Amman, Jordan, U.N. spokesman Eckhard said.
	   Another 41 U.N. international staff and their dependents are
scheduled to leave Baghdad on Thursday, he said.
	   The departures will leave about 40 essential U.N. staff members
in Baghdad, Eckhard said. He said 231 U.N. personnel will also
remain in three northern Iraqi provinces, including 69 guards. They
are involved in food distribution.
	   The United Nations launched an oil-for-food program in December
1996 which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to buy
needed food and medicine for its 22 million people.

The Sun tabloid says it will give up outing gays
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The top-selling Sun tabloid, which earlier this
week ran a front-page headline asking ``Are we being run by a gay
mafia?'', announced Wednesday that it has changed its policy on
outing homosexuals.
	   ``The Sun is no longer in the business of destroying closet
gays' lives by `exposing' them as homosexuals,'' editor David
Yelland said in a statement.
	   The newspaper's rhetorical question on Monday about a ``gay
mafia'' followed the revelation that another member of Prime
Minister Tony Blair Blair's Cabinet, Agriculture Minister Nick
Brown, was gay.
	   Culture Secretary Chris Smith is openly gay, and Ron Davies
resigned as Welsh Secretary last month after being mugged in an
area known for homosexual activity.
	   A few days earlier, Sun columnist Matthew Parris said on a BBC
television news program that Trade and Industry Secretary Peter
Mandelson ``is certainly gay.''
	   Mandelson, one of the most powerful members of Blair's
government, prefers not to make an issue of his sexuality.
	   The Sun is Britain's biggest-selling daily newspaper and the
sister paper to The News of The World, a sensational Sunday tabloid
that forced Nick Brown's revelation of his homosexuality.
	   ``From now on, The Sun will not out homosexuals unless there is
major public interest reason to do so,'' Yelland's statement said.
	   ``We will continue to be in the vanguard of this debate _ and
all debates _ but we will not invade the privacy of gay people by
outing them.''
	   ``We hope eventually that all gay people will feel free to come
out thus ensuring that charges that there is a `gay mafia' become
irrelevant,'' the statement said.
	   There was no immediate indication of any change in The News of
the World's policy.
	   Parris, who is gay himself, said Wednesday evening that Yelland
had telephoned to tell him in a ``perfectly pleasant'' way that the
Sun was dropping his column.
	   He said he had the clear impression the decision was ``not
unconnected'' to his remark about Mandelson.

Athens organizers seek an early start to image making
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THEODORA TONGAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ How the 2004 Olympics should be portrayed
and marketed is a complex question combining sports and history
with modern business and culture, a conference on marketing the
games was told Wednesday.
	   ``It's a lot more than just coming up with an emblem, sticking
it on sponsors' products,'' said Michael Payne, the International
Olympic Committee's marketing director.
	   Payne spoke at a one-day session for advertisers and marketers
developing the Olympic image. Also on hand were members of the
Barcelona, Lillehammer, Atlanta, Nagano and Sydney organizing
committees.
	   Athens organizers say they want an early start to avoid the
rampant commercialism that grew up around the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta. And it's not just the IOC and organizers who say they want
to keep such commercialization away from the event.
	   Greeks have one of the world's highest rates of intolerance to
commercialization, 85 percent compared to the global average of 63
percent, according to Brad Copeland, an IOC marketing
representative.
	   ``But,'' said Athens Organizing Committee President Stratis
Stratigis, ``without commercialization, there can be no games.''
	   That's why design and image play a critical role in the overall
presentation of the Olympics, Payne told an audience of 200 Greek
and international marketing and advertising representatives.
	   ``The Olympic Games are primarily a visual experience for
everyone,'' Payne said. ``It is the image of the games that is
spread over various venues around the city that provides the visual
continuity of the experience.''
	   He added that the games' theme or message should convey the
cultural character and personality of the host city.
	   ``Nothing has the potential to change or to enhance people's
perceptions of a country like the Olympic Games,'' Payne said. ``It
is a truly unique opportunity. The image that is created by the
host committee must speak to the world.''
	   The advertising and marketing representatives will participate
in contests to design, among other things, the logo, mascot, torch
and medals for the 2004 Olympics. The open call for entries for the
Athens logo will be in January 1999.
	   Payne said that many people around the world were anticipating
the Games' return to their birthplace and that the expectations are
high.
	   ``We have to take advantage of it, but in a way that won't be
chauvinistic or kitsch,'' Stratigis said.

military strike by the United States and Britain is imminent.
	   Iraq showed no sign of backing down from its refusal to deal
with the arms inspectors, the nub of the crisis. The evacuation was
not reported by the Iraqi media, and there was little evidence of
Iraqis panicking or rushing to stock up on food.
	   Prakash Shah, the special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, said the withdrawal was ``in the background of possible
military action against Iraq. This is what we learned in our
consultations with New York.''
	   The United States and Britain have been threatening military
action since Iraq announced Oct. 31 that it was halting the
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   UNSCOM officials in Baghdad did not learn of plans to evacuate
until chief weapons inspector Richard Butler called from New York
at 4 a.m. Baghdad time Wednesday and ordered the entire staff out,
said UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross.
	   Speaking from Bahrain where she was evacuated, Cross said 103
staffers of UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency had
pulled out. UNSCOM field officer in Baghdad, Goran Wallen, said no
one from the commission was left behind in Iraq.
	   In addition, about 130 of the 450 humanitarian workers in Iraq
withdrew Wednesday and were headed to the Jordanian capital of
Amman by road. There was confusion over the numbers, and earlier
U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, estimated 300
were leaving.
	   U.N. officials said about 40 more humanitarian workers would
leave on Thursday, but apparently U.N. workers will remain in the
northern Kurdish areas.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Larry Dierker won the North American baseball's
National League Manager of the Year award Wednesday after leading
the Houston Astros to a team-record 102 wins and their second
straight division title.
	   Dierker, in his second year as a big-league manager, received 16
first-place votes, six seconds and four thirds to earn 102 points
in balloting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America.
	   San Diego's Bruce Bochy was second with five first-place votes
and 70 points, followed by Chicago's Jim Riggleman, who got five
firsts and 55 points, and San Francisco's Dusty Baker with the
other six first-place votes and 39 points.
	   Dierker led the Astros in 1997 to 84 wins and their first
division title in 11 years. The Astros built on that success this
year, improving by 18 games, tied for third best in baseball, to
win the NL Central again.
	   In the regular season, the Astros led the league in runs scored
and runs batted in, and were second in batting average. The
pitching staff had the second-best earned run average in the NL.
	   But once again the Astros faltered in the first round of the
playoffs, losing in four games to the Padres. Houston was swept by
Atlanta in 1997. The voting, however, was conducted before the
playoffs.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Peaceful resolution of the Kosovo
conflict is a long way off, the American head of a new foreign
mission to the Serbian province acknowledged Wednesday amid reports
of more violence.
	   NATO officials also voiced concern about continuing clashes a
month after an agreement aimed at halting the unrest in Serbia, the
dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   U.S. diplomat William Walker, chief of a verification mission
still being put together, arrived in Pristina the day after three
Serb policemen were injured in an attack on their police station,
presumably by ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   The mission, organized by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, will send as many as 2,000 unarmed monitors
into the field to check whether Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic is complying with agreements aimed at ending the
hostilities.
	   Walker called it perhaps the last chance ``to avert an
irrational spiral of more violence'' in Kosovo, where the ethnic
Albanian majority seeks independence from Serb rule.
	   Serb forces in February launched a crackdown on Kosovo Albanian
separatists. Several hundred people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have
been killed and as many as 300,000 were driven from their homes.
	   The violence has continued past the Oct. 12 agreement by
Milosevic to sharply reduce the number of police and soldiers in
Kosovo. NATO had threatened airstrikes to force an end to the
crackdown.
	   In the past week, at least two Serb policemen have been killed
and three injured, while six guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation
Army have died from police gunfire.
	   ``It is obvious that we have a long way to go from this
battlefield to the negotiating table,'' Walker said.
	   Western powers led by the United States believe the verification
mission will restore stability in Kosovo by having the unarmed
foreigners roaming the region to report on any violence or
violations of the agreement Milosevic reached with U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke and the OSCE.
	   Walker was unable to provide a firm date for launching the
mission, which he called the most ambitious undertaking to date of
the 54-nation OSCE.
	   The OSCE's Permanent Council on Wednesday estimated costs for
the year-long mission at dlrs 200 million. The council, meeting in
Vienna, Austria, approved expenditures of dlrs 64 million for the
rest of 1998, with 1999 outlays to be decided later, spokeswoman
Melissa Fleming said.
	   Security for the verifiers depends on guarantees given by
Milosevic and the rebels, Walker said.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A bomb damaged the home of Albania's
constitutional court chief near the center of Tirana Wednesday
night, 11 days before a referendum on the nation's first
non-communist constitution.
	   The court's chief judge, Fehmi Abdiu, said by telephone that he
was slightly injured by the apartment building blast, which
followed several other incidents of unrest this week in tense
Albania.
	   Police confirmed that TNT was used in the bombing at the
apartment building but gave no other details. Officers ringed the
building, keeping onlookers away. Windows on the building opposite
were smashed.
	   Abdiu said his second-floor apartment was badly damaged, along
with that of his neighbors.
	   The building is located just 300 meters (yards) from Tirana's
main police station and less than a kilometer (half-mile) from
central Skanderbeg Square.

Cabinet ratifies peace agreement with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu quotes, details from news conference,
Palestinian reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli Cabinet on Wednesday ratified the
peace agreement with the Palestinians after a two-week delay and
some U.S. prodding, setting the stage for an Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January.
	   The accord was narrowly approved by eight to four vote at the
end of seven hours of debate. Five ministers abstained. The narrow
vote appeared to be a political blow for Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, who had expected broader support.
	   Saying it was difficult to ``part with even one square
centimeter'' of the land, Netanyahu attached four stipulations to
the agreement that could cause new disruptions. Israel is to
withdraw from the land in exchange for security guarantees from the
Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu said he would bring each stage of the phased pullback
over the next three months to the Cabinet for a separate approval.
Ministers will be asked to determine whether the Palestinians have
met their security obligations under the accord, he said.
	   The agreement would stop in its tracks if the Palestine National
Council, the Palestinian parliament in exile, does not hold a
formal vote by mid-December to revoke clauses in the PLO founding
charter that call for Israel's destruction, Netanyahu said.
	   The prime minister also said Israel reserved the right to annex
areas of the West Bank if Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat went
ahead with plans to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state in
May, at the end of the five-year autonomy period.
	   In a fourth clause, Netanyahu said that in an additional
pullback to which Israel committed itself last year, the
Palestinians would receive no more than 1 percent of the West Bank.
	   Despite the new conditions, Netanyahu pledged to go ahead with
implementing the agreement. Israel has already fallen behind in the
12-week time table negotiated at least month's Mideast summit.
	   Netanyahu said he would permit the opening of the Palestinian
airport next week and would also begin releasing Palestinian
security prisoners at that time. In all, 750 Palestinians held by
Israel for security offenses are to be freed by January.
	   Another key Israeli commitment, to withdraw from 2 percent of
the West Bank by Monday, will likely not be carried out on time,
said Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan. The troop withdrawal cannot
take place until parliament as approved the deal Tuesday and will
likely be carried out a week late.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said he believed Netanyahu
attached new conditions to please Israeli hard-liners.
	   ``We appreciate the Cabinet approval, but we will close our ears
and eyes to the conditions because they are for them and not for
us,'' Asfour told The Associated Press.
	   Over the past two weeks, with Netanyahu postponing Cabinet
debate four times, the United States urged Israel to try to stick
to the agreement's original timetable.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke with Netanyahu on Tuesday
night about the agreement and the U.S. showdown with Iraq over
weapons inspections.
	   An Israeli official said the United States has signaled that its
tough policies toward Iraq were encountering problems in the Arab
world because Israel had not moved forward on its implementation of
the agreement.
	   While the Cabinet voted, thousands of Jewish settlers protested
in Tel Aviv. Far-right opposition legislator Rehavam Zeevi said the
pullback ``will endanger Jews in the Holy Land and bring war closer
to their homes.''
	   A key Israeli stipulation attached to the accord concerns the
procedure for revoking clauses of the PLO founding charter.
	   The agreement, negotiated last month at Wye Plantation outside
of Washington, says the Palestine National Council and other
Palestinian organizations will convene in mid-December to
``reaffirm'' a January letter by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to Clinton that lists the clauses considered annulled.
	   Israel insists that the Palestinian delegates hold a vote and
Netanyahu said Wednesday that the agreement would only be carried
out if the Palestinians comply. Palestinian officials have said
only approval by acclamation was required.
	   The Maariv daily said the dispute has been resolved quietly by
the United States. Under the compromise, the delegates will vote by
a show of hands, but not all members of the PNC will have to be
present and there will be no need for a two-thirds majority, Maariv
said.

	   The bombing comes with unrest on the upswing in Albania. Earlier
Wednesday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
issued a statement saying incidents over the past two days, notably
in the northern town of Shkodra, ``raise serious concerns about the
security situation in northern Albania.''
	   The unrest in Shkodra, 85 kilometers (50 miles) north of Tirana,
and a stronghold of the opposition Democratic Party, began late
Tuesday after police arrested three men _ all members of an
anti-Communist union _ on charges of theft.
	   Two of the men were later released, but a third, identified as
Marjan Zef Gryka, 27, remained in custody.
	   Local media reported Wednesday that Gryka was a former bodyguard
of Azem Hajdari, a popular opposition leader who was killed Sept.
12. Hajdari's death sparked a week of violent protests in the
capital.
	   The reports said Gryka was arrested for confronting President
Rexhep Mejdani during a visit to Shkodra last week while carrying
weapons. But an Interior Ministry spokesman later said he was only
charged with theft.
	   A crowd of anti-Communists gathered in the town's main square
late Tuesday, demanding the detained be released. They blocked off
part of the town and started shooting into the air. State
television later said some of the men had gained entry into the
main local government building.
	   The OSCE said its office in Shkodra had been looted of computers
and other equipment and a vehicle had been stolen during the
violence. No one was injured, the organization.
	   Shkodra was calm but tense Wednesday. Interior Ministry
officials said special police units have were sent from Tirana to
reinforce local officers.
	   Anti-Communist unions demanded Gryka's release as well as the
replacement of Shkodra's police chief and several local government
officials.

Paraguay drops World Court action against United States in death
</HEADLINE>
penalty case

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Paraguay has dropped a World Court
case against the United States in which it sought but failed to
postpone the execution in Virginia of a Paraguayan national, the
court announced Wednesday.
	   Paraguay went to the court in April to fight for a stay of
execution for Angel Francisco Breard, who was sentenced to death in
Virginia for the murder and attempted rape of a woman in Arlington
in 1992.
	   In a unanimous decision, the court, which has no enforcement
powers, ordered the United States to do everything it could to
prevent Breard's execution before the court made a final ruling in
the case.
	   Despite the order, Virginia officials executed Bread by lethal
injection April 14.
	   Paraguay had argued that Breard had been denied his right to
consular assistance after his arrest, as required by the 1963
Vienna Convention.
	   Arguing that Breard's case was a breach of the convention made
it possible for Paraguay to take the case to the World Court and
into the international spotlight.
	   No reason was given for Paraguay dropping the case _ which
effectively became moot when Breard was executed. Paraguay informed
the court Nov. 2 it wanted to halt proceedings and U.S. officials
agreed to the proposal on Tuesday.
	   The case marked the first time, the World Court, the United
Nations' highest judicial organ, had been asked to make a ruling in
a capital case.
	   The court, formally known as the International Court of Justice,
noted at the time that its decision did not ``concern the
entitlement of the federal states within the United States to
resort to the death penalty for the most heinous crimes.''
	   At heated hearings shortly before Breard was due to die,
Paraguay claimed that if Breard had been able to seek advice from
consular officials, he likely would have pleaded guilty in a
pretrial plea bargain and escaped the death penalty.
	   U.S. lawyers, argued Breard was never offered a plea bargain.
The United States also says it has no dispute with Paraguay over
the Vienna Convention and that the World Court therefore has no
jurisdiction in the case.
	   Breard, 32, was convicted of stabbing Ruth Dickie, 39, five
times on Feb. 17, 1992. He told police he intended to rape her, but
ran away when he heard someone knock on the door.

Why no records of anyone seeing big supernova explosion in 13th
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS to recast slug &QL; 
century? &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFF DONN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Astronomers have discovered evidence that hundreds of years ago
a star exploded closer to Earth than any other known supernova.
They just can't figure out why no one back in the 13th century
seems to have recorded the blast, which should have been a
spectacular sight.
	   The mystery suggests, among other things, that the astronomic
records are incomplete or that scientists have come across a new
celestial phenomenon: invisible supernovas.
	   The supernova should have appeared for a year or more as the
brightest object in the night sky, except for the moon, around the
year 1250.
	   Presumably, the great astronomers of the Orient should have been
able to see it just above the horizon, sometimes even during the
day, according to Bernd Aschenbach, one of the chief researchers.
	   But they made no known observations of it.
	   The explanation may be that the explosion of superheated gas and
radiation may not have given off visible light. The new work
``offers the possibility that we're looking at a new and different
phenomenon,'' said astrophysicist Robert Petre at NASA's Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.
	   Or the explanation might be much more mundane, like bad
record-keeping, the researchers said.
	   The discovery was made by scientists at the Max Planck Institute
in Germany and was reported Thursday in the journal Nature.
	   Only a few exploded stars within our Milky Way galaxy have been
at least potentially visible to the naked eye on Earth.
	   The supernova revealed itself when researchers scanned the
constellation Vela for invisible X-rays and gamma rays, which can
be byproducts of a supernova explosion.
	   In analyzing the radiation, the astronomers found that the
explosion's gas cloud is still out there and is twice as hot as the
sun's core and stretches up to 25 light-years across.
	   Though it is the nearest known supernova, it is still 650
light-years away, or about 41 million times farther from Earth than
the sun. (That means that the explosion actually occurred around
the year 600, but its light took about 650 years to reach Earth.)
	   Aschenbach said the 13th century supernova should have been
spectacular. He said the lack of any historical record has him
``very puzzled.''
	   However, one other known supernova, known as Cas-A from the year
1680, appears strangely dark. So maybe it and the newfound
supernova suggest a previously unknown group of invisible,
``subluminous'' exploding stars, researchers said.
	   Another one of the researchers, A.F. Iyudin, suggested that
maybe the explosion was simply hidden behind some expanse of
absorbing cosmic material.
	   Aschenbach also said that some Chinese astronomical records are
missing from the time, so it's possible that Mongol rule disrupted
the work of astronomers.
	   Or maybe astronomers did record the supernova, but their records
have been lost, said Edwin Krupp, director at the Griffith
Observatory in Los Angeles.
	   The last plainly observable supernova in this galaxy was
recorded by Johannes Kepler and other astronomers in 1604. It was
so dramatic to the naked eye that Kepler predicted it would be
hailed symbolically ``as a spectacle of public triumph or the entry
of a mighty potentate.''

 &UR; Eds: Updates with Stoltenberg upsetting Sampras

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Jason Stoltenberg scored one of the
finest wins of his career Wednesday, upsetting top-ranked Pete
Sampras 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 6-4 in the first round of the Stockholm
Open.
	   Stoltenberg, an Australian ranked 29th who had lost all four
previous matches to Sampras, needed seven match points before
wrapping up the match in 2 hours and 14 minutes.
	   ``I thought it was at least 15,'' Stoltenberg said. ``I thought
it was slipping away at the end. I held on.''
	   Both players received a standing ovation from the Royal Tennis
Hall crowd after the match.
	   Sampras' early exit could jeopardize his chances of finishing
the season as world No. 1 for a record sixth consecutive year. He's
now tied with Jimmy Connors, who also was top-ranked for five
straight years.
	   Marcelo Rios, who's playing a clay court tournament in his
native Chile this week, could overtake Sampras.
	   Sampras was playing the Stockholm Open, one of the world oldest
indoors, for the seventh time. He lost twice in the first round and
never won the tournament, but reached four semifinals. Boris Becker
beat him in three semis.
	   Earlier, Britain's Tim Henman advanced to the quarterfinals with
a straight-set victory over Wayne Ferreira of South Africa.
	   Henman's fellow countryman Greg Rusedski was more convincing,
demolishing Tommy Haas, 6-1, 6-4, in a quick 52 minutes in a
first-round match. The German failed to hold his first four service
games, winning a scant two points along the way.
	   ``I couldn't be playing much better tennis if I tried,''
Rusedski said after the match. Asked if he had ever won every point
of an opponent's service game in an entire set, he joked, ``It must
be my new improved returns.''
	   Henman's was much more evenly matched. He started fast, breaking
Ferreira's serve in game two, losing five of the next six games,
and then breaking Ferreira's serve to force a tiebreak. He won 7-6
(7-3), 6-4.
	   ``It was an up-and-down first set,'' Henman said. ``My serving
was erratic at that point.''
	   Henman and Rusedski, ranked Nos. 10 and 11 in the world, are
trying to qualify for the last spots in the ATP Tour Championships
in Hanover, Germany, later this month.
	   ``I think I've got to get to the finals'' at the Stockholm Open,
Rusedski said. ``I'm just thinking about my tennis and everything
else will take care of itself.... If it works, it works. If it
doesn't, it doesn't.''
	   Rusedski is on a roll. Last week he beat Sampras at the Paris
Open, a win he considers ``probably my greatest accomplishment in
tennis, by far.''
	   In other matches Wednesday, American Todd Martin defeated
Australia's hard-serving Wayne Arthurs, 6-4, 6-3, to join Henman in
the quarterfinals.
	   Arthurs, a 27-year-old doubles specialist from Adelaide, got to
face Martin by upsetting tournament second seed and world No. 7
Karol Kucera of Slovakia the evening before. He started sharp with
three aces in his first game, but the more experienced Martin broke
his serve in game three of each set, and wore him down.
	   Martin's play was business-like. He rarely fell behind in the
count, won the big points including service breaks early in each
set, and never lost his serve.
	   Arthurs, ranked No. 168, notched at least one ace in every
service game except one, and had 15 overall.
	   The tournament is being played on the hard composition court of
the Royal Tennis Hall.

AZT stops AIDS in babies when given after birth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 2200 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ The drug AZT appears to protect babies from
catching the AIDS virus from their mothers, even if treatment
begins only after birth.
	   AZT is already the standard medicine to prevent maternal
transmission of the AIDS virus. Typically, doctors give the
medicine to mothers during their last 14 weeks of pregnancy as well
as to babies for six weeks after birth.
	   However, sometimes the full course of treatment cannot be given,
often because HIV-infected women do not seek prenatal care. So
doctors at the New York State Department of Health in Albany
reviewed medical records to see what happened when AZT was started
late.
	   They found that even the shorter treatment cuts the risk
substantially. Even if treatment began only at birth, this reduced
the chance of catching the virus by two-thirds.
	   The study, directed by Dr. Nancy A. Wade, was published in
Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
	   Similar to other studies, this one found a 27 percent risk that
HIV-infected mothers would pass the virus to their babies if no AZT
was given. The study found that the risk was:
	   _6 percent if treatment was started before birth.
	   _9 percent when started within the first two days of life.
	   _18 percent if started after three days of life.
	   An editorial by Dr. Kenneth McIntosh of Children's Hospital in
Boston said the results ``add weight to the argument that HIV
infection can be prevented after exposure.''
	   The researchers said they still recommend that the full course
AZT be given when possible.

Study: Carotid artery surgery questioned in those with mild
</HEADLINE>
blockages &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 2200 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ A widely used operation intended to prevent
strokes by cleaning out clogged arteries in the neck is of little
value unless the blood vessels are severely blocked, a study
concludes.
	   The results were first reported by The Associated Press last
February when they were presented at a medical conference sponsored
by the American Heart Association. They are now being published in
Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
	   Earlier work from the research found that the operation clearly
saves lives when performed on people whose carotid arteries are at
least 70 percent blocked.
	   The latest findings show that when the blockage is between 50
percent and 69 percent, the operation reduces the risk of stroke
from 16 percent to 22 percent.
	   If the blockage is less than 50 percent, the operation does
nothing to prevent strokes. Since the operation itself can trigger
a stroke, doctors worry that in these patients the risks of the
surgery may outweigh the benefits, especially if done by surgeons
who are not highly experienced.
	   The study was performed on 2,226 men and women who had suffered
mild strokes that caused no permanent damage. It was directed by
Dr. Henry J.M. Barnett of the John P. Robarts Research Institute in
London, Ontario.

U.N. withdraws inspectors, relief workers from Iraq

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations evacuated all of its
weapons inspectors and many of its humanitarian workers from
Baghdad on Wednesday, blaming fears of ``possible military action''
against President Saddam Hussein's regime.
	   The hasty withdrawal _ conducted amid drenching rainstorms _
involved more than 200 U.N. staffers and raised fears that a
military strike by the United States and Britain is imminent.
	   Iraq showed no sign of backing down from its refusal to deal
with the arms inspectors, the nub of the crisis. The evacuation was
not reported by the Iraqi media, and there was little evidence of
Iraqis panicking or rushing to stock up on food.
	   Prakash Shah, the special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, said the withdrawal was ``in the background of possible
military action against Iraq. This is what we learned in our
consultations with New York.''
	   The United States and Britain have been threatening military
action since Iraq announced Oct. 31 that it was halting the
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   UNSCOM officials in Baghdad did not learn of plans to evacuate
until chief weapons inspector Richard Butler called from New York
at 4 a.m. Baghdad time Wednesday and ordered the entire staff out,
said UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross.
	   Speaking from Bahrain, where she was evacuated, Cross said 103
staffers of UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency had
pulled out. UNSCOM's field officer in Baghdad, Goran Wallen, said
no one from the commission was left behind.
	   In addition, about 130 of the 450 humanitarian workers in Iraq
withdrew Wednesday and were headed to the Jordanian capital of
Amman by road. There was confusion over the numbers, and earlier
U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, estimated 300
were leaving.
	   U.N. officials said about 40 more humanitarian workers would
leave Thursday, but apparently U.N. workers will remain in the
northern Kurdish areas.

Lukashenko threatens to dissolve government over money problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARINA BABKINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Alexander Lukashenko apologized to
Belarusians on Wednesday for rising prices and threatened to
reshuffle his government unless it finds a way to ``stabilize'' the
situation.
	   ``It's abnormal when we can't provide our people with bare
necessities,'' Lukashenko told top government officials in a
meeting broadcast on national television.
	   ``I would like to get an answer to one question: Why are our
people becoming poorer and poorer every month while our industry
and agriculture have shown steady development?'' he asked.
	   While Russia's economy has shriveled in recent months,
Lukashenko has claimed that production growth in Belarus is proof
that his post-Soviet policies of large subsidies to
state-controlled farms and industries are superior to free-market
reforms.
	   But Belarus' economy isn't looking great either. There are
frequent shortages of meat and dairy products, and inflation has
hit 30 percent this year in this former Soviet republic of 10
million on Russia's western border.
	   Critics say Lukashenko's growth figures are misleading because
the country has been printing large sums of money, leaving the
currency almost worthless.
	   For the first time, Lukashenko apologized to Belarusians for the
economic troubles and admitted that prices in the shops are
``limitless'' for the average Belarusian.
	   Speaking to the government officials, he said: ``I came to this
meeting with no intentions of firing anybody or lashing somebody
out in public. ... However, if by December 1 the situation isn't
stabilized, I'll have to seriously reshuffle the government.''
	   ``I don't really want to know what methods you will use to
stabilize the situation on the country's consumer goods market ...
but it won't be an easy task,'' he said, without elaborating.
	   The independent weekly Belarusskaya Gazeta published figures
Wednesday showing that since Lukashenko entered office in June 1994
prices for consumer goods increased 590 percent.

Police rearrest former Haitian army chief accused in slaughter of
</HEADLINE>
civilians &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Once-feared Haitian army chief
Claude Raymond was released from jail, then immediately rearrested
on charges he sent machete-wielding squads to slaughter civilians,
his lawyer said Wednesday.
	   Raymond, 64, received the papers ordering his release Tuesday
afternoon after two years in prison awaiting trial on terrorism
charges. Simultaneously, he was served the new arrest warrant, said
lawyer Reynold Georges.
	   Two of his associates, Claude Schneider and Dieu Phaniel, were
released for lack of evidence.
	   Prosecutors claim Raymond, the army chief under former Haitian
dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, committed ``crimes against the
constitution'' and participated in a 1987 election-day massacre in
which attackers shot and hacked voters to death at a Port-au-Prince
polling station.
	   He was also charged with participating in a September 1988
attack in St. Jean Bosco Church on former president Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, then a Roman Catholic priest. An army-backed death squad
murdered a dozen worshipers with machetes and gunfire, then burned
down the church. Aristide was not hurt.
	   Raymond was arrested with three others in July 1996 while
attending a voodoo festival.
	   They were charged with committing ``terrorist acts in the
framework of a process to destabilize public authority and order.''
	   The U.N. civilian mission, which monitors human rights in Haiti,
protested their long detention without trial. Fewer than 20 percent
of about 3,300 prisoners in Haiti have been tried and sentenced.
	   One of the four arrested, Frantz Bataille, was released in
December 1996 because of health problems and now lives in the
United States. He was Raymond's top political adviser.
	   On Nov. 5, an appeals court ordered the release of Raymond,
Schneider and Phaniel, citing insufficient evidence.
	   Raymond was transferred Tuesday from a downtown police prison to
the National Penitentiary.
	   He became army chief in 1971, when ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier took
over as life president after the death of his father, Francois
``Papa Doc'' Duvalier.
	   Raymond was briefly Haiti's interior minister in 1980 and
retired from the army before a 1986 popular uprising sent Duvalier
into exile in France.
	   After months of bloodshed, the army and army-backed death squads
aborted the 1987 elections.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A bomb damaged the home of Albania's
constitutional court chief near the center of Tirana Wednesday
night, 11 days before a referendum on the nation's first
non-communist constitution.
	   The court's chief judge, Fehmi Abdiu, said by telephone that he
was slightly injured by the apartment building blast, which
followed several other incidents of unrest this week in tense
Albania.
	   Police confirmed the bombing at the apartment building but gave
no other details. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
	   The bombing comes with unrest on the upswing in Albania, where
chronic political turmoil erupted in September in rioting that
prompted the resignation of Premier Fatos Nano.
	   Earlier Wednesday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe said incidents over the past two days, notably in the
town of Shkodra, ``raise serious concerns about the security
situation in northern Albania.''
	   Albanians are to vote Nov. 22 on a proposed constitution that
its drafters say would guarantee Albanians fundamental human and
religious rights and the right to own private property.
	   But the hard-line opposition Democrats, led by former President
Sali Berisha, charge that it would destroy the Albanian nation by
allowing people to change their nationality and religion.
	   Abdiu said his second-floor apartment was badly damaged in the
bombing, along with that of his neighbors. Officers ringed the
building, keeping onlookers away. Windows of the building opposite
were smashed.
	   The unrest in Shkodra, 85 kilometers (50 miles) north of Tirana,
and a stronghold of the opposition Democratic Party, began late
Tuesday after police arrested three men _ all members of an
anti-communist union _ on charges of theft.
	   Two of the men were later released, but a third, identified as
Marjan Zef Gryka, 27, remained in custody.
	   Local media reported Wednesday that Gryka was a former bodyguard
of Azem Hajdari, a popular opposition leader who was killed Sept.
12. Hajdari's death sparked a week of violent protests in the
capital.
	   A crowd of anti-communists gathered in the town's main square
late Tuesday, demanding the detained be released. They blocked off
parts of the town and shot their guns in the air. State television
later said some of the men had entered the main local government
building.
	   The OSCE said its office in Shkodra was looted of computers and
other equipment and a vehicle was stolen.
	   Shkodra was calm but tense Wednesday. Interior Ministry
officials said special police units were sent from Tirana to
reinforce local officers.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations evacuated all of its
weapons inspectors and many of its humanitarian workers from
Baghdad on Wednesday, blaming fears of ``possible military action''
against President Saddam Hussein's regime.
	   The hasty withdrawal _ conducted amid drenching rainstorms _
involved more than 200 U.N. staffers and raised fears that a
military strike by the United States and Britain is imminent.
	   Iraq showed no sign of backing down from its refusal to deal
with the arms inspectors, the nub of the crisis. The evacuation was
at first not reported by the Iraqi media, and there was little
evidence of Iraqis panicking or rushing to stock up on food.
	   Prakash Shah, the special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, said the withdrawal was ``in the background of possible
military action against Iraq. This is what we learned in our
consultations with New York.''
	   The United States and Britain have been threatening military
action since Iraq announced Oct. 31 that it was halting the
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   UNSCOM officials in Baghdad did not learn of plans to evacuate
until chief weapons inspector Richard Butler called from New York
at 4 a.m. Baghdad time Wednesday and ordered the entire staff out,
said UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross.
	   Speaking from Bahrain where she was evacuated, Cross said 103
staffers of UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency had
pulled out. UNSCOM field officer in Bahrain, Goran Wallen, said no
one from the commission was left behind in Iraq.
	   In addition, about 130 of the 450 humanitarian workers in Iraq
withdrew Wednesday and were headed to the Jordanian capital of
Amman by road. There was confusion over the numbers, and earlier
U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, estimated 300
were leaving.
	   U.N. officials said about 40 more humanitarian workers would
leave on Thursday, but apparently U.N. workers will remain in the
northern Kurdish areas.
	   The departing U.N. workers gave hugs to colleagues remaining
behind _ including Iraqi staff _ but refused to talk to reporters.
	   As the buses were leaving, U.N. workers were hanging mesh
screens over the glass windows of the U.N. headquarters on the
outskirts of Baghdad _ likely a precaution against flying glass in
the event of a military strike.
	   Iraq says it will not resume cooperation with UNSCOM unless the
U.N. Security Council moves to begin lifting trade sanctions
imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Shah told reporters he was in close contact with Iraq's Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   The Iraqis ``will not be able to desist from their position
unless the Security Council takes some action with regard to
sanctions against Iraq,'' Shah quoted Aziz as saying.
	   Later, the official Iraqi News Agency reported that Aziz had
sent a letter to Annan complaining about the withdrawal of the
weapons inspectors.
	   The agency quoted Aziz as saying that Iraq had not asked the
weapons teams to leave, adding: ``This measure on the part of
UNSCOM without authorization from the Security Council shows once
again that the commission takes its orders from the American
administration.''
	   INA also reported that Saddam held two meetings Wednesday with
his military commanders and defense officials, including the chief
of the air force and air defenses. It gave no details on the
meetings.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will respond to Japan's
proposals on the disputed Kuril Islands when he meets with Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Thursday, but the Kremlin plans to
keep the long-awaited response secret.
	   The talks with Obuchi, who arrived in Moscow on Wednesday night,
will be the first high-level meeting for Yeltsin since his latest
illness sidelined him a month ago.
	   The four islands north of Japan were seized by Soviet Union at
the end of World War II. Both countries claim ownership, and the
dispute has prevented them from signing a peace treaty.
	   Former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto presented new
proposals for ending the dispute when he and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin met in Japan in April.
	   The proposals have not been made public. Media reports have said
Tokyo proposes taking over the islands legally, but allowing
Russian to retain control for some time.
	   Yeltsin has long stalled with a response, but is expected to
finally give an answer when he meets with Hashimoto behind closed
doors in the Kremlin on Thursday, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   The Kremlin does not intend to disclose the proposal or
Yeltsin's response, ITAR-Tass said.
	   During their summit in Krasnoyarsk in November 1997, Yeltsin and
Hashimoto pledged to make utmost efforts to sign a peace treaty by
2000.
	   But Japan wants the treaty to spell out the status of the
Kurils. Obuchi again called for settling the dispute before the end
of the century in an interview published Wednesday.
	   ``I believe that our generation carries the responsibility for
making sure that the problems that have arisen in this century are
solved before it is over and are not shifted to the shoulders of
our children and grandchildren,'' Obuchi told Russian daily
Izvestia.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin's office said Wednesday that the Russian
leader planned to visit Japan next spring or summer.
	   Yeltsin has canceled several foreign trips this fall, and
Russian media have quoted unidentified top Kremlin officials as
saying that his health problems are likely to rule out any foreign
trips during the rest of his term, which runs through mid-2000.
	   Yeltsin's aides deny the speculations, insisting he has no
serious health problems. Yeltsin's visit to India in December is
still on schedule.
	   During Obuchi's visit, Russia and Japan will also sign an
agreement on investment protection, and deals on cooperation in
transport, tourism and environmental protection, ITAR-Tass
reported.
	   Russian Ambassador to Japan Alexander Panov recently said that
before any tough decision can be made on the Kurils dispute, Japan
needs to improve its relations with Russia.
	   About a week before the summit, Japan announced plans to give a
dlrs 800 million loan to Russia. The money is part of a dlrs 22.6
billion bailout package arranged by the International Monetary Fund
in the summer but put on hold after Russia succumbed to the
economic crisis in August, devaluing the ruble and defaulting on
domestic treasury debts.
	   No timetable for the release of the loan has been set, but
Obuchi's spokesman Sadaaki Numata said it ``would not be a
months-long wait,'' Interfax reported.
	   No reason was given for why Japan decided to go ahead with the
loan.
	   Obuchi is also expected to offer medical aid and dlrs 100
million in technical aid to support Russian industry and train
specialists, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Meanwhile, governors of two Russian Far Eastern regions _
Yevgeny Nazdratenko of Primorye and Igor Farhutdinov of Sakhalin _
insisted Wednesday that the Kurils must remain part of Russia,
ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Detroit Tigers signed their first
significant free agent in years, agreeing Wednesday to a dlrs 36
million, five-year contract with Dean Palmer.
	   Palmer, who turns 30 next month, hit .278 this year for Kansas
City, leading the Royals in both homers (34) and RBIs (119). He was
acquired by Kansas City from Texas on July 25, 1997, for Tom
Goodwin.
	   Palmer, who made dlrs 5.75 million this season, turned down a
dlrs 4.75 million player option and became a free agent following
the World Series. He gets a dlrs 10 million signing bonus that is
payable over five years, dlrs 3 million in 1999, dlrs 5 million in
2000, dlrs 5.5 million in 2001, dlrs 6 million in 2002 and dlrs 6.5
million in 2003.
	   Detroit also made an offer to Ken Caminiti, another free-agent
third baseman, but he turned it down. The Tigers, getting ready to
move into a new ballpark in 2000, have said they plan to upgrade
their payroll next season in an effort to get competitive before
the move.
	   The Tigers were last in the American League Central this season
at 65-97, 24 games behind first-place Cleveland. They have had five
straight losing seasons for the first time in their history.

Dodgers trade Bonilla to Mets for Rojas

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The Los Angeles Dodgers, seeking to bolster
their bullpen and give themselves financial flexibility, traded
third baseman Bobby Bonilla to the New York Mets on Wednesday for
right-hander Mel Rojas and cash.
	   The switch-hitting Bonilla, hampered by injuries last year,
batted .249 with 11 homers and 45 RBIs in 100 games following
offseason surgery on his left wrist and left Achilles' tendon.
	   Bonilla was traded to the Dodgers on May 15 along with Gary
Sheffield, Charles Johnson and Jim Eisenreich and a minor league
pitcher for Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile as part of the Florida
Marlins' payroll purge.
	   Piazza was traded to the Mets a week later and recently signed a
dlrs 91 million, seven-year contract with them.
	   Bonilla, 35, played for the Mets for 3 1/2 years before being
traded to the Baltimore Orioles midway through the 1995 season. He
is under contract for two more years at dlrs 5.9 million per
season.
	   Rojas, who turns 32 next month, was a major disappointment for
the Mets last year, going 5-2 with a 6.05 ERA and two saves in 50
games. He is signed for 1999 at dlrs 4.5 million.
	   Bonilla has 273 homers in his big-league career, hitting a
career-best 34 for the Mets in 1994. He began his big-league career
with the Chicago White Sox in 1986, was traded to the Pittsburgh
Pirates during that season and then signed with the Mets as a free
agent after the 1991 season. The Marlins signed him as a free agent
after the 1995 season.
	   Rojas signed a with the Cubs after the 1996 season and was a
bust, going 0-4 with a 4.22 ERA and 13 saves before he was traded
to the Mets that Aug. 8 with outfielder Brian McRae and pitcher
Turk Wendell for outfielder Lance Johnson, pitcher Mark Clark and
infielder Manny Alexander. During the remainder of the 1997 season,
Rojas was 0-2 with two saves and a 5.13 ERA.

Mastodon bones discovered in Macedonia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Bones of a mastodon thought to date
back millions of years were discovered during unrelated excavation
work last week in Macedonia, officials said Wednesday.
	   Two meter- (yard-) long bones from the animal, an extinct and
distant ancestor of the present-day elephant, were unearthed when a
brick factory was digging for clay, according to media reports in
Skopje.
	   The bones, belonging to the foot and femur of a mastodon, were
transferred from the site 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the
Macedonian capital to Skopje's Museum of Natural Sciences for
expert evaluation and preservation.
	   Mastodons lived during the Pliocene period, some 2 million to 10
million years ago, according to Gute Mladenovski, head of the
museum's paleontology department.
	   They were mammals but differed from their relatives the mammoths
and their common descendants the elephants, both by being larger in
size and with a different tusk structure.
	   ``In the Pliocene, Macedonian terrain was filled with this kind
of animal life roaming the vast steppes which existed here,''
Mladenovski said in an interview.
	   As fossil remains from the Pliocene era have been found in
Macedonia before, Mladenovski suggested there could be more
prehistoric bones in this particular region.
	   Expert teams plan to launch a scientific project to dig for more
mastodon remains, he said.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina offered to be the first
developing nation to voluntarily cut back on greenhouse gas
emissions, seeking a breakthrough Wednesday in talks to reduce
global warming.
	   President Carlos Menem opened the final phase of the U.N.
conference with a promise that Argentina would seek to join
industrialized nations already bound by a 1997 treaty to reduce
carbon dioxide output by 2012.
	   ``Not only can highly advanced countries contribute to a new
world order, but also emerging nations,'' Menem said. ``We all have
a responsibility.''
	   Several developing countries have refused to even discuss the
issue of voluntary targets at the 160-nation conference that ends
Friday. China and India are among the developing countries that
threaten to become the world's leading greenhouse gas polluters by
2015.
	   Yet, U.S. administration adviser Todd Stern told The Associated
Press that Argentina's pledge opens ``a new pathway for developing
countries'' to commit to emissions targets similar to those
accepted by 38 industrialized nations bound by the treaty.
	   ``This is a major breakthrough,'' Stern said.
	   Pat Upson, president of the European Nuclear Society, worried
that Argentina's concession overshadowed the efforts to curtail the
excesses of the big polluters, such as the United States.
	   ``We welcome any reduction,'' he said. ``But what we would be
more interested in hearing from the industrialized countries is how
they plan to reduce their emissions.''
	   At the landmark conference in Kyoto, Japan, last year, more than
three dozen industrialized nations agreed, by 2012, to cut their
pollution output by 5 percent below 1990 levels. Poorer nations
were merely asked to do what they can to curtail emissions.
	   The United States has yet to sign the Kyoto Protocol. Stalled in
the Senate, opponents argue the treaty needs a greater commitment
from the developing world.
	   Participation from developing nations was not considered at the
conference. They argue industrialized nations should cut back first
because they are largely responsible for the problem. They also say
their emerging economies should not be burdened with costly
pollution reductions.
	   Many scientists believe Earth is gradually warming because of
what are known as greenhouse gas emissions _ mainly carbon dioxide
from factories, power plants and automobiles.
	   Critics say global warming scenarios have not been proven and
that the pact threatens American industry. Proponents of the treaty
say it won't force costly measures on American companies to cut
pollution.

Swindell signs three-year contract with Diamondbacks

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Arizona Diamondbacks landed a free-agent
pitcher today, but it wasn't Randy Johnson.
	   Greg Swindell, who finished the season with Boston following a
midseason trade from Minnesota, agreed to a three-year contract
with the Diamondbacks.
	   The left-hander, 33 next season, was a combined 5-6 with a 3.59
ERA for the Twins and Red Sox last season in 81 relief appearances.
	   He was 3-3 with a 3.66 ERA for the Twins when they traded him to
Boston on July 31 along with first baseman-outfielder Orlando
Merced for right-hander Matt Kinney and left-handers Joe Thomas and
John Barnes.
	   Arizona planned to announce the deal later today. It was
confirmed to the AP by a source who spoke on the condition he not
be identified.
	   The Diamondbacks also are seeking to sign Johnson, who visited
with the team Tuesday. The ``Big Unit'' went 10-1 with a 1.28 ERA
for the Astros after a July 31 trade from the Seattle Mariners.
Johnson led the major leagues with 329 strikeouts.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won narrow
approval from his Cabinet Wednesday which placed a series of
conditions on the land-for-security agreement signed with Yasser
Arafat last month at the White House.
	   After two weeks of delays and American pressure, eight of 17
ministers voted in favor, five ministers abstained and four voted
against in what appeared to be a political blow for Netanyahu who
had expected broader support.
	   In approving the latest Mideast peace accord, the Israeli
government voted to withdraw its troops from 13 percent of the West
Bank and expand Palestinian autonomy. But pinned implementation on
four stipulations which could disrupt the deal altogether.
	   At the same time, the government announced plans to speed up
construction of a new Jewish neighborhood on a disputed Jerusalem
hilltop and confiscate sections of West Bank land for settler
bypass roads.
	   The Palestinians cautiously welcomed ratification of the accord
but dismissed the conditions as ``violations.'' U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright called the vote an important step in the
peace process. And Jewish settlers, some of whom will find
themselves in isolated West Bank areas after the withdrawal, lashed
out at the government for giving up land which settlers consider to
be their biblical birthright.
	   ``For Sale: State of Israel, a giveaway,'' read a large banner
at a protest rally where over ten thousand settlers and their
supporters gathered in Tel Aviv as the Cabinet met.
	   In a news conference immediately following the vote, Netanyahu
said the land, which Israel captured in 1967, was ``precious and
important.'' He said that Israel reserved the right to annex large
areas of the West Bank if Arafat made good on a threat to
unilaterally declare Palestinian statehood in May.
	   Each stage of the phased pullback over the next three months
would require separate Cabinet approval, a move which would likely
delay implementation. ``The Cabinet will convene to review
Palestinian compliance with their commitments. Only then, when the
Cabinet sees a complete compliance ... will it approve the next
phase,'' Netanyahu said.
	   The agreement would stop in its tracks if the Palestine National
Council does not hold a formal vote by mid-December to revoke
clauses in the PLO founding charter that call for Israel's
destruction, Netanyahu said.
	   In a fourth clause, Netanyahu said if Israel carries out an
additional pullback which it promised to do last year, the
Palestinians would receive no more than 1 percent of the West Bank.
	   ``The condition are part of game between Mr. Netanyahu and his
right wing ministers. We refuse them completely,'' senior
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told The Associated Press.
	   ``This is a clear and serious violation of the Wye River
agreement and we call on the American administration to come down
to the area to observe who is implementing the agreement and who is
not implementing,'' Erekat said.
	   Netanyahu said that he would allow the opening of the
Palestinian airport next week and would also begin releasing some
750 Palestinian security prisoners at that time.
	   But Israel would not meet a Monday deadline to withdraw troops
from 2 percent of the West Bank, said Netanyahu adviser David
Bar-Illan. The troop redeployment cannot take place until
parliament has approved the deal Tuesday. Bar-Illan said it would
likely take place ``towards the end of next week.''
	   Over the past two weeks, with Netanyahu postponing Cabinet
debate four times, the United States urged Israel to try and stick
to the original time table of the agreement.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke with Netanyahu on Tuesday
night about the land-for-security agreement and about the U.S.
showdown with Iraq over weapons inspections.
	   An Israeli official said the United States has let it be known
that its policy of being tough on Iraq was encountering problems in
the Arab world because Israel had not moved forward on its
implementation of the Wye agreement.
	   Wednesday's vote was the third time since Netanyahu came to
power in 1996 that his Cabinet has narrowly approved withdrawals
from the West bank, Which each vote, the powerful Jewish settler
lobby which helped put Netanyahu in office, has distanced itself
from his administration.
	   At Wednesday's rally, thousands of settlers and mostly religious
Jews, lobbed their first direct hit at the government which it
vowed to bring down.
	   ``This is a confused and fractured government,'' said right wing
lawmaker Rehavam Zeevi. The agreement ``will lead to the
endangerment of the Jews in the Holy Land and bring war closer to
their homes.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations evacuated all of its
weapons inspectors and many of its humanitarian workers from
Baghdad on Wednesday, blaming fears of ``possible military action''
against President Saddam Hussein's government.
	   The hasty withdrawal _ conducted amid drenching rainstorms _
involved more than 200 U.N. staffers and raised fears that a
military strike by the United States and Britain is imminent.
	   Iraq showed no sign of backing down from its refusal to deal
with the arms inspectors, the nub of the crisis. The evacuation was
not reported by the Iraqi media, and there was little evidence of
Iraqis panicking or rushing to stock up on food.
	   U.N. envoy Prakash Shah said the withdrawal was ``in the
background of possible military action against Iraq. This is what
we learned in our consultations with New York.''
	   The United States and Britain have been threatening military
action since Iraq announced Oct. 31 that it was halting the
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Commission officials in Baghdad did not learn of plans to
evacuate until chief weapons inspector Richard Butler called from
New York at 4 a.m. Baghdad time Wednesday and ordered the entire
staff out, said UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross.
	   Speaking from Bahrain, where she was evacuated, Cross said 103
staffers of UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency had
pulled out. UNSCOM field officer in Bahrain, Goran Wallen, said no
one from the commission was left behind in Iraq.
	   In addition, about 130 of the 450 humanitarian workers in Iraq
withdrew Wednesday and were headed to the Jordanian capital of
Amman by road. There was confusion over the numbers, and U.N.
officials had estimated earlier that 300 were leaving.
	   U.N. officials said about 40 more humanitarian workers would
leave Thursday, but apparently U.N. workers will remain in the
northern Kurdish areas.
	   The departing U.N. workers gave hugs to colleagues remaining
behind _ including Iraqi staff _ but refused to talk to reporters.
	   As the buses were leaving, U.N. workers were hanging mesh
screens over the glass windows of the U.N. headquarters on the
outskirts of Baghdad _ likely a precaution against flying glass in
the event of a military strike.
	   Iraq says it will not resume cooperation with UNSCOM unless the
U.N. Security Council moves to begin lifting trade sanctions
imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Shah told reporters he was in close contact with Iraq's Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. Shah said the Iraqi official had made
clear that Iraq does not intend to back down without movement by
the U.N. Security Council to lift the sanctions.
	   Later, the official Iraqi News Agency reported that Aziz had
sent a letter to U.N. chief Kofi Annan complaining about the
withdrawal of the weapons inspectors.
	   The agency quoted Aziz as saying that Iraq had not asked the
weapons teams to leave, adding: ``This measure on the part of
UNSCOM without authorization from the Security Council shows once
again that the commission takes its orders from the American
administration.''
	   The agency also reported that Saddam held two meetings Wednesday
with his military commanders and defense officials, including the
chief of the air force and air defenses. It gave no details on the
meetings.

Russian lawmakers fail in bid to lift sanctions against Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Ivanov saying Russia is working to
solve crisis, but no sign of active mediation, other quotes; ADDS
byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's foreign minister said Wednesday that
Moscow was ``using all its opportunities'' to solve the standoff in
Iraq, but said international consensus was essential and gave no
sign that Russia would try to mediate as in previous crises.
	   Igor Ivanov's comments came hours after Russia requested an
emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council because of the
crisis over inspections of suspected Iraqi weapons sites. U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered a major buildup Wednesday
of U.S. military force in the Persian Gulf.
	   In Moscow, visiting German Foreign Minister Joshka Fischer
appealed to Ivanov for Russia to use its influence with Baghdad to
help cool tensions.
	   Russia's Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, an Arab affairs
expert, successfully negotiated with Saddam during previous
disputes, when Primakov was foreign minister.
	   ``Russia is using its opportunities'' to make Iraq change its
mind and allow inspectors to continue their work, Ivanov told
reporters after meeting Fischer.
	   But he added, ``It is of paramount importance that the
international community preserve consensus on this issue. ... This
is why it would be wrong to shift the responsibility to Russia or
anyone else. We have to act together.''
	   The comments differed sharply from Russia's traditional support
of Iraq.
	   The Russian government has called for the early lifting of
international sanctions against Iraq, but has not moved to act
unilaterally. The sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait, and the United Nations says they will not be
lifted until inspectors verify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons
of mass destruction.
	   The latest Iraqi crisis comes amid Russia's worst economic
turmoil since the Soviet collapse, and Primakov _ the country's key
player in relations with Iraq _ has been preoccupied with domestic
affairs.
	   Iraq owes Moscow billions of dollars from Soviet times, when the
Arab nation was a big arms buyer.
	   Ivanov on Wednesday reiterated Moscow's opposition to any
possible strikes against Iraq, saying they ``would cancel the
immense work done by the international community over the past
seven years and complicate the situation in the region.''
	   Fischer urged Ivanov to use Russia's influence, saying the
situation was considered very serious in Western capitals. Fischer
spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and his
French and British counterparts before meeting with Ivanov.
	   Also Wednesday, Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist party
launched a motion that called for lifting sanctions against Iraq,
but it failed to win approval.
	   A total of 156 lawmakers voted Wednesday for lifting the
sanctions and only 36 voted against, but the motion was well short
of the 226 votes needed for a simple majority.
	   Even if it had passed, the motion would have been non-binding,
because parliament has little say over foreign policy, which is
crafted almost entirely by President Boris Yeltsin's government.
	   Zhirinovsky has visited Iraq on several occasions and expressed
his support for Saddam.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will respond to Japan's
proposals on the disputed Kuril Islands when he meets with Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Thursday, but the Kremlin plans to
keep the long-awaited response secret.
	   The talks with Obuchi, who arrived in Moscow on Wednesday night,
will be the first high-level meeting for Yeltsin since his latest
illness sidelined him a month ago.
	   The four islands north of Japan were seized by Soviet Union at
the end of World War II. Both countries claimed ownership, and the
dispute prevented them from signing a peace treaty.
	   Former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto presented new
proposals for ending the dispute when he and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin met in Japan in April.
	   The proposals have not been made public. Media reports have said
Tokyo proposes taking over the islands legally, but allowing
Russian to retain control for some time.
	   Yeltsin has long stalled with a response, but is expected to
finally give an answer when he meets with Obuchi behind closed
doors in the Kremlin on Thursday, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.

Huber 6-3, 6-2.

Two Americans, two Czechs charged with cruelty to students

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two Czech employees of school also charged &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Charges have been filed against
two American and two Czech employees of a private American school
whom police say held students against their will and punished them
excessively, officials said Wednesday.
	   Spokeswoman Dagmar Bartonikova said the two Americans were
charged Tuesday with cruelty to people in their custody and with
curtailing the students' freedom of movement, charges that can
entail eight years in prison under Czech law.
	   She refused to identify the suspects or their roles at the
school in the Moravia region, but said one of them is a woman.
	   Czech TV later Wednesday cited authorities as saying two Czech
employees also had been arrested on similar charges.
	   According to media reports, the school is run by U.S. citizen
Glenn Roach and her husband Steven.
	   A judge now must rule whether the two will remain in police
custody, Bartonikova said.
	   Last Friday, police searched the school located in Brno, 200
kilometers (125 miles) southeast of Prague, and interviewed some of
the students after former employees complained the children were
being unduly punished and were forbidden to leave.
	   Martin Pilka, the co-owner of the Morava Academy agency that
runs the school, told The Associated Press last week that the
school is a regular boarding school for American teen-agers who
were neglecting school at home and had problems getting along with
their families.
	   He ruled out any harsh methods, saying the children regularly
went for walks and excursions.
	   Pilka said the school has 60 students, the first of whom arrived
last March for the eight- to 10-month course. He claimed the school
is accepted in the United States as part of the U.S. educational
system.
	   He said Ralph Atkin of St. George, Utah, is the majority owner
of Morava Academy.
	   Czech television said late Tuesday that a first group of
students had already left for the United States and the rest will
leave by the end of the week.
	   According to media reports, parents paid dlrs 60 per day for
each child.
	   No one answered the phone at the school Wednesday and the U.S.
Embassy in Prague was closed due to Veterans Day.

Security Council to meet on Iraq as Annan appeals to Saddam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with council meeting, letter from
Iraq's deputy prime minister to Annan, RAISE background on Iraq,
Annan quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council met in an
emergency session on Iraq Wednesday while Secretary-General Kofi
Annan appealed to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to immediately resume
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Russia requested the council meeting after 233 U.N. personnel
were pulled out of Iraq because of the possibility of airstrikes by
the United States to compel Iraq to permit the U.N.-mandated
inspections that monitor Iraq for weapons of mass destruction.
	   Before heading into the Security Council's afternoon meeting,
British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said that while diplomacy
remains active, a military solution is now ``a serious option.''
	   Iraq says it will not cooperate with the weapons inspectors
until the Security Council begins to lift the debilitating economic
sanctions imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking
the Gulf War.
	   Iraq barred the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, from
carrying out spot weapons inspections on Aug. 5. After the council
offered Baghdad a comprehensive review of its compliance with U.N.
resolutions _ without linking it to the possible lifting of
sanctions _ Iraq halted all dealings with UNSCOM on Oct. 31.
	   Annan cut short a trip through north Africa and was expected to
return to U.N. headquarters in New York on Thursday, U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said.
	   Saying he was ``saddened and burdened'' by Iraq's decision to
halt dealings with the inspectors, the U.N. chief reiterated that
economic sanctions against Baghdad can only be lifted if Iraq fully
cooperates with the Security Council.
	   ``I strongly urge President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi
government to rescind its decision and resume immediate
cooperation'' with inspectors, Annan said in a statement issued at
the United Nations.
	   ``This would be good for the Iraqi people, for the region and
for the world,'' he said.
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler, who heads UNSCOM,
said Wednesday that he ordered all inspectors to leave Baghdad
because of a strong recommendation from the United States and an
``increasingly hostile'' atmosphere in Iraq.
	   ``This is a precautionary move only ... and I sincerely hope
it's temporary,'' he said.
	   Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz accused the UNSCOM of
acting on orders from the United States and using the United
Nations merely as ``false cover.''
	   In a letter to Annan _ the first official Iraqi reaction since
the pullout _ Aziz gave no indication that Baghdad was prepared to
rescind its ban on dealing with the weapons inspectors. He made no
mention of appeals by Annan and others to resume cooperation.
	   Aziz said no explanation for the U.N. pullout was given to the
Iraqi government _ and he stressed that Baghdad had not requested
the weapons inspectors to leave.
	   ``In the light of the American threats to launch a military
aggression against Iraq without authorization from the Security
Council, the decision of UNSCOM fully proves once again that UNSCOM
acts in accordance with the orders of the United States and that it
coordinates its actions with it,'' he said.
	   He called on Annan and the Security Council to take unspecified
action in light of what he said was confirmation of the links
between UNSCOM and the United States. Iraq has repeatedly called
for Butler to be replaced and UNSCOM to be completely restructured
to get a greater diversity of inspectors.
	   Butler told a news conference he spent almost all day Tuesday
dealing with ``an absolutely unfounded allegation'' by Iraq that an
inspector had committed an act of espionage. He would not disclose
the nationality of the inspector, except to say he was not
American.
	   Calling Iraq's Oct. 31 decision to halt inspections and
monitoring ``very wrongheaded,'' Butler said: ``Iraq knows quite
well what needs to be done to complete the disarmament work and
move towards the removal of sanctions. ... The course that they're
on now is only extending sanctions.''
	   Greenstock, the British ambassador, said he did not foresee a
return visit to Baghdad by Annan, who flew to the Iraqi capital
during the last crisis in February and signed a memorandum of
understanding with the Iraqis that resumed inspections and averted
U.S. and British airstrikes.
	   ``His memorandum of understanding from February has been thrown
back in his face,'' Greenstock said.

Bordeaux gains vital win at Lorient; Rennes falters at Lens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Second-placed Bordeaux kept in touch with French
league leader Marseille on Wednesday with a 2-0 win at lowly
Lorient, but the challenge of minnow Rennes faltered.
	   At Lorient, Bordeaux took the lead in the seventh minute with a
well-struck shot from captain Michel Pavon, before an 80th minute
strike from Silvain Wiltord secured the points.
	   Wiltord's goal was his tenth in this season's French
championship.
	   Rennes' challenge took a knock when it lost 3-1 at last year's
champion Lens.
	   Wagneau Eloi and Tony Vairelles, with two, scored for Lens,
while Shabani Nonda replied for Rennes.
	   In a match between two teams on the fringe of the early
championship race, fourth-placed Monaco beat fifth-placed Auxerre
3-2 at the Stade Louis II.
	   French international striker David Trezeguet scored twice for
Monaco.
	   Second half goals from Alain Caveglia and Philippe Violeau gave
Lyon a 2-0 success at home to high-scoring Montpellier.
	   After 13 rounds of the championship, Marseille has 33 points,
ahead of Bordeaux with 31 and Rennes with 26. Monaco's win leaves
it with 23 points.
	   In other games Wednesday: Paris Saint-Germain 2, Metz 2; Sochaux
2, Bastia 1; Toulouse 0, Strasbourg 1.
	   In Tuesday's games, Marseille won 3-2 at Nancy, while Nantes
drew 1-1 at home to Le Havre.

Leverkusen gains some ground on Bayern, Dortmund also wins

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Bayer Leverkusen gained some ground on
Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga when it beat Hertha Berlin 1-0 on a
goal by Dutch striker Erik Meijer late in the game Wednesday.
	   Leverkusen's three points took it up to second place, five
points behind Bayern, whose game against Borussia Moenchengladbach
was called off Tuesday because of a waterlogged pitch.
	   1860 Munich also has 23 points, but dropped to third because of
an inferior goal difference.
	   In other games Wednesday, Borussia Dortmund beat Duisburg 2-0,
Eintracht Frankfurt defeated Freiburg 3-1, Nuremberg played to a
2-2 draw with Bochum and Wolfsburg upset Stuttgart 2-1.
	   In Berlin's Olympic stadium, Meijer connected on a looping
free-kick to head home the only goal in the 74th minute.
	   Berlin's Cameroon striker Alphonse Tchami, a late substitute
shot wide with five minutes left to waste the home side's best
opportunity to clinch a point.
	   Berlin lost its first home game of the season while Leverkusen
remained unbeaten on the road.
	   ``It wasn't easy to become the first team win in Berlin but I
think we deserved it,'' said Leverkusen coach Christoph Daum.
	   In Dortmund, Lars Ricken shot the home side ahead in the 11th
minute, pouncing on a ball deflected by the Duisburg goalkeeper and
Swiss striker Stephane Chapuisat made it 2-0 in the 35th with a
left-footed drive inside the far post.
	   Duisburg finished with 10 men after the expulsion in the 76th
minute of Stefan Emmerling and Dortmund wasted dozens of chances.
	   In a battle of two promoted teams, Frankfurt went ahead in the
11th through Bernd Schneider, who found the net with an angled
shot, but Uwe Wassmer equalized in the 23rd, heading in from close
range.
	   Eintracht, the only team to beat Bayern Munich so far this
season, regained the lead in 37th through Thomas Epp's splendid
volley.
	   Its job was made easier after Marco Wesisshaupt's expulsion nine
minutes from time that left Freiburg under strength and Marco
Gebhardt secured the victory with the third goal in the dying
seconds to seal Freiburg's first loss on the road.
	   Jonathan Akpoborie gave Stuttgart the lead in the 23rd after
beating an offside trap, but Wolfsburg's Roy Praeger got the
visitors back into the game with a goal in the 36th.
	   Polish striker Andrzej Juskowiak clinched the winner two minutes
from time to give Wolfsburg an unexpected victory.
	   Wolfsburg jumped five places in the standings, to fifth, after
its third consecutive victory.
	   Nuremberg led twice against Bochum but still failed to score its
first victory in six games at home. Former German international
Stefan Kuntz converted two penalties to clinch a draw for Bochum.
	   In Tuesday's games, defending champion Kaiserslautern edged
Hamburg 1-0, while 1860 Munich beat Hansa Rostock 2-1.

No panic in Baghdad as government sends assuring messages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's state-run newspapers were full of
telegrams of support Wednesday for Saddam Hussein in the latest
crisis with the United Nations. But the official radio and TV made
no mention of the surprise evacuation of U.N. workers.
	   Many Iraqis said they did not fear a new U.S. military strike,
adding they could do little about it. Streets were full, and there
was no sign of people rushing to stock up on food.
	   Hussein Ali Kadhim, a vendor in Baghdad's commercial hub of
Shorja, said he believed most Iraqis were fed up with crises over
U.N. arms inspectors and hoped a flare-up of hostilities would lead
to some change.
	   ``How many times will America come and unleash its missiles and
go as if nothing happened. It must be a game and we the ordinary
people do not understand,'' said Kadhim.
	   Unlike in past crises, the Iraqi dinar did not dive in value,
staying steady at 1,750 to the dollar. Grocers also said prices
were stable despite the realization that a new U.S. missile strike
could come soon.
	   ``I have not seen anything extraordinary today. It is like any
other day,'' said grocer Nizar Khalifa.
	   That may be because the government is sending a different
message this time from that in past confrontations with the United
Nations.
	   It has not announced any measures to ward off a possible
military strike, nor has it rationed gasoline _ which usually set
off runs on filling stations in the past.
	   While reports outside Iraq spoke of war preparations _ the
London-based Al-Zaman newspaper said key military and security
headquarters were evacuated _ none of this was apparent in Baghdad.
	   In the past, the government publicized that it was dismantling
factories to protect them against attack and sent units of military
police into the streets.
	   Not this time.
	   Instead there were the messages of support for Saddam in
newspapers from tribal leaders and trade unions.
	   And although weapons inspectors and other U.N. personnel had
pulled out by afternoon _ giving a possible U.S. attack as the
reason _ Iraqi radio and TV still had not broadcast the news hours
later.
	   Despite a heavy downpour that turned Baghdad streets into
swamps, all was normal.
	   Shops remained open in the market area of Shorja into the
evening. Rasheed Avenue, Baghdad's main thoroughfare, was congested
with cars and pedestrians strolled along the colonnaded sidewalk,
some drinking tea and others looking at shop windows.
	   Residents in Shorja said they were not aware the inspectors were
pulled out. Nizar Abdulkhalifa noted that the United Nations
withdrew inspectors in 1997 as well, after Iraq ordered the removal
of Americans from the team.
	   ``We have passed through this before and I personally I am not
afraid at all,'' Abdulkhalifa said.
	   Salem Jarjees, who sells nylon sheets, said he would open his
shop on Thursday even if the Americans attacked on Wednesday.
	   ``I hope we the civilians will be spared but mind you their
so-called smart weapons hit residential areas in the past,'' he
said.

Study: Zeroing in on heart patients with low HDL saves lives
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ Cholesterol drugs can save the lives of even those
heart patients whose only cholesterol problem is too little HDL,
the good stuff that keeps arteries clean, a study found.
	   Doctors often recommend cholesterol-lowering drugs for people
whose so-called bad cholesterol, or LDL, is off the charts.
However, about one-quarter of all people with heart disease have
ordinary amounts of LDL, while their HDL, or good cholesterol, is
low.
	   In a Veterans Administration study released Wednesday, doctors
gave these people a relatively old generic medicine that slightly
increases HDL. They found it lowered the risk of a heart attack or
death from heart disease by 22 percent.
	   The study used a drug called Lopid, known generically as
gemfibrozil. This medicine has been overtaken in recent years by a
newer class of medicines, called statins, that are available only
in more expensive brand-name versions.
	   ``It works. It's cheap. It's well-tolerated,'' said Dr. Hanna
Rubins, who directed the study at the Veterans Administration
Medical Center in Minneapolis.
	   The study was presented at a meeting in Dallas of the American
Heart Association, along with another report showing that unusually
aggressive treatment with one of the statin drugs can forestall the
need for angioplasty.
	   The statins typically cost dlrs 900 to dlrs 1,800 a year. In her
study, Rubins said gemfibrozil cost the Veterans Administration
dlrs 48 per patient annually, although the typical drugstore cost
is likely to be several times higher.
	   In the study, 1,264 men were randomly assigned to take
gemfibrozil, while 1,267 others got placebos. At the start, average
LDL levels were an unremarkable 111, while HDL was 31.5 _ well
below the healthy level of 45 or higher.
	   The treatment raised HDL just two points, while LDL was
unchanged. Nevertheless, after five years, 21 percent of patients
taking gemfibrozil had died or suffered heart attacks, compared
with 17 percent in the comparison study.
	   Side effects of gemfibrozil can include intestinal upsets and
gallstones. Statins are easier to take, but they have not been
specifically studied in heart patients with normal LDL and low HDL.
Some heart specialists said they doubt that gemfibrozil will gain
on the statins, even though it is cheaper.
	   ``We've got to get the LDL down, the lower the better,'' said
Dr. Gerald Fletcher of Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. ``We
shouldn't take the emphasis off of LDL. All of my patients are on
statins.''
	   Dr. Bertram Pitt of the University of Michigan described the
results of a study with one of the statin drugs, known as
atorvastatin, or Lipitor, on 341 people with mild heart disease who
were scheduled to undergo balloon angioplasty to reopen their
clogged heart arteries.
	   Half got their angioplasties and other usual treatment, while
the rest were put on higher-than-usual doses of Lipitor. After 18
months of follow-up, there was no statistically meaningful
difference in heart problems between the two groups.
	   Lipitor cut their LDL almost in half _ from an average 140 to
77. And 87 percent of these people were able to avoid angioplasty
or bypass surgery during the follow-up period.
	   ``We can delay or prevent the need for angioplasty'' with
aggressive statin treatment, Pitt said.

Musical actress Mary Millar dies at 62
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Actress Mary Millar, a television star and veteran
of the London musical stage, has died at age 62 after a long battle
with cancer.
	   She died Tuesday at her home in southeast London, her husband,
Rafael, said Wednesday.
	   In the 1990s, Mary Millar was known to millions of television
viewers as Rose in the BBC comedy series ``Keeping up
Appearances.''
	   But her musical talents had also led to a long and successful
career on the London stage, appearing in ``The Phantom of the
Opera'' as the original Madame Giry, and most recently in Disney's
``Beauty and the Beast.''
	   Her illness had forced her to withdraw in recent months from
``Beauty and the Beast,'' in which she played Mrs. Potts, the
teapot, and sang the show's love theme.
	   On the straight play front, she won acclaim as Judi Dench's
replacement in 1984 in the hit West End drama, ``Pack of Lies.''
	   Mary Millar was the second actress to play Hyacinth Bucket's
flashy, man-chasing sister Rose in ``Keeping Up Appearances.''
	   She won the role, which called for thigh-skimming skirts, when
she was in her 50s.
	   ``I bought a mini-skirt for the audition and sat on the Tube
(subway) feeling the biggest fool, but I got the job,'' she once
remarked.
	   Her first television success, in a show called ``Those Were the

	   She went on to work on stage and in television and also
understudied for Julie Andrews in the Broadway production of
``Camelot'' in the 1960s.

important to her,'' her husband said.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won narrow
approval from his Cabinet Wednesday for a land-for-deal with the
Palestinians but his ministers placed a series of conditions on the
agreement signed with Yasser Arafat last month at the White House.
	   After two weeks of delays and American pressure, eight of 17
ministers voted in favor, five ministers abstained and four voted
against in what appeared to be a political blow for Netanyahu who
had expected broader support.
	   In approving the latest Mideast peace accord, the Israeli
government voted to withdraw its troops from 13 percent of the West
Bank and expand Palestinian autonomy. But pinned implementation on
four stipulations which could disrupt the deal altogether.
	   At the same time, the government announced plans to speed up
construction of a new Jewish neighborhood on a disputed Jerusalem
hilltop and confiscate sections of West Bank land for settler
bypass roads.
	   The Palestinians cautiously welcomed ratification of the accord
but dismissed the conditions as ``violations.'' U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright called the vote an important step in the
peace process. And Jewish settlers, some of whom will find
themselves in isolated West Bank areas after the withdrawal, lashed
out at the government for giving up land which settlers consider to
be their biblical birthright.
	   ``For Sale: State of Israel, a giveaway,'' read a large banner
at a protest rally where over ten thousand settlers and their
supporters gathered in Tel Aviv as the Cabinet met.
	   In a news conference immediately following the vote, Netanyahu
said the land, which Israel captured in 1967, was ``precious and
important.'' He said that Israel reserved the right to annex large
areas of the West Bank if Arafat made good on a threat to
unilaterally declare Palestinian statehood in May.
	   Each stage of the phased pullback over the next three months
would require separate Cabinet approval, a move which would likely
delay implementation. ``The Cabinet will convene to review
Palestinian compliance with their commitments. Only then, when the
Cabinet sees a complete compliance ... will it approve the next
phase,'' Netanyahu said.
	   The agreement would stop in its tracks if the Palestine National
Council does not hold a formal vote by mid-December to revoke
clauses in the PLO founding charter that call for Israel's
destruction, Netanyahu said.
	   In a fourth clause, Netanyahu said if Israel carries out an
additional pullback which it promised to do last year, the
Palestinians would receive no more than 1 percent of the West Bank.
	   ``The condition are part of game between Mr. Netanyahu and his
right wing ministers. We refuse them completely,'' senior
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told The Associated Press.
	   ``This is a clear and serious violation of the Wye River
agreement and we call on the American administration to come down
to the area to observe who is implementing the agreement and who is
not implementing,'' Erekat said.
	   Netanyahu said that he would allow the opening of the
Palestinian airport next week and would also begin releasing some
750 Palestinian security prisoners at that time.
	   But Israel would not meet a Monday deadline to withdraw troops
from 2 percent of the West Bank, said Netanyahu adviser David
Bar-Illan. The troop redeployment cannot take place until
parliament has approved the deal Tuesday. Bar-Illan said it would
likely take place ``towards the end of next week.''
	   Over the past two weeks Netanyahu postponed Cabinet debate three
times and broke off a Friday debate after a suicide bombing by
Islamic militants at a Jerusalem market which injured 21 Israelis.
The United States urged Israel to try and stick to the original
time table of the agreement.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke with Netanyahu on Tuesday
night about the land-for-security agreement and about the U.S.
showdown with Iraq over weapons inspections.
	   An Israeli official said the United States has let it be known
that its policy of being tough on Iraq was encountering problems in
the Arab world because Israel had not moved forward on its
implementation of the Wye agreement.
	   Wednesday's vote was the third time since Netanyahu came to
power in 1996 that his Cabinet has narrowly approved withdrawals
from the West bank, Which each vote, the powerful Jewish settler
lobby which helped put Netanyahu in office, has distanced itself
from his administration.
	   At Wednesday's rally, thousands of settlers and mostly religious
Jews, lobbed their first direct hit at the government which it
vowed to bring down.
	   ``This is a confused and fractured government,'' said right wing
lawmaker Rehavam Zeevi. The agreement ``will lead to the
endangerment of the Jews in the Holy Land and bring war closer to
their homes.''

Canada's foreign minister assesses Russia's crisis

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Canada is offering emergency aid to Russia's vast
Arctic regions, which are facing possible food and fuel shortages
because of the latest economic crisis, visiting Canadian Foreign
Minister Lloyd Axworthy said Wednesday.
	   The offer came days after the United States pledged dlrs 625
million in food aid and loans to help Russia through its worst
economic crisis since the Soviet collapse. Russia is also
negotiating with the European Union for aid.
	   ``We have offered to provide humanitarian assistance during this
very severe crisis,'' Axworthy said after meeting Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov in Moscow. ``There was an understanding
that, in the North in particular, there are some real gaps that
need to be filled.''
	   Russia has been struggling with the high costs of distributing
food and fuel to its far-flung regions, especially in the north.
	   Axworthy wouldn't say how much Canadian aid would be provided or
when.
	   A Canadian official accompany Axworthy said the aid might
include warm clothing, medicines, heating equipment and grain.
	   Axworthy discussed Russia's economic woes and international
problems during his meetings with Primakov and Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov.
	   Axworthy had originally been scheduled to lay the groundwork for
a visit by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who was to lead a
delegation of Canadian business executives to Russia in January.
	   But Chretien's visit was put off because of Russia's economic
crisis.
	   Axworthy also met with Russian regional leaders and the
government's economic officials during his one-day stay in Moscow.
	   Axworthy and Ivanov discussed the problems in Iraq and Kosovo,
and Canada's upcoming two-year term on the U.N. Security Council.
	   ``This circumstance gives additional importance to Canada's
position in the international arena,'' Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin was quoted as saying by Interfax.
	   Axworthy left later Wednesday for a summit in Malaysia.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Peaceful resolution of the Kosovo
conflict is a long way off, the American head of a new foreign
mission to the Serbian province acknowledged Wednesday amid reports
of more violence.
	   NATO officials also voiced concern about continuing clashes in
Kosovo a month after an agreement aimed at halting the unrest.
	   U.S. diplomat William Walker, chief of a verification mission
still being put together, arrived in Pristina the day after three
Serb policemen were injured in an attack on their police station,
presumably by ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   The mission, organized by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, will send as many as 2,000 unarmed monitors
into the field to check whether Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic is complying with agreements he signed on ending the
hostilities.
	   Walker called it perhaps the last chance ``to avert an
irrational spiral of more violence'' in Kosovo, where the ethnic
Albanian majority seeks independence from Serb rule.
	   Serb forces in February launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists. Several hundred people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have
been killed and as many as 300,000 were driven from their homes.
	   The violence has continued past the Oct. 12 agreement by
Milosevic, under the threat of NATO airstrikes on his forces, to
sharply reduce the number of police and soldiers in Kosovo.
	   In the past week, at least two Serb policemen have been killed
and three injured, while six guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation
Army have died from police gunfire.
	   ``It is obvious that we have a long way to go from this
battlefield to the negotiating table,'' Walker said.
	   Western powers led by the United States believe the verification
mission will restore stability in Kosovo by having the unarmed
foreigners roaming the region to report on any violence or
violations of the agreements Milosevic reached with U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke and the OSCE.
	   Walker was unable to provide a firm date for launching the
mission, which will absorb a previous Kosovo observer mission that
started in July. He called it the most ambitious undertaking to
date of the 54-nation OSCE.
	   The OSCE's Permanent Council on Wednesday estimated costs for
the year-long mission at dlrs 200 million. The council, meeting in
Vienna, Austria, approved expenditures of dlrs 64 million for the
rest of 1998, with 1999 outlays to be decided later, spokeswoman
Melissa Fleming said.
	   Security for the verifiers depends on guarantees given by
Milosevic and the rebels, Walker said.
	   Foreign nations sending verifiers to Kosovo ``gambling with the
lives of their citizens that the overwhelming majority of people in
Kosovo want the violence to end,'' he said.
	   But there was little sign of abating violence Wednesday.
	   Belgrade's state-run Tanjug news agency reported that ethnic
Albanian guerrillas opened fire Wednesday on a Serb farmer and
three other men picking corn near Klina, 45 kilometers (28 miles)
west of Pristina. The report said the farmer returned fire and a
police patrol helped him repel the attackers. No injuries were
reported.
	   In Glogovac, police showed damaged walls at their station caused
by a rocket fired during an attack Tuesday night. Three policemen
were injured.
	   Police accuse the rebels of launching repeated attacks in recent
weeks to try to provoke a harsh response that could prompt world
leaders to order military attacks.
	   NATO officials fear that the recent incidents could lead to a
renewal of outright fighting in Kosovo.
	   ``There is a great deal of concern about the deteriorating
situation ... and the deaths that have occurred, and obviously we
condemn these incidents,'' a NATO official told reporters on
condition of anonymity after the weekly meeting of alliance
ambassadors in Brussels, Belgium.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Opposition parties lodged no-confidence
motions Wednesday against Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz after
allegations he interfered in the privatization of a bank and helped
a businessman linked to a mobster.
	   Yilmaz' minority government could go down if the the small,
center-left Republican Party, which usually gives him the majority
he needs in parliament, votes against him.
	   The leader of the Republicans, Deniz Baykal, urged Yilmaz to
resign. But the premier vowed Wednesday to stay on, saying he was
the victim of a conspiracy.
	   ``This is a plot and it can't be a reason for a resignation,''
Yilmaz said, adding that he intended to continue the ``struggle
against organized crime.''
	   Afterward, Baykal said the Republicans would support a
no-confidence motion.
	   The leader of the Democratic Turkey Party, Husamettin Cindoruk,
said his party might withdraw from the governing coalition. He said
the party would announce its decision Thursday.
	   The political turmoil sent the Istanbul stock market plunging
14.9 percent.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ With Roberto Baggio showing signs of rust Wednesday
in his return from a long injury absence and Brazil's Ronaldo held
out as a precaution, Internazionale of Milan could only muster a
1-1 comeback draw at third-division Castel di Sangro, but that was
good enough to sneak into the Italian Cup quarterfinals on a 2-1
aggregate.
	   Internazionale next faces defending titlist Lazio of Rome, in
what will be a rematch of last season's UEFA Cup final, won by
Inter. Lazio played a 1-1 draw at AC Milan on Wednesday to advance
on a 4-2 aggregate.
	   Elsewhere, Russian striker Igor Kolyvanov hit a penalty kick
with one minute left as Bologna rallied for a 2-1 win over
Sampdoria of Genoa, which finished the game with eight players on
the field, while Udinese defeated Vicenza 1-0. Bologna and Udinese
advanced, since both matchups' first legs had ended 0-0.
	   AC Parma settled for a 0-0 draw against Bari and qualified for
the quarterfinals on a 2-1 aggregate.
	   Juventus of Turin, which has won a record nine Italian Cups, was
locked in a 1-1 draw at lowly Venezia in a game headed to
supplemental time.
	   AS Roma hosts Atalanta of Bergamo Thursday night, while Serie A
leader Fiorentina advanced Tuesday by routing Lecce 4-0 _ with all
the goals in the second half _ to win 5-0 on aggregate.
	   At Castel di Sangro, the small-town club which upset Serie A
sides Perugia and Salernitana in earlier rounds of the competition
took a 1-0 lead in the 75th minute on striker Alberto Bernardi's
header off a corner kick. Inter pulled even just two minutes later
when Youri Djorkaeff, a member of France's World Cup champions,
connected on a penalty kick awarded for a foul on Nicola Ventola.
	   Baggio played 60 occasionally effective minutes and was replaced
by playmaker Andrea Pirlo. The 31-year-old Baggio had been
sidelined with an inflamed knee tendon since a Sept. 20 league
game.
	   Ronaldo returned last weekend from his own extended layoff due
to knee tendinitis and is expected to play in Sunday's Serie A game
against Sampdoria of Genoa.
	   Castel di Sangro played the final five minutes with 10 men,
because defender David Bianchini was expelled for dissent.
	   At Bologna, Kolyvanov hit the winner after Davide Fontolan was
fouled. Samp's players argued vehemently with the referee and two
were expelled, joining teammate Vincenzo Iacopino, who was sent off
in the 49th.
	   The visitors took the lead nine minutes into the game, when
Francesco Palmieri headed in Argentine playmaker Ariel Ortega's
free kick. After Iacopino was red carded, Bologna's veteran forward
Giuseppe Signori tied the score in the 66th. Bologna coach Carlo
Mazzone was expelled in the 26th for arguing with the referee.
	   At Vicenza, Argentine striker Roberto Carlos Sosa _ who tallied
the injury-time equalizer against Juventus last weekend in league
play _ was left unmarked in the 67th minute and slotted in
countryman Mauro Navas' cross.
	   At Milan, Chilean striker Marcelo Salas lobbed the ball over
German 'keeper Jens Lehmann to put Lazio ahead in the 41st minute,
and Maurizio Ganz leveled the score for the hosts off a breakaway
in the 55th.
	   The two-leg quarterfinals are scheduled for Dec. 2 and Jan. 27.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Pete Sampras took a wild card entry to
the Stockholm Open to bolster his top tennis ranking and instead
endangered it by losing an opening-round match to Australian Jason
Stoltenberg on Wednesday, 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 6-4.
	   ``What went wrong? That's not an easy question to answer,'' he
said afterward. ``I had some opportunities I didn't capitalize
on.... He (Stoltenberg) played some good tennis. I give him
credit.''
	   Sampras will lose 630 points from his No. 1 ranking. That's more
than the 605 that separate him from No. 2 Marcelo Rios, who this
week is playing a tournament in his home country Chile.
	   In a thrilling match that lasted 2 hours 16 minutes, Sampras
fended off seven match points in the final two games.
	   ``I thought it was at least 15,'' quipped a jubilant
Stoltenberg, world No. 29 and loser of his four previous matches
with Sampras. ``I thought it was slipping away at the end. I held
on.''
	   Sampras lost in the finals of the Paris Open last week to Briton
Greg Rusedski. He said that _ and his desire to finish a record
sixth straight year ranked No. 1 _ weighed on his mind.
	   ``I felt I needed the best chance possible to try and finish No.
1,'' he said. ``I must admit I'm a little bit exhausted.... I'm
going to try and get out tonight,'' and not wait for a Thursday
flight home to the United States.
	   Both players received a standing ovation from the Royal Tennis
Hall audience after the match.
	   In earlier matches, Britain's Tim Henman and Rusedski both
advanced.
	   Henman reached the quarterfinals with a straight-set victory
over Wayne Ferreira of South Africa, 7-6 (7-3) and 6-4.
	   He started fast, breaking Ferreira's serve in game two, but then
lost five of the next six games, and had to scramble to break
Ferreira's serve to force a tiebreak.
	   ``It was an up-and-down first set,'' Henman said. ``My serving
was erratic at that point.''
	   Rusedski demolished Tommy Haas, 6-1, 6-4, in a quick 52 minutes.
The German failed to hold his first four service games, winning
just two points along the way.
	   ``I couldn't be playing much better tennis if I tried,''
Rusedski said after the match. Asked if he had ever won every point
of an opponent's service game in an entire set, he joked, ``It must
be my new improved returns.''
	   Henman and Rusedski, ranked Nos. 10 and 11 in the world, are
trying to qualify for the last spots in the ATP Tour Championships
in Hanover, Germany, later this month. Sampras already is in.
	   Rusedski is on a roll. His victory over Sampras last week in
Paris was ``probably my greatest accomplishment in tennis, by
far.''
	   In other matches Wednesday, American Todd Martin defeated
Australia's hard-serving Wayne Arthurs, 6-4, 6-3, to join Henman in
the quarterfinals.
	   Arthurs, a 27-year-old doubles specialist from Adelaide, on
Tuesday upset tournament second seed and world No. 7 Karol Kucera
of Slovakia. He started sharp with three aces in his first game,
but the more experienced Martin broke his serve in game three of
each set, and wore him down.
	   Arthurs, ranked No. 168, notched at least one ace in every
service game except one, and had 15 overall.
	   Martin's play was business-like. He rarely fell behind in the
count, won the big points including service breaks early in each
set, and never lost his serve.

Cocaine-laden plane: a new stain on Colombia's military
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ The seizure in the United States of a
Colombian air force plane stocked with over a ton of cocaine is
another blot for a military already beleaguered by leftist rebels
and human rights investigations.
	   The incident is also an embarrassment for President Andres
Pastrana, who has assured the United States he will strengthen
Colombia's commitment against drug trafficking.
	   Colombia's air force commander resigned Tuesday after U.S.
customs authorities found 1,639 pounds (743 kilograms) of cocaine
in the cargo compartments of a Colombian air force C-130 Hercules
that landed Monday at Fort Lauderdale's international airport on a
weekly supply run to pick up military equipment.
	   Pastrana accepted the resignation of Gen. Jose Manuel Sandoval,
though no arrests or criminal charges have been announced.
	   U.S. and Colombian officials said the incident was unlikely to
affect relations, which improved dramatically after Pastrana took
office in August, replacing Ernesto Samper.
	   The United States revoked Samper's visa in 1996, convinced he
knowingly accepted dlrs 6 million in campaign contributions from
the Cali drug cartel. By contrast, U.S. officials hailed Pastrana's
election as a new opportunity for cooperation with the country that
supplies over 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the United States.
	   In Colombia, the incident was seen as the latest symptom of a
military in decay.
	   ``There has been a moral deteroriation of huge proportions with
the Colombian armed forces, '' said Javeriana University political
scientist Andres Franco. ``This deserves a more profound
discussion, much more than the rhetoric saying that heads should
roll.''
	   The discovery of cocaine in the air force plane could be the
just a small fraction of the criminal activity within the Colombian
security forces. ``If this is what we know, what don't we know?''
he said.
	   Two weeks ago, news leaked that a former army colonel who headed
a now-disbanded army intelligence unit was wanted for planning the
1995 assassination of a top conservative leader. Four soldiers are
already under arrest in the killing of Alvaro Gomez.
	   Numerous other investigations have linked the army to Colombia's
feared paramilitary groups _ right-wing death squads who massacre
civilians suspected of collaborating with rebels.
	   Military leaders are also struggling to explain their faltering
performance against the rebels, who now control about one-third of
the country. The guerrillas, who held a remote state capital for
three days last month, have been piling up military victories since
1996 and now hold nearly 300 soldiers and police prisoner.
	   The armed forces chief, Gen. Fernando Tapias, was grilled in
Congress on Tuesday by lawmakers demanding explanations for both
the air force incident and the army's mounting losses.
	   This week's scandal isn't the first implicating Colombia's
12,000-member air force in drug trafficking.
	   In the most embarrassing incident, Colombian authorities found 8
pounds (3.6 kilograms) of heroin in the nose and luggage
compartment of then-President Ernesto Samper's official airplane.
Three former air force mechanics were convicted last week of
stashing the drugs on the plane, which was getting ready to take
Samper to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The following is the official text of the Israeli government's
decision to approve the Wye River Memorandum peace accord signed
with the Palestinians at the White House on October 23.
	   ___
	   1. The Israeli government approves the Wye River Memorandum
signed in Washington on October 23, 1998, (henceforth ``the
Agreement'') and will present it to the Knesset for approval.
	   2. a) The implementation of all the Palestinian obligations
throughout all phases of the agreement is a condition for the
implementation of the Israeli obligations under the agreement
according to the timetable set in it.
	   b) The implementation of each phase of the Further Redeployments
mentioned in the agreement will be brought before the Israeli
government for prior discussion and approval.
	   3. a) The government approves the map of the first phase of the
Further Redeployment as presented to the government. Approval of
the maps of the additional phases of the Further Redeployment shall
be given in the ministerial committee mentioned below, which shall
decide the matter with the government's consent.
	   b) In accordance with Paragraph 36(A)(6) of the Basic Law, the
prime minister has appointed a ministerial committee consisting of
the minister of defense, chairman; the minister of foreign affairs;
the minister of education, culture and sport; the minister of
immigrant absorption; and the minister for public security.
	   c) Government ministers may view the maps of each phase of the
Further Redeployment at the government secretariat as the date of
its implementation approaches and they may appear before the
committee and express their views.
	   d) The minister of defense will determine the work agenda of the
Committee.
	   4. a) Since the signing of the agreement, official Palestinian
declarations regarding the PLO Covenant have substantively
contradicted the agreement.
	   b) The agreement decrees a decision at the Palestinian National
Council to confirm the Palestinian Authority Chairman's statement
in his letter to President Clinton regarding the cancellation of
the Palestinian Covenant articles which contravene the PLO's
commitment to denounce terrorism, recognize Israel and live
peacefully with Israel.
	   c) In light of the above, the fulfillment of Israel's commitment
according to the agreement is conditioned on a properly conducted
vote at the Palestinian National Council.
	   5. a) Israel persists in its demand for the transfer of suspects
and wanted fugitives according to the agreement.
	   b) As for the list of 30 suspects, the government notes the
Prime Minister's statement, according to which: The arrest of the
30 suspects is included in the Working Plan for Combating
Terrorism, so that one third will be arrested at each phase of the
12 weeks, and the U.S. has promised Israeli that this will be
implemented. The U.S. has also committed to Israel that there will
be special arrangement to prevent a ``revolving door'' policy in
relation to these prisoners, and that if nevertheless a release of
these prisoners will occur, it will be considered a violation of
the agreement.
	   6. As to the third Further Redeployment, in so far as Israel,
according to its own judgment, will make a decision on it, the
scope of the redeployment will not exceed the total of one percent
in all categories.
	   7. In the negotiations on Judea, Samaria and the Gaza District,
the government will preserve the vital national interests of the
State of Israel, as affirmed in the government's decision of
January 14, 1998. These include security areas, the areas around
Jerusalem, the areas of Jewish settlement, infrastructure
interests, water sources, military and security locations, the
areas around north-south and west-east transportation arteries, and
historic sites of the Jewish people.
	   8. The government asserts that a unilateral declaration by the
Palestinian Authority on the establishment of a Palestinian state,
prior to the achievement of a final status agreement would
constitute a substantive and fundamental violation of the Interim
Agreement. In the event of such a violation, the government would
consider itself entitled to take all necessary steps, including the
application of Israeli rule, law and administration to settlement
areas and security areas in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza, as it sees
fit. Israel reiterates its position, in accordance with the
agreement with the PA, that the final status must be the result of
free negotiations between the parties without the implementation of
unilateral steps which will change the status of the area.
	   9. The government will continue to pursue its policy of
strengthening and developing the communities in Judea, Samaria, and
the Gaza Strip, on the basis of a multi-annual plan.
	   10. The government will see to it that security roads will be
built in Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza District.
	   11. The government expresses its hope that there will be
complete compliance with the provisions of the Wye River
Memorandum, and that this agreement will contribute to the
advancement of peace.

Stoltenberg upsets Sampras
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Jason Stoltenberg scored a stunning
victory in the first round of the Stockholm Open on Wednesday,
upsetting top-ranked Pete Sampras 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 6-4.
	   Stoltenberg, an Australian ranked 29th who had lost all four
previous matches to Sampras, needed seven match points before
wrapping up the victory in 2 hours, 14 minutes.
	   ``I thought it was at least 15,'' Stoltenberg said. ``I thought
it was slipping away at the end. I held on.''
	   Sampras' early exit could jeopardize his chances of finishing
the season as world No. 1 for a record sixth consecutive year.
Marcelo Rios, playing a clay court tournament in his native Chile
this week, could overtake him.
	   Earlier, Britain's Tim Henman advanced to the quarterfinals with
a straight-sets victory over Wayne Ferreira of South Africa.
	   Henman's countryman, Greg Rusedski, was more convincing with a
52-minute victory over Tommy Haas, 6-1, 6-4.
	   ``I couldn't be playing much better tennis if I tried,'' said
Rusedski, who defeated Sampras in the finals of the Paris Open last
weekend. ``It must be my new improved returns.''
	   Henman was much more evenly matched. He started fast, then
struggled before breaking Ferreira's serve to force a tiebreak. He
won 7-6 (7-3), 6-4.
	   ``It was an up-and-down first set,'' Henman said. ``My serving
was erratic at that point.''
	   Henman and Rusedski, ranked Nos. 10 and 11 in the world, are
trying to qualify for the last spots in the ATP Tour Championships
in Hanover, Germany, later this month. Sampras is already in that
event.
	   ``I think I've got to get to the finals,'' Rusedski said. ``I'm
just thinking about my tennis and everything else will take care of
itself.... If it works, it works. If it doesn't, it doesn't.''
	   Rusedski is on a roll. He called last week's victory over
Sampras, ``probably my greatest accomplishment in tennis, by far.''
	   In other matches Wednesday, American Todd Martin defeated
Australia's hard-serving Wayne Arthurs, 6-4, 6-3, to join Henman in
the quarterfinals.
	   Arthurs, a 27-year-old doubles specialist, had upset second seed
and world No. 7 Karol Kucera of Slovakia on Tuesday.

Egypt arrests train officials for negligence in crash that killed
</HEADLINE>
47 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police on Wednesday arrested a deputy train
driver and two railway officials accused of negligence that led to
a train crash that killed 47 people last month, officials said.
	   The arrest came one day after the release of a report that said
the accident, in which a train flew off its tracks and smashed into
a town square in the Nile Delta, was caused by human error.
	   The report said the train was speeding and that brakes were
faulty or missing when it crashed in Kafr el-Dawar, 30 kilometers
(20 miles) southeast of the port city of Alexandria.
	   Police arrested the train's assistant driver, Hosni Mohammed
Abdel-Latif, and two railway officials in the town, Hamdi Ibrahim
Faqr and Mohammed Sayed Ibrahim, police officials said.
	   Following the accident, the government suspended five top
railway officials, including the national head of railways and the
managers in the province where the accident occurred.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council held an
emergency meeting on Iraq Wednesday while Secretary-General Kofi
Annan appealed to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to immediately resume
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Russia requested the council meeting after 233 U.N. personnel
were pulled out of Iraq because of the possibility of airstrikes by
the United States to compel Baghdad to permit the U.N.-mandated
inspections that monitor Iraq for weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Security Council is sharply divided over the use of force
against Iraq. The United States and Britain maintain that they can
take military action, based on previous U.N. resolutions. Russia
and China insist that fresh council approval is needed.
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said that while diplomacy
remains active, a military solution is now ``a serious option.''
	   But Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said ``the use of force is
fraught with very serious consequences not only for the U.N.
ability to continue to monitor inside Iraq but also for the
stability in the region and for the Middle East in general.''
	   Moscow has been in contact with Baghdad trying to get the Iraqis
to resume cooperation and resolve the situation peacefully, which
he stressed was the only real solution.
	   Lavrov demanded to know why the decision to withdraw U.N.
personnel was made without informing the council _ even in the
middle of the night.
	   ``It is an emergency. It is a crisis,'' he said.

Cruyff criticism adds to pressure on Van Gaal's job as Barcelona
</HEADLINE>
coach &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Venerated former FC Barcelona coach Johan
Cruyff on Wednesday added his weight to the pressure bearing down
on fellow Dutchman and current coach of the struggling Spanish
soccer giant Louis Van Gaal.
	   Cruyff told reporters in this northeastern city ``I do not enjoy
the football played by Barcelona at the moment, which means I feel
the same as the majority of the fans,'' the state-owned news agency
EFE reported.
	   Van Gaal's disciplined style is viewed as a colorless sequel to
the flair of the Cruyff years, with stars such as Romario and
Michael Laudrup, or the spectacular season with Ronaldo under
Cruyff's successor, Bobby Robson.
	   But matters of style are easier to forgive than bad results, and
Barcelona is currently reeling from three consecutive defeats.
	   The last came Tuesday with a 2-0 loss in a friendly against
Swedish team Helsingborgs with Barcelona still suffering from
losing 2-1 to Oviedo at its weekend Spanish league game.
	   That result, leaving Barcelona at No. 4 in the domestic table,
came hot on the heals of a 2-1 drubbing by Bayern Munich that
raised the specter of elimination from the prized European
Champions League.
	   According to Cruyff, such failures were in part due to reliance
on a strategy of counterattack, a failure to get the best out of
quality players by placing them in inappropriate positions on the
field, and lack of knowledge about the nature of the club.
	   This last, the former Dutch star said, was demonstrated by Van
Gaal's dependence on foreign players, particularly the inclusion of
six Dutchmen in his side.
	   Although Barcelona won last season's league and King's Cup,
traditional rival Real Madrid stole the limelight by claiming a
record seventh European Champions Cup.
	   Now Barcelona fans face the possibility of Madrid clinching an
eighth Champions Cup in Barcelona's very own Camp Nou, after the
stadium was chosen as the site for the next final.
	   Although Van Gaal had admitted the recent results are
disappointing, he has stressed he has the backing of club chairman
Jose Luis Nunez, something that Cruyff finds far from convincing.
	   ``When the chairman comes out to support you, you should start
getting nervous,'' he said.
	   This weekend, Van Gaal and Barcelona face struggling Tenerife in
the Spanish league before going on to host Manchester United in a
decisive Champions League bout.
	   These games could also be decisive for Van Gaal's future at
Barcelona.
	   According to Cruyff his job in the end ``will depend on results
and the fans,'' although some appear to have ruled out redemption.
	   Barcelona-based daily El Mundo Deportivo covered its front page
on Wednesday with a picture of a bank check made out to Van Gaal
for 800 million pesetas (dlrs 5.7 million).
	   ``This is how much its would cost to sack Van Gaal,'' read the
headline.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Considered one of the Third World's most
feared armies before the Gulf War, Iraq's military suffered a
humiliating _ and quick _ defeat in 1991. Today, it is far leaner
but less powerful, less equipped and less of a threat.
	   About 375,000 men serve in the army, significantly fewer than
the 500,000 mobilized during the Gulf War. But sanctions and a lack
of money and spare parts have left much of the army in shambles,
even though its smaller size means it requires less upkeep.
	   ``It's quite a mess,'' said Peter Felstead, editor of Jane's
Intelligence Review in London. ``I don't think there's much of a
conventional threat there.''
	   The one exception is the Republican Guard _ but it's a qualified
exception. Long considered the key to Saddam Hussein's power, the
elite unit performed poorly in the Gulf War, only to regroup in the
weeks after the war to save Saddam by crushing a Kurdish rebellion
in the north and a Shiite Muslim revolt in the south.
	   By far the best equipped and best paid, the Republican Guard has
seven or eight divisions, although estimates differ on total
manpower. Of Iraq's total tank force of 2,000 _ far fewer than the
5,500 it had before the Gulf War _ 800 are believed to be in its
hands, including 500 high-quality T-72s.
	   It is thought as well to have 1,000 armored fighting vehicles
and 500 artillery pieces, Felstead said.
	   While Iraq's military is much scaled back from its pre-Gulf War
strength, it remains larger than the forces of its small neighbors.
U.S. officials also have expressed fears that it would only take
weeks for Iraq to reconstitute its chemical and biological weapons
programs if U.N. arms monitoring stopped.
	   ``If the inspectors are not permitted to visit suspect sites or
monitor compliance at known production facilities, they may as well
be in Baltimore, not Baghdad,'' U.S. President Bill Clinton said.
``That would open a window of opportunity for Iraq to rebuild its
arsenal of weapons and delivery systems in months _ I say again, in
months _ not years.''
	   Former weapons inspectors have said that Iraq might be able to
quickly mix small batches of chemical and biological weapons if it
restarted the programs. The amount of poisons would be small but
would give Iraq a terror weapon to intimidate its neighbors.
	   In any confrontation with the United States or Iraq's neighbors,
however, Baghdad's conventional forces would be the key.
	   Since the war, the government has set up a special guard under
the command of one of Saddam's sons, Qusai. Thought to have 15,000
men, the battalions are well-armed and believed to be extremely
loyal.
	   ``He is well-protected by these elite units,'' said Sean Boyne,
a military analyst in Ireland. ``The only way to get to him would
be to get inside one of their more trusted units.''
	   Like everything else in Iraq, the military has wrestled, usually
unsuccessfully, with the impact of eight years of U.N. sanctions _
particularly in securing spare parts for aging armaments.
	   Nevertheless, Iraq still produces parts for the T-72 tank, small
arms like AK-47s, ammunition, some artillery and rocket-launchers
and artillery shells, Boyne said. Other pieces are kept going by
smuggling in parts or cannibalizing other equipment, he said.
	   In addition to the special guard, Iraq has spent many of its
scarce resources on upgrading its air defense against bombing and
cruise missile attacks, most of it Soviet-designed.
	   But while advanced for the Third World, it is not considered a
match for U.S. forces, especially radar-evading, stealth aircraft
or cruise missiles.
	   The rest of Iraq's military poses little threat.
	   The army relies on conscripts whose loyalty is doubtful. The 17
or so divisions have nearly 2,000 pieces of artillery and a
significant number of anti-tank weapons. But the equipment is
outdated and often unserviceable.
	   Iraq's air force once boasted 700 aircraft. About 350 remain,
but only about half are fit to fly, military analysts say. A lack
of parts keeps many of the best aircraft, such as the MiG-29s, on
the ground.
	   ``I think they're unlikely to put them up in the air because
they're just going to be shot down,'' Felstead said.
	   The military has about 500 helicopters as well, but again, a
lack of spare parts makes them largely ineffective except in
operations against guerrillas fighting in the north and south.
	   In any last-ditch effort to keep power, the government might
call on the Fedayeen Saddam, a paramilitary force of 40,000 run by
Saddam's eldest son, Odai. The ruling Baath Party's 1 million
members are armed as well, with light weapons, rifles and grenades.

U.N. says withdrawal of staff will slow food program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The evacuation of U.N. workers will slow
down the distribution of relief supplies in government-controlled
areas, Iraq's top U.N. humanitarian official said Wednesday.
	   But Hans von Sponeck, who assumed his post Monday, said it would
not end the U.N.-monitored oil-for-food program.
	   He spoke after the United Nations evacuated all of its weapons
inspectors and about 130 of its 450 humanitarian aid workers in
Iraq. A further 40 aid workers are expected to leave on Thursday.
	   The withdrawals came amid increased fears of a U.S. military
strike aimed at forcing Iraq to rescind its decision to end
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   ``Our capacity is much reduced,'' von Sponeck said. ``But
whatever capacity we have we will utilize for our humanitarian
program.''
	   The oil-for-food deal is an exemption from U.N. trade sanctions
imposed against Iraq following Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
It is aimed at relieving civilian suffering caused by the sweeping
economic sanctions.
	   Iraq must fully cooperate with the weapons monitors before the
U.N. sanctions can be lifted.
	   The latest six-month phase allows Baghdad to export up to dlrs
5.2 billion in oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies.
	   In government-controlled areas, U.N. observers check that the
Iraqis equitably distribute humanitarian supplies to civilians.
	   Some 230 U.N. workers distribute supplies in northern Iraq,
which is administered by Kurdish rebels. Those monitors are not
being withdrawn.
	   Von Sponeck said a large number of humanitarian aid workers will
remain in Iraq to administer the oil-for-food program.
	   The United Nations had no intention of ending the deal, von
Sponeck said.
	   ``How can we just drop it?'' he asked. ``We owe it to the Iraqi
people.''

Study: Bacterium could be Alzheimer's risk

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Infection of a person's brain cells by a type
of bacteria commonly found in the sinuses and lungs may raise the
risk of Alzheimer's disease late in life, researchers suggested
Wednesday.
	   Scientists who examined brain tissue of Alzheimer's patients
after they died found a bacterium called Chlamydia pneumoniae had
gotten into cells in regions where Alzheimer's damage is detected.
	   The presence of the bacterium was unexpected, because it meant
the germ had to penetrate a protective barrier.
	   Brian J. Balin, a researcher at Allegheny University of the
Health Sciences in Philadelphia, presented the findings at a
meeting in Los Angeles of the Society for Neuroscience.
	   A top Alzheimer's expert called the findings exciting.
	   ``I think that it's something that's really worth taking
seriously because of the issue of what's triggering the
degeneration process,'' said Zaven Khachaturian, a consultant to
the Alzheimer's Association and former director of the Office of
Alzheimer's Disease Research at the National Institutes of Health
in Washington.
	   Khachaturian said it will be important to find out whether the
bacteria set the stage for Alzheimer's, or whether Alzheimer's
damaged the brain and let the bacteria in.
	   Balin's team found segments of the bacterium's DNA in brain
samples of 17 of the 19 Alzheimer's patients he analyzed.
Conversely, 18 of 19 brain samples from people without Alzheimer's
showed no signs of the organism.
	   Cells infected by the bacterium make chemicals to fend off the
infection. Those inflammatory chemicals, called cytokines, can in
turn damage surrounding nerve cells.
	   The same bacterium has been detected in the fatty plaques that
clog heart arteries, though researchers do not yet know if it is
responsible for the clogging.
	   Researchers have also found a correlation between late-onset
Alzheimer's and infection with herpes simplex virus type 1.

Economy shuts down as national strike takes hold in Zimbabwe

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Police fired tear gas to disperse
demonstrators in an eastern border city on Wednesday during a
one-day national strike to protest price increases. At least one
person was killed in the unrest.
	   State radio said police clashed with about 25,000 strikers in
townships around Mutare, 270 kilometers (168 miles) east of Harare
on the border with Mozambique.
	   Police also fired tear gas to disperse strikers in the farming
center of Marondera, 75 kilometers (45 miles) east of Harare, and
at Bindura, a mining and agricultural town 80 kilometers (50 miles)
northeast of the capital, witnesses and state television said.
	   The Commercial Farmers' Union, representing mostly white
farmers, confirmed an elderly white woman was killed at her farm
near Marondera when unknown assailants attacked her property
earlier Wednesday.
	   Sylvia Jackson, who was in her seventies, had been an outspoken
critic of government plans to nationalize white-owned land for
handing over to landless blacks, said David Hasluck, a director of
the farmers' union.
	   Tensions have mounted in recent days over economic hardships
blamed on the government's alleged mismanagement of the economy,
including land seizures that have scared off foreign investors.
	   Wednesday's national strike was called by the main labor
federation.
	   Morgan Tsvangirai, secretary-general of the Confederation of
Trade Unions, said he was called to a meeting Wednesday with
government officials but on arrival at government offices he was
told the talks were called off.
	   Officials gave no reason for the postponement.
	   ``It seems they are immune to pressure,'' Tsvangirai said in a
telephone interview.
	   He said the federation was scheduled to meet with employers'
representatives and government officials on Thursday as part of
continuing talks on economic policies.
	   Tsvangirai said the labor group estimated 90 percent of workers
stayed off the job Wednesday.
	   State radio said Wednesday most provincial centers, including
the second city of Bulawayo, were brought to a standstill by the
national strike.
	   In Harare, most factories and businesses shut down and police
and army troops, backed by helicopters, patrolled township suburbs
around the capital, where riots erupted last Wednesday because of a
67 percent rise in gasoline prices.
	   It looked like a Sunday in downtown Harare, with light traffic
and most government offices, banks and stores closed.
	   ``It's like an anti-government public holiday,'' said Mathias
Wedza, a worker at one of a few fast food outlets that remained
open in Harare.
	   The gasoline increase has pushed up prices of food and essential
goods by a third, with latest increases of 20 percent on sugar and
cooking oil hitting Tuesday.
	   The government blames the gasoline increases on an 80 percent
slide in the value of the Zimbabwe currency against the U.S. dollar
in the past year.
	   The labor federation, representing 90 percent of organized labor
groups, accuses the government of economic mismanagement,
corruption and using resources badly needed at home to deploy 6,000
Zimbabwe troops to support Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   Unrest over deteriorating economic conditions is posing the most
serious threat yet to Mugabe's hold on power.
	   Mugabe, 74, has been the only black leader since 1980, when he
led the former British colony of Rhodesia to independence.

U.S. trade secretary in Jordan for talks

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ U.S. Trade Secretary William Daley arrived
in Jordan Wednesday at the start of a Middle East tour to promote
closer economic ties.
	   Daley met with Crown Prince Hassan to discuss the possibilities
of increasing trade with Jordan, Daley's Jordanian counterpart,
Mohammed Saleh Hourani, said.
	   On Thursday, Daley will meet with Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh
and inspect facilities at a joint Jordanian-Israeli trade zone that
exports tax-free goods to the United States, Hourani said.
	   He said Jordan will ask Daley to intercede with Israel to ease
restrictions on Jordanian trade with the Palestinian territories.
Jordan says stringent security measures and searches at border
crossings hamper trade with the West Bank.
	   Preparations are under way for Daley to chair a meeting this
week for trade ministers from Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian
territories, Hourani said. The date and venue has not been decided,
he added.
	   Daley is also expected to visit Israel, the Palestinian
territories, Lebanon and Egypt.

Sampras loses first round match to Stoltenberg

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Pete Sampras took a wild-card entry to
the Stockholm Open to bolster his top tennis ranking but it
backfired on Wednesday when he lost an opening-round match to
Australian Jason Stoltenberg, 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 6-4.
	   ``What went wrong? That's not an easy question to answer,''
Sampras said afterward. ``I had some opportunities I didn't
capitalize on. He (Stoltenberg) played some good tennis. I give him
credit.''
	   Sampras will lose 630 points from his No. 1 ranking. That's more
than the 605 that separate him from No. 2 Marcelo Rios, who this
week is playing a tournament in his home country Chile.
	   In a thrilling match that lasted 2 hours, 16 minutes, Sampras
fended off seven match points in the final two games.
	   ``I thought it was at least 15,'' quipped a jubilant
Stoltenberg, No. 29 in the world and loser of his four previous
matches with Sampras. ``I thought it was slipping away at the end.
I held on.''
	   Sampras said his loss in the finals of the Paris Open last week
to Briton Greg Rusedski and his desire to finish a record sixth
straight year ranked No. 1 weighed on his mind.
	   ``I felt I needed the best chance possible to try and finish No.
1,'' he said. ``I must admit I'm a little bit exhausted ... I'm
going to try and get out tonight,'' and not wait for a Thursday
flight home to the United States.
	   Both players received a standing ovation from the Royal Tennis
Hall audience after the match.
	   In earlier matches, Britain's Tim Henman and Rusedski both
advanced.
	   Henman reached the quarterfinals with a straight-sets victory
over Wayne Ferreira of South Africa, 7-6 (7-3) and 6-4.
	   After breaking Ferreira's serve early, Henman lost five of the
next six games, and had to scramble to break Ferreira's serve and
force a tiebreak.
	   ``It was an up-and-down first set,'' Henman said. ``My serving
was erratic at that point.''
	   Rusedski defeated Tommy Haas, 6-1, 6-4, in 52 minutes.
	   ``I couldn't be playing much better tennis if I tried,''
Rusedski said after the match.
	   Henman and Rusedski, ranked Nos. 10 and 11 in the world, are
trying to qualify for the last spots in the ATP Tour Championships
in Hanover, Germany, later this month. Sampras already is in.
	   Rusedski is on a roll. He called his victory over Sampras last
week in Paris ``probably my greatest accomplishment in tennis, by
far.''
	   In other matches Wednesday, American Todd Martin defeated
Australia's hard-serving Wayne Arthurs, 6-4, 6-3, to join Henman in
the quarterfinals.
	   Arthurs, a 27-year-old doubles specialist, had upset
second-seeded Karol Kucera of Slovakia, No. 7 in the world, on
Tuesday.

Honduran schools start over after Mitch
</HEADLINE>

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Maria Carmen Rodriguez daubed at
the black muck on the 1997 class photo, saved from the rubble that
was once a school. The students were smiling. ``Happy Vacation''
was written in Spanish on the blackboard.
	   ``Happy times,'' the principal said, her voice a whisper. ``Now
we have lost everything.''
	   After 121 years, the Francisca Reyes school for girls is no
more. Hurricane Mitch and the furious waters of the Rio Grande
Choluteca carried most of it away.
	   The scene is similar in towns and villages across this Central
American country. The storm, which killed an estimated 10,000
people, also wiped out one-fourth of Honduras' schools, leaving
education in check and the future in doubt.
	   In the capital Tegucigalpa, the flood waters rose to the third
floor of the riverside Education Ministry building, destroying
computers and wiping out school records.
	   ``The entire educational history of the country was lost,'' said
Carmen Siri, an education specialist with the United Nations
Development Program in Honduras.
	   The Education Ministry canceled the rest of the school year,
sending children home and teachers to distribute medicine, take
census and help clean the streets.
	   Minister Jose Ramon Calix Figueroa said the decision was mostly
for safety and health concerns. But there's a more practical
reason: most of the schools are being used as temporary shelters
for the homeless.
	   Nearly 2 million people were evacuated from their homes when
Mitch hit, and relocating them costs money that Honduras doesn't
have.
	   With no school and no records, the ministry is deciding what to
do about students. What grades do they get? Who passes and who
fails?
	   Calix Figueroa said most schools will use the shortened year as
a base, and kids who flunk will get another chance to pass at a
make-up exam. Where schools and records were destroyed, teachers
will try to reconstruct the student records from memory.
	   Just rebuilding the schools will cost at least dlrs 35 million,
the minister said, and he doesn't know where it will come from. The
government is negotiating with U.S. AID, the World Bank and the
Inter-American Development Bank, among other lenders.
	   ``So far, we haven't got a cent,'' he said.
	   The task is daunting.
	   At the Alvaro Contreras grade school, where 1,500 children
studied barely two weeks ago, twisted iron dangles from concrete
pillars, snapped in half by Mitch's rage. An uprooted pine tree
lies on the basketball court, where the flood waters tore the rim
from the backboard. Scavengers pick through trash covering a
classroom floor.
	   ``This all will be rebuilt, but not here,'' Calix Figueroa said.
	   The kindergarten Mundo Maravilloso _ Wonderful World in Spanish
_ was luckier. It was built up the hill, and the river only came up
to the windowsill.
	   ``It was a terrible shock,'' said principal Mirna Ruth Flores.
``The water broke down the door and took out all the desks.''
	   Behind her, a brigade of 36 medical school students use picks
and shovels to scrape up the muck and debris and load it into
wheelbarrows. They also have no classes, and the National
Autonomous University is a shelter for 6,000.
	   The younger students will help relief efforts until Nov. 24 and
in return receive 40 hours of credit for community service. Older
students are put into medical brigades.
	   Ena Patricia Sevilla, a fifth-year student, pauses after taking
out a load. Her white sneakers and red rubber gloves are black with
the foul-smelling gunk, but she is smiling.
	   ``Everyone must work. We can't just study while people need
help,'' she said. ``It's time to rebuild our country.''

Chilean accused of human rights abuses leaves UN post, but
</HEADLINE>
promoted &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A Chilean general accused of human rights
abuses during the Pinochet dictatorship will leave his U.N. post
within a month to return to the Chilean army _ with a promotion.
	   The international organization Human Rights Watch, which had
protested Brig. Gen. Sergio Espinoza Davies' position as chief of
the U.N. military observer mission in India and Pakistan, welcomed
his departure but said his promotion to major general showed the
weakness of Chile's young democracy.
	   Chile informed the United Nations of its decision in a letter
Tuesday. Without mentioning the human rights allegations, Chile
said Espinoza would become inspector general of the Chilean army by
Dec. 15 _ an important but largely administrative position that
places Espinoza as the army's fifth-ranked general.
	   The Espinoza case, first brought to light two months ago, comes
amid increased international attention to the abuses carried out by
the government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who ruled Chile after his
1973 coup until he relinquished power in 1990.
	   Over 3,000 people were killed for political reasons during the
Pinochet regime _ including 1,100 who disappeared after his
security agents detained them, according to a report by the
civilian government that succeeded him. Thousands more were
tortured, forced into exile, or both.
	   A Spanish judge wants to try Pinochet on charges of genocide,
torture and kidnapping. A tribunal in Britain, where Pinochet was
taken into custody, is hearing an appeal of a High Court decision
to quash the Spanish arrest warrant on grounds that Pinochet is
immune from prosecution as a former head of state.
	   Before Pinochet's arrest warrant had been issued, however, Human
Rights Watch had urged the United Nations to remove Espinoza from
office for having served on Pinochet's infamous war tribunals,
which were found to have been used to justify illegal executions
during the regime.
	   In a letter last month to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the
organization said Espinoza's documented participation ``in the
worst human rights abuses in his home country'' makes him unfit to
remain in charge of the U.N. mission.
	   Espinoza has denied the accusations.
	   The United Nations, which had asked Chile for clarification on
Espinoza's past allegations surfaced, had no comment, spokesman
Fred Eckhard said Wednesday. Eckhard had noted when the allegations
first surfaced that the United Nations doesn't conduct background
checks on people volunteered by U.N. member states to serve on U.N.
missions.
	   Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the Americas division of Human
Rights Watch, welcomed the decision to remove Espinoza as an
important precedent for the United Nations but said the decision to
promote him was unfortunate.
	   ``It's not only a compromise of a matter of principle, it
weakens the authority of the civilian government over the
military,'' he said in a phone interview from Washington.
	   Vivanco, who met last week in Santiago with Chile's defense and
foreign ministers over the Pinochet and Espinoza cases, called for
the United Nations and governments like Chile's to better screen
applicants for foreign diplomatic postings.
	   ``It is really a tremendous risk and quite irresponsible to do
business as usual with these officers,'' he said.

``Striker'' Ferrara gives Juve extra-time win over upset-minded
</HEADLINE>
Venezia &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with Venezia-Juventus. TRIMS. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Ciro Ferrara, a defender just back from 10 months
off with a broken leg, filled in as a forward and scored in
supplemental time Wednesday night to allow injury-riddled Juventus
of Turin to rally for a dramatic 2-2 draw at upset-minded Venezia
and advance to the Italian Cup quarterfinals on the away goals
rule.
	   The first-leg match two weeks ago ended 1-1 and that was the
score after 90 minutes at Venice Wednesday. The hosts, currently
last in the Italian League standings, moved ahead 1-0 with three
minutes left in regulation on a close-range goal by Brazilian
striker Tuta, who was making his debut for the club before a crowd
of 11,000 at Penzo Stadium.
	   Juventus, owner of a record nine Italian Cup titles, leveled a
minute later on Uruguayan striker Daniel Fonseca's penalty kick.
	   In supplemental time, Venezia again went ahead, as captain
Gianluca Luppi connected on a penalty kick in the 107th minute.
This time Juve needed two minutes to pull even, when Ferrara sent a
rising blast into the net from the edge of the penalty area.
	   Ferrara _ who has been used sparingly lately as he works back
into form following a tibia fracture _ and Croat defender Igor
Tudor both played significant minutes up front for Juve. The club
lost star striker Alessandro Del Piero to knee ligament damage last
weekend and saw French playmaker Zinedine Zidane limp off in the
65th minute after entering the game as a halftime substitute.
	   Juve was not the only big club to struggle with an unheralded
opponent Wednesday.
	   With Roberto Baggio showing signs of rust and Brazil's Ronaldo
held out as a precaution, Internazionale of Milan could only muster
a 1-1 comeback draw at third-division Castel di Sangro, but that
was good enough to sneak into the quarterfinals on a 2-1 aggregate.
	   Internazionale next faces defending titlist Lazio of Rome, in
what will be a rematch of last season's UEFA Cup final, won by
Inter. Lazio played a 1-1 draw at AC Milan on Wednesday to advance
on a 4-2 aggregate.
	   Elsewhere, Russian striker Igor Kolyvanov hit a penalty kick
with one minute left as Bologna rallied for a 2-1 win over
Sampdoria of Genoa, which finished the game with eight players on
the field, while Udinese defeated Vicenza 1-0. Bologna and Udinese
advanced, since both matchups' first legs had ended 0-0.
	   AC Parma settled for a 0-0 draw against Bari and qualified for
the quarterfinals on a 2-1 aggregate.
	   Juventus will play Bologna and Udinese faces Parma in the
two-leg quarterfinals, slated for Dec. 2 and Jan. 27.
	   AS Roma hosts Atalanta of Bergamo Thursday night for the right
to face Serie A leader Fiorentina, which advanced Tuesday by
routing Lecce 4-0 to win 5-0 on aggregate.
	   At Castel di Sangro, the small-town club which upset Serie A
sides Perugia and Salernitana in earlier rounds of the competition
took a 1-0 lead in the 75th minute on striker Alberto Bernardi's
header off a corner kick. Inter pulled even just two minutes later
when Youri Djorkaeff, a member of France's World Cup champions,
connected on a penalty kick awarded for a foul on Nicola Ventola.
	   Baggio played 60 occasionally effective minutes and was replaced
by playmaker Andrea Pirlo. The 31-year-old Baggio had been
sidelined with an inflamed knee tendon since a Sept. 20 league
game.
	   At Bologna, Kolyvanov hit the winner after Davide Fontolan was
fouled. Samp's players argued vehemently with the referee and two
were expelled, joining teammate Vincenzo Iacopino, who was sent off
in the 49th. Francesco Palmieri scored for Samp in the ninth
minute, while veteran Giuseppe Signori tied the score in the 66th.
	   At Vicenza, Argentine striker Roberto Carlos Sosa was left
unmarked in the 67th minute and slotted in countryman Mauro Navas'
cross.

Ajax, Feyenoord win but still trail Heerenveen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax edged Roda JC Kerkrade 2-1
Wednesday while Feyenoord subdued MVV Maastricht 3-1, keeping the
Netherlands' two oldest rivals well in the championship race.
	   But SC Heerenveen (9-1-3) seemed as surprised as anyone else to
continue its four-day run atop the league, for the first time in
its 78-year history.
	   The small Frisian club owed its 2-1 victory over fourth-placed
FC Twente Enschede to an injury-time winner from Boudewijn
Pahlplatz, who started his career at Twente.
	   Heerenveen's 28 points put it one ahead of Ajax and two better
than Feyenoord, which has played two games fewer.
	   Ajax, missing six injured players but grateful for the return of
captain and guiding force Danny Blind, started confidently.
	   Brazilian Wamberto beat the offside trap for 1-0 and Richard
Witschge set up Benni Mccarthy for the second before Peter van
Houdt pulled one back for Roda.
	   Frank de Boer and Roda's Ramon van Haaren both had to be
substituted after a clash of heads.
	   In Maastricht Bert Konterman rose to knock in a corner after
half an hour for a dominant Feyenoord and Argentinian Julio Ricardo
Cruz's defelected shot doubled the lead five minutes later.
	   The game looked won but Dane Kenneth Perez's strike for MVV
livened up the last ten minutes before Jean Paul van Gastel
restored order with a peach of a goal.
	   The Feyenoord captain's cruelly curving free kick from wide on
the right astonished MVV keeper Rein van Duijnhoven and sneaked in
at the near post for 3-1.
	   Referee Jack van Hulten awarded his first penalty of the season
to Feyenoord in the last minute, but Van Duijnhoven's fine save
made him even with Van Gastel.
	   Bobby Robson's beleaguered PSV Eindhoven faces a rough week,
entertaining in-form Vitesse Arnhem Thursday and visiting Ajax
Sunday.

Puerto Rican statehood opponents abandon lawsuit against vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Opposition party officials have
withdrawn their lawsuit challenging a vote on possible statehood
for Puerto Rico, saying an appeals court decision signals further
legal delays ahead.
	   Popular Democratic Party president Anibal Acevedo Vila said
Tuesday officials would instead concentrate on urging Puerto Ricans
to vote for continued commonwealth in the Dec. 13 vote on the
island's future relationship with the United States.
	   ``We'll see you at the polls,'' Acevedo Vila told the El Nuevo
Dia newspaper.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello called the vote this summer in the hope that
it would prompt Congress to resolve the island's tangled legal ties
to the United States. Residents are being asked to vote for
statehood, independence or a continued commonwealth.
	   As residents of a U.S. commonwealth, Puerto Ricans are U.S.
citizens, subject to the U.S. military draft and receive limited
federal benefits. But they cannot vote for president, have no vote
in Congress and pay no federal taxes.
	   As a state, Puerto Ricans would send senators and
representatives to Congress, could vote for president and would pay
federal taxes.
	   The Popular Democratic Party sued the Rossello administration in
a local court, claiming the ballot is worded to favor statehood.
	   But U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston ruled Monday
that party's lawsuit belongs in a federal court, not a local one.
	   The decision was seen as a blow to the party's case, since its
lawsuit hinges on whether the island's local government _ and
courts _ have the right to decide their own affairs.
	   On Tuesday, Acevedo Vila said the party was abandoning the suit
because time was short and a federal case could drag on for months.
``The calendar does not favor us,'' he said.

	   CIUDAD SANDINO, Nicaragua (AP) _ Hundreds of half-naked children
in a refugee camp swarmed Tipper Gore on Wednesday, asking her for
help to put their lives back together after the devastation of
Hurricane Mitch.
	   ``We'll go back and tell more people what you are suffering,''
the wife of U.S. Vice President Al Gore told Francisca Ramos, who
brought her toddler to see Mrs. Gore.
	   Mrs. Gore, representing President Bill Clinton, arrived
Wednesday in the Nicaraguan capital, accompanied by professional
baseball player Dennis Martinez, six members of Congress and a
promise of more supplies and support.
	   Stunned by the storm that killed some 10,000 people, governments
and aid organizations from around the world have promised hundreds
of millions of dollars in relief, ranging from bags of beans to
forgiveness of millions in foreign debt.
	   ``We are heartened by the solidarity and brotherhood of the
international community,'' Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman told
the Mrs. Gore in a meeting at Aleman's office.
	   But Aleman said his country still needs more funds, and many
people in Honduras and Nicaragua say they have seen little sign of
the foreign aid reportedly flowing into the country.
	   ``Almost everyone here is sick and almost everyone has multiple
problems _ respiratory problems from being out in the water so
long, fungal infections, open sores, diarrhea, parasites,'' said
Lillian Hall, coordinator at the camp for the Quaker group Pronica.
	   Mrs. Gore said Wednesday the United States would donate dlrs 1.5
million for medical aid in addition to dlrs 80 million pledged
earlier.
	   At the Ciudad Sandino camp, 20 miles (32 kms) from Managua, Mrs.
Gore helped to distribute water bottles, toilet paper and wash
buckets, and spent nearly two hours talking with children.
Martinez, a Nicaraguan who pitches for the Atlanta Braves, served
as translator.
	   ``I'd like to learn English to speak like you,'' one child told
her.
	   ``The eyes of the children are filled with hope,'' she said.
``All we can do is tell the world of the devastation here so they
can help.''
	   Mrs. Gore was part of a first wave of foreign visitors arriving
to survey the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch, which caused
massive flooding across Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and
Guatemala.
	   French President Jacques Chirac was expected to visit next week.
France forgave the debts of Honduras and Nicaragua on Tuesday.
	   Spain also announced it would pardon about dlrs 64 million _
nearly 30 percent of what is owned to Spain by the four countries _
by waiving payments due before the year 2002.
	   Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo on Wednesday launched a major
fund-raising campaign to help victims of Hurricane Mitch, calling
on Mexicans to donate to a special bank account that will go to
aid.
	   Mexico's navy also sent a medical frigate to Honduras. The
ship's 34-bed hospital is equipped with an operating room, X-ray
facilities and medical supplies.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Qatar calling on Iraq to cooperate with U.N.,
Bahrain, Kuwait cautioning against violence

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Qatar opened a meeting of the foreign
ministers of eight Arab states Wednesday by calling on Iraq to
cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors ``to ward off further
catastrophes.''
	   The United States has threatened military strikes if Baghdad
does not rescind its refusal to deal with the arms inspectors.
	   Iraq must cooperate with the U.N. ``to ward off further
catastrophes,'' Qatari Foreign Minister Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin
Jabor al Thani said.
	   But he added that ``the solution of this problem should be
through diplomacy.''
	   The Kuwaiti and Bahraini foreign ministers echoed the Qatari
call for diplomacy.
	   Bahrain ``endeavors to help Iraq apply the (U.N.) resolutions by
diplomatic means,'' Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheik Mohammed bin
Mubarak al-Khalifa told reporters.
	   Those resolutions say that U.N. sanctions against Iraq will not
be lifted until weapons inspectors dismantle Iraqi programs to
build weapons of mass destruction and set up a monitoring system to
ensure that such programs cannot be restarted. The sanctions were
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Foreign ministers from Egypt, Syria and six Gulf states attended
the meeting at which the Gulf crisis, the Middle East peace accord
and the Syrian-Turkish agreement over Kurdish separatists were
discussed.
	   The two-day conference is the first meeting of the so-called
Damascus-8 since July 1997. The group normally meets twice a year,
but it canceled a meeting last December after a row between Egypt
and Qatar.
	   By the Damascus Declaration of 1991, Egypt and Syria pledged to
defend the security of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United
Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and Gulf states promised to give
aid to the Cairo and Damascus governments.

Cabinet ratifies peace agreement with Palestinians

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's government narrowly ratified the
land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians on Wednesday,
setting the stage for withdrawal from West Bank territory and an
expansion of Palestinian autonomy.
	   Prodded by the United States, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
pushed the deal through the Cabinet with far less support than he
anticipated. To secure the votes of hard-liners opposed to any deal
offering land-for-peace, he also attached conditions that may
provoke a new crisis.
	   Eight of 17 ministers voted in favor, five ministers abstained
and four voted against the deal struck last month between Netanyahu
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at the Wye Plantation outside
Washington. The plan calls for Israel to withdraw its troops from
13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for security guarantees.
	   Approval of the deal came after weeks of delay, caused in part
by a suicide-bombing by Islamic militants at a Jerusalem market
that injured 21 Israelis.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called the vote an
important step in the peace process. The Palestinians welcomed
ratification with caution, but dismissed the conditions as
``violations.''
	   Jewish settlers, some of whom will find themselves in isolated
West Bank areas after the withdrawal, criticized the government for
giving up land that settlers consider to be their biblical
birthright.
	   ``For Sale: State of Israel, a giveaway,'' read a large banner
at a protest rally where more than 10,000 settlers and their
supporters gathered in Tel Aviv as the Cabinet met.
	   Saying that land was ``precious and important,'' Netanyahu
attached conditions to be met before he relinquished control,
saying Israel reserved the right to annex large areas of the West
Bank if Arafat makes good on a threat to unilaterally declare
Palestinian statehood in May.
	   Netanyahu's second condition entailed bringing each stage of the
phased pullback to the Cabinet for separate approval over the next
three months, a move that would likely stall any handover.
Ministers will be asked to determine whether the Palestinians have
met their security obligations under the accord.
	   He also demanded that the Palestine National Council, the
Palestinian parliament-in-exile, hold a formal vote by mid-December
to revoke clauses in the Palestine Liberation Organization founding
charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   In a fourth stipulation, Netanyahu said that in an additional
pullback to which Israel committed itself last year, the
Palestinians would receive no more than 1 percent of the West Bank.
Following the 13 percent withdrawal, the Palestinians would control
about 40 percent of the territory.
	   ``The conditions are part of game between Mr. Netanyahu and his
right-wing ministers,'' senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat
told The Associated Press. ``We refuse them completely.''
	   ``This is a clear and serious violation of the Wye River
agreement and we call on the American administration to come down
to the area to observe who is implementing the agreement and who is
not implementing,'' Erekat said.
	   At the same time, the government announced plans to speed up
construction of a new Jewish neighborhood on a disputed Jerusalem
hilltop and confiscate sections of West Bank land for settler
bypass roads.
	   Israel also announced it would not meet a Monday deadline to
withdraw troops from 2 percent of the West Bank. Netanyahu adviser
David Bar-Illan said the troop pullback cannot take place until
parliament approves the deal in a vote planned for Tuesday. A
pullback would likely take place ``towards the end of next week.''
	   The United States spurred Israel to act in the final days before
the Cabinet vote, urging the government to stick to the original
timetable of the agreement.
	   President Bill Clinton spoke with Netanyahu on Tuesday night
about the land-for-security agreement and about the U.S. showdown
with Iraq over weapons inspections.
	   An Israeli official said the United States has signaled that its
tough policy toward Iraq is encountering problems in the Arab world
because Israel had not moved forward on its implementation of the
agreement.

Air Caribbean negotiating with investors to add flights, aircraft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Trinidad and Tobago-based Air
Caribbean said it is negotiating with a group of foreign investors
for a dlrs 71 million infusion in equity and additional aircraft.
	   Chief executive officer Leslie Lucky-Samaroo said Tuesday the
airline, which currently flies a Boeing 737 and turboprops, wants
to expand service to Miami, New York and London. The company
currently flies from Trinidad to Tobago, Barbados and Guyana.
	   Lucky-Samaroo declined to name the investors.
	   Earlier this year, Air Caribbean protested rival BWIA's
designation as Trinidad and Tobago's ``national flag carrier.''
	   Last month, the government named Air Caribbean its second
national carrier. BWIA relinquished its 15-year exclusive contract
to the title for a basket of tax breaks reported at dlrs 10
million.
	   Air Caribbean employs about 225 people.

Prosecutors request transcript of Pinochet lawyer's arguments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentine prosecutors
investigating the 1974 murder here of a former Chilean general said
Wednesday the arguments of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's lawyer in
Britain shed light on their case.
	   Prosecutors Jorge di Lello and Jorge Alvarez Berlanda said they
would request a transcript of lawyer Claire Montgomery's arguments
before the House of Lords, where she said that the former dictator
was the real head of the feared secret police DINA.
	   The DINA is believed to have placed the car bomb that killed
former Gen. Carlos Prats and his wife Sofia on Nov. 30, 1974 in
Buenos Aires, where Prats sought asylum after publicly opposing
Pinochet's 1973 military coup.
	   A former DINA agent, Enrique Arancibia Clavel, is in prison in
Buenos Aires awaiting trial for the bombing.
	   Di Lello and Alvarez Berlanda have sought unsuccessfully to have
Pinochet indicted for conspiracy in the Prats case.
	   Pinochet, 82, was arrested while recuperating from back surgery
in London on Oct. 16 on allegations of genocide, torture and
kidnapping. He remains in a hospital under police guard.
	   Britain's highest court is hearing arguments on whether to
uphold the arrest or let Pinochet return to Chile.

Carolina rewards Beuerlein with a new deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOE MACENKA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (AP) _ Steve Beuerlein, who took over
as the Carolina Panthers' starting quarterback last month amid
questions about Kerry Collins' commitment, was given a three-year,
dlrs 9 million contract extension Wednesday.
	   The deal, which covers the 1999-2001 seasons, includes a dlrs
1.5 million signing bonus.
	   Beuerlein, who joined the Panthers in 1996 for dlrs 2.3 million
over three years, had said in recent weeks that he did not want to
become a free agent at the end of the season, preferring instead to
re-sign with Carolina (1-8).
	   Beuerlein, 33, was originally signed to be the top backup to
Collins, who in 1995 became the Panthers' first-ever draft pick.
But Collins had his share of struggles and was cut last month after
team officials said he told them he had lost his heart for being
the starter.
	   His departure handed the starting job to Beuerlein, who has been
mainly a backup in his 12-year National Football Leagyue career.
His last stint as a full-time starter was in 1995 before the
Jacksonville Jaguars awarded the job to Mark Brunell.
	   Beuerlein has started just 12 games for Carolina but has
recorded four of the franchise's top eight single-game passing
performances.
	   He has started the last five games and completed 65 percent of
his passes, tops in the NFL. He has the third-highest quarterback
rating in the NFC, behind only those of Randall Cunningham and
Steve Young.
	   On Nov. 1, Beuerlein completed 13 of 17 passes to help the
Panthers win their first game of the season and end a club-record
nine-game losing skid.

Chelsea hammers under-strength Arsenal 5-0 in League Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ For Arsenal, England's lightly regarded League Cup
proved to be one cup too many Wednesday.
	   The Gunners, the defending Premier League and F.A. Cup
champions, were destroyed at their home ground in north London 5-0
by Chelsea, the League Cup holders.
	   Arsenal, playing an all-reserve lineup with Dennis Bergkamp the
only regular in the starting 11, bows out and now can focus on the
league, F.A. Cup and Europe's top club competition _ the Champions
League.
	   In Wednesday's other five League Cup fourth-round matches:
Everton 1, Sunderland 1 (Sunderland advanced 5-4 on penalties);
Leicester 2, Leeds 1; Manchester United 2, Nottingham Forest 1;
Newcastle 1, Blackburn 1 (Blackburn advanced 4-2 on penalties).
	   At Arsenal, Frank Lebeouf gave Chelsea a 1-0 lead in the 34th on
a penalty and, after that, full-strength Chelsea rolled with two
goals each from player/manager Gianluca Vialli and Gustavo Poyet.
	   At Leicester, Muzzy Izzet scored in the 88th and Garry Parker
got the winner two mintues later on a penalty as Leicester rallied
for the 2-1 win. Harry Kewell gave Leeds the lead in the 17th.
	   At Manchester United, 37,000 fans saw the Reds ease into the
final eight on two goals by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (57th and 60th).
Steve Stone scored for Forest on a 30-yard (meter) blast in the
68th.
	   At Newcastle, neither team wanted this match as they both missed
penalty shots in the final minutes to force 30 minutes of extra
time after a 1-1 draw with Alan Shearer scoring in the 9th to break
a seven-game scoring slump, and Tim Sherwood for Blackburn in the
30th.
	   Shearer missed Newcastle's late penalty _ shooting high _ and
Jeff Kenna was stopped by Newcastle keeper Shay Given. Blackburn
got through 4-2 on penalties.
	   At Everton, this was another match that went to extra time after
a 1-1 draw with Michael Bridges scoring for Sunderland (29th) and
John Collins on a penalty for Everton (74th). Sunderland survived
5-4 on penalties.
	   Sunderland is now undefeated in 23 league and cup matches.
	   In the draw for the quarterfinals, it's: Leicester vs.
Blackburn; Wimbledon vs. Chelsea; Tottenham vs. Manchester United;
Luton vs. Sunderland.

Head of Kosovo verification mission arrives as violence continues

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Peaceful resolution of the Kosovo
conflict is a long way off, the American head of a new foreign
mission to the Serbian province acknowledged Wednesday amid reports
of more violence.
	   NATO officials also voiced concern about continuing clashes a
month after an agreement aimed at halting the unrest in Serbia, the
dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   U.S. diplomat William Walker, chief of a verification mission
still being put together, arrived in Pristina the day after three
Serb policemen were injured in an attack on their police station,
presumably by ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   The mission, organized by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, will send as many as 2,000 unarmed monitors
into the field to check whether Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic is complying with agreements aimed at ending the
hostilities.
	   Walker called it perhaps the last chance ``to avert an
irrational spiral of more violence'' in Kosovo, where the ethnic
Albanian majority seeks independence from Serb rule.
	   Serb forces in February launched a crackdown on Kosovo Albanian
separatists. Several hundred people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have
been killed and as many as 300,000 were driven from their homes.
	   The violence has continued past the Oct. 12 agreement by
Milosevic to sharply reduce the number of police and soldiers in
Kosovo. NATO had threatened airstrikes to force an end to the
crackdown.
	   In the past week, at least two Serb policemen have been killed
and three injured, while six guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation
Army have died from police gunfire.
	   ``It is obvious that we have a long way to go from this
battlefield to the negotiating table,'' Walker said.
	   Western powers led by the United States believe the verification
mission will restore stability in Kosovo by having the unarmed
foreigners roaming the region to report on any violence or
violations of the agreement Milosevic reached with U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke and the OSCE.
	   Walker was unable to provide a firm date for launching the
mission, which he called the most ambitious undertaking to date of
the 54-nation OSCE.
	   The OSCE's Permanent Council on Wednesday estimated costs for
the year-long mission at dlrs 200 million. The council, meeting in
Vienna, Austria, approved expenditures of dlrs 64 million for the
rest of 1998, with 1999 outlays to be decided later, spokeswoman
Melissa Fleming said.
	   Security for the verifiers depends on guarantees given by
Milosevic and the rebels, Walker said.
	   There was little sign Wednesday of violence abating.
	   Belgrade's state-run Tanjug news agency reported that ethnic
Albanian guerrillas opened fire Wednesday on a Serb farmer and
three other men picking corn near Klina, 45 kilometers (28 miles)
west of Pristina. The report said the farmer returned fire and a
police patrol helped him repel the attackers. No injuries were
reported.

Dodgers trade Bonilla to Mets for Rojas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 1st graf to correct that cash goes to Mets; ADDS

 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The Los Angeles Dodgers, seeking to bolster
their bullpen and give themselves financial flexibility, traded
third baseman Bobby Bonilla and cash to the New York Mets today for
right-hander Mel Rojas.
	   The switch-hitting Bonilla, hampered by injuries last year,
batted .249 with 11 homers and 45 RBIs in 100 games following
offseason surgery on his left wrist and left Achilles' tendon.
	   Bonilla was traded to the Dodgers on May 15 along with Gary
Sheffield, Charles Johnson and Jim Eisenreich and a minor league
pitcher for Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile as part of the Florida
Marlins' payroll purge.
	   Piazza was traded to the Mets a week later and recently signed a
dlrs 91 million, seven-year contract with them.
	   Bonilla, 35, played for the Mets for 3 1/2 years before being
traded to the Baltimore Orioles midway through the 1995 season. He
is under contract for two more years at dlrs 5.9 million per
season.
	   Rojas, who turns 32 next month, was a major disappointment for
the Mets last year, going 5-2 with a 6.05 ERA and two saves in 50
games. He is signed for 1999 at dlrs 4.5 million.
	   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone has said the team needed to
bolster its bullpen. Rojas figures to pitch in a setup role to
closer Jeff Shaw.
	   Bonilla has 273 homers in his big-league career, hitting a
career-best 34 for the Mets in 1994. He began his big-league career
with the Chicago White Sox in 1986, was traded to the Pittsburgh
Pirates during that season and then signed with the Mets as a free
agent after the 1991 season. The Marlins signed him as a free agent
after the 1995 season.
	   Beltre, 20, played in 77 games for the Dodgers last season and
hit .214 with seven homers and 22 RBIs. He committed 13 errors at
third base.
	   Rojas made his big league debut with Montreal in 1990, and has
also played for the Chicago Cubs. His best season was in 1996, when
he went 7-4 with a 3.22 ERA and 36 saves for the Expos.

Lareau upsets Kremlin Cup top seed Corretja

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Canadian Sebastien Lareau upset top-seeded Alex
Corretja of Spain in the second round of the dlrs 1.1 million
Kremlin Cup on Wednesday.
	   For Lareau, a 25-year-old doubles specialist, it was the second
upset of a top-ten player since 1996, when he downed Michael Stich
of Germany, ranked fourth at that time.
	   After trading serve breaks early in the first set, both players
held serve in the next two games, when Lareau broke Corretja three
more times in the first set to win it 6-3.
	   ``It was my last big tournament of the year, so I just wanted to
go out and play as wise as I can,'' Lareau told reporters.
	   The Canadian closed the second set 6-3.
	   Corretja has already qualified for the ATP Championship in
Hanover, Germany, later this month.
	   Another upset came later in the day when Jan Kroslak of Slovakia
ousted fourth-seeded Byron Black of Zimbabwe 6-4, 6-4.
	   Defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, seeded second,
lost the first set to Sebastien Grosjean of France but gained
control in the second and won the match 2-6, 6-3, 6-2.
	   Former Kremlin Cup champion Croatian Goran Ivanisevic won the
first set and was ahead 3-2 in the second when his opponent Jerome
Golmard of France withdrew on an injury.
	   In other action Wednesday, German qualifier Lars Burgsmuller
made his way to the quarterfinals as he ousted Sjeng Schalken of
the Netherlands, 6-3, 5-7.

Ajax, Feyenoord win but still trail Heerenveen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax edged Roda JC Kerkrade 2-1
Wednesday while Feyenoord subdued MVV Maastricht 3-1, keeping the
Netherlands' two oldest rivals well in the championship race.
	   But SC Heerenveen (9-1-3) seemed as surprised as anyone else to
continue its four-day run atop the league, for the first time in
its 78-year history.
	   The small Frisian club owed its 2-1 victory over fourth-placed
FC Twente Enschede to an injury-time winner from Boudewijn
Pahlplatz, who started his career at Twente.
	   Heerenveen's 28 points put it one ahead of Ajax and two better
than Feyenoord, which has played two games fewer.
	   Ajax, missing six injured players but grateful for the return of
captain and guiding force Danny Blind, started confidently.
	   Brazilian Wamberto beat the offside trap for 1-0 and Richard
Witschge set up Benni Mccarthy for the second before Peter van
Houdt pulled one back for Roda.
	   Frank de Boer and Roda's Ramon van Haaren both had to be
substituted after a clash of heads.
	   In Maastricht Bert Konterman rose to knock in a corner after
half an hour for a dominant Feyenoord and Argentinian Julio Ricardo
Cruz's defelected shot doubled the lead five minutes later.
	   The game looked won but Dane Kenneth Perez's strike for MVV
livened up the last ten minutes before Jean Paul van Gastel
restored order with a peach of a goal.
	   The Feyenoord captain's cruelly curving free kick from wide on
the right astonished MVV keeper Rein van Duijnhoven and sneaked in
at the near post for 3-1.
	   Referee Jack van Hulten awarded his first penalty of the season
to Feyenoord in the last minute, but Van Duijnhoven's fine save
made him even with Van Gastel.
	   Bobby Robson's beleaguered PSV Eindhoven faces a rough week,
entertaining in-form Vitesse Arnhem Thursday and visiting Ajax
Sunday.

U.N. withdraws inspectors, relief workers from Iraq

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations evacuated all of its
weapons inspectors and many of its humanitarian workers from
Baghdad on Wednesday, blaming fears of ``possible military action''
against President Saddam Hussein's regime.
	   The hasty withdrawal _ conducted amid drenching rainstorms _
involved more than 200 U.N. staffers and raised fears that a
military strike by the United States and Britain is imminent.
	   Iraq showed no sign of backing down from its refusal to deal
with the arms inspectors, the nub of the crisis. The evacuation was
at first not reported by the Iraqi media, and there was little
evidence of Iraqis panicking or rushing to stock up on food.
	   Prakash Shah, the special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, said the withdrawal was ``in the background of possible
military action against Iraq. This is what we learned in our
consultations with New York.''
	   The United States and Britain have been threatening military
action since Iraq announced Oct. 31 that it was halting the
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   UNSCOM officials in Baghdad did not learn of plans to evacuate
until chief weapons inspector Richard Butler called from New York
at 4 a.m. Baghdad time Wednesday and ordered the entire staff out,
said UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross.
	   Speaking from Bahrain where she was evacuated, Cross said 103
staffers of UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency had
pulled out. UNSCOM field officer in Bahrain, Goran Wallen, said no
one from the commission was left behind in Iraq.
	   In addition, about 130 of the 450 humanitarian workers in Iraq
withdrew Wednesday and were headed to the Jordanian capital of
Amman by road. There was confusion over the numbers, and earlier
U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, estimated 300
were leaving.
	   U.N. officials said about 40 more humanitarian workers would
leave on Thursday, but apparently U.N. workers will remain in the
northern Kurdish areas.
	   The departing U.N. workers gave hugs to colleagues remaining
behind _ including Iraqi staff _ but refused to talk to reporters.
	   As the buses were leaving, U.N. workers were hanging mesh
screens over the glass windows of the U.N. headquarters on the
outskirts of Baghdad _ likely a precaution against flying glass in
the event of a military strike.
	   Iraq says it will not resume cooperation with UNSCOM unless the
U.N. Security Council moves to begin lifting trade sanctions
imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Shah told reporters he was in close contact with Iraq's Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   The Iraqis ``will not be able to desist from their position
unless the Security Council takes some action with regard to
sanctions against Iraq,'' Shah quoted Aziz as saying.
	   In a letter to Annan, Aziz complained about the withdrawal of
the weapons inspectors.
	   Aziz said that Iraq had not asked the weapons teams to leave,
adding: ``In the light of the American threats to launch a military
aggression against Iraq without authorization from the Security
Council, the decision of UNSCOM fully proves once again that UNSCOM
acts in accordance with the orders of the United States and that it
coordinates its actions with it.''

Greece publishes historical archives on Jewish community
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK QUINN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ In dry official documents and evocative
private letters, the passages chronicle the life and death of one
of the most vibrant Jewish communities in the Balkans.
	   But the vivid details about Greece's Jewish populationcontained
in some the foreign ministry's archives, released Wednesday in a
472-page book, may not just help illuminate one of Europe's least
researched Jewish populations.
	   Delving into the Greek archives could also aid those trying to
trying fit together the jigsaw of looted Nazi gold.
	   ``We come to the real problem that the appearance of this volume
punctures like a lance in the boil of denial. Nazis expropriated,
exploited and then killed the Jews. But after the war _ who got the
loot?'' asked Steven Bowman, a professor of Judaic studies at the
University of Cincinnati, who helped compile the English-language
volume.
	   More than 90 percent of Greece's 80,000 Jews perished in Nazi
death camps and less than 5,000 remain today.
	   Bowman said it contained many previously unpublished official
documents that languished in the foreign ministry archives until
three years ago.
	   At that time, Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos decided to put
some order to the thousands of documents gathering dust in his
ministry's catacomb-like basements.
	   The first compilation of archives, published last year,
concerned the Dodacanese islands obtained from Italy following War
War II.
	   The Jewish volume is also an act of contrition of sorts for
Greece.
	   Although it was one of the only countries to return all the
Jewish properties lost during the Holocaust, it also took more than
50 years to fully honor the Jewish community. Pangalos unveiled
Greece's first Holocaust memorial one year ago.
	   The foreign ministry will ship 25 crates full of archival
documents to the Holocaust Museum in Washington for study. The
papers could open new avenues for Nazi gold investigators.
	   Among the nuggets in the archives are the official dispatches
from Greek diplomats who attended 1946 talks between the victorious
Allies and the Swiss government on Nazi German funds held in its
banks.
	   Switzerland stayed out of the war, but was subsequently accused
by Jewish groups of profiting from the Holocaust and retaining the
assets of slain Jews and acting as banker to the Nazis.
Switzerland's two biggest banks agreed in August to pay dlrs 1.25
billion in settlement of survivors' claims.
	   Both the book and the documents will be used at a December
conference in Washington on plundered Nazis treasure. Some 40
countries have been invited to attend the four-day conference.
	   The book's 159 documents from 1903 to 1957 also contain rare
insights into Greek Jews _ a community with roots dating back
nearly 3,000 years.
	   They provide a glance at the community in the northern port of
Salonica _ once known as the ``Pearl of Israel'' and home to the
Sephardic Jews who fled there from Spain following the Inquisition
in the 15th century.
	   Pangalos also said the change of government in Germany may spur
Greece to claim dlrs 7.2 billion in war reparations. That money was
given to Germany as a loan by then-occupied Greece.

Air Caribbean negotiating with investors to add flights, aircraft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Trinidad and Tobago-based Air
Caribbean said it is negotiating with a group of foreign investors
for a dlrs 71 million infusion in equity and additional aircraft.
	   Chief executive officer Leslie Lucky-Samaroo said Tuesday the
airline, which currently flies a Boeing 737 and turboprops, wants
to expand service to Miami, New York and London. The company
currently flies from Trinidad to Tobago, Barbados and Guyana.
	   Lucky-Samaroo declined to name the investors.
	   Earlier this year, Air Caribbean protested rival BWIA's
designation as Trinidad and Tobago's ``national flag carrier.''
	   Last month, the government named Air Caribbean its second
national carrier. BWIA relinquished its 15-year exclusive contract
to the title for tax breaks reported at dlrs 10 million.
	   Air Caribbean employs about 225 people.

	   The departing U.N. workers gave hugs to colleagues remaining
behind _ including Iraqi staff _ but refused to talk to reporters.
	   As the buses were leaving, U.N. workers were hanging mesh
screens over the glass windows of the U.N. headquarters on the
outskirts of Baghdad _ likely a precaution against flying glass in
the event of a military strike.
	   Iraq says it will not resume cooperation with UNSCOM unless the
U.N. Security Council moves to begin lifting trade sanctions
imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Shah told reporters he was in close contact with Iraq's Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. Shah said the Iraqi official had made
clear that Iraq does not intend to back down without movement by
the U.N. Security Council to lift the sanctions.
	   In a letter to U.N. chief Kofi Annan, Aziz complained about the
withdrawal of the weapons inspectors.
	   Aziz said that Iraq had not asked the weapons teams to leave,
adding: ``In the light of the American threats to launch a military
aggression against Iraq without authorization from the Security
Council, the decision of UNSCOM fully proves once again that UNSCOM
acts in accordance with the orders of the United States and that it
coordinates its actions with it.''
	   The official Iraqi News Agency, also reported that Saddam held
two meetings Wednesday with his military commanders and defense
officials, including the chief of the air force and air defenses.
It gave no details on the meetings.

Sabanis of Greece sets lift record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHTI, Finland (AP) _ Leonidas Sabanis of Greece, the European
champion and the Olympic silver medalist, lifted 704 pounds (320
kilograms) Wednesday to win the 62-kilogram class in the World
Weightlifting Championships.
	   Sabanis lifted a world-record 324 1/2 pounds (147.5 kgs) in the
snatch on the way to a 6-pound (2.7-kg) victory margin over
Bulgaria's Nikolai Peshalov, the Olympic bronze medalist in 1996.
Bulgaria's Sevdalin Mintchev was third.
	   Taipei's top women lifters won two gold medals from Chinese
competitors under the body-weight rule.
	   Kuo Ping-Chun of Taipei and China's Song Zhihuan both lifted 456
1/2 pounds (205 kgs) in the 58-kilogram class, but Kuo won the gold
because she weighed about a pound (.45 kgs) less than her Chinese
opponent.
	   In the 63-kilogram class, Chen Jui-Lien of Taipei, also a pound
less than China's Shi Lihua, won gold when both lifted 495 pounds
(223 kgs).
	   Taipei and China have two golds each in the first four women's
events. China also has two silvers and Taipei has one silver and
one bronze.

 &UR; Families of sailors sue Windjammer, saying trip was a suicide
mission &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Rewrites throughout to CORRECT that lawsuits filed in Miami,
sted Caribbean countries, ADD comment from attorney who filed
suits &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Mitch &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN PACENTI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Families of sailors lost aboard a schooner in
Hurricane Mitch sued a cruise company, accusing it of sending an
ill-trained and overworked crew on a suicide mission in an attempt
to save its flagship.
	   Five lawsuits seeking in excess of dlrs 1 million per family
were filed in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court against Windjammer
Barefoot Cruises Inc. on behalf of relatives from Honduras, Antigua
and Guyana. Attorneys promised more would be filed on Thursday.
	   ``I can't imagine anybody being more callous than to put the
fate of the ship over the fate of men, '' said attorney William
Huggett, who filed the suits last week and Tuesday. ``My God, why
didn't they just beach the ship and get the men off?''
	   Miami-based Windjammer said it believed it did everything
possible to save the 31-member crew on the Fantome, a 282-foot
(86-meter), four-masted vessel once owned by Aristotle Onassis.
	   The 71-year-old Fantome, French for ghost, was last heard from
on Oct. 27, reporting 115 mph (185 kph) winds and waves as big as a
five-story building. It was listing at 40 degrees. Rescuers gave up
their search Nov. 5 after finding life vests, life rafts and part
of a staircase.
	   As the storm approached Jamaica, Windjammer has said, Fantome
was ordered from the Honduran port of Omoa north to Belize City,
Belize, to drop off its 110 passengers and nonessential crew.
	   The company had hoped the ship could sail north toward Mexico's
Yucatan Peninsula but was afraid the vessel, which travels at a top
speed of 9 mph (14 kph), couldn't outrun the hurricane.
	   So the decision was made to head south toward Honduras in hopes
of slipping in under the monster storm. Mitch, though, stalled and
the Fantome tacked east and west, hoping to take refuge behind the
Roatan Islands off Honduras.
	   Huggett said Windjammer's action was ``corporate greed'' to
protect a ship worth at least dlrs 10 million.
	   James Canty, vice president of corporate development for
Windjammer, said it is a standard practice for ships to ride out
storms and felt the company directed the ship correctly.
	   ``We believe these are false accusations from a self-serving
personal injury attorney,'' Canty said.

Security Council summons weapons chief to explain Iraq pullout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Butler appearance before council and
Chinese reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council summoned the
chief U.N. weapons inspector Wednesday to explain why he suddenly
withdrew the entire inspection team from Iraq. Russia and China
were clearly angry at not being informed of the move ahead-of-time.
	   The council meeting followed an appeal by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to immediately resume
cooperation with the weapons inspectors.
	   Russia requested the emergency meeting after 233 U.N. personnel
were pulled out of Iraq early Wednesday because of the possibility
of airstrikes by the United States to compel Iraq to resume
cooperation with U.N. inspectors.
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler told a news
conference Wednesday that he ordered all inspectors to leave
Baghdad because of a strong recommendation from the United States
and an ``increasingly hostile'' atmosphere in Iraq.
	   ``This is a precautionary move only ... and I sincerely hope
it's temporary,'' he said.
	   He said he made the decision because of safety concerns after a
meeting Tuesday evening with Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh,
the current Security Council president. He said he spoke to
officials in the secretary-general's office _ but didn't have time
for wider consultations.
	   The Security Council is sharply divided over the use of force
against Iraq. The United States and Britain maintain that they can
take military action, based on previous U.N. resolutions. Russia
and China insist that fresh council approval is needed.
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said that while diplomacy
remains active, a military solution is now ``a serious option.''
	   But Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said ``the use of force is
fraught with very serious consequences not only for the U.N.
ability to continue to monitor inside Iraq but also for the
stability in the region and for the Middle East in general.''
	   Moscow has been in contact with Baghdad trying to get the Iraqis
to resume cooperation and resolve the situation peacefully, which
he stressed was the only real solution.
	   Lavrov demanded to know why the decision to withdraw U.N.
personnel was made without informing the council.
	   Deputy Chinese Ambassador Shen Guofang said Butler's unilateral
decision was unacceptable.
	   ``We just asked for clarification,'' Shen said. ``A lot of
council members are concerned about why he withdrew.''
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard, who was monitoring the closed
meeting, said the bulk of 15 council members supported Butler's
decision to withdraw the inspectors _ and his explanation.
	   Iraq says it will not cooperate with the weapons inspectors
until the Security Council begins to lift the debilitating economic
sanctions imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking
the Gulf War.
	   Iraq barred the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, from
carrying out spot weapons inspections on Aug. 5. After the council
offered Baghdad a comprehensive review of its compliance with U.N.
resolutions _ without linking it to the possible lifting of
sanctions _ Iraq halted all dealings with UNSCOM on Oct. 31.
	   Annan cut short a trip through north Africa and was expect to
return to U.N. headquarters in New York on Thursday, Eckhard said.
	   Saying he was ``saddened and burdened'' by Iraq's decision to
halt dealings with the inspectors, the U.N. chief reiterated that
economic sanctions against Baghdad can only be lifted if Iraq fully
cooperates with the Security Council.
	   ``I strongly urge President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi
government to rescind its decision and resume immediate
cooperation'' with inspectors, Annan said in a statement issued at
the United Nations.
	   ``This would be good for the Iraqi people, for the region and
for the world,'' he said.
	   Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz accused the UNSCOM of
acting on orders from the United States and using the United
Nations merely as ``false cover.''
	   In a letter to Annan _ the first official Iraqi reaction since
the pullout _ Aziz gave no indication that Baghdad was prepared to
rescind its ban on dealing with the weapons inspectors. He made no
mention of appeals by Annan and others to resume cooperation.
	   Aziz said no explanation for the U.N. pullout was given to the
Iraqi government _ and he stressed that Baghdad had not requested
the weapons inspectors to leave.
	   ``In the light of the American threats to launch a military
aggression against Iraq without authorization from the Security
Council, the decision of UNSCOM fully proves once again that UNSCOM
acts in accordance with the orders of the United States and that it
coordinates its actions with it,'' he said.
	   He called on Annan and the Security Council to take unspecified
action in light of what he said was confirmation of the links
between UNSCOM and the United States. Iraq has repeatedly called
for Butler to be replaced and UNSCOM to be completely restructured
to get a greater diversity of inspectors.
	   Butler told a news conference he spent almost all day Tuesday
dealing with ``an absolutely unfounded allegation'' by Iraq that an
inspector had committed an act of espionage. He would not disclose
the nationality of the inspector, except to say he was not
American.
	   Calling Iraq's Oct. 31 decision to halt inspections and
monitoring ``very wrongheaded,'' Butler said: ``Iraq knows quite
well what needs to be done to complete the disarmament work and
move towards the removal of sanctions. ... The course that they're
on now is only extending sanctions.''
	   Greenstock, the British ambassador, said he did not foresee a
return visit to Baghdad by Annan, who flew to the Iraqi capital
during the last crisis in February and signed a memorandum of
understanding with the Iraqis that resumed inspections and averted
U.S. and British airstrikes.
	   ``His memorandum of understanding from February has been thrown
back in his face,'' Greenstock said.

Stoltenberg upsets Sampras
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sampras losing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Jason Stoltenberg scored a stunning
victory in the first round of the Stockholm Open on Wednesday,
upsetting top-ranked Pete Sampras 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 6-4.
	   Stoltenberg, an Australian ranked 29th who had lost all four
previous matches to Sampras, needed seven match points before
wrapping up the victory in 2 hours, 14 minutes.
	   ``I thought it was at least 15,'' Stoltenberg said. ``I thought
it was slipping away at the end. I held on.''
	   Sampras' early exit could jeopardize his chances of finishing
the season as world No. 1 for a record sixth consecutive year.
Marcelo Rios, playing a clay court tournament in his native Chile
this week, could overtake him.
	   Earlier, Britain's Tim Henman advanced to the quarterfinals with
a straight-sets victory over Wayne Ferreira of South Africa.
	   Henman's countryman, Greg Rusedski, was more convincing with a
52-minute victory over Tommy Haas, 6-1, 6-4.
	   ``I couldn't be playing much better tennis if I tried,'' said
Rusedski, who defeated Sampras in the finals of the Paris Open last
weekend. ``It must be my new improved returns.''
	   Henman was much more evenly matched. He started fast, then
struggled before breaking Ferreira's serve to force a tiebreak. He
won 7-6 (7-3), 6-4.
	   ``It was an up-and-down first set,'' Henman said. ``My serving
was erratic at that point.''
	   Henman and Rusedski, ranked Nos. 10 and 11 in the world, are
trying to qualify for the last spots in the ATP Tour Championships
in Hanover, Germany, later this month. Sampras is already in that
event.
	   ``I think I've got to get to the finals,'' Rusedski said. ``I'm
just thinking about my tennis and everything else will take care of
itself.... If it works, it works. If it doesn't, it doesn't.''
	   Rusedski is on a roll. He called last week's victory over
Sampras, ``probably my greatest accomplishment in tennis, by far.''
	   In other matches Wednesday, American Todd Martin defeated
Australia's hard-serving Wayne Arthurs, 6-4, 6-3, to join Henman in
the quarterfinals.
	   Arthurs, a 27-year-old doubles specialist, had upset second seed
and world No. 7 Karol Kucera of Slovakia on Tuesday.

Pakistan looks to Central America to clean up Karachi

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan has gone as far afield as
Latin America in its search for help to rid this violent port city
of the thousands of weapons being used by militant ethnic groups to
terrorize the people, the provincial governor said Wednesday.
	   ``Unless we remove the weapons from the city we cannot establish
peace,'' Governor Moinuddin Haider told The Associated Press in an
interview. ``We have called for experts from Colombia and other
countries who have experience in disarming people and collecting
weapons.''
	   The call for help has only just gone out, he said and so far
there have been no replies.
	   Haider is currently running southern Sindh province.
	   Last month Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif dismissed the Sindh
provincial government and imposed governor's rule, promising to end
the lawlessness and ethnic feuding that has paralyzed the city.
	   The main culprits have been rival factions of an ethnic group
known as the Muttaheda Qami Movement. Activists of both the smaller
Haqiqi group and the mainstream MQM group, led by exiled leader
Altaf Hussein, are well armed.
	   Policemen in this troubled city say some of the activists are
better armed than the thousands of security forces patrolling the
streets, often in armored personnel carriers and armor plated
vehicles.
	   So far more than 1,000 people, many of them civilians, have been
killed in the bloodletting between rival MQM groups, who say they
represent Indian migrants to Pakistan after 1947 when the Asian
subcontinent gained its independence from Britain.
	   Haider said the borders of southern Sindh province have been
sealed to stop the weapons coming in mostly from northwest
Pakistan, which borders Afghanistan.
	   Successive Pakistani governments have blamed the runaway weapons
trade in Pakistan on the 1980s war in neighboring Afghanistan
against invading Soviet soldiers.
	   Billions of dollars worth of arms and ammunition were pumped
into Afghanistan from the Untied States and other western
countries. When the Soviets pulled out in 1989 and Afghanistan's
pro-communist government was overthrown in 1992, Islamic insurgents
sold their weapons on the open market.
	   Russian-made kalashnikov rifles, rocket propelled grenade
launchers, heavy artillery, machine guns and a huge variety of
explosive devises are readily available.
	   ``We are taking measures to block the main routes of weapons
supply to the city,'' Haider said. ``We have also asked the
governments of other provinces to check the arms smuggling.''
	   An estimated 10,000 illegal weapons have made their way into
this city of 13 million, Pakistan's largest city and the financial
hub of the country.
	   ``Deweaponization of the city will not be an easy job, but there
is no other way to restore peace,'' Haider said.

Unions proposes program to boost slumping auto industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Pressed by increasing unemployment and
slumping auto sales, the nation's leading metalworkers' union on
Wednesday proposed a rescue package to boost their industry.
	   The Metal and Auto parts Industry Workers' Union said its
proposal would generate 65,000 new jobs by slashing car prices by
as much as 30 percent, lowering sales tax and giving customers
lower interest rates and longer payment plan. Further details will
be presented to the government later this week, said union
spokesman Jefferson da Conceiao.
	   ``We will continue to lose jobs unless plans like this are
implemented,'' said da Conceicao, whose union is based in the
industrial town of Sao Bernardo do Campo, 40 kilometers (25 miles)
from Sao Paulo.
	   According to Conceicao, many Brazilians would trade in their
older models for a new car if given the incentive.
	   ``More than one-fourth of the nation's fleet is over 15 years
old and 90 percent would not pass the current mandatory safety
laws,'' he said.
	   The auto industry has been reeling since late last year after
the government doubled interest rates following the Asian market
crisis. It was showing signs of recovery, until the government
doubled interest rates once again to 50 percent in the wake of the
Russian financial crisis.
	   Assembly plants and dealers have reportedly some 200,000 unsold
cars in their yards.

Jamaica to repatriate 14 Cuban migrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaican officials said Wednesday they
will repatriate 14 Cuban migrants who landed on the island while
trying to reach Puerto Rico in a rickety boat.
	   The Ministry of Security and Justice said interviewers decided
none of the migrants were eligible for political asylum.
	   The Cubans left Santiago in eastern Cuba in a 14-foot
(4.2-meter) fishing boat and landed Oct. 11 near Hope Bay in
northeastern Jamaica. They claimed they were headed east to the
U.S. Caribbean territory of Puerto Rico but drifted off course
after their outboard motor failed.

Players hold status meeting; Jordan may play exhibition game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Michael Jordan's next basketball game could
occur the first weekend of December in an exhibition that would be
held in Las Vegas, players' union director Billy Hunter said
Wednesday.
	   ``Whether or not (Jordan) will play won't be known until the
last moment. If he doesn't play, he'll coach. But he'll be
physically present,'' Hunter said after the union's negotiating
committee and several team player representatives met for about 5
1/2 hours to discuss the lockout.
	   No new negotiations are scheduled, although Hunter said he would
call commissioner David Stern on Wednesday night or Thursday to
gauge whether the sides want to sit down at the negotiating table
again.
	   ``He has indicated that he does have another proposal. When he
puts it out there remains to be seen,'' Hunter said. ``I think what
he wants to do is sweat our players a little more and see whether
there's any inclination on our part to want to submit.''
	   There have been no discussions since talks broke off Friday, and
the season cannot start until mid-December at the earliest.
	   If another three weeks go by without an agreement, the season
probably won't start until 1999.
	   ``Fans may be somewhat disheartened at this moment, but I don't
think the fans are turned off to the point that we can't regain
their support,'' Hunter said. ``It's sort of crunch time. Sooner or
later the (owners) will have to decide that it's time to get a
deal.
	   In the meantime, agents David Falk, Arn Tellem and Eric Fleisher
are trying to organize an exhibition game in Las Vegas for the
first weekend of September.
	   Hunter said the Showtime cable network has expressed interest in
televising the game. A spokeswoman for Showtime had no comment.
	   Hunter said the game might be a matchup between two of the three
Dream Teams that competed in the 1992 and 1996 Olympics and the
1994 World Championships.
	   But it would be impossible to put the original Dream Team back
together since Magic Johnson and Larry Bird are now part of
management _ Johnson as a part-owner of the Lakers and Bird as the
coach of the Indiana Pacers. Also, Christian Laettner ruptured his
Achilles' tendon last summer and could not play, and Clyde Drexler
will be busy coaching the University of Houston basketball team.
	   During Wednesday's meeting, discussions focused mainly on where
the sides stand and how to reach a compromise.
	   Owners, general managers and coaches have been contacting
players in recent days to discuss the owners' proposal.
	   The sides have already discussed the framework for a deal in
which a ``luxury tax'' would be imposed for two or three years on
owners who sign players to lucrative contracts, after which an
``escrow tax'' could be withheld from players' paychecks to ensure
that the percentage of revenues devoted to salaries drops to an
agreed-upon level.
	   Owners want a maximum salary of about dlrs 8 million to dlrs 12
million. The luxury tax proposed by the players for contracts worth
more than dlrs 15 million would be intended to have the same
effect.
	   Under the union's proposal, if the luxury tax failed to retard
salary growth, most players would have 10 percent of their salary
withheld from their paychecks. That money would be returned to the
owners if the targeted percentage was exceeded, but the owners are
asking that the deduction not be limited to 10 percent.
	   The sides also are far apart on what percentage of revenues
devoted to salaries would trigger the imposition of the escrow
plan. The owners want the plan to go into effect if the percentage
is not reduced from its current 57 percent to 50 percent. The
players don't want the escrow system to go into effect unless the
percentage exceeds 60 percent.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Maria Carmen Rodriguez daubed at
the black muck on the 1997 class photo, saved from the rubble that
was once a school. The students were smiling. ``Happy Vacation''
was written in Spanish on the blackboard.
	   ``Happy times,'' the principal said, her voice a whisper. ``Now
we have lost everything.''
	   After 121 years, the Francisca Reyes school for girls is no
more. Hurricane Mitch and the furious waters of the Rio Grande
Choluteca carried most of it away.
	   The scene is similar in towns and villages across this Central
American country. The storm, which killed an estimated 10,000
people, also wiped out one-fourth of Honduras' schools, leaving
education in check and the future in doubt.
	   In the capital Tegucigalpa, the flood waters rose to the third
floor of the riverside Education Ministry building, destroying
computers and wiping out school records.
	   ``The entire educational history of the country was lost,'' said
Carmen Siri, an education specialist with the United Nations
Development Program in Honduras.
	   The Education Ministry canceled the rest of the school year,
which was supposed to last until the end of November, sending
children home and teachers to distribute medicine, take census and
help clean the streets. Officials hope to reopen the schools on
schedule in February.

Brazil lowers interest rates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with Central Bank lowering interest
rates; ADDS details on alleged political scandal affecting stock
market. &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ With exorbitantly high interest rates
strangling South America's largest economy, Brazil's Central Bank
has heeded President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's call to lower the
country's key lending rate.
	   The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee lowered the rate
late Wednesday evening from 49.75 percent to 42.25 percent.
	   With more than 50 percent of retail sales made on installment
plans, the drop in interest rates was expected to be welcome news
for consumers and store owners.
	   Even a small reduction would ``have a positive psychological
effect on the consumer and help stimulate sales,'' Marcel Solimeo,
chief economist of the Sao Paulo Chamber of Commerce, had said
before the Central Bank announcement.
	   Solimeo recently predicted a somber Christmas season, with sales
during the final two months of the year expected to drop by almost
10 percent compared to last year.
	   The Central Bank decision followed a tumultuous day on the Sao
Paulo stock exchange. Influenced by allegations about a
multi-million dollar overseas bank account involving Cardoso and
some of his closest aides, the market dropped nearly 3 percent.
	   The allegations, which the government dismissed as dirty tricks
by its political opposition, surfaced over the weekend and diverted
the nation's attention from Cardoso's recently announced fiscal
austerity package.
	   Last week's congressional approval of a social security reform
bill and an expected International Monetary Fund rescue package
``justify a lowering of interest rates,'' said presidential
spokesman Sergio Amaral.
	   Amaral added that the government was projecting annual interest
rates next year of 21 percent.
	   Brazil's key lending rate was nearly doubled to 49.75 percent in
September as investors fled the country following Russia's default
and devaluation in August. The country's foreign reserves have
fallen to around dlrs 43 billion from the dlrs 70 billion posted at
the end of July.
	   ``With interest rates like these, it's impossible to draw up any
coherent investment or expansion plan,'' Aldo Lorenzetti, president
of a large electrical appliance factory, said earlier this week.
	   Business leaders have warned that the success of the
government's fiscal austerity package depends on lower interest
rates.
	   The National Confederation of Industries has released a report
claiming that high interest rates will increase the public deficit
_ now at 7 percent of gross domestic product _ and lower tax
collection as economic output dwindles.
	   The belt-tightening measures unveiled Oct. 28 are a mix of taxes
and spending cuts in a bid to save nearly dlrs 24 billion in 1999
and some dlrs 80 billion by 2002. The measures must be approved by
Congress.
	   The government hopes the measures will qualify Brazil for an IMF
rescue package, expected to be announced within the next few days.
	   The IMF has insisted on a tough plan to slash Brazil's deficit
before going ahead with an estimated dlrs 30 billion to dlrs 40
billion aid program.
	   Analysts say the austerity measures are likely to aggravate the
country's economic slowdown and push unemployment above its current
official rate of 7.8 percent. Independent economists say
unemployment is closer to 20 percent.

 &UR; Eds: Items are on Jesse Jackson, a hare-hunting ban in the
Netherlands, the former pro wrestler elected governor of Minnesota,
a small U.S. town's curfew, and rapper Luther Campbell; some of the
items also moved as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ U.S. politician and civil rights leader
Jesse Jackson called Nigeria's most prominent political prisoner,
the late Moshood Abiola, a symbol of hope for Africa's most
populous nation.
	   ``Every day Abiola was in jail he believed in one Nigeria and he
lost his life trying to save the nation,'' Jackson said Wednesday
after meeting with Abiola's family.
	   Abiola, a powerful businessman, was the apparent winner of the
1993 presidential elections, which were later annulled. He was
imprisoned and charged with treason after declaring himself
president.
	   When dictator Gen. Sani Abacha died in June, it was expected
that Abiola would be freed by the new military leader. Just days
before his anticipated release, Abiola died.
	   Jackson urged Nigerians to remember Abiola and to ensure that
his death was not in vain. Jackson has called for elections and a
return to civilian rule in Nigeria.
	   ----- &QC; 
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Friday the 13th will be a lucky
day for Dutch hares.
	   The hares have recently become sitting ducks as they huddle on
high ground because the low-lying fields they usually call home
have been flooded by heavy rainfall.
	   But as of this Friday _ the 13th _ hunters in the northern
Netherlands will have to abide by a two-week cease-fire imposed by
the government or face prosecution.
	   ``Hares are forced to head for the high ground where they become
an easy target,'' the government said Wednesday in a news release
explaining the decision.
	   Wild hare is traditionally dished up as a Christmas Day delicacy
in many Dutch homes.
	   ----- &QC; 
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ The former professional wrestler elected
governor of the U.S. state of Minnesota shot a short film last
spring that may pop up at the Sundance Film Festival soon after he
takes office.
	   Gov.-elect Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura plays a shady marriage
counselor named Buddy (One-Arm) Sanchez in the low-budget ``20/20
Vision.'' In one scene, Buddy slaps a woman who has come to him for
counseling.
	   The filmmaker, Christopher Newberry, said ``The Body'' had one
concern when he was hired. ``He said, `This isn't going to be shown
anywhere in the next few months, is it?''' Newberry said.
	   Newberry submitted the short to Sundance and should find out in
early December whether it made the cut for the festival, which
begins in mid-January. Ventura takes office Jan. 4.
	   Ventura has appeared in the films ``Predator,'' ``The Running
Man'' and ``Repossessed.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PALMER, Illinois (AP) _ There's been no more trash stuffed into
the bank night deposit slot, no more burned flags thrown down
toilets, no more chickens tossed to their deaths off the grain
elevator.
	   This farming town of 275 people is quiet again. It might have
something do with the seven-day-a-week 8 p.m. curfew imposed on
anyone under 18.
	   The curfew, enforced until dawn, is one of the most severe in
the United States. Violators can be fined dlrs 75.
	   The curfew began last month, following a summer in which rowdy
kids flooded Palmer's park, drinking beer and carousing late at
night. Graffiti was scrawled about, and the bank's night drop-box
was filled with trash. Two chickens were thrown to their death from
the grain elevator and the post office's flag was burned and thrown
into a portable toilet.
	   ``You could tell they were drunk. They'd be hollering
obscenities until 1 or 2 in the morning,'' said Tracy Tull, who
lives across from the park in the town 40 miles (64 kilometers)
southeast of Springfield. ``Someone would have ended up getting
hurt real bad.''
	   So far, nobody has been caught breaking the new curfew, which
used to be 11 p.m. on weekdays and midnight on weekends.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MIAMI SHORES, Florida (AP) _ Luther Campbell got stripped of his
dlrs 40,000 Mercedes.
	   The 37-year-old former front man for the rap group 2 Live Crew
left the car running while he paid for his purchase at a gas
station Monday.
	   ``He heard squealing tires, looked out and said, `Hmmm, that
looks like my car _ leaving,''' police Lt. Jack Ulmer said.
	   Campbell told police the silver 1993 500 SEL contained dlrs
20,000 in jewelry and clothes, as well as his credit cards and
identification. It was found stripped Tuesday 17 blocks from the
gas station.
	   ``Now I know how ladies feel when their purses get stolen,'' he
said.
	   Campbell and 2 Live Crew gained notoriety in 1990 when he was
acquitted of giving an obscene performance at a nightclub.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Profit-takers sent stocks lower for a third
straight day Wednesday, but the damage to Wall Street's fall rally
remained modest. Technology shares bucked the trend again after an
upbeat update from Intel. The Dow Jones industrial average fell as
much as 71 points after shedding an early 72-point gain before
finishing 40.16 points lower at 8,823.82. While the Dow has now
fallen each day this week, the losing streak has barely put a dent
in the blue-chip barometer's rebound. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The dollar declined against most major
currencies Wednesday, falling against the Japanese yen on news that
a new fiscal stimulus package from Japan would include tax cuts,
considered essential to any efforts to revive that country's
economy. The dollar's fall against the mark came as a German
central banker emphasized that no interest rate cuts were in the
offing. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at 121.72 yen in
late New York trading, down from 122.52 late Tuesday. The U.S.
currency also was changing hands at 1.6764 marks, down from 1.6842.
(US-DOLLAR)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The United States is accusing
Japan of offering financial aid to other Asian nations in an effort
to weaken a proposed free-trade pact at next week's Pacific Rim
summit. Japan will donate dlrs 204 million to its Asian neighbors
to help develop their fishing and forestry industries, a major
Japanese newspaper reported Wednesday. The aid, promised for the
next five years, will be announced at a meeting Saturday of
representatives in the Malaysian capital ahead of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit next Tuesday and Wednesday, Asahi said.
The United States, Australia and Canada will be pushing the
21-member trade forum to agree to a plan to cut tariffs in nine
sectors covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade by 2020. (APEC)
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria has started to privatize key
state-controlled industries as part of a government move toward
economic reform, the country's military ruler said Wednesday. ``Our
privatization program kicked off last month,'' Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar told an economic forum in Abuja. ``The responses are most
encouraging as some 46 domestic and foreign organizations have
expressed interest in eight of the advertised public enterprises.''
The state-controlled firms to either be fully or partially sold off
include the telecommunications, mining and energy industries.
Companies from the United States, Canada, Europe and South Africa
have expressed interest in investing in Nigeria, Abubakar said of
the privatization plan. (NIGERIA-PRIVATIZATION)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin ordered the government
Wednesday to stop bankruptcy proceedings against insolvent defense
plants. In a decree, Yeltsin specifically instructed the government
to spare the Radio Instrument Research Institute, the Myasishchev
Experimental Machine-Building Plant and other companies producing
equipment crucial to national security, Yeltsin's office said in a
statement. The government has launched bankruptcy proceedings
against several dozen companies over their tax debts in an effort
to boost sluggish tax collection, which is crippling the
cash-starved country. (RUSSIA-BANKRUPTCY)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A nationwide strike by 100,000 revenue
workers threw exports into chaos Wednesday, and businessmen warned
of an industrial shutdown in an economy already struggling with a
slump. The strike for higher wages by officers and other employees
of customs and tax departments began Tuesday, and its organizers
vowed to remain off work indefinitely if their demands were not met
by Thursday. Trade-related operations were paralyzed at
international airports, cargo depots and ports across the country
on the first day, media reports said. ``It will have a tremendously
damaging impact,'' said M. Roy, a director with the Confederation
of Indian Industry. ``Imports and exports will come to a grinding
halt.'' (INDIA-EXPORT SHUTDOWN)

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton ordered warships,
planes and troops to the Gulf Wednesday in a major buildup as he
laid out his case for a possible attack on Iraq. Allowing Saddam
Hussein to flout the will of the United Nations by rejecting
weapons inspections would only embolden him to ``act recklessly,''
Clinton said. ``We continue to hope _ indeed, pray _ that Saddam
will comply,'' the president said. ``But we must be prepared to act
if he does not.'' As U.S. ships headed toward the Gulf, dozens of
Air Force fighters and bombers were ordered to the area. In
response to the threat, U.N. weapons inspectors were hastily
evacuated from Iraq. (US-IRAQ, IRAQ-UN)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's government narrowly ratified the
land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians on Wednesday,
setting the stage for withdrawal from West Bank territory and an
expansion of Palestinian autonomy. Prodded by the United States,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed the deal through the
Cabinet with far less support than he anticipated. To secure the
votes of hard-liners opposed to any deal offering land-for-peace,
he also attached conditions that may provoke a new crisis.
Palestinian officials welcomed ratification with caution, but
dismissed the conditions as ``violations.'' (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The devastation of Hurricane Mitch
could be felt for many years. In addition to killing an estimated
10,000 people in Central America, the storm also wiped out
one-quarter of Honduras' schools, leaving education in limbo and
the future in doubt. In the capital, Tegucigalpa, the floodwaters
rose to the third floor of the Education Ministry building,
destroying computers and wiping out school records. ``The entire
educational history of the country was lost,'' said Carmen Siri, an
education specialist with the U.N. Development Program in Honduras.
The Education Ministry has canceled the rest of the school year and
must decide what to do about student's grades and who will pass or
fail. (HONDURAS-MITCH-SCHOOLS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will respond to Japan's
proposals on the disputed Kuril Islands when he meets with Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Thursday, but the Kremlin plans to
keep the long-awaited response secret. The talks with Obuchi, who
arrived in Moscow on Wednesday night, will be the first high-level
meeting for Yeltsin since his latest illness sidelined him a month
ago. The four islands north of Japan were seized by Soviet Union at
the end of World War II. Both countries claimed ownership, and the
dispute prevented them from signing a peace treaty. (RUSSIA-JAPAN)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Peaceful resolution of the Kosovo
conflict is a long way off, the American head of a new foreign
mission to the Serbian province acknowledged Wednesday amid reports
of more violence. U.S. diplomat William Walker, chief of a
verification mission still being put together, arrived in Pristina
the day after three Serb policemen were injured in an attack on
their police station, presumably by ethnic Albanian guerrillas. The
mission, organized by the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe, will send as many as 2,000 unarmed monitors to check
whether Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is complying with
agreements aimed at ending the hostilities. Walker called it
perhaps the last chance ``to avert an irrational spiral of more
violence'' in Kosovo, where the ethnic Albanian majority seeks
independence from Serb rule. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)

Understanding the genesis and the consequences of Iraq's crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iraq-UN &QL; 
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The threat of U.S. military strikes on Iraq looms large as
President Saddam Hussein dares the world's most powerful military
in another clash of wills. Here are some of the issues involved:
	   Q: What led to the current crisis?
	   A: On Oct. 31, Iraq halted all work by the United Nations
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, which is responsible for dismantling
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles. The
U.N. Security Council declared this a flagrant violation of
resolutions passed after the 1991 Gulf War that require Iraq to
eliminate its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Q: What does the United States hope to achieve by military
strikes?
	   A: To significantly reduce Saddam's military strength and to
prevent development of chemical, biological and nuclear
capabilities.
	   Q: Is the United States still pursuing a diplomatic option?
	   A: The message coming out of Washington is that diplomacy has
its limits and that Iraq must not be allowed to defy world opinion
this time. State Department spokesman James Rubin said: ``What is
not needed, and there is no plan for it, is negotiations with
Saddam Hussein.''
	   Q: Does the United States have the support of Arab and Gulf
allies?
	   A: It doesn't appear so. Although U.S. officials say they have
the backing of the region's governments, Gulf officials have
clearly indicated that they oppose a military strike.
	   Q: What is the extent of U.S. military might in the Gulf?
	   A: There are 23,500 U.S. troops in the Gulf region at present
besides 173 aircraft and 23 ships, including an aircraft carrier.
Eight ships carry long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles. Another
aircraft carrier, USS Enterprise, and a Marine task force are on
the way.
	   Q: In seven years of searches, what have the weapons inspectors
achieved?
	   A: They have accounted for the vast majority of Iraq's
nonconventional warheads, which can carry chemical and biological
weapons. The dismantling of the nuclear program was also on the
verge of completion.
	   Q: What remains to be done?
	   A: UNSCOM says Iraq has not provided an account of destruction
of conventional warheads or of missile propellant. It awaits an
expert accounting of 155 mm mustard-filled shells to back up Iraqi
claims that the shells were lost. UNSCOM also wants documentation
that Iraq disposed of R-400 aerial bombs equipped for chemical and
biological agents and equipment to manufacture chemical weapons.
	   UNSCOM also hasn't verified destruction of Iraq's biological
warfare program.
	   Q: What does Iraq say about this?
	   A: It maintains it has fulfilled the requirements of U.N.
resolutions and demands the United Nations lift sanctions imposed
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. It says its biological program
was a short-lived failure.
	   Q: What do the sanctions prohibit?
	   A: The free sale of oil, Iraq's main source of revenue. Also, no
country is allowed to trade with Iraq or have other business links.
Flights to Iraq are banned. Iraq can also purchase food and
medicines under U.N. supervision. After complaints that the
sanctions were mainly hurting regular people, the United Nations
has allowed limited sales of oil since December 1996 to enable Iraq
to buy humanitarian goods, under what is called the oil-for-food
program.
	   Q: What have the effects of the sanctions been?
	   A: Iraq's oil-based economy has been devastated. The U.S.
administration estimates the sanctions cost Iraq dlrs 120 billion
so far. Although food is available in the markets, most people are
too poor to buy much. The oil-for-food program gives people monthly
rations. But medicines remain scarce because of frequent delays in
obtaining mandatory approvals from the United Nations.
	   Q: Amid all these hardships, how does Saddam manage to command
support?
	   A: Saddam has extracted support during his 30-year-rule with a
combination of terror, rewards and nationalistic sentiments. The
omnipresent security and intelligence agencies have created such an
aura of fear that virtually no public opposition to his regime
remains. Saddam also wins loyalty by providing jobs and other
benefits to the estimated 1 million members and supporters of the
ruling Baath Party. Genuine anger against U.N. sanctions has
translated into support for Saddam's anti-U.S. propaganda.

Graf wins first-round match, hopes to shake season-slowing
</HEADLINE>
injuries &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VILLANOVA, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Steffi Graf has her sights on
winning the Advanta Championships this weekend but also welcomes
the chance just to be here.
	   ``To be able to play through continuously without a break would
be welcomed,'' said Graf, who beat Mary Jo Fernandez 6-3, 7-6,
(7-4) on the third day of the dlrs 450,000 tournament.
	   Last weekend, Graf returned from wrist surgery to captured
Leipzig's Sparkassen Cup International in her native Germany on
Sunday.
	   ``I just have been feeling so much better, and I hope I can
shake the injuries that have slowed my season,'' she said.
	   Graf's victory at Leipzig made her the top money winner in
women's tennis with about dlrs 20.5 million in career earnings,
surpassing the dlrs 20.3 million by Martina Navratilova.
	   In earlier matches, third-seeded Jana Novotna, the 1996 titlist
and 1998 Wimbledon champion, was upset by Russia's Natasha Zvereva
6-4, 6-4 and fourth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain was
beaten by South Africa's Amanda Coetzer 6-4, 6-1. Sanchez-Vicario
had won 14 of their previous 17 meetings.
	   Graf, the 1995 Advanta winner and currently ranked 17th, had
little trouble in the first set, then won the second after
Fernandez rallied for a 4-3 lead. Graf relied on a strong backhand
to roar back to hold off Fernandez 7-4 in the tiebreaker.
	   Graf is 16-0 against Fernandez, dropping only two sets in 12
years.
	   ``I felt it was really close,'' Graf said. ``I broke her a few
times, but she kept coming back. I knew that I couldn't make a lot
of mistakes.''
	   Said Fernandez, who has played in only eight tournaments this
season and has battled a wrist injury: ``I felt that I could have
won the second set. I think she is playing well. She has endured so
much. I know how tough it is to come back.
	   ``She has always come back and she always seems to get better.''
	   Graf moves on to play Russia's Elena Likhovtseva in the second
round Thursday evening. Likhovtseva won over eighth-seeded
Sandrione Testud, who was forced to retire in the third set due to
a knee injury.
	   Graf, recovering from nagging knee and wrist injuries, said she
believed the Philadelphia-based tournament would be a good way
back.
	   ``The surface is a little different and there is always the
problem of dealing with the time change,'' Graf said. ``It would be
great to get to the (Chase) Championships (limited to the top 16),
but it just means enough to me to be able to keep playing.''
	   Second-seeded Martina Hingis, who received a bye in the opening
round, had little trouble in a 6-4, 6-1 victory over Brie Rippner.
Hingis won the first three games of each set.

Golf company cuts 700 jobs to save dlrs 40 million annually
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHELLE WILLIAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARLSBAD, California (AP) _ Callaway Golf, the world's largest
golf equipment manufacturer, will lay off 700 people and
discontinue some of its side ventures to save dlrs 40 million
annually.
	   Wednesday's announcement was the latest sign the golf industry
is struggling through a dismal sales year.
	   Last month, Ely Callaway, the 79-year-old founding chairman,
resumed the role of top executive after the company fired its
highest-paid employee to cut costs and redirect the company. In
July, 300 temporary jobs were cut.
	   ``The sale of golf clubs is slow in three major markets: U.S.,
Japan and Southeast Asia,'' Callaway said. ``Because of financial
chaos in the Asian markets, people are not buying as many golf
clubs. In the U.S., there are a lot of good golf clubs and our
competitors are pricing lower and closing out more than we are.
That puts pressure on us.''
	   The company slightly dropped it wholesale prices in May, and
Callaway said once was enough. ``We will retain our prices and
standards,'' he said.
	   He added that the jobs cuts did not indicate a declining
interest in golf. ``We think interest will continue to grow and
these depressed conditions are temporary,'' he said. ``But after
studying the company over the last six weeks, we decided to focus
only on golf clubs and golf balls rather than other areas.''
	   Some 5,000 retailers in the United States carry Callaway
products. One of its best known lines is the Big Bertha series of
titanium metal woods, drivers and irons.
	   The full-time employees cut were notified Wednesday. They
represent about 24 percent of Callaway's workforce; the number of
employees will drop to 2,200 by January.
	   Employees will receive eight weeks of severance pay, medical
insurance for their families through April and career counseling
through Jan. 1, Callaway said.
	   In July, when the company saw its first down quarter since it
was founded in 1982, Callaway hinted to financial analysts that
reorganization was possible. He also said he thought the market
would remain flat through 1999.
	   The company's board of directors asked Callaway to return as
president and chief executive officer, a position he left in 1996,
to see the company through the next two years. Donald H. Dye, who
spent 24 years at Callaway, was fired from the top position but
remains as a consultant.
	   Costs associated with the restructuring will lower
fourth-quarter earnings by dlrs 70 million to dlrs 85 million
before income tax benefits, causing it to post a loss for the full
year, Callaway said.
	   The company expects to lose 25 cents to 40 cents a diluted share
for fiscal 1998. Last year, Callaway earned dlrs 133 million, or
dlrs 1.85 a diluted share, on revenue of dlrs 843 million.

Brazil lowers interest rates

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ With exorbitantly high interest rates
strangling South America's largest economy, Brazil's Central Bank
has heeded President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's call to lower the
country's key lending rate.
	   The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee lowered the rate
late Wednesday evening from 49.75 percent to 42.25 percent.
	   Rafael Cardoso, director of Banco Sudamer, called the rate cut a
gradual move and said it would ``have no big impact on consumers.''
	   But with more than 50 percent of retail sales made on
installment plans, other analysts expected the move to be welcomed
by consumers and store owners.
	   Even a small reduction would ``have a positive psychological
effect on the consumer and help stimulate sales,'' Marcel Solimeo,
chief economist of the Sao Paulo Chamber of Commerce, had said
before the Central Bank announcement.

Australians, New Zealanders warned to leave Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australians and New Zealanders in
Iraq were warned Thursday to immediately leave the country amid the
increasing possibility of military strikes.
	   Foreign Affairs officials in both countries warned that security
conditions in Iraq could deteriorate quickly, and private citizens
should follow the lead of personnel linked to United Nations
organizations and get out.
	   ``All Australians who do not have essential business or other
commitments that require their continued presence in Iraq should
now make arrangements to leave the country as soon as possible,''
an Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade statement
said.
	   ``Tensions in the region remain at very high levels and security
conditions could deteriorate in Iraq at very short notice.''
	   A major U.S. military buildup is underway in the Gulf following
Iraq's latest refusal to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The United Nations has withdrawn several hundred weapons
inspectors and other U.N. staff from Baghdad in light of the
possibility of American airstrikes, including more than a dozen
Australians and New Zealanders.
	   Australia on Wednesday appeared to back military action against
Iraq. Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said it may be the only
option to ensure that Iraq does not resume producing weapons of
mass destruction.
	   ``A diplomatic resolution to this crisis is still possible if
Iraq immediately and unconditionally resumes full cooperation with
the U.N. Special Commission,'' Downer told Parliament.
	   ``If Iraq does not, then military action may be the only
alternative.''
	   New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said: ``The world is
rapidly losing patience with Saddam Hussein flagrantly and directly
challenging the authority of the security council.
	   ``He cannot expect the international community to accept this
indefinitely.''

U.N. withdraws inspectors, relief workers from Iraq

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Convoys of buses have hastily evacuated all
U.N. weapons inspectors and many humanitarian workers from Iraq,
raising fears that a military strike by the United States and
Britain is imminent.
	   Iraq showed no sign of backing down from its refusal to deal
with the arms inspectors _ the heart of the crisis. The evacuation
of more than 200 U.N. staffers in a driving rain Wednesday was at
first not reported by the Iraqi media, and there was little
evidence of Iraqis panicking or rushing to stock up on food.
	   U.N. envoy Prakash Shah said the withdrawal was ``in the
background of possible military action against Iraq.''
	   The United States and Britain have been threatening a military
strike since Iraq announced Oct. 31 that it was halting the
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which
is responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   With U.S. warships in the Gulf region and the Pentagon beginning
a major buildup of warplanes and troops, President Bill Clinton
said that not enforcing U.N. demands for arms inspections would be
a costly mistake.
	   The U.N. Security Council held an emergency session on Iraq on
Wednesday. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called on Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein to immediately resume cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   UNSCOM officials in Baghdad did not learn of plans to evacuate
until chief weapons inspector Richard Butler called from New York
at 4 a.m. Baghdad time Wednesday and ordered the entire staff out,
said spokeswoman Caroline Cross.
	   Speaking from Bahrain where she was evacuated, Cross said 103
staffers of UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency had
pulled out. The UNSCOM field officer in Bahrain, Goran Wallen, said
no one from the commission was left in Iraq.
	   In addition, about 130 of the 450 humanitarian workers in Iraq
withdrew Wednesday and were headed to the Jordanian capital of
Amman by road.
	   U.N. officials said about 40 more humanitarian workers would
leave on Thursday, but apparently U.N. workers will remain in the
northern Kurdish areas.
	   As the buses were leaving, U.N. workers hung mesh screens over
the glass windows of the headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad _
likely a precaution against flying glass in the event of a military
strike.
	   Iraq says it will not resume cooperation with UNSCOM unless the
Security Council moves to begin lifting trade sanctions imposed to
punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Shah told reporters he was in close contact with Iraq's Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency reported that Aziz had sent a
letter to Annan complaining about the withdrawal of the weapons
inspectors, saying that UNSCOM was following U.S. orders and using
the United Nations as ``false cover.''
	   The news agency also reported that Saddam held two meetings
Wednesday with his military commanders and defense officials. It
gave no details on the meetings.
	   Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs here, said
only core U.N. officials would remain in Baghdad. He declined to
give figures.
	   Most of the relief workers monitored a U.N. humanitarian program
that allows Iraq to sell limited quantities of crude oil to buy
food and medicine for its 22 million people.
	   Among those staying in the country were Shah, the U.N. envoy,
and Hans von Sponeck, the head of U.N. humanitarian operations who
took up his post in Iraq on Monday.
	   Von Sponeck said the evacuation of U.N. workers would slow down,
but not end, the distribution of relief supplies in
government-controlled areas.
	   ``Our capacity is much reduced,'' von Sponeck said. ``But
whatever capacity we have we will utilize for our humanitarian
program.''
	   The pullout is likely to halt the work of other specialized
agencies such as the U.N. Children's Fund, the U.N. Development
Program and the World Health Organization.
	   The crisis had been simmering since Aug. 5 when Iraq said it was
halting the work of U.N. inspectors, who carried out unannounced
spot checks of suspected weapons sites. On Oct. 31, Iraq expanded
its work ban to UNSCOM monitors, who conduct long-term surveillance
to ensure Iraq doesn't rearm.
	   Iraq is required to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction
under U.N. resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War, waged to oust
Iraq from Kuwait.
	   At a meeting of eight Arab foreign ministers Wednesday in Qatar,
three Gulf countries _ Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar _ called for a
diplomatic solution to the crisis.
	   Iraq must cooperate with the U.N. ``to ward off further
catastrophes,'' Qatari Foreign Minister Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin
Jabor al Thani said.

	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Sally Apfelbaum didn't want to hear the
advice from her veterinarian: Put Pierre to sleep.
	   A cancer as big as a grapefruit clogged the chest of the
6-year-old Parisian cat, partially collapsing his lungs.
	   But Apfelbaum thought Pierre was too young to let go. She
brought him to the Veterinary Hospital at the University of
Pennsylvania, where an oncology team used chemotherapy to shrink
the tumor.
	   Pierre will never go into complete remission and will require
more chemotherapy every few weeks. But Apfelbaum, who lives in New
York, doesn't mind the trips or the hundreds of dollars in bills.
	   ``They did wonders for him,'' says Apfelbaum, stroking Pierre's
striped fur, made even softer by the treatments. ``He's having a
very nice life.''
	   Apfelbaum is among a growing number of pet owners seeking the
latest in high-tech health care _ and willing to pay for it. From
kidney transplants for cats to open heart surgery on dogs, new
treatments are saving pets that wouldn't have survived 10 years
ago.
	   Along with the new care, though, come the same types of ethical
dilemmas that doctors and loved ones face in human health care.
	   Early in a pet's stay at Pennsylvania's center, one of the most
advanced in the nation with about 23,000 patients a year, doctors
try to broach with owners how far to pursue treatment.
	   Sometimes owners need to know that ``they don't have to go
through the emotional upheaval and spend all this money'' if their
pet doesn't stand a good chance, says Joan Hendricks, the
hospital's chief of critical care.
	   Karin Sorenmo, an assistant professor of oncology at the center,
believes it's inappropriate to put animals through such aggressive
cancer treatment that they need prolonged hospitalization.
``Animals exist in the present,'' she says, ``and this is how we
understand their existence.''
	   To help families decide how to proceed, the hospital also gives
daily estimates of costs. In some cases, the financial reality
forces tough choices: Pet owners may decide to euthanize an animal
that could only be saved at great expense.
	   Kidney transplants cost dlrs 5,000, which includes the charge to
remove the kidney from the donor cat. A procedure to open up a
dog's heart valves using a balloon runs dlrs 1,200- dlrs 1,500, a
stomach ultrasound costs about dlrs 180 and an overnight stay
starts at dlrs 80.
	   ``The charges are high compared to local vets,'' says hospital
director Barry Stupine. ``But they're low compared to human
medicine.''
	   For some families, the knowledge that their pet is in good
health is priceless.
	   When Anne Loisch first noticed a growth on the toe of her
7-year-old Rottweiler, Luther, her veterinarian dismissed it and
said a biopsy was unnecessary.
	   ``That's all well and good, I said, but there's a history of
cancer in the family,'' said Loisch, playing with her dog in a
waiting room. Just moments before, doctors had given chemotherapy
to Luther, injecting the medication into the area around the toe. A
biopsy had in fact shown the growth to be malignant, and doctors
removed it.
	   Loisch, who like most owners pays the hospital costs out of
pocket, says next time she will think about buying pet insurance.
	   At Pennsylvania, animals hooked to IVs are rolled on stretchers
through the halls. For the less pressing cases, workers gingerly
carry animals in their arms or direct them on leashes.
	   Inside a darkly lit room off the emergency room, veterinary
cardiologist Meg Sleeper runs a device over the chest of a cat
lying on a table. With the echocardiogram machine _ the same
top-of-the-line model used for humans _ she can examine the cat's
heart on a monitor, looking for abnormalities.
	   In a critical care wing that can hold 12 animals, Hendricks and
her team give constant care to pets.
	   ``We're here moment to moment if crisis breaks,'' Hendricks
says.
	   Along one wall, glass chambers hold animals too small to have
oxygen tubes in their nostrils. The tanks keep oxygen, humidity and
temperature steady for pets recovering from operations. And
ventilators, once used only as a last resort for animals, now
frequently ease the transition from critical condition.
	   One Rottweiler has made his home in the unit _ which costs about
dlrs 150 to dlrs 160 a day _ for nearly two months. The dog suffers
from bouts of pneumonia caused by an underlying nervous system
problem. His esophagus doesn't work properly, and when he's home,
he tries to eat things he can't.
	   ``He's out of danger here,'' says Hendricks. ``But the question
is can he go home?''

Norman back with his own set of priorities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THOUSAND OAKS, California (AP) _ The swing looks as strong as
ever, his presence on the golf course just as large. By all
accounts, he looks like the Greg Norman of old, even if he insists
that won't be the case.
	   No more hitting 600 balls a day on the practice range, never
fully satisfied. No more believing that every major championship is
one last chance to make up for so many that slipped away.
	   Norman is back in golf. Where he goes from here is anyone's
guess, including his own.
	   ``My challenge is not to get back to No. 1 in the world. That
was never an objective of mine,'' Norman said Wednesday after a
pro-am round in the Shark Shootout, his first tournament since
surgery April 22 on his left shoulder forced him out of the game.
	   ``My challenge is getting back to the level I know I can play,''
he said. ``Whatever that dishes out to be at the end of the day, I
can accept. But I'm a confident individual. And right now, my No. 1
passion is the game of golf.''
	   Being No. 1 has always been a major part of Norman's career. He
has occupied that spot in the world rankings longer than any player
of his generation, and he knew of only one way to get there _
grinding away on the range, grinding away on the tour.
	   Norman says he will reduce his schedule next year by about six
tournaments and change his practice habits to keep his head fresh
and reduce wear and tear on his left shoulder.
	   ``Right now, I'm just feeling my way back,'' he said.
	   He cannot pinpoint the tournament in which he began to
experience a twinge in his shoulder or when he began to lose some
of his desire, although he believes now the two go hand in hand.
	   ``There's a good reason I was burned out,'' he said. ``I was
frustrated because I didn't know what was going on.''
	   For a player who has been so much a part of golf the past 15
years, Norman slowly slipped out of the spotlight this year. He
played three tournaments on the PGA Tour and missed the cut in two,
the latter the Masters, when his shoulder was in such disarray that
he barely got the ball off the 18th tee in the second round.
	   That was his last round of the year. Instead of chasing majors,
he chased his family on vacations around the world. He began
hitting balls Sept. 4 and played only four rounds until Wednesday's
pro-am.
	   On Friday, he'll be paired with Steve Elkington in the first
round of the Franklin Templeton Shark Shootout, a two-man team
event.
	   ``I'm ready to get back,'' he told one well-wisher when he
arrived on the practice range.
	   On a cold, rainy morning, it didn't take long for Norman to warm
up. He arrived on the driving range about 40 minutes before he teed
off in the pro-am, took four hard practice swings in succession and
quickly worked his way through the bag.
	   From wedge to 5-iron to driver, it was the same old Norman,
attacking every shot and never once even rubbing his shoulder.
	   ``I'm interested to see how he'll play,'' Tom Kite said. ``I'm
sure he'll play quite well.''
	   Asked about his goals for 1999, Norman said he still has some of
this season left. His streak of winning at least once on the PGA
Tour ended at six years, but there is still meaningful golf to be
played.
	   The Shark Shootout is the start of a three-tournament warmup for
the Presidents Cup, which will be played Dec. 11-13 in his native
Australia. He also plans to play more golf than usual early next
year to get tournament ready _ but not for Augusta National or any
other major on American soil that has eluded him. The winner of two
British Opens, Norman is better known for being the only player to
lose all four majors in playoffs.
	   Norman admits that getting his game back to the level he expects
would automatically mean getting into contention in the majors once
again, but he insists that won't drive him the way it once did.
	   ``I don't know that majors do anything for me,'' Norman said.
``I want to enjoy playing golf to the level I know I can play it. I
don't have extra motivation to win because everyone thinks you
should have won more majors. I don't want to fall into that trap
again.''
	   He is excited about arriving on the first tee of any tournament
and getting to the 18th green, hopefully with a low number on his
card. But the travel, the routine of the PGA Tour is not something
the 43-year-old Norman relishes.
	   Where Norman goes from here _ and how long it will take to get
there _ is yet to be known.
	   ``I just can't imagine that he's going to struggle much,'' Fred
Couples said. ``And if he does, it won't be for long.''

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Some dlrs 277 million has been pledged to help
Peru fight illegal drug production, Prime Minister Alberto Pandolfi
said Wednesday.
	   The money will finance programs to give impoverished farmers in
Peru's jungle highlands alternatives to growing the coca leaves
used to make cocaine. Peru is one of the world's largest coca leaf
producers.
	   The decision to give the money was made at a meeting in Brussels
that ended Wednesday.
	   The United States will contribute dlrs 150 million, the United
Nations, dlrs 32 million; the European Union, dlrs 31 million;
Spain, dlrs 11 million; Canada, dlrs 10 million; and Germany, dlrs
8.5 million.
	   Coca cultivation in Peru has shrunk by 40 percent in the past
two years due to lower prices and a successful program of shooting
or forcing down suspected drug flights in Peru's jungle, U.S.
officials say.

	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) _ Kodak laid off about 200 workers from its
Tijuana factory after a major client dropped orders for photocopy
machines.
	   Kodak spokesman German Mendez declined to name the client that
dropped the orders.
	   Before the announcement, Kodak had employed about 600 people at
the factory _ one of an estimated 2,700 assembly plants operating
across the border just south of San Diego.
	   It is the first time that the Rochester, New York-based company
has laid off workers in Tijuana since it began operating there in
1987.
	   ___
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ Search operations to locate a missing
single-engine plane carrying a missionary family from the United
States have been suspended, charity officials said.
	   The plane is believed to have crashed six weeks ago in the
middle of the Bolivian rain forests. No signs of the plane or its
occupants have been found.
	   Several Bolivian air force and missionary planes and helicopters
were combing a vast, densely forested reach in the middle of the
country, said Ron Gouge, a member of the World Gospel Mission in
Santa Cruz, 450 miles (720 kilometers) east of La Paz.
	   ``Over the years, planes have gone down in these jungles and in
the swampy areas and they have never been found again,'' said
Gospel Mission President Tom Hermiz.
	   The plane was carrying an American missionary, his wife and
their two children, a Bolivian pastor, a seminary student and his
wife.
	   The Cessna CP-1528 disappeared while flying from the village of
Yucuma on the eastern slopes of the Andes to the city of Santa
Cruz. The area where the plane disappeared is covered with dense
and inaccessible forestss.

Dollar higher against yen, Tokyo stocks fall in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar traded higher against the yen early
Thursday, while Japanese stocks slipped as investors awaited
details of an upcoming government package to stimulate the economy.
	   The dollar bought 121.64 yen at 9 a.m. (0000 GMT), up 0.52 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of
121.72 yen overnight.
	   ``The market is waiting to see the contents of the package, but
we don't expect any surprises,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant
foreign exchange manager at ABN-Amro Bank.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is expected to decide later
Thursday on a basic framework for the stimulus plan and to release
details on Monday.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, prices were lower on growing doubts
about whether the government will cut Japan's unpopular national
consumption tax, traders said.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 108.78 points,
or 0.75 percent, to 14,319.24 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Wednesday, the index gained 319.93 points, or 2.27
percent.
	   The opposition Liberal Party is pushing for a cut in the 5
percent consumption tax, but it could meet opposition from the
ruling LDP. The two parties are currently discussing forming an
alliance.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 4.75 points, or 0.43 percent, to 1,093.37.
The TOPIX rose 19.8 points, or 1.84 percent, the previous day.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average lost
40.16 points to finish Wednesday's session at 8,823.82.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond was unchanged from Wednesday's finish of 0.855 percent. Its
price remained at 108.37 yen.

Examples of advances in animal medicine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With MED-US-Pet Care &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Samples of advances in animal medicine:
	   _Pet owners who wince at the thought of a cancer-ridden dog
losing a leg can now consider an option besides amputation. The
process, called limb sparring, costs dlrs 1,000- dlrs 1,500, about
twice as much as amputation. Veterinary oncologists at Colorado
State University have performed 300 in the past 12 years, and
consider it at the forefront of what they do.
	   ``To a degree, I think we have maximized what surgery, radiation
and chemotherapy can do by themselves,'' said Stephen Withrow, the
hospital's chief of oncology.
	   Doctors there keep a ``bone bank,'' limbs collected from animals
who died of noninfectious diseases. Surgeons replace cancerous
bones with the healthy ones. If successful, in 18 months the animal
will have accepted 80 percent of the new graft.
	   ___
	   Veterinary surgeons at the University of California, Davis,
School of Veterinary Medicine perform 25 to 40 kidney transplants a
week. The procedure works best on cats because they tend to accept
a new organ better than other animals, including dogs, says John D.
Wooldridge, a small-animal surgeon.
	   Wooldridge stressed that the procedure _ which costs dlrs 3,000
to dlrs 4,000 _ is intended for cats that are healthy aside from
renal problems.
	   Cats from local animal shelters or cats that have been used for
research projects and would otherwise be euthanized often serve as
donors. At UC Davis and some other centers, veterinarians require
that owners adopt the donor cat, which can function with one
kidney.
	   For that reason, Wooldridge doesn't foresee performing full
heart or liver transplants anytime soon. ``We'd have to kill a
healthy animal to save a sick animal.''
	   ___
	   To address a cardiac condition found in the valves of dogs,
veterinarians mimic the balloon angioplasty technique used to open
up human arteries. Doctors pass a catheter into the deformed
valves, then inflate the balloon to enable blood to pass more
freely, said Dr. David H. Knight, chief of cardiology at the
University of Pennsylvania's veterinary hospital.
	   The balloon helps alleviate the pressure of too narrow valves,
which could otherwise force the dogs into congestive heart failure.
The procedure, called a balloon valvioplasty, runs dlrs 1,200- dlrs
1,500 and generally has a low death rate. The hospital has been
performing them for eight to 10 years. Although less common,
doctors also perform open heart surgery.

Insurance for pets booming
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With MED-US-Pet Care &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Rewards Plus of America, which puts together benefits packages
for companies to offer workers, recently added a new product to its
standard lineup of mutual funds and term life policies: pet
insurance.
	   Executives at the Baltimore, Maryland-based business weren't
sure they heard quite right when a West Coast client said there was
a lot of demand for the product.
	   ``We were all laughing and telling the dog jokes,'' said Frank
Longwell, vice president of marketing.
	   But six months later, pet insurance is one of the company's
second or third most popular voluntary benefits, trailing only
slightly behind more traditional products such as automobile
insurance. Workers may have the premiums deducted from their
paychecks.
	   From dlrs 5,000 kidney transplants to chemotherapy treatments
that can cost from hundreds to thousands of dollars, advanced care
for animals doesn't come cheap.
	   In terms of what veterinarians can do for pets, ``it's primarily
a limitation of funds as much as anything else,'' says Cynthia
Cook, a veterinary ophthalmologist in San Jose, California.
	   Veterinary Pet Insurance, the nation's largest pet insurer,
based in Anaheim, California, expects more than a 200 percent
increase in business this year. Since its founding 18 years ago,
the company has sold nearly 750,000 policies and expects the trend
toward insuring pets to continue.
	   ``They're part of the family, and people want to take care of
them,'' said company president Jack Stevens.
	   VPI covers 6,500 known medical conditions, exempting hereditary
and congenital conditions. Premium plans start at dlrs 49 and dlrs
159 a year.

Cone signs one-year contract with Yankees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Hours before he could have become a free agent,
pitcher David Cone signed a one-year, dlrs 8 million contract to
remain with the New York Yankees on Wednesday.
	   With incentives, the deal could be worth as much as dlrs 9.75
million.
	   Cone probably could have made more money on the open market, but
he decided to stay with the Yankees after twice extending the
deadline for becoming a free agent.
	   ``I always made it clear that my first choice was the Yankees,''
he said in a conference call Wednesday night. ``That's where I want
to be, where I want to end my career.''
	   Cone, who won the 1994 AL Cy Young Award with Kansas City, said
he thought he got ``fair market value'' in the new contract.
	   ``Some people might second-guess me for not testing the free
agent waters, but I'm satisfied,'' he said.
	   The 35-year-old Cone was 20-7 with a 3.55 ERA last season as New
York set an American League record with 114 victories and won the
World Series. His 20 wins tied for the AL lead Roger Clemens and
Rick Helling.
	   ``We are extremely happy to retain such a vital part of our
championship club and one of the best pitchers in baseball,'' said
Yankees general manager Brian Cashman.
	   Cone had until midnight to decide whether to exercise his dlrs
5.5 million option for next season, become a free agent or work out
a new deal with the Yankees.

Reputed Hong Kong mob boss to get verdict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A reputed mob boss and 35 underlings arrived in
a mainland Chinese court early Thursday to hear verdicts in a
sensational case centering around murders, kidnappings and arms
smuggling, Hong Kong Radio reported.
	   Security was tight around the courthouse in Guangzhou as Cheung
Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender,'' arrived to learn his fate. The
case could carry the death penalty.
	   Security personnel wore bullet-proof vests and carried machine
guns, with armored vehicles positioned around the courthouse in
Guangzhou, which is about 100 miles (160 kms) north of the Chinese
border, the radio report said.
	   Hong Kong media have said previously the tight security was put
in place out of concerns that the reputed gangsters could be the
targets of assassins who don't want them revealing any secrets.
	   The case has drawn considerable attention in Hong Kong, as it is
the first high-profile cross-border trial to be held since the
territory reverted to Chinese rule from Britain last year. The case
is closed to journalists, but it has been widely covered by Hong
Kong newspapers and broadcasters.
	   Hong Kong does not execute people, and some legal experts have
raised questions about the propriety of trying suspects from Hong
Kong, for some crimes allegedly committed there, in a court in
China, where the death penalty is often imposed.
	   Hong Kong authorities have said they could not take over the
case, because many of the crimes, including two prominent
kidnappings, were never reported to Hong Kong police.
	   In the reported kidnappings, the victims _ identified in press
reports as Victor Li, the son of property magnate Li Ka-shing, and
Walter Kwok, chairman of blue-chip developer Sun Hung Kai
Properties _ are said to have paid ransom totaling 1.6 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 205 million).
	   The alleged mobsters are also accused of murdering a mainland
Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, robbing seven gold
shops in Hong Kong and wounding several people with their assault
rifles in broad daylight, according to Hong Kong press reports.
	   They were also charged with smuggling firearms into Hong Kong,
media have reported.

People kidnapped, lawyer beaten _ all in the name of law in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A lawyer is jailed and beaten for
requesting access to files on his client. People are kidnapped,
``sentenced'' _ and sometimes executed _ by separatist guerrillas.
	   In Kosovo, both Serbs and Albanians are victims, not only of
war, but of a legal system gone haywire.
	   Like other pillars of Kosovo society, the rule of law has been
eroded under the bloodshed and hatred generated by the conflict
between Serbian government forces and militant members of the
Serbian province's ethnic Albanian majority fighting for
independence.
	   Albanians complain of relatives held by Serb authorities for
months of ``investigative custody'' without any prospect of charges
being laid. The ethnic Albanian Council for the Defense of Human
Rights and Freedoms says about 1,800 Kosovo Albanians are in
pretrial detention, facing long periods in prison without trial and
with little access to lawyers.
	   Only a little more than 100 Serbs have been detained by
Albanians. But their fate is perhaps even more chilling. Kidnapped
by the Kosovo Liberation Army, the lucky ones reappear after months
of being held in isolation. Others disappear for good or turn up as
decomposing bodies on a roadside.
	   Such happenings put both sides afoul of the Oct. 12 agreement
intended to halt Kosovo's eight-month war. The agreement says no
one can be prosecuted for crimes ``related to the conflict in
Kosovo except for crimes against humanity and international law.''
	   Additionally, the International Committee of the Red Cross is
supposed to have access to detained people. That, too, is not
happening, even as both sides complain of torture _ and worse _ by
Serb police or KLA guerrillas.
	   The Red Cross says it has been allowed to visit those sentenced
by Yugoslav courts but not those in pretrial custody.
	   The Serbs say those detained in connection to the conflict are
suspected of real crimes, such as terrorism. But ethnic Albanians,
particularly young or middle-aged men, say any encounter with Serb
police _ such as a routine stop at a checkpoint _ can bring
detention.
	   ``They are not asking, they are just saying you are young and
you are Albanian, you are a terrorist,'' complained Skandar Ferizi,
42, in the western village of Kodralji.
	   Albanian human rights activists say arrest is only the start of
the nightmare, which in the past year resulted in five deaths while
in Serb police custody.
	   Ismet Berdynaj, project coordinator of the Pristina-based
Council, says most detainees are tortured into making false
``confessions'' that are used against them later.
	   Pristina lawyer Destan Rukiqi calls Serb prisons ``concentration
camps in which prisoners are tortured.''
	   Rukiqi claims to have personally experienced the seamy side of
the Serb legal system, which is at best controlled by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic. In June, he says, he was thrown into
prison and badly beaten after complaining to Judge Danica
Marinkovic when she refused to allow him to see paperwork relating
to his client's case.
	   His client, 32-year-old Cen Dugolli, accused of terrorist
activity, died in custody while Rukiqi was in jail.
	   Marinkovic refused an interview request.
	   Amanda Williamson of the Red Cross said the organization was
visiting about 160 people already sentenced by Yugoslav authorities
and was demanding complete figures on detainees and full access to
them.
	   She also said the Red Cross was looking into more than 100 cases
of people reportedly held by the guerrilla KLA, but had made little
progress so far.
	   ``We still have problems to find any information, let alone
access, on Serbs who've been abducted,'' Williamson said.
	   Among those the Red Cross is trying to see are two Serb
journalists of the Tanjug state news agency. On Nov. 1, the KLA
said it ``sentenced'' the two to 60 days' imprisonment for
``violation and disregard of rules on civilian and military
organization'' set by the group.

Tipper Gore visits Honduras to assess hurricane relief needs

	   CIUDAD SANDINO, Nicaragua (AP) _ Hundreds of half-naked children
in a refugee camp swarmed Tipper Gore on Wednesday, asking her for
help to put their lives back together after the devastation of
Hurricane Mitch.
	   ``We'll go back and tell more people what you are suffering,''
the wife of U.S. Vice President Al Gore told Francisca Ramos, who
brought her toddler to see Mrs. Gore.
	   Mrs. Gore, representing President Bill Clinton, arrived
Wednesday in the Nicaraguan capital, accompanied by professional
baseball player Dennis Martinez, six members of Congress and a
promise of more supplies and support.
	   Stunned by the storm that killed some 10,000 people, governments
and aid organizations from around the world have promised hundreds
of millions of dollars in relief, ranging from bags of beans to
forgiveness of millions in foreign debt.
	   ``We are heartened by the solidarity and brotherhood of the
international community,'' Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman told
Mrs. Gore in a meeting at Aleman's office.
	   But Aleman said his country still needs more funds, and many
people in Honduras and Nicaragua say they have seen little sign of
the foreign aid reportedly flowing into the country.
	   ``Almost everyone here is sick and almost everyone has multiple
problems _ respiratory problems from being out in the water so
long, fungal infections, open sores, diarrhea, parasites,'' said
Lillian Hall, coordinator at the camp for the Quaker group Pronica.
	   Mrs. Gore said Wednesday the United States would donate dlrs 1.5
million for medical aid in addition to dlrs 80 million pledged
earlier.
	   At the Ciudad Sandino camp, 20 miles (32 kms) from Managua, Mrs.
Gore helped to distribute water bottles, toilet paper and wash
buckets, and spent nearly two hours talking with children.
Martinez, a Nicaraguan who pitches for the Atlanta Braves, served
as translator.
	   ``I'd like to learn English to speak like you,'' one child told
her.
	   ``The eyes of the children are filled with hope,'' she said.
``All we can do is tell the world of the devastation here so they
can help.''
	   Mrs. Gore was part of a first wave of foreign visitors arriving
to survey the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch, which caused
massive flooding across Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and
Guatemala.
	   French President Jacques Chirac was expected to visit next week.
France forgave the debts of Honduras and Nicaragua on Tuesday.
	   Spain also announced it would pardon about dlrs 64 million _
nearly 30 percent of what is owed to Spain by the four countries _
by waiving payments due before the year 2002.
	   Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo on Wednesday launched a major
fund-raising campaign to help victims. Mexico's navy also sent a
medical frigate to Honduras.
	   Mrs. Gore left for Washington later Wednesday, where she was
scheduled to brief Clinton on damage caused by Mitch.
	   Elizabeth Dole, head of the American Red Cross, was also in
Central America this week to survey damage and help in the relief
effort. She left from Managua on Wednesday to return to the United
States.

Endangered Fijian languages will be taught in schools
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT KEITH-REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ All schools in Fiji have been directed to
teach two local languages throughout students' 12 years of formal
schooling in an effort to avert their decay, the government said
Thursday.
	   The directive, which covers Fijian and Rotuman, also applies to
students who have government scholarships to attend the University
of the South Pacific in Suva, the capital.
	   English, Fijian and Hindi are Fiji's three constitutionally
prescribed official languages, but because of dialect differences,
English has become the main language.
	   But the wide use of English has left the Pacific Island nation's
380,000 people with a diminishing grip on their own languages.
	   In a statement, Fiji's Cabinet said there was no need for the
compulsory teaching of Hindi, spoken by about 40 percent of the
population, because it was in no danger of falling into disuse.
	   Fijian has its origins in Melanesian and Polynesian languages
and has about 300 varieties, said Dr. Paul Geraghty, an Irish
linguist fluent in all of them and who recently produced the first
comprehensive Fijian language dictionary.
	   He said the differences between some dialects were slight but
between others so large that people in western Fiji could not
understand those in the east.
	   For this reason, most Fijians have become fluent in English or
``standard'' Fijian, which evolved from several dialects used in
the district around Suva.
	   Standard Fijian is used by newspapers, radio stations and in
government documents.
	   Rotuma, an isolated small island 400 miles (640 kms) north of
Suva, is the only purely Polynesian local society in the 360 island
Fiji group.
	   Its language is a 3,000-year-old, Polynesian-based tongue spoken
only by the 12,000 Rotuman people, of whom only about 4,000 remain
on the island. About 8,000 Rotuman people live on Viti Levu, the
main island of Fiji.

Palestinians reject Israel's conditional ratification

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After several postponements, the Israeli
government has narrowly approved the latest Mideast peace accord
calling for withdrawal from parts of the West Bank. But the
ministers attached several conditions that were immediately
rejected by Palestinian officials.
	   The stipulations, and a threat to annex West Bank land if the
Palestinians do not comply, did not ease the concerns of one of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's key constituencies _ right-wing
Jews who live in settlements in the West Bank.
	   The settlers rejected the Cabinet's decision Wednesday and said
they would take as much West Bank land as they could before Israel
begins its promised troop withdrawal.
	   Under the deal, signed last month in Washington, Israel is to
begin a phased withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank on
Monday in return for Palestinian security measures against Islamic
militants.
	   Wednesday's vote had been delayed several times, in part due to
a suicide bombing in Jerusalem by an Islamic militant last week.
Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said the pullback would likely
not begin for at least another week, following a parliamentary vote
scheduled on Tuesday.
	   Approval in the Knesset is necessary for Israel to begin the
withdrawal. With the conditions set by the Cabinet, the fragile
deal will likely face more obstacles before it is carried out.
	   The Cabinet will meet before each stage of the phased pullback
to vote on whether the Palestinians were meeting Israel's security
demands. If not, ministers would have the option to halt the
process by voting against the next phase.
	   Netanyahu said the agreement would stop altogether if the
Palestine National Council, the Palestinian parliament-in-exile,
does not hold a formal vote by mid-December to revoke clauses in
the PLO founding charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   Under the agreement, the PNC is to convene to reaffirm changes
it voted on in April 1996 and does not mention a vote.
	   Any additional pullback would turn over no more than 1 percent
of the West Bank to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's control.
	   And at a news conference following the vote, Netanyahu said
Israel ``reserves the right'' to annex large chunks of the West
Bank if Arafat makes good on a threat to declare independence next
May.
	   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in 1967. The
Palestinians, who make up the vast majority of the West Bank
population, hope to establish an independent homeland in the
territory.
	   Palestinian officials said the conditions were violations of the
accord signed in the presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Washington on Oct. 23.
	   ``We spoke to the American administration and filed an official
complaint regarding the conditions. We asked Mr. Netanyahu before
to stop the threats and conditions, but he chose threats, which
means he does not want there to be trust between us,'' said an
angry Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official who helped
negotiate the accord.
	   After seven hours of debate Wednesday, eight of 17 ministers
voted in favor of the condition-riddled deal. But five ministers
abstained and four voted against it, a move that showed their
allegiances are with the settlers and not the prime minister.
	   But in a boost for Netanyahu, hawkish Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon voted for the deal. Sharon's refusal to reveal where he
stood on the accord before the vote led to speculation that he
would abstain.
	   Calling himself ``the father of settlements,'' Sharon appealed
to the right wing to trust the accord and said the government would
continue to expand Jewish settlements. As housing minister in the
early 1990s, Sharon oversaw a dramatic expansion of settlements.
	   On Thursday, the government was to begin accepting contract bids
for a new Jewish neighborhood on a disputed Jerusalem hilltop.
	   But leaders of the powerful Jewish settler lobby said it wasn't
enough. Flexing their numbers, thousands of supporters staged a
protest rally in Tel Aviv on Wednesday against the accord.
	   ``We will work on every front. We will do everything possible to
take over the land around us. We will strengthen our movement and
charge onto the national political stage and run against
Netanyahu,'' said settler leader Pinchas Wallerstein.

Pinochet judges face deciding on whether torture can be legal
</HEADLINE>
policy &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Court hearing resumes 1000 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ While emotional demonstrators chant outside and
lawyers inside calmly debate if torture is acceptable government
policy, Britain's highest court must decide whether to free Chile's
arrested former dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   The hearing before a five-judge panel in the House of Lords was
scheduled to end Thursday, its sixth day, with lawyers for Spanish
and British prosecutors making a final plea that some crimes are
beyond all immunity. Judgment may be delivered next week.
	   ``It is essentially a question of interpretation,''
international law expert David Lloyd-Jones told the court
Wednesday. He noted that a strict reading of Britain's 1978 State
Immunity Act might give protection from arrest for acts that were
``part of some state policy, however terrible that policy might
be.''
	   Because of the importance of the case and the legal precedent it
may set, the judges called in Lloyd-Jones to give an independent
opinion as a so-called ``friend of the court.''
	   Pinochet was arrested on Oct. 16 on a Spanish extradition
warrant. But England's High Court quashed the arrest, saying that
the 1978 immunity act granted him immunity from arrest in Britain
as a former foreign head of state.
	   The Spanish warrant cited charges of genocide, torture and
kidnapping during Pinochet's 17-year-rule after he toppled Salvador
Allende, an elected Marxist, in 1973.
	   A report by Chile's government says some 3,000 people were
murdered or disappeared at the hands of secret police under
Pinochet. Chile, however, has protested his arrest, saying it
strains the country's democracy, carefully built since Pinochet
stepped down in 1990.
	   With placards declaring ``Pinochet must pay,'' and ``Wanted:
Augusto Pinochet'' a group of some 50 protesters demonstrate daily
outside the House of Lords, part of the elegant Houses of
Parliament and a prime area for tourists.
	   Pinochet, arrested while recuperating from back surgery, remains
in a north London hospital under police guard.
	   On Wednesday, Clive Nicholls, a lawyer for Pinochet, said the
1978 act was so broad that even Adolf Hitler could not be tried in
this country.
	   Pinochet's British lawyers maintain that if he is to be tried,
the right place is Chile _ where he has so far enjoyed immunity
partly because of laws he introduced _ or before an international
tribunal, such as the ones set up specially to try war crimes and
mass murder in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.
	   Hitler committed suicide, and other Nazi leaders were tried
before a specially constituted tribunal in Nuremberg.

Beloved Japanese film critic Nagaharu Yodogawa dies at 89
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese film critic Nagaharu Yodogawa, the host of
a long-running television program featuring Hollywood films, has
died of heart failure at the age of 89, a spokesman said Thursday.
	   Yodogawa recorded his last broadcast earlier this week after
hosting the ``Sunday Western Film Theater'' program for more than
30 years, said Asahi National Broadcasting Co. spokesman Shiriki
Yamakawa.
	   Yodogawa died late Wednesday at a Tokyo hospital.
	   Known for his folksy commentary and gentle demeanor, the
white-haired, bespectacled Yodogawa habitually ended the program
with his signature sign off ``sayonara, sayonara, sayonara.''
	   Born in a geisha house in the western Japanese city of Kobe, he
worked as an editor of a magazine devoted to motion pictures for
two decades after World War II. He took up his role as a television
commentator in 1966.

Graf wins, closing in on Chase Championship berth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Seles match &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VILLANOVA, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Finally playing without pain,
Steffi Graf is one match away from a berth in the season-ending
Chase Championships.
	   ``To be able to play through continuously without a break would
be welcomed,'' said Graf, who beat Mary Joe Fernandez 6-3, 7-6,
(7-4) in a first-round match Wednesday at the Advanta
Championships.
	   When Irina Spirlea lost to fifth-seeded Monica Seles 6-3, 6-4 in
a second-round match Wednesday night, it opened the way for Graf to
qualify for the elite 16-player tournament in New York next week.
	   Graf currently is 17th, but would pass Spirlea in the year-long
points race by beating Elena Likhovtseva on Thursday.
	   Last weekend, Graf returned from wrist surgery to capture
Leipzig's Sparkassen Cup International in her native Germany.
	   ``I just have been feeling so much better, and I hope I can
shake the injuries that have slowed my season,'' she said.
	   Graf's victory at Leipzig made her the top money winner in
women's tennis with about dlrs 20.5 million in career earnings,
surpassing the dlrs 20.3 million by Martina Navratilova.
	   In earlier matches Wednesday, third-seeded Jana Novotna, the
1996 titlist and 1998 Wimbledon champion, was upset by Natasha
Zvereva of Belarus 6-4, 6-4 and fourth-seeded Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario of Spain was beaten by South Africa's Amanda
Coetzer 6-4, 6-1. Sanchez-Vicario had won 14 of their previous 17
meetings.
	   Seles, Novotna, Sanchez-Vicario, Zvereva and Coetzer have
already qualified for the Chase Championships.
	   Graf, the 1995 Advanta winner, had little trouble in the first
set, then won the second after Fernandez rallied for a 4-3 lead.
Graf relied on a strong backhand to hold off Fernandez 7-4 in the
tiebreaker.
	   Graf is 16-0 against Fernandez, dropping only two sets in 12
years.
	   ``I felt it was really close,'' Graf said. ``I broke her a few
times, but she kept coming back. I knew that I couldn't make a lot
of mistakes.''
	   Said Fernandez, who has played in only eight tournaments this
season because of a wrist injury: ``I felt that I could have won
the second set. I think she is playing well. She has endured so
much. I know how tough it is to come back.
	   ``She has always come back and she always seems to get better.''
	   Likhovtseva beat eighth-seeded Sandrine Testud, who retired in
the third set due to a knee injury.
	   Graf, recovering from nagging knee and wrist injuries, said she
believed the Philadelphia-based tournament would be a good way to
get back.
	   ``The surface is a little different and there is always the
problem of dealing with the time change,'' Graf said. ``It would be
great to get to the Championships, but it just means enough to me
to be able to keep playing.''
	   Second-seeded Martina Hingis, who received a bye in the opening
round, had little trouble in a 6-4, 6-1 victory over Brie Rippner.
Hingis won the first three games of each set.
	   Hingis has her sights set on top-ranked Lindsay Davenport.
	   ``She has been on top for a long time,'' Hingis said. ``There
has been a more hectic lifestyle since I've been (No. 2), and
everything has happened so quickly.
	   ``I feel that I'm playing well, and we'll see what happens as
the week go on.''

 &UR; Japan's ruling party unveils new economic stimulus package

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling party outlined
plans Thursday for Japan's biggest stimulus package ever, with
measures totaling more than 14 trillion yen (dlrs 115 billion) to
jumpstart this country's anemic economy.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party proposals will form the basis of an
official government plan to be formally announced on Nov. 16 and
expected to be passed later this month in a special session of
Parliament.
	   The centerpiece of party's package calls for 10 trillion yen
(dlrs 82 billion) in public works-related spending through next
March and 4 trillion yen (dlrs 33 billion) in income tax cuts next
year.
	   It also recommends cutting the effective corporate tax rate to
40 percent in the fiscal year starting next April, down from the
current rate of about 46 percent.
	   The party said other tax measures to stimulate housing demand
and private investment should also be considered.
	   Japan has been mired in a deep recession, and the government is
struggling to come up with a strategy to prevent the economy from
shrinking in fiscal 1999 for a third consecutive year.
	   The government estimates gross domestic product will contract by
1.8 percent for the current fiscal year, which ends on March 31,
1999.

White Sox trade Cameron to Reds for Konerko
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Mike Cameron, once one of the most promising
young players in the Chicago White Sox organization, was traded
Wednesday to the Cincinnati Reds for first baseman Paul Konerko.
	   Cameron, whom the White Sox thought would be their center
fielder of the future, slumped last season, batting just .210 with
eight homers, 43 RBIs and 27 stolen bases in 141 games.
	   In parts of four seasons with the White Sox, the 25-year-old
Cameron batted .229 with 23 homers and 100 RBIs. The centerfield
job will probably now go to Jeff Abbott.
	   The trade was the Reds' second in two days. On Tuesday, they
sent Bret Boone and Mike Remlinger to Atlanta for Denny Neagle and
Michael Tucker.
	   Konerko, like Cameron, was also a disappoinment last season.
	   He played in 75 games with the Dodgers and Reds, batting .217
with seven homers and 29 RBIs. Konerko, 22, had been acquired by
the Reds from the Dodgers along with Dennys Reyes in the July 4
deal that sent All-Star reliever Jeff Shaw to Los Angeles.
	   The Reds had projected Konerko as their power hitter of the
future and even tried him at third and left field, but he struggled
both at the plate and in the field.
	   After three weeks with the Reds in which he batted just .182, he
was demoted back to Triple-A and then called back up the final
month.
	   In 1997, Konerko batted .323 with 37 homers and 127 RBIs in 130
games at Triple-A Albuquerque. He was the Dodgers' first-round pick
in 1994 and had 106 homers over five minor-league seasons.
	   Acquiring Konerko could mean Frank Thomas, the subject of trade
rumors, will stay as a permanent DH.
	   Or the deal could signal that the Sox will move switch-hitter
Greg Norton from first to third and not re-sign free agent third
baseman Robin Ventura.

Fate of disputed Kuril Islands to dominate Russian-Japanese summit

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The fate of the disputed Kuril Islands was in the
balance Thursday as President Boris Yeltsin prepared to meet with
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and reportedly deliver his
long-awaited response to Japan's proposals to resolve the conflict.
	   The four islands north of Japan and known in that country as the
Northern Territories were once held by Tokyo but have been
controlled by Moscow since the end of World War II. Both nations
claimed ownership, and the dispute is the main reason the two
haven't signed a formal peace treaty for the war.
	   Former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto presented new
proposals for ending the dispute when he and Yeltsin met in Japan
in April. The proposals have not been made public. Media reports
have said Tokyo suggests taking over the islands legally but
allowing Russia to retain control for some time.
	   Yeltsin has long stalled, but is expected to finally give an
answer when he meets with Obuchi behind closed doors on Thursday,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The Kremlin does not intend to disclose the proposal or
Yeltsin's response, ITAR-Tass said.
	   During their summit in Krasnoyarsk in November 1997, Yeltsin and
Hashimoto pledged to make the utmost effort to sign a peace treaty
by 2000. But Japan wants the treaty to spell out the status of the
Kurils.
	   ``I believe that our generation carries the responsibility for
making sure that the problems that have arisen in this century are
solved before it is over and are not shifted to the shoulders of
our children and grandchildren,'' Obuchi told the Russian daily
newspaper Izvestia in an interview published Wednesday.
	   Tokyo got legal control of the islands now in contention_
Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai islets _ in a treaty
with Russia in 1875. The Soviet Union took them back in the closing
days of World War II, a move Japan has protested ever since as
illegal.
	   The islands total only about 4,000 square miles (10,350 square
kilometers), slightly larger than the Caribbean island of Puerto
Rico. The waters around them, however, are rich fishing grounds.
	   The summit was to be Yeltin's first high-level meeting since his
latest illness sidelined him a month ago. And the president's
office said Wednesday that the 67-year-old leader planned to visit
Japan next spring or summer.
	   Russia's ambassador to Japan, Alexander Panov, said recently
that Japan needs to improve its relations with Russia before any
tough decision can be made on the Kurils dispute.
	   About a week before the summit, Japan announced plans to give an
dlrs 800 million loan to Russia. The money is part of a dlrs 22.6
billion bailout package arranged by the International Monetary Fund
but put on hold after Russia succumbed to economic crisis in
August, devaluing the ruble and defaulting on domestic treasury
debts.
	   No timetable has been set for the release of the loan, but
Obuchi's spokesman Sadaaki Numata said it ``would not be a
months-long wait,'' the Interfax news agency reported.

Report: Reputed Hong Kong mob boss sentenced to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A reputed Hong Kong mob boss was sentenced to
death Thursday after being convicted in a sensational trial in
China that centered around kidnappings and arms smuggling, the
official Chinese news agency Xinhua reported.
	   Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender,'' learned his fate in a
courthouse in Guangzhou that was ringed by security personnel
wearing bullet-proof vests and carrying machine guns.
	   Four of Cheung's alleged accomplices, Chan Chi-ho, Ma
Shangzhong, Liang Hui and Chin Hon-sau, were also sentenced to
death at a hearing in the Intermediate People's Court of Guangzhou,
about 100 miles (160 kms) north of the Chinese border, Xinhua said.
	   Two others, Chu Yuk-sing and Li Wan, received death sentences
that the court was suspending for two years, giving them time to
demonstrate good behavior and perhaps have the sentences reduced to
prison terms, Xinhua said.
	   Twenty-nine other members of Cheung's gang were sentenced to
prison terms, some of them for life, Xinhua said, citing a public
announcement from the court.
	   Cheung and his gang were charged with a variety of crimes
including kidnapping, arms and explosives trafficking, robbery and
concealing stolen goods _ and the court convicted them on all of
those charges, Xinhua said.
	   Hong Kong media had previously reported the case also concerned
the murders of a mainland Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong
resident. The Xinhua report made no mention of any murder charges.
	   The Hong Kong press reports have said the gangsters would have
10 days to appeal their sentences.
	   The case has drawn considerable attention in Hong Kong, as it is
the first high-profile cross-border trial to be held since the
territory reverted to Chinese rule from Britain last year. The
trial was closed to journalists, but details have been widely
reported by Hong Kong newspapers and broadcasters.
	   Hong Kong does not execute people, and some legal experts have
raised questions about the propriety of trying suspects from Hong
Kong, for some crimes allegedly committed there, in a court in
China, where the death penalty is often imposed.
	   Hong Kong authorities have said they could not take over the
case, because many of the crimes, including two prominent
kidnappings, were never reported to Hong Kong police. Also, Hong
Kong officials pointed out that some of the crimes were plotted and
carried out in China.
	   In the reported kidnappings, the victims _ identified in press
reports as Victor Li, the son of property magnate Li Ka-shing, and
Walter Kwok, chairman of blue-chip developer Sun Hung Kai
Properties _ are said to have paid ransom totaling 1.6 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 205 million).

U.N. Security Council meets on Iraq as Annan appeals to Saddam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with meeting ended, Security Council
giving strong backing to secretary-general, new comments from
ambassadors &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council strongly backed
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's appeal to Saddam Hussein to
immediately resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   U.S. Deputy Ambassador Peter Burleigh, the current council
president, said Wednesday that all 15 members would prefer a
diplomatic solution to military action.
	   But in separate comments he said were made in his role as acting
U.S. ambassador, Burleigh said Wednesday, ``the ball is in Iraq's
court,'' and emphasized that Annan's statement means Iraq must
cooperate. The United States has threatened airstrikes unless Iraq
resumes cooperation.
	   After the council offered Baghdad a comprehensive review of its
compliance with U.N. resolutions _ without linking it to the
possible lifting of sanctions _ Iraq halted all dealings with the
U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, on Oct. 31.
	   Annan on Wednesday called the council's offer of a comprehensive
review ``a genuine opportunity'' to move toward lifting sanctions.
He cut short a trip to North Africa and was to return to U.N.
headquarters in New York Thursday.
	   ``The comprehensive review will map out the remaining steps,
provided Iraq cooperates, thus allowing them to see light at the
end of the tunnel,'' he said in a statement issued at the United
Nations.
	   ``This would be good for the Iraqi people, for the region and
for the world,'' he said.
	   Russia requested the emergency council meeting after 233 U.N.
personnel were pulled out of Iraq early Wednesday because of the
possibility of airstrikes by the United States to compel Iraq to
resume cooperation with U.N. inspectors.
	   The council didn't discuss any new diplomatic initiatives. But
British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock told CNN earlier that ``the
diplomatic move isn't dead yet.'' Still, he said a military
solution is now ``a serious option.''
	   Iraq says it will not cooperate with weapons inspectors until
the council commits to a timetable to lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait that led to the
Gulf War.
	   Russia, China and France had been angry that the council had not
been informed immediately of U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler's decision to suddenly withdraw the entire inspection team
from Iraq.
	   But U.N. security coordinator Benon Sevan told the council there
had been no consultation about 58 prior U.N. evacuations, saying,
``Let's not politicize the safety and security of U.N. personnel,''
according to diplomats at the closed meeting.
	   After the council meeting, Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said
his concerns were allayed.
	   ``There are circumstances under which the program managers have
to think about the safety of the people who work under their
authority,'' he said.
	   The council is sharply divided over the use of force against
Iraq. The United States and Britain maintain that they can take
military action, based on previous U.N. resolutions. Russia and
China insist that fresh council approval is needed.
	   In a letter to Annan _ the first official Iraqi reaction since
the pullout _ Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz gave no
indication that Baghdad was prepared to rescind its ban on dealing
with the weapons inspectors.
	   Earlier, Butler said he ordered all inspectors to leave Baghdad
because of a strong recommendation from the United States and an
``increasingly hostile'' atmosphere in Iraq.
	   Butler said he spent almost all day Tuesday dealing with ``an
absolutely unfounded allegation'' by Iraq that an inspector had
committed an act of espionage. He would not disclose the
nationality of the inspector, except to say he was not American.
	   Aziz accused the UNSCOM of acting on orders from the United
States and using the United Nations merely as ``false cover.''

Red Cross, Army develop blood-clotting bandage

<TEXT>
	   FREDERICK, Maryland (AP) _ Army and American Red Cross
researchers say they have developed a bandage that can stop severe
bleeding within seconds, potentially saving thousands of lives on
battlefields, highways and city streets.
	   The experimental bandage and a related foam and spray contain
freeze-dried clotting agents in concentrations 50 to 100 times
greater than in human blood, according to William Drohan, senior
director of plasma research at the Red Cross' Jerome H. Holland
Laboratory in Rockville, Maryland.
	   ``This is really the first significant advance in emergency
treatment to stem blood loss in about 3,000 years,'' Drohan said.
	   The products have stopped arterial bleeding in animals within 15
to 60 seconds, reducing blood loss by 50 to 85 percent, the
scientists said recently.
	   The Army has spent about dlrs 3 million subsidizing the research
because bleeding is the most common cause of battlefield deaths,
according to Col. John Hess, commander of the blood research
detachment at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in
Rockville and inventor of the process that produced the bandage.
	   Drohan said he expects to begin clinical trials within a year at
an Army hospital in Texas, where the bandage will be applied to the
gushing wounds from prostate removal surgery.
	   The foam is intended for bullet wounds and other punctures that
bleed from deep inside the body, Drohan said, while the clotting
spray is for seeping wounds such as severe burns and torn muscle.
	   Such products could prove very useful in emergency medicine and
trauma care, said Dr. LaMont Smith, an attending physician in the
emergency department of the University of Maryland Medical System
in Baltimore.
	   ``That's the name of the game, stopping the bleeding,'' he said.
``It sounds pretty exciting.''
	   The products use a process developed at Fort Detrick in
Frederick, Maryland, that combines two key clotting agents _ a
protein called fibrinogen and an enzyme, thrombin _ derived from
blood plasma. In contact with blood, they instantly begin forming a
sticky lattice called fibrin that adheres to live tissue and
eventually becomes a scab.
	   Another fibrin product called Tisseel, made by Baxter Healthcare
Corp., was approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration
earlier this year. Tisseel's preparation can take up to 40 minutes,
though, limiting its effectiveness in emergencies.
	   The Red Cross' patented fibrin products are ready to use, Drohan
said. The 4-by-4-inch (10-by-10 centimeter) bandage has a stiff,
quarter-inch (half-centimeter) layer of clotting material that
dissolves and coagulates when pressed into a wound.
	   ``If you can see blood, put it on. As soon as blood hits it, it
turns into a gel'' that begins setting within seconds, he said.
	   The fragile bandage could be carried by soldiers and emergency
medical technicians in a protective plastic package, he said.
	   Except for Tisseel, which is used during surgeries, the only way
to stop bleeding is applying pressure to the wound, which sometimes
works and sometimes doesn't, Drohan said.
	   He wouldn't discuss the possible price of the bandage but said
it would become cheaper if genetically engineered animals were used
to manufacture the components by excreting them in their milk. Pigs
are already doing so in a project at Virginia Polytechnic Institute
and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia, Drohan said.
	   ``There is a time when we're able to make a lot of this
material, using transgenic animals, when one or two of these
bandages could be kept in every medicine chest,'' he said.
	   A pint (half liter) of blood contains about one five-hundredth
of a pound of fibrinogen and an even smaller amount of thrombin,
Hess said.

The Makah Indians prepare to resume hunting gray whales

<TEXT>
	   NEAH BAY, Washington (AP) _ Grays are not the most charismatic
of whales.
	   ``Some people call them swimming rocks,'' says National Marine
Fisheries Service biologist Pat Gearin, who tags them with
transmitters and conducts other research here where the Strait of
Juan de Fuca meets the Pacific.
	   They don't offer the crowd-pleasing aerial displays of
humpbacks, killer whales, belugas and some others. Grays mostly
browse placidly in water 50 feet (1.5 meters) deep or less, often
close to shore, stirring up sediment and straining out tiny edible
organisms and small fish using vertical bony plates in their
mouths. Occasionally they dive deeply enough to show their broad,
graceful tails, called flukes.
	   Grays are black or gray with splotches _ not as visibly
individual as killer whales or orcas, whose vivid black-and-white
markings make them as distinctive as pinto ponies. Identification
of grays is based primarily on scars, patches of lighter or darker
pigment and the patches of barnacles that mottle their skin.
	   They don't sing like humpies, whose mysterious calls and
whistles can be found on CDs and tapes at the record store, or use
sound to echolocate like toothed whales. Scientists presume the
grays' clicks and grunts are communication _ the basic message
being ``whale here,'' says research biologist John Calambokidis at
Cascadia Research in Olympia, who has studied marine mammals in
Washington's inland waters since 1977.
	   And they don't form communal pods of related animals like orcas,
a practice humans can relate to. Grays generally travel solo or in
pairs made up of mother and calf. Occasionally, observers see two
or three feeding in the same area, and groups of eight or 10 may be
seen over a quarter mile (half kilometer) during their migrations
between Alaska and Mexico.
	   Baleen whales, those that strain their food from the sea,
generally don't have the ``intricate social systems'' of toothed
whales, Calambokidis said.
	   But the low-profile grays are in the headlines now as the Makah
Indians prepare to resume hunting them in small numbers _ a maximum
of five per year through 2002 _ reviving a tradition that long
defined the tribe on this remote point of land.
	   The hunt poses risks to the hunters as well as the hunted.
Stormy winter weather can be deadly here, and grays have a
reputation for ferocity when attacked.
	   ``That's certainly a reputation that whalers gave them over and
above other whales _ hence their nickname `devil fish,'''
Calambokidis said.
	   And grays have their defenders _ people who simply like knowing
the huge, graceful mammals share the planet, animal-rights
activists whose ships have been anchored offshore here for weeks,
human neighbors who have given names to so-called resident whales,
and whale-watching-boat operators who worry they've taught the
whales to trust boats that could now threaten them.
	   Scientists offer mixed assessments of the notion that grays are
friendly and ``solicit contact,'' as some would have it.
	   ``Whales don't do that out here,'' Gearin says. Resident whales
that browse in the strait _ including ``Buddy,'' who hangs out near
Snow Creek three miles (five kilometers) east _ ``are wild animals
that are going about their business, which is getting something to
eat.''
	   Calambokidis agrees that most feeding residents stick around
when boats approach because they're ``just oblivious.'' But he
believes a small percentage here do exhibit what could be termed
``friendly behavior.'' And he reports an increase in such behavior
among grays in the so-called birthing lagoons off Baja California
	   ``I don't think science has an explanation for it,'' he says.
``It goes beyond curiosity.''
	   Steve Boothe, who operates Snow Creek Charters, believes the
whales are reaching out to their human neighbors.
	   ``Until someone has looked into the whale's eye, they cannot
understand,'' he says.
	   Bob Coster, commander of the Coast Guard station here for three
years and a longtime hunter and wildlife observer, sees it
differently.
	   ``They're curious,'' he says. ``I've had them roll up and look
at me _ I see an animal. ... I really appreciate them, but if
somebody wants to eat one, I don't have a problem with that
either.''
	   For thousands of years, the Makah hunted grays and humpback
whales here at the end of the world, the extreme upper left corner
of the continental United States. The practice helped define the
Makah as a fierce and formidable people, who had a use for every
part of the whale.
	   A central part of Makah life vanished with the end of tribal
whaling in the 1920s, when commercial whaling for oil to light
faraway cities brought the grays to the brink of extinction.
	   Toward the end, whaling ships focused on the so-called birthing
lagoons off Mexico that mark the southern terminus of the grays'
migration, where females and their calves bask in warm seas.
	   ``I don't like to think about that,'' library assistant Laura
Pereira said in a telephone interview from Massachusetts' New
Bedford Whaling Museum.
	   The factory ships rendered blubber into oil on board, using
lower-grade oil and some other body parts for fuel. Baleen _ ``an
early precursor to plastic,'' Pereira says _ was used to make
corset stays, buggy whips and umbrella frames.
	   The meat, for the most part, was left to rot.
	   By the 1920s, the gray-whale population had been reduced to
about 4,000 animals from a peak estimated at about 23,000, federal
officials say.
	   The grays have been rebuilding their population in relative
peace for more than 50 years. In 1994, their numbers estimated at
more than 22,000, they were taken off the Endangered Species List.
	   Last fall, the Makah were cleared to again intercept the fall
and spring migrations. Their first hunt is to take place sometime
this fall from a cedar canoe, backed by motorized chase and support
boats. A ceremonial harpoon strike is to be followed by
high-powered rifle fire to ensure as humane a kill as possible.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Pete Sampras headed home Thursday after
an unexpected first-round exit from the Stockholm Open tennis
tournment that endangered his top world ranking.
	   He lost a three-set match to unheralded Jason Stoltenberg, 7-6
(7-5), 4-6 and 6-4 Wednesday evening, saving seven match points but
ultimately going down to defeat.
	   Afterward, he wasn't angry as might be expected but he
uncharacteristically threw his racket to the court after his
tiebreak loss in the first set, breaking it and earning boos from
the crowd and a warning from the umpire.
	   ``I kind of lost it there a little bit,'' he said.
	   His mind was so focused on last week's disappointing loss to
Briton Greg Rusedski in the finals of the Paris Open, and on the
year-ending ATP Tour Championships in Hannover, Germany, that he
accepted a wild card berth here in hopes of winning points and
padding his world No. 1 lead.
	   ``I felt I needed the best chance possible to try and finish at
No. 1,'' he said. That would make it six years in a row, a record
Sampras covets and thinks will last a long time.
	   It was not to be.
	   Stoltenberg played brilliant tennis, ``my best match for a long,
long time.'' At the end when Sampras was fraying, the Australian
``couldn't do anything wrong, I felt so relaxed.''
	   He double-faulted and fell behind by two points in the last
game, then rallied to even the score at deuce. In the final
frenzied moments, Sampras saved three match points and Stoltenberg
fended off a service break that would have swung momentum to his
rival.
	   The audience of several thousand at Royal Tennis Hall was on its
feet and gave both players a long ovation.
	   Sampras, who has traveled and competed continuously the past
several weeks, will lose 630 points from his No. 1 ATP ranking.
That's more than the 605 that separate him from No. 2 Marcelo Rios,
who this week is playing a tournament in his home country Chile.
	   In other matches, Britain's Tim Henman and Rusedski both
advanced, while No. 5 seed and last year's winner Jonas Bjorkman
was knocked out by fellow Swede Magnus Gustafsson, 6-0, 4-6 and
6-1.
	   Henman reached the quarterfinals with a straight-set victory
over Wayne Ferreira of South Africa, 7-6 (7-3) and 6-4.
	   He broke Ferreira's serve in game two, but then lost five of the
next six games and had to scramble to break Ferreira's serve a
third time to force a tiebreak.
	   ``It was an up-and-down first set,'' Henman said. ``My serving
was erratic at that point.'' He also lost three service games.
	   Rusedski demolished Tommy Haas, 6-1, 6-4. The German won just
two points in his first four service games.
	   ``I couldn't be playing much better tennis if I tried,''
Rusedski said. Asked if he had ever won every point of an
opponent's service game in an entire set, he joked, ``It must be my
new improved returns.''
	   Henman and Rusedski, ranked Nos. 10 and 11 in the world, are
trying to win the last spots in the ATP Tour Championships in
Hannover later this month. Sampras already is in.
	   In another singles match, American Todd Martin defeated
Australia's hard-serving Wayne Arthurs, 6-4, 6-3, to join Henman in
the quarterfinals.

Satellite to monitor Earth's climate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ About a million miles (kilometers) away and
fixed in a spot where the Earth and the sun's gravitational tug is
balanced, a satellite will study how much energy Earth absorbs from
sunlight and how that affects the climate.
	   Francisco P.J. Valero, a scientist from Scripps Institution of
Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, will lead
the new NASA program. It uses a satellite in a fixed location _
known as L1 _ that will allow it to have a continuous view of Earth
in sunlight.
	   The satellite ``Triana,'' named after the sailor on Columbus'
ship who spotted the ``New World,'' will be launched in 2000 aboard
a space shuttle.
	   Scientists plan for Triana to be the first satellite at the L1
point dedicated to observing Earth. Another satellite is now there
observing activity of the sun.
	   Valero, who works in Scripps' Atmospheric Research Laboratory,
was selected over eight others to lead the research. NASA's Goddard
Space Flight Center in Maryland will develop and manage the
mission.

 &UR; Study shows Ritalin is effective in helping children with ADHD
	   ANAHEIM, California (AP) _ Behavior in children with
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder improves dramatically when
they take the controversial drug Ritalin, according to a study.
	   The study's early findings showed that the children who took the
drug improved far more than children who were treated with only
therapy. It should quiet some of the criticism of drugs such as
Ritalin and encourage doctors to stop blaming ``bad parents'' and
teachers, said Peter Jensen of the National Institute of Mental
Health, one of the authors.
	   The authors, from six medical centers including the University
of California, Irvine, presented their preliminary results recently
at the American College of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry meeting
in Anaheim. They believe it is the largest study of the disorder.
	   ADHD affects 3 percent to 9 percent of all children, limiting
their ability to focus, and accounts for one-third to one-half of
referrals for mental health services for kids.
	   Critics say doctors are too quick to diagnose ADHD and
over-prescribe drugs for children.
	   But Jensen said the problem is that thousands of children aren't
treated and more than one-half of children with the disorder have
not been diagnosed.
	   The 600 children in the study, ages 7 to 9, were randomly placed
in one of four groups: medication; psychosocial
(behavior-modification therapy, social-skill building and summer
programs); combination medication and psychosocial; and referral
back to the community doctor.
	   After 14 months of treatment, 12 to 15 percent of kids on
medication or combined therapy were diagnosed with ADHD, and 32 to
35 percent of children on psychosocial or community-based treatment
still had the disorder. For social skills, however, combined
treatment was best.

 &UR; Concussions dangerous, hard to define
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Concussions are the hidden dangers of contact
sports.
	   There are 82,000 brain injuries a year reported in sports,
according to the American Academy of Neurology. In football alone,
a brain injury occurs once in every 3.5 games, it said.
	   What happens inside the skull after a hard hit is difficult to
diagnose, even if the player is willing to report it _ which the
player sometimes is not. Doctors are struggling to find a way to
tell those players who can go back in the game from those who must
wait and those who will never play again.
	   ``A lot of times, we don't recognize it because the player does
not want to tell us they have suffered a concussion,'' said Dr.
Bryan Smith, head team physician at the University of North
Carolina, Chapel Hill.
	   ``There's a long tradition in college and high school where
players accept injury as part of the risk of playing,'' said sports
agent Leigh Steinberg of Newport Beach, California. ``Tough players
are stoic and don't talk a lot about injury or pain. You have a
fair amount of denial going on.''
	   The brain is the most complex organ in the body, Smith said.
``Even though we have certain symptoms and signs, they are quite
variable and they don't always occur in each person that's been
concussed.''
	   Some immediate symptoms are clear. A player may be dazed, dizzy,
have trouble focusing attention or remembering, and even black out.
Long-term damage can range from no effect to a loss of coordination
or thinking ability to death.

<TEXT>
	   HARTFORD, Connecticut (AP) _ Seven players scored in double
figures, led by Kevin Freeman with 18 points, as No. 2 Connecticut
routed a Slovakian team 125-39 in their final exhibition game of
the season.
	   Senior E.J Harrison and sophomore Khalid El-Amin each finished
with 15 points and the Huskies connected on 68.5 percent of their
shots against BC Istroenergo-Slovakia.
	   It took almost seven minutes for the visitors to score while
Connecticut was running to a 31-0 lead. Two free throws by Marian
Marchyn with 13:06 left in the half elicited a roar from the
partisan crowd.
	   The Huskies, employing a full-court press for all but the last
five minutes on the half, led 47-6 with 7:21 left, 64-8 with 3:14
remaining and 71-12 at the half.
	   The Huskies shot 69.2 percent (27-of-39) in the first half to
23.8 percent (5-of-21) for Slovakia. The visitors also committed 23
turnovers.
	   Connecticut hit the 100-point mark with 8:35 remaining on
Freeman's layup.
	   Alexander Czako, a 6-foot-7 (1.97-meter) forward, led the
visitors with 13 points.
	   Connecticut opens its season Sunday against Quinnipiac, a
Division I newcomer.

Researchers recommend flu shots for children to save money, sick
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Medical researchers are recommending that
schoolchildren across America get annual flu shots to help control
the rampant spread of the virus this winter.
	   It's an unusual public health message, they acknowledge.
Physicians typically reserve their annual allocations of the
influenza vaccine for people who might die otherwise, especially
the elderly.
	   Last year, serious flu outbreaks were recorded in 46 U.S.
states, killing 20,000 people. But virtually none of the victims
were children, researchers said.
	   But that doesn't mean that children are immune. In a new study
being presented Thursday at the annual infectious diseases meeting
in Denver, researchers said 45 percent of all schoolchildren get
the flu, and they pass it along to adult family members and daycare
providers.
	   Many of the adults aren't vaccinated either, and the flu spreads
quickly through the general population.
	   Vaccinating kids would reduce the flu's impact on adults' lost
work hours, productivity and wages, while potentially boosting
students' performance by reducing sick days, said researchers at
Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.
	   ``Parents who would miss work if their children got the flu
should talk to their pediatricians about getting the vaccine right
now,'' said Dr. Mary D. Nettleman, lead author of the study.
	   ``More widespread use of the vaccine in school-age children
would have substantial benefits to society,'' she said.
	   A projection of nationwide cost savings or reduction in school
absences was not available, Nettleman said.
	   More researchers are breaking with tradition this year and
touting the preventive benefits of flu shots for children.
	   At a recent national microbiology meeting, Dr. Michael Marcy of
Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Panorama City, California said
expanding annual vaccinations to children would ``go a long way
towards stopping flu transmission.''
	   The vaccine is made from three strains of the flu virus that
change annually. This year's strains are dubbed A/Beijing, A/Sydney
and B/Beijing. The vaccine is made from particles of the dead
strains that generate an immune response, but cannot give you the
flu.
	   Eighty million doses of vaccine were to be available by this
month despite some initial difficulties reproducing the A strains
in the laboratory.
	   Vaccine production would have to be increased if schoolchildren
were widely vaccinated, officials said.
	   More help is on the horizon in the form of new anti-viral drugs.
	   Researchers are testing a flu vaccine in a painless nasal spray
on 15,000 children ages 18 months to 18 years in the Texas towns of
Temple and Belton.
	   Study directors believe the spray vaccine may protect most of
the children, and reduce adults' doctor visits by more than half.
	   At the end of the flu season next spring, researchers will
compare the results against the flu rate in Austin, 60 miles (96
kilometers) away, where the nasal spray was not tested.

Japan's ruling party unveils new economic stimulus package
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details and background; ADDS byline.
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling party outlined
plans Thursday for Japan's biggest stimulus package ever to
jumpstart this country's anemic economy.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party proposals will form the basis of an
official government plan to be formally announced on Monday and
expected to be passed later this month in a special session of
Parliament.
	   The centerpiece of party's package calls for 10 trillion yen
(dlrs 82 billion) in public works-related spending through next
March and 4 trillion yen (dlrs 33 billion) in income tax cuts next
year.
	   With the addition of corporate tax cuts and other tax relief
measures, it will likely total a record 18 trillion yen (dlrs 148
billion).
	   The widely expected package was compiled in a bid to prevent
Japan's economy from shrinking for a third consecutive year and to
fulfill Obuchi's pledge to engineer a recovery within two years.
	   It also comes just days before Obuchi meets United States
President Bill Clinton and other leaders this weekend at an annual
gathering of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia.
	   The government has faced intense pressure both from opposition
parties at home and foreign trade partners such as the United
States to deal with record unemployment, soaring bankruptcies and
deeply shaken consumer confidence.
	   Japan officially estimates gross domestic product will contract
by 1.8 percent for the current fiscal year, which ends March 31,
1999. The economy shrank 0.7 percent last year.
	   On Tuesday, President Clinton singled out Japan _ as he often
has in recent months _ as the key to reviving economic growth in
Asia and pulling the region out of the financial crisis that is
beginning to be felt on American soil.
	   ``The restoration of growth in Japan, which has been stalled now
for more than five years, is absolutely essential to the
restoration of growth in the rest of Asia,'' Clinton said. ``The
rest of us look to Japan to move quickly.''
	   The proposals announced Thursday for a supplementary budget, the
third such appropriation measure so far this year, also include
reducing the effective Japanese corporate tax rate to 40 percent in
the fiscal year starting next April, down from the current rate of
about 46 percent.
	   The ruling party called for other measures as well, including
consideration of tax incentives to stimulate housing demand and
private investment should also be considered.
	   It also recommends a novel idea designed to get consumers to
spend more _ the distribution of government-issue coupons worth
about 20,000 yen (dlrs 164) to the elderly and families with young
children.

Dollar rises against yen, Japanese stocks fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Thursday
morning on a U.S. news report that the United States was planning
to attack Iraq. Japanese stock prices fell moderately.
	   The dollar bought 122.17 yen at midday, up 1.05 yen from late
Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 121.72
yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 66.40 points,
or 0.46 percent, to 14,361.62 at the end of the morning session. On
Wednesday, the index gained 319.93 points, or 2.27 percent.
	   ``We heard that CBS said the U.S. could bomb Iraq as soon as
today (Thursday),'' said a foreign exchange manager at a Japanese
bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The dollar shot up
sharply,'' he added.
	   On its Internet page, CBS News quoted White House sources as
saying that while a military attack was not likely in the next 12
hours, an aerial attack could come as soon as Thursday.
	   The United States and Britain have been threatening a military
strike since Iraq said late last month it was stopping the
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   With U.S. warships in the Gulf region and the Pentagon beginning
a major buildup of warplanes and troops, President Bill Clinton
said that not enforcing U.N. demands for arms inspections would be
a costly mistake.
	   The dollar, regarded as a safe haven, often strengthens at times
of international tension.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices remained in negative
territory on growing doubts over whether the government will cut
Japan's unpopular national consumption tax, traders said.
	   Such a cut was not included in a plan outlined Thursday by the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party for Japan's biggest stimulus
package ever aimed at jumpstarting the country's anemic economy.
	   The opposition Liberal Party is pushing for a cut in the 5
percent consumption tax, but it could meet opposition from the
ruling LDP. The two parties are currently discussing forming an
alliance.
	   The centerpiece of the LDP package calls for 10 trillion yen
(dlrs 82 billion) in public works-related spending through next
March and 4 trillion yen (dlrs 33 billion) in income tax cuts next
year.
	   With the addition of corporate tax cuts and other tax relief
measures, it will likely total a record 18 trillion yen (dlrs 148
billion).
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 2.80 points, or 0.25 percent, to 1,095.32.
The TOPIX rose 19.8 points, or 1.84 percent, the previous day.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average lost
40.16 points to finish Wednesday's session at 8,823.82.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond stood at 0.855 percent, unchanged from Wednesday's finish. Its
price remained at 108.37 yen.

Argentina advances global warming talks with surprise announcement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous; final minister's phase of summit to begin at
1500 GMT.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ In a breakthough for
international efforts to reduce global warming, Argentina has
become the first developing country to seek to voluntarily cut back
on greenhouse gas emissions.
	   President Carlos Menem announced during a U.N. summit Wednesday
that Argentina would seek to join industrialized countries already
bound by a 1997 treaty to reduce carbon dioxide output by 2012.
	   ``Not only can highly advanced countries contribute to a new
world order, but also emerging nations,'' Menem told delegates from
over 160 nations.
	   The announcement gave a boost to U.S. efforts at the summit to
encourage developing countries to voluntarily commit to reducing
their emissions of greenhouse gases _ pollutants caused primarily
by motor vehicles and power plants.
	   And in another diplomatic victory, the chief U.S. climate change
negotiator announced late Wednesday the former Soviet republic of
Kazakstan was ready to make a similar commitment.
	   Kazakstan ``plans to announce tomorrow its intent to assume a
binding target to abate their emissions below business as usual by
the period 2008-2012,'' said Stuart Eizenstat.
	   Eizenstat, a U.S. undersecretary of state, did not offer
specifics on Kazakstan's plans to reduce its emissions. Messages
left with the Kazakstan delegation were not immediately returned.
	   Many scientists believe Earth is gradually warming because of
these emissions. Critics say global warming scenarios have not been
proven and that the costliness to achieve the cuts in the pact
threatens American industry.
	   Without specific plans to make the reductions, the moves by
Argentina and Kazakstan are largely symbolic. In addition, China
and India, which are expected to become the world's leading
greenhouse gas polluters by 2015, refused to discuss voluntary
emission targets for developing countries at the Buenos Aires
meeting.
	   But U.S. officials, who are struggling to ratify the treaty in
the Republican-led Congress, claimed the newest commitments were a
``breakthrough.''
	   White House adviser Todd Stern told The Associated Press that
Argentina's pledge opens ``a new pathway for developing countries''
to commit to emissions targets similar to those accepted by 38
industrialized nations in Kyoto, Japan, last year.
	   Ratification of the treaty has been slowed in the U.S. Congress,
where critics have called for more reductions from developing
countries.
	   Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a treaty opponent and member
of the U.S. congressional delegation attending the summit, said he
was encouraged by Argentina's announcement.
	   But he said there is ``no way'' Argentina would be forced to
meet the targets spelled out in the Kyoto Pact, which calls for
developed countries to cut their output of carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases blamed for global warming to 5 percent below their
1990 levels.
	   Others said the issue of developing country participation was
shifting attention away from what industrial nations _ the world's
biggest polluters _ should be doing.
	   ``What we would be more interested in hearing from the
industrialized countries on how they plan to reduce their
emissions,'' said Pat Upson, president of the European Nuclear
Society.
	   While skeptical of the lack of specifics, environmentalists
generally welcomed Argentina's announcement.
	   ``The Argentine initiative will help this conference by raising
the pressure to agree on the crucial decision required to implement
the Kyoto Protocol,'' said a statement released by the World
Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace.

Vietnam veteran helps launch anti-mine bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A legislator who lost both legs to a
land mine in the Vietnam War helped introduce a bill to Australia's
Parliament on Thursday which ratifies an international treaty
banning the weapons.
	   Labor opposition lawmaker Graham Edwards shook hands with
conservative Foreign Minister Alexander Downer as the bill, which
will make Australia one of the first countries in the world to
ratify the Ottawa Convention, entered the House of Representatives.
	   Downer fought long and hard last year to get Cabinet approval
for the convention, arguing that the only sane and humane response
was to ban land mines.
	   ``The global battle against land mines is not yet over,'' Downer
told Parliament.
	   ``The next step will be to get negotiations underway as soon as
possible in the Conference on Disarmament on an agreement to ban
transfers of land mines as a way of complementing the Ottawa
Convention.
	   ``Neither will we lose sight of the ongoing urgent need to do
something concrete and compassionate about the millions of land
mines which are already in the ground and which continue to claim
victims on a daily basis.''
	   The bill will be debated in coming weeks, but has the support of
all parties and is assured of passage.
	   Once the bill becomes law, Australia will be required to destroy
its stockpile of antipersonnel mines, apart from a small number
retained for training purposes.
	   The Ottawa Convention was signed by 122 countries in December
1997. It imposes a comprehensive ban on producing, stockpiling,
transporting and using land mines.

Reputed Hong Kong mob boss gets death in China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with more details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A reputed Hong Kong mob boss was sentenced to
death Thursday after being convicted in a sensational trial in
China centered around kidnappings and arms smuggling, the official
Chinese news agency Xinhua reported.
	   Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender,'' learned his fate in a
courthouse in Guangzhou that was ringed by security personnel
wearing bullet-proof vests and carrying machine guns.
	   Four of Cheung's alleged accomplices, Chan Chi-ho, Ma
Shangzhong, Liang Hui and Chin Hon-sau, were also sentenced to
death at a hearing in the Intermediate People's Court of Guangzhou,
about 100 miles (160 kms) north of the Chinese border, Xinhua said.
	   Two others, Chu Yuk-sing and Li Wan, received death sentences
that the court was suspending for two years, giving them time to
demonstrate good behavior and perhaps have their punishments
reduced to prison terms, Xinhua said.
	   Twenty-nine other members of Cheung's gang were sentenced to
prison, some of them for life, Xinhua said, citing a public
announcement from the court.
	   Cheung and his gang were charged with a variety of crimes
including kidnapping, arms and explosives trafficking, robbery and
concealing stolen goods _ and the court convicted them on all of
those charges, Xinhua said.
	   Hong Kong media had previously reported the case also concerned
the murders of a mainland Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong
resident. The Xinhua report made no mention of any murder charges.
	   Under Chinese law, the gangsters can appeal the verdicts within
10 days of receiving a written judgment.
	   The case has drawn considerable attention in Hong Kong, as it is
the first high-profile cross-border trial to be held since the
territory reverted to Chinese rule from Britain last year. The
trial was closed to journalists, but details have been widely
reported by Hong Kong newspapers and broadcasters.
	   Hong Kong does not execute people, and some legal experts have
raised questions about the propriety of trying suspects from Hong
Kong, for some crimes allegedly committed there, in a court in
China, where the death penalty is often imposed.
	   Hong Kong authorities have said they could not take over the
case, because many of the crimes, including two prominent
kidnappings, were never reported to Hong Kong police. Also, Hong
Kong officials pointed out that some of the crimes were plotted and
carried out in China.
	   The Xinhua report noted that 18 of the gangsters were mainland
residents and that all of the defendants had been arrested in
China.
	   The most sensational charges in the case reportedly concerned
the kidnappings of two Hong Kong tycoons, who were identified in
Hong Kong newspaper stories as Victor Li, the son of property
magnate Li Ka-shing, and Walter Kwok, chairman of blue-chip
developer Sun Hung Kai Properties.
	   The Xinhua report did not name the tycoons but said kidnappings
in May 1996 and September 1997 netted Cheung and his gang 1.638
billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 210 million) in ransom
payments.

U.N. Security Council isn't prepared to compromise _ so no Iraqi
</HEADLINE>
mediation &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Remember the last Iraq crisis? U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan engaged in high-stakes diplomacy,
flying to Baghdad at the last minute and signing an agreement that
averted U.S. and British air strikes.
	   The U.N. Security Council was willing to give Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein a last chance in February and Annan went to Baghdad
with the deal. But Saddam hasn't lived up to his part of the
bargain to allow unfettered weapons inspections _ and the council
isn't prepared to compromise any more.
	   So instead of flying to Baghdad to try to solve the latest Iraqi
crisis, Annan is returning to New York on Thursday. And there is
virtually no chance of another diplomatic mission by Annan or
anyone else unless Iraq is prepared to rescind its decision to cut
all dealings with the weapons inspectors.
	   ``Mediation requires some halfway house, some middle road, and
there isn't one in this case,'' said Raad Alkadiri, a Middle East
expert with The Petroleum Finance Co., a Washington-based oil
industry consultancy.
	   Iraq wants sanctions lifted _ and it wants a timetable from the
Security Council. The council has offered a comprehensive review of
Baghdad's compliance with U.N. resolutions _ which could lead to an
easing of the oil embargo if weapons inspectors certify that Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated. But it won't make
any promises.
	   Alkadiri said the current crisis has its roots in the 1991 Gulf
War, which failed to oust Saddam Hussein's regime.
	   ``As far as the United States is concerned, sanctions will not
be lifted in any shape, manner or form while Saddam Hussein is in
power,'' he said in an interview.
	   ``For the Iraqis, compliance with what were all-encompassing,
sweeping U.N. resolutions was always going to be partial as long as
Saddam Hussein survived. The Iraqis have now come to the point
where they say, why should we comply at all when our compliance
gets us nowhere?,'' he said.
	   Annan on Wednesday expressed ``surprise'' that Iraq took such a
drastic step when the council was offering ``a genuine
opportunity'' to move toward a lifting of sanctions _ and he said
he suspects council members were equally surprised.
	   The Russians, Chinese and French, who have generally been more
sympathetic to Baghdad and have pushed to have sanctions lifted,
couldn't defend Iraq's Oct. 31 ban on all dealings with the
inspectors.
	   ``Iraq's violation of Security Council resolutions on this
occasion is so flagrant that it's in a sense forced a superficial
unity among the Security Council that I certainly don't think will
survive military action,'' Alkadiri said. ``But it provides a
suitable prelude to military action.''
	   Behind the scenes, the French have been pushing the Iraqis to
take a more conciliatory position and the Americans and British to
consider a diplomatic solution and not just threaten force.
	   ``So far, that appears to have been unsuccessful,'' said
Alkadiri, who has also worked with the Middle East program at
London's Royal Institute of International Affairs.
	   Moscow has been in contact with Baghdad but isn't playing an
active role in mediating the Iraqi standoff.
	   Robert Legvold, a professor of political science who specializes
in Russian affairs at Columbia University's Harriman Institute,
said the primary reason Moscow hasn't gotten involved is that
``governments and international institutions understand that they
have run their strength'' and can no longer make a difference.
	   ``The Russians are very wary of undertaking foreign policy
actions that aren't successful,'' he said.
	   Legvold noted that Russia's previous interventions on Iraqi
issues were strongly influenced by Yevgeny Primakov, who is now
prime minister and preoccupied with Russia's domestic problems and
immense economic troubles.
	   The Russians might step in, he said, ``if there was some
prospect of this working.''
	   Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said Tuesday that
``intensive contacts'' were going on between world capitals and
Baghdad _ and Iraq wants Annan to become more involved.
	   Annan's special envoy Prakash Shah remained in Baghdad Wednesday
after 233 weapons inspectors and U.N. personnel were ordered to
leave the country because of the threat of U.S. air strikes.
	   But so far, the behind-the-scenes contacts have produced no
results.
	   As British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said Wednesday, a
diplomatic solution remains possible but Iraq hasn't come through
yet, and a military solution is now ``a serious option.''

Thousands peacefully commemorate 1991 East Timor massacre
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ About 10,000 people gathered peacefully
in a graveyard in the provincial capital of East Timor on Thursday
to commemorate the anniversary of a massacre of anti-Indonesian
protesters in 1991.
	   Unlike other demonstrations recently in the
Indonesian-controlled territory, however, there was no sign of
trouble.
	   Indonesian police and troops kept their distance from the crowd,
which laid flowers, prayed and lit candles in honor of the dead
before heavy rain fell.
	   Some sang rebel songs and chanted pro-independence slogans. But
the overall mood was somber.
	   ``Indonesia may be able to sell our properties, our land or even
our people, but they cannot sell our right to freedom,'' said Jose
Da Costa, a former separatist rebel leader.
	   On Nov. 12, 1991, Indonesian troops fired on pro-independence
protesters in front of Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili.
	   A national fact-finding commission found at least 50 people were
killed and dozens were missing. Independent sources and human
rights activists put the death toll at about 200.
	   Dozens of grieving relatives of the dead turned out for
Thursday's ceremony, which followed an early morning Mass by Bishop
Carlos Belo, the spiritual leader of predominantly Roman Catholic
East Timor.
	   Earlier this week, Belo, who won the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, and
Indonesian military chiefs urged East Timorese to remain calm
during the anniversary.
	   This year's ceremony comes amid new efforts to secure a lasting
peace for the half-island territory.
	   The leaders of opposing East Timorese factions, that either
support or oppose independence from Indonesia, came together
Thursday to lay wreaths at the cemetery.
	   One group carried a Christian cross that carried the words:
``National reconciliation.''
	   Mainly Muslim Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 after
invading the year before during civil war that broke out in the
last days of Portuguese colonial rule.
	   Human rights abuses and guerrilla warfare have wracked the
territory since.
	   The United Nations does not recognize Indonesia's claim of
sovereignty but is sponsoring talks between Indonesia and Portugal
over the future of East Timor.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has offered East Timor a form
of autonomy in return for international recognition that the
territory is part of Indonesia.
	   Despite this, there have been a series of big protests in Dili
recently where demonstrators have called for a referendum on
independence.
	   Protesters have also demanded the immediate release of Xanana
Gusmao, a rebel guerrilla leader who is serving a 20-year prison
term for fighting Indonesian troops.
	   The peaceful nature of Thursday's commemoration also contrasted
with a recent upsurge in rebel attacks against Indonesian forces.
	   On Monday, three Indonesian soldiers and one pro-independence
rebel were killed in a guerrilla raid on a military post at
Manufahi, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili.
	   The rebels kidnapped 13 soldiers and later released 11.
	   Two soldiers were still being held captive, the military said.

Changing cab rules latest painful bid to reform old Italy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Rome's latest efforts to open up business to
competition are parked at the curb these days, along with lots of
taxis going nowhere.
	   A bid by the mayor to give taxi customers a little bargaining
power and get more cabs cruising the cobblestones has left the
capital cab-less for much of this fall.
	   After weeks of sporadic one-day strikes, drivers are keeping
their cabs parked for four straight through Thursday, when taxis
from all over Italy were expected to converge on the capital in a
show of solidarity.
	   The winds of change are supposed to be sweeping across Italy as
heavily protected sectors of the economy, one after the other, are
encouraged to open up to keep in line with the rest of Western
Europe.
	   But as the cabbies' resistance to change makes clear, reform in
Italy is hardly a breeze. Last year, for example, Rome's
mom-and-pop shops took to lowering their shutters to protest
permits for megastores and easing of rigid store rules like Sunday
closures.
	   ``Being put to the test is ... the introduction of the principle
of competition and opening to the market,'' La Repubblica columnist
Miriam Mafai wrote of the taxi strike. ``Everything has to remain
as it was, as always.''
	   Mayor Francesco Rutelli moved to change rules for the cabs after
the national Antitrust Authority concluded that Rome's taxi
situation had the makings of a cartel.
	   With buses packed during the day, and few running at all in the
wee hours, and parking scarce and expensive, taxis are about the
only game in town for those not willing to brave a scooter. But try
to find a cab.
	   Paris boasts one cab license for every 126 inhabitants compared
to one for every 456 in Rome. And the wait for a cab might seem
forever in 2000 when millions of Holy Year pilgrims pour into the
Eternal City. The Antitrust Authority noted that Naples and Milan
each had more cabs per inhabitant than Rome.
	   If you're lucky and get a cab here at a taxi stand or by phone
(most cabbies won't cruise), you had better have lots of lire. As
soon as the meter clicks on, you've spent 5,000 lire _ dlrs 3 _
compared to a dlrs 2.50 charge in London or dlrs 2.35 in Paris.
	   The city wants cabs to circulate for a minimum of six hours a
day, leaving owners or family members free to work more if they
want when there's demand. Now, cabs are locked into maximum shifts
of 7 1/2 hours during the day and nine hours during the night.
	   ``We now have times of the day when there are customers without
cabs and times when there are cabs lined up without customers,''
said Rossella Panarese, a spokeswoman for traffic commissioner
Walter Tocci.
	   But no lids on shifts means they'll have to work longer hours to
keep up with colleagues with more time and stamina, cabbies
contend.
	   ``Working minimum shifts means you have to work the maximum,''
said Franco Fani who was among hundreds of strikers parking their
cabs this week in Piazza Venezia, around the corner from City Hall.
	   Cabbies also are resisting maximum fares for certain routes or
services such as baggage transport.
	   But whether Rome's cabbies would risk taking away colleagues'
business by offering discounts remains to be seen.
	   Cabbies, most of whom own their taxis, claim there isn't much to
shave off after paying for taxes, maintenance and fuel, which runs
close to a dollar per liter (more than dlrs 4 a gallon).
	   The idea of fostering competition is still new to much of Italy,
which was the last Western European nation to establish an
antitrust authority, in 1990.

Neely skates with Bruins in comeback try
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WILMINGTON, Massachusetts (AP) _ More than halfway into his
first practice since retiring from the Boston Bruins in 1996, Cam
Neely received the puck and took a shot on net.
	   Clank.
	   No matter that the puck hit the crossbar. Or that Neely breathed
heavily, weighed more and skated slower than in years past.
	   Cam Neely was back on the ice and that was enough.
	   Two years after the four-time National Hockey League All-Star
prematurely retired from the game at 31, after scoring 395 goals
and 299 assists in a 13-year-career, Neely was on the ice with his
old team Wednesday seeing if he could overcome the degenerative hip
condition that sidelined his career.
	   So far, so good.
	   ``I wish that my lungs felt as good as my hip,'' he said after
leaving the ice at the Ristuccia Center.
	   He always wondered if he could come back. After the 45-minute
practice session, Neely recalled how the pain was once so
unbearable he couldn't sleep.
	   Neely's return follows intensive work with a physical therapist
who is helping to lengthen the muscles and tendons around his hip
and break down some of the scar tissue surrounding the hip socket.
	   The rink was filled with media and teammates excited about
Neely's possible comeback.
	   Bruins veteran Ray Bourque, one of three remaining players who
played with Neely, said that he was watching the 1988 playoff tapes
featuring Neely ``scoring all over the place'' when Neely called
Tuesday to tell him of his return.
	   ``I feel this is important for him to try,'' Bourque said. ``The
way he went out wasn't the way he wanted to. ... If it works out
for him, it's going to be a big bonus for everybody.''
	   Young players who never skated with Neely, like 19-year-old Joe
Thornton, the Bruins' 1997 first-round draft pick, are looking
forward to playing with the star.
	   ``I grew up watching highlights of him on television,'' Thornton
said.
	   In the 10 seasons he played for the Bruins, it was hard to miss
Neely, who was as much of a presence in front of the net as he was
in the community.
	   Neely helped to create the Cam Neely Foundation at the New
England Medical Center, a home for families of patients with
cancer. The disease killed Neely's parents.
	   While playing with an injured knee, Neely scored 50 goals in his
first 44 games of 1993-94. Only Wayne Gretzky has scored 50 goals
in fewer games.
	   Neely said he is not concerned about his stick and shooting
skills coming back. It's a view shared by Bruins president and
general manager Harry Sinden.
	   ``He hasn't lost anything off his shot and he's handling the
puck well,'' Sinden said. ``Obviously, his conditioning is light
years behind where it has to be.''
	   Which is a good sign. Neely can improve his conditioning, but
his hip could keep him off the ice forever.
	   If Neely does return, Sinden said, the team would have to
negotiate a new contract. But Sinden said that is far away for now.
	   ``He knows it's a long shot, and I do, too,'' Sinden said.

Judge bars lewd account from being read aloud in court

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The judge in the trial of Anwar
Ibrahim on Thursday barred a witness from reading out loud a lewd
account of the former deputy prime minister's alleged sexual
misconduct.
	   Anwar, 51, is on trial for corruption and sex crimes, in what he
claims is a politically motivated vendetta. The charges of illicit
sex acts, allegedly with a man and a woman in separate incidents,
have shocked this predominantly Muslim nation.
	   During a break in Thursday's proceedings, Anwar issued a string
of verbal taunts against the government and his one-time patron,
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, despite a gag order.
	   ``There are two sets of laws, one for me and one for Dr.
Mahathir. They put me in prison and they asked me to shut up. I'm
in prison, so why are they scared?'' Anwar told a group of
reporters in the courtroom hallway.
	   He added: ``There are so many poison pen letters against the
prime minister and (the national police chief). I've seen so many
of them.''
	   Anwar's trial is already expected to drag on well into next
year, but the exasperated defendant said that if Mahathir is still
in power ``then it might go beyond the year 2000.''
	   Bailiffs gently put their arms around Anwar and escorted the
visibly upset defendant back to the courtroom.
	   The trial will be suspended during next week's summit of world
leaders in Kuala Lumpur, some of whom may be meeting with Anwar's
wife, Azizah Ismail. Any such meetings are likely to infuriate the
Malaysian government, which doesn't want the Anwar case to become a
sideshow to the summit talks.
	   On Thursday, Judge Augustine Paul barred Mazlan Mohamed Din, an
assistant police commissioner, from reading aloud a lewd account of
Anwar's alleged sexual encounters with his private secretary's
wife.
	   ``This evidence is being introduced solely for its prejudicial
value,'' defense attorney Christopher Fernando complained. ``It
certainly has no probative value.''
	   Judge Paul agreed, stipulating that the documents would be
entered into the trial record, but not read aloud in the crowded
courtroom.
	   During the exchange, Anwar supporters in the courtroom sat bolt
upright and stared straight ahead.
	   The day before, Judge Paul rejected defense attempts to show the
former Malaysian deputy prime minister is the victim of a political
conspiracy and trumped-up charges.
	   Anwar maintains the sex and corruption charges against him stem
from his rivalry with Mahathir.
	   The criminal proceedings have cast a shadow over next week's
summit of 21 government leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum. Critics say the case demonstrates human rights
abuses in this Southeast Asian nation.
	   Anwar says his one-time patron, Mahathir, is losing support both
at home and abroad.
	   ``Foreign leaders can no longer tolerate him anymore. He's
becoming recalcitrant,'' Anwar said. He said many Malaysians also
rejected Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Mahathir, 72, has defended his sacking in September of Anwar as
the country's No. 2 official, and said he believed Anwar would
receive a fair trial.

Senior trade officials hash out agenda for APEC summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Senior officials from 21 Pacific
Rim countries met Thursday to discuss trade liberalization, but the
global economic crisis clearly remained a big concern.
	   ``We want to understand each others' difficulties and help to
solve the problem,'' Andrew Hsia, director-general of the Taiwanese
Foreign Ministry, told reporters before joining the first session
of senior trade officials meeting in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Hsia said the financial crisis, which has hit all Asian
economies and pushed many into full-fledged recession, must be key
to all discussions of trade among the officials.
	   They were to meet for two days to hash out the agenda before
Cabinet ministers from the 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation hold their weekend session.
	   APEC heads of state, including U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, will meet in the Malaysian
capital next Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   The United States, Australia and Canada will be pushing the
trade forum to finalize a pact to lift tariffs in nine sectors
covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade by 2020.
	   The industries would be chemicals, forest products, medical
equipment, energy, telecommunications equipment, environmental
goods and services, gems and jewelry, fisheries and toys.
	   But a showdown between the United States and Japan was likely,
as Tokyo has insisted it can't accept a fixed schedule for opening
its forestry and fishing sectors, the two industries the governing
party appears determined to protect on behalf of its supporters.
	   APEC's aim is free trade among the developed member nations by
2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   Just like last year's summit in Vancouver, Canada, the
discussions in Malaysia will be dominated by a financial crisis
that has leveled many Asian nations, Russia and is threatening to
break out in Latin America.
	   The United States has launched a full-court press to keep the
APEC response to the crisis on the free-market road that the
International Monetary Fund has been urging countries to pursue.
	   However, this year's host, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad is expected to lead a counter assault on this free-market
philosophy, arguing that the IMF prescription has failed to halt
the crisis and has instead left many countries in deep recessions
with little prospect of an early recovery.
	   Mahathir would like endorsement of Malaysia's approach, which
imposed currency controls to keep speculators away from its
financial markets.
	   Those two views are likely to dominate the discussions during
the APEC summit, but are expected to be papered over before the
final statement is issued.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

Hong Kong leader says won't follow Singapore pay cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Singapore has just announced a major
cost-cutting package that could make it more competitive than Hong
Kong in some areas, but Hong Kong's chief executive says he won't
follow suit by ordering pay cuts.
	   Despite intense competition between the rival Asian financial
centers, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said the territory's wages
are set by the market, not the government.
	   ``Our wages are adjusted by market forces,'' Tung said in
remarks carried Thursday by local newspapers. ``The government has
no intention whatsoever of issuing such instructions because Hong
Kong is a free market.''
	   Tung's assurances could ring hollow to many private sector
workers. Numerous companies in Hong Kong already have cut wages by
as much as 20 percent as the territory struggles through a
recession that has pushed unemployment to a 15-year high of 5
percent.
	   Singapore proposed measures Wednesday that would trim business
expenses by 10 billion Singapore dollars (U.S. dlrs 6 billion) a
year, reducing corporate costs by about 15 percent.
	   Drawn up to ease the pain of Singapore's first economic
recession in 13 years, the package recommends major cuts in wages
and pension contributions, reduced land and factory rentals,
slashed levies and service charges, and lower taxes.
	   The measures are the latest moves by Singapore that could lure
investors or employers away from Hong Kong.
	   Hong Kong and Singapore are also currently feuding over
Singapore's plans to launch new futures trading of a stock index
that virtually mirrors Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index.

Report: Weather phenomenon may cut Indonesian rice production
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The La Nina weather phenomenon may cut
rice production in 10 Indonesian provinces as excessive rain could
delay or affect rice harvests next year, a local newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted Chairil Anwar Rasahan, director general
of food crops and horticulture at the Ministry of Agriculture, as
saying rice production could drop significantly.
	   The provinces, which account for half of Indonesia's total
output, are Aceh, north and south Sumatra, Lampung, west, central
and east Java, west and east Kalimantan and south Sulawesi.
	   La Nina threatens to bring floods and tropical storms to
Indonesia, which has previously been struck by droughts from the
opposite weather phenomenon, El Nino.
	   During the El Nino cycle last year, Indonesia experienced its
worst drought in 50 years, setting off uncontrolled fires on
Sumatra and Kalimantan.
	   Harvest failure forced the country to import 4.1 million tons of
rice this fiscal year.

U.N. Security Council meets on Iraq as Annan appeals to Saddam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting ended, Security Council giving strong
backing to Annan, new quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council strongly backed
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's appeal to Saddam Hussein to
immediately resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   U.S. Deputy Ambassador Peter Burleigh, the current council
president, said Wednesday that all 15 members would prefer a
diplomatic solution over military action to force Saddam to comply.
	   But subsequently _ in comments made in his role as acting U.S.
ambassador _ Burleigh said that ``the ball is in Iraq's court'' and
emphasized that Annan's statement means Iraq must cooperate.
	   The United States has threatened airstrikes unless Iraq resumes
cooperation.
	   Iraq has said it will not cooperate with inspectors from the
U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, until the Security
Council begins to lift an embargo imposed after Iraqi forces
invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War.
	   The Security Council maintains the embargo won't be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Annan on Wednesday called the council's offer to conduct a
comprehensive review of U.N. resolutions ``a genuine opportunity''
to move toward lifting sanctions.
	   ``The comprehensive review will map out the remaining steps,
provided Iraq cooperates, thus allowing them to see light at the
end of the tunnel,'' he said in a statement.
	   ``This would be good for the Iraqi people, for the region and
for the world,'' he said.
	   Annan cut short a trip to North Africa and was to return to U.N.
headquarters Thursday.
	   Russia requested the emergency council meeting after 233 U.N.
personnel were pulled out of Iraq early Wednesday because of the
possibility of U.S. airstrikes to compel Iraq to resume cooperation
with U.N. inspectors.
	   Russia, China and France had been angry that the council had not
been informed immediately of U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler's decision to suddenly withdraw the entire inspection team
from Iraq.
	   But U.N. security coordinator Benon Sevan told the council that
prior evacuations of U.N. personnel were not publicized, according
to diplomats at the closed meeting.
	   After the council meeting, Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said
his concerns were allayed.
	   ``There are circumstances under which the program managers have
to think about the safety of the people who work under their
authority,'' he said.
	   The council didn't discuss any new diplomatic initiatives. But
British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock told CNN earlier that ``the
diplomatic move isn't dead yet.'' Still, he said a military
solution is now ``a serious option.''
	   Iraq says it will not cooperate with weapons inspectors until
the council commits to a timetable to lift economic sanctions.
	   The council is sharply divided over the use of force against
Iraq. The United States and Britain maintain that they can take
military action, based on previous U.N. resolutions. Russia and
China insist that fresh council approval is needed.
	   In a letter to Annan _ the first official Iraqi reaction since
the pullout _ Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz gave no
indication that Baghdad was prepared to rescind its ban on dealing
with the weapons inspectors.
	   Earlier, Butler said he ordered all inspectors to leave Baghdad
because of a strong recommendation from the United States and an
``increasingly hostile'' atmosphere in Iraq.
	   Butler said he spent almost all day Tuesday dealing with ``an
absolutely unfounded allegation'' by Iraq that an inspector had
committed an act of espionage. He would not disclose the
nationality of the inspector, except to say he was not American.
	   Aziz accused the UNSCOM of acting on orders from the United
States and using the United Nations merely as ``false cover.''

Asian children quit school, face hunger as economic crisis deepens

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More Asian children are dropping out of
school and millions face malnutrition as the regional economic
crisis attacks social progress made in previous decades, a top
UNICEF official said Thursday.
	   Carol Bellamy, executive director of the United Nations
Children's Fund, urged regional governments at the Fourth
Ministerial Consultation on children's welfare to not let the
crisis divert attention from child health and education.
	   `The price of inaction can be high, as the suffering of Latin
America and much of Africa in the 1980s proved,'' Bellamy said in a
speech opening the three-day meeting.
	   ``Countries in those regions endured a deeply damaging economic
crisis, but they continued to invest in social programs and they
are now reaping the benefits for it,'' Bellamy said.
	   Bellamy encouraged Asian-Pacific governments, grappling with
austerity programs to get through the financial devastation that
hit the region last year, to minimize cuts in social development
budgets.
	   The meeting is bringing together officials from 18 Asian-Pacific
countries with representatives of donor nations, non-governmental
organizations and the United Nations. They will discuss what can be
done to protect children and other vulnerable groups.
	   A UNICEF report said that malnutrition in East Asia and the
Pacific rank third after South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. But if
China is excluded, the region moves up to second place.
	   Bellamy said that gloomy regional economic scenarios have
``potentially devastating'' consequences for children.
	   About 33 million children in the region continue to face severe
and moderate malnutrition, and the crisis is making the situation
worse.
	   Poverty remains the chief cause. But evidence shows that a lack
of access to nutritious food is still a major problem in some
countries like Indonesia and North Korea.
	   The crisis threatens to undo progress made in recent years in
protecting children from labor and exploitation. Poverty and loss
of jobs for their parents will force more children to work and
raise the risks of child abuse and neglect, the report said.
	   Primary school dropout rates are going up and access to health
care and sanitation _ already difficult in some countries _ are
expected to get worse as funding tightens up.
	   Some 1 billion people, or about 65 percent of the region's
population, lack access to adequate sanitation, the report said.
About 40,000 women die each year of pregnancy and childbirth
problems.
	   UNICEF fears that recession will increase maternal mortality
rates because families have less means to pay for hospital
services.
	   Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai told the conference that the
crisis threatens hard-won gains since 1960 in getting nearly every
Thai child to finish sixth grade and in slashing the infant
mortality rate.
	   ``We cannot and must not compromise our children's well-being,''
Chuan said. ``Indeed, we cannot and must not compromise our own
future.''

U.N. Security Council meets on Iraq as Annan appeals to Saddam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS that council members want to meet with Annan to discuss
efforts of U.N. envoy in Baghdad. &QL;

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council strongly backed
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's appeal to Saddam Hussein to
immediately resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   U.S. Deputy Ambassador Peter Burleigh, the current council
president, said Wednesday that all 15 members would prefer a
diplomatic solution over military action to force Saddam to comply.
	   But subsequently _ in comments made in his role as acting U.S.
ambassador _ Burleigh said that ``the ball is in Iraq's court'' and
emphasized that Annan's statement means Iraq must cooperate.
	   The United States has threatened airstrikes unless Iraq resumes
cooperation.
	   Iraq has said it will not cooperate with inspectors from the
U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, until the Security
Council begins to lift an embargo imposed after Iraqi forces
invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War.
	   The Security Council maintains the embargo won't be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Annan on Wednesday called the council's offer to conduct a
comprehensive review of U.N. resolutions ``a genuine opportunity''
to move toward lifting sanctions.
	   ``The comprehensive review will map out the remaining steps,
provided Iraq cooperates, thus allowing them to see light at the
end of the tunnel,'' he said in a statement.
	   ``This would be good for the Iraqi people, for the region and
for the world,'' he said.
	   Annan cut short a trip to North Africa and was to return to U.N.
headquarters Thursday. Many council members expressed interest in
meeting with Annan to discuss efforts by his envoy in Baghdad,
Prakash Shah, to persuade Iraq to resume cooperation with U.N.
inspectors.
