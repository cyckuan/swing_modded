<HEADLINE> Law would attack crime by targeting drug houses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A new state effort to close drug dens and crack
houses will target the landlords who own the properties.
<P>
	   A landlord could be targeted after repeated police raids and convictions of
the same drug suspects living in or operating from leased properties, according
to a plan outlined Monday by state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Spitzer, stiff fines could compound for as long as it takes for
the landlord to rid the criminal element from the building.
</P>
<P>
	   The cycle of raid, arrest, jail, release and return to the same home is
destroying neighborhoods and the families who are trying to live in them, two
community activists said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "People are afraid to walk; people are afraid to use the telephone booth and
the traffic is going in and out all night," Linda Miller said.
</P>
<P>
	   "What I object to is all the people who come from the suburbs and get their
drugs," said Elfrieda Textores, who has lived her 68 years in the inner-city
neighborhood. "I'm tired of having people afraid to visit me."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the message," Miller said sternly: "The South End is not going to
tolerate this kind of behavior anymore."
</P>
<P>
	   "Drug dealers cannot be permitted to plant a flag in our neighborhoods,
claim it as their turf, and proclaim they are open for business," Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   His office is seeking court orders against a landlord and to keep five
alleged dealers from within 200 feet of one suspected marijuana operation in
Albany. The strategy will be duplicated statewide and eventually take on crack
houses and other centers of harder drugs and violence, Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clean Sweep is being tried in the Albany neighborhood where Miller and
Textores live first. While the civil action, backed by police reports and
records of convictions began Monday, Spitzer said a court injunction might not
be granted until March 22 under the law. Despite the delay, Spitzer said the
suspects are unlikely to move before the court acts.
</P>
<P>
	   That's how stubborn the players are and how persistent the problem is,
Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer said the constitutionality of the program is sound because property
owners are required by safety codes to report and deter crime in their
buildings. He also said the potential penalty - fines - is a measured,
reasonable response that will withstand a legal test.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are fundamentally shifting the focus of our attention," Spitzer said.
"We want to bring different tools to the situation."
</P>
<P>
	   Miller and Textores said it's about time.
</P>
<P>
	   They remember an editorial once said crime in her neighborhood was simply a
fact of life: live with it.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well," Miller said, "We don't think we have to live with it."

<HEADLINE> Protesters support white officers' rights; memory of victim  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - If racial tension is an undercurrent in the trial of
four white police officers accused of killing a black man, it was a flood
outside the courtroom Monday.
<P>
	   "We're here to fight racism," said the Rev. Timothy Mitchell, a 69-year-old
minister speaking to Harlem Christian school students. "I have never seen as
much racism in my whole experience as what is happening now."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day of sporadic demonstrations, Thomas Chandler, another
black man, argued that racism is a key to the trial - but it's aimed at the four
white New York City police officers charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
	   "These officers would be treated differently if they were (members of) a
minority," said Chandler of suburban Albany and chairman of a local gun-owners'
rights group. "People are so willing to politicize the hatred ... They were
treated as probable murderers simply because they are white officers."
</P>
<P>
	   These protesters weren't organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton like the bused-in
rage a week ago from the Bronx, where the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo
happened one year ago. Monday's conflicts illustrated the complexity of race
relations, even within the black community, of the trial so racially charged it
was moved to Albany because an appeals court ruled the officers couldn't get an
impartial jury in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   At noon, a dozen students and their ministers from the Mount Pleasant
Christian Academy in Harlem quietly prayed, sang hymns and ranted in a small
rally against the racism they fear could leave them like Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   "What happened to Amadou Diallo could happen to any of us," said Kyle
Bollar, 21, of Long Island who attends the State University of New York at
Albany. "We're the next generation. We need to start fighting."
</P>
<P>
	   In the crowd was Mony Tambi who, like Diallo, is a West African immigrant.
He redirected his concerns of race back to the minister. Tambi said blacks must
confront racism by a "revolution in our hearts" and through an individual
initiative to overcome bias.
</P>
<P>
	   "How long are you going to sing?" he shouted back to the stage. "If we do
for ourselves and create opportunity for ourselves this won't happen," he said,
referring to the racism he fears fueled the Diallo shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   As disagreement rose within the crowd, the minister ended the debate with a
call for more hymns, drowning out Tambi.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd specifically addressed questions by reporters about Chandler's
comments, repeatedly saying racism fueled the quick reactions of the New York
City police officers who said they thought Diallo was an armed and dangerous
suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was an honest mistake," Chandler insisted, as four white colleagues
stood well behind him wearing placards that read "Freedom is Never Free."
</P>
<P>
	   "They had cornered a desperate man. If it was your son," Chandler said,
"wouldn't you want him to defend himself the best he could?"
</P>
<P>
	   Chandler argued that black activists who have led protests outside the
trial, while well intentioned, are hurting the cause of civil rights he shares
with them.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only reason the civil rights movement worked was people had respect for
equal treatment," he said. "We should be able to recognize bigotry."

<HEADLINE> Long to Giuliani: Don't run for Senate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The leader of the New York Conservative Party says
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani fails on almost every issue that
conservatives hold dear.
<P>
	   "I think I would rather that he didn't run," Michael Long said during his
party's political action conference in Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Long also suggested that his party may field its own Senate candidate
against Giuliani and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Democrat, no matter
how damaging it might be to the Republican cause.
</P>
<P>
	   "Occasionally, conservatives have to take a tough stand," said Long, who
refused to say who his party is looking at as a possible candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by an almost 5-3
margin, no Republican has won statewide office in the past 25 years without the
Conservative Party's endorsement. Republican George Pataki beat then-Democratic
Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1994 on the strength of the Conservative Party vote.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Giuliani didn't back down. "Sure, we'd like to have the
endorsement," Giuliani spokeswoman Kim Serafin said. "However, the mayor will
not sacrifice principle for political expediency."
</P>
<P>
	   "The mayor does not and will not change his views for anybody," Giuliani
campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, unlike most states, major party candidates can run on several
ballot lines and the votes for them on all lines are then added together to
determine the election winner.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has routinely run for mayor with Liberal Party backing. But Long
has said that the only way Giuliani could win Conservative Party backing in his
Senate bid would be to give up Liberal Party support and come out in favor of a
ban on what critics call partial-birth abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani, like Clinton, is an abortion rights supporter.
</P>
<P>
	   "If he refuses to evolve or be open-minded on the issue I believe more than
75 percent of the people of New York consider a horrific act and infanticide
then, in fact, he has to accept the responsibility of that decision," Long said.
</P>
<P>
	   Long said he hasn't even talked to the mayor since a brief conversation in
August when the mayor said he would get back in touch.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's wrong on domestic partners, he's wrong on gays in the military, he's
wrong on gay rights, he's wrong on rent control, he's wrong on ... we could just
go on and on and on," Long said. "The question would be what issues is he right
on. He's right on (school) vouchers and he's a good strong administrator. But
being a strong administrator doesn't make you a good United States senator."
</P>
<P>
	   Long said he was actively looking for someone to run for the Senate seat but
refused to slam the door completely on Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we can find the right candidates, you'll be the first to know about it
immediately," Long said. "And clearly I think we will blow this race wide open
and that's what our intentions are to do UNLESS someone comes to us and is
willing to give to us the commitment that they will fight for conservative
principles in the United States Senate."
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Congressman Rick Lazio was one of the names Long seemed
interested in. Lazio was prepared earlier in the year to run for Senate, but he
stepped aside at the behest of Republican Party leaders. He also spoke to the
Conservative meeting in Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   "If he made a phone call, we're ready to move," Long said.
</P>
<P>
	   Long also called on the Republican Party leadership to ask Giuliani not to
take the Liberal Party endorsement, saying it would damage the GOP's
relationship with the Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
	   "If this happens, I consider it a break in a relationship that has been
going on for 25 years, and clearly that would mean that they are allowing it,"
he said. "If they allow him to accept the Liberal Party endorsement statewide,
then in fact they are not serious about the things I think they believe in."

<HEADLINE> Study: Child Health Plus results generally positive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The health and habits of poor people do not change
overnight even if they get access to health care coverage, a study of New York's
Child Health Plus program has concluded.
<P>
	   The study of more than 2,000 children - funded in part by the state Health
Department - showed many hopeful trends. They included an increase in visits to
primary care facilities, including a jump of 25 percent for preventive visits,
52 percent for acute visits and 42 percent for total visits, with
hospitalizations dropping by 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   About one third of parents reported improved health care for their children
after enrolling in Child Health Plus, and none noted a worse quality of care.
</P>
<P>
	   But according to the author of the study, Dr. Peter Szilagyi, the mere fact
that health coverage is available doesn't necessarily mean that everyone will
avail themselves of that care or do so in a diligent fashion.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the report, uninsured children are more likely than insured
children to delay seeking care, to use fewer ambulatory health services and to
have fewer visits for common pediatric conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   "Much of this past behavior continues even after the children are insured,"
said Szilagyi, a doctor at the Children's Hospital at Strong Memorial in
Rochester. "There were problems with patient follow up, it was tough to keep
patients coming back for regular appointments and there is no reason to believe
that similar results are not to be expected from the adult population if
insurance were guaranteed to them under Family Health Plus."
</P>
<P>
	   Szilagyi's study was released Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Child Health Plus program will serve as the model for a new planned
program, Family Health Plus, which state officials say will make
state-subsidized health coverage available to up to 1 million poor working New
York adults starting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also found that significantly more specialists were seen through
Child Health Plus, more than double the number before the program for all
children.
</P>
<P>
	   "The old adage is that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, if
you have access to preventive care you are more likely to avoid long term, more
serious injuries," said Richard Kirsch, executive director of Citizen Action of
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   State health officials are cautiously optimistic.
</P>
<P>
	   "On the one hand we're happy with the conclusion of this most recent study,
but we're also cautious about the future," said Rob Kenny, a spokesman for the
state Health Department.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one can make an individual go to the hospital, all that we can do is to
establish a relationship with an individual or family to keep them coming back
either for Child Health Plus or Family Health Plus," Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
	   Family Health Plus program is an initiative included in the Health Care
Reform Act 2000 approved by the state Legislature and Gov. George Pataki in
December.
</P>
<P>
	   It will initially cost $277 million. Funding in part will come from the
state's settlement with tobacco companies and through a near-doubling of the
state's tax on cigarettes to begin on March 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The study appeared in the February issue of Pediatrics and was also
partially funded by the Packard Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Reform groups try to keep pressure on over ballot access  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The governor and leaders of the state Legislature
owe it to the people of New York to rework state laws to make ballots more
accessible to more candidates, a government reformer says.
<P>
	   "We're simply asking them to practice democracy," Barbara Bartoletti of the
League of Women Voters said Monday. "We think they have a responsibility to the
constituents of this state."
</P>
<P>
	   An agreement engineered by a federal judge to open the March 7 presidential
primary to the top Republican candidates should not be the extent of ballot
access "reform" in 2000, Bartoletti and representatives of two other groups
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attempts by Gov. George Pataki and state GOP Chairman William Powers to
exclude Republican candidates in favor of their choice for the presidency, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, were a disaster for the prestige of New York Republicans
and the state as a whole, Bartoletti argued.
</P>
<P>
	   "People have ridiculed New York state," she said. "We are literally the
embarrassment of the nation."
</P>
<P>
	   There remains much confusion over whether the deal brokered by federal Judge
Edward Korman to open New York's primary ballot applies only to the March 7
primary or will have a longer-range effect on the state's exclusionary and
hyper-technical process of qualifying for the ballot, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Government reform groups have called for years for the system to be eased.
Their representatives said Monday they have sent Pataki and legislative leaders
a letter calling on them to approve a new primary system where all "serious"
presidential candidates automatically get on New York's ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   The groups said such "serious" candidacies could be defined as those which
either collect 5,000 petition signature statewide or which qualify for federal
matching funds - a process now requiring a candidate to raise at least $100,000
and collect 5,000 petition signatures in at least 20 states.
</P>
<P>
	   The groups, which also included Common Cause and the New York Public
Interest Research Group, said political parties in New York should also share
with all candidates lists of their enrolled members. Control of the lists is one
more way in which party bosses are able to boost the candidacies of their
presidential favorites and inhibit candidates who are out of favor with the
party establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Erik Joerss of Common Cause said making permanent changes would also prevent
reformers from having to lobby every four years for fairer ballot access rules,
since he said politicians and reporters only seem to focus on the state's
exclusionary system in each presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
	   "One of the definitions of insanity is to do the same thing over and over
again and to expect different outcomes," Joerss said.
</P>
<P>
	   The reformers also said a swift adoption of a new primary system would allow
more lenient access rules to apply to the 2000 state legislative races. Petition
signatures to qualify those candidates must be gathered by early June.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, who abandoned the fight against Bush's opponents in New York, has
said he does not believe candidates should be ruled off the ballot because of
technicalities.
</P>
<P>
	   State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said Monday he does not see the
immediate need for legislation. The deal worked out by Korman will solve the
ballot access problem for this upcoming presidential primary, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Of access to legislative ballots and wider-ranging changes to the nominating
system, Silver said, "at the appropriate time we'll deal with that, if
necessary."
</P>
<P>
	   Korman found a series of unconstitutional provisions in the current primary
qualification system, including the requirement that petition signers list the
town they live in instead of the hamlet or village. Korman said that provision
was on the books only to serve as a technicality to allow petition signatures to
be disqualified.

<HEADLINE> Top Assembly Democrats in spat over gubernatorial endorsement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - First the state's most powerful Republicans got into
a tussle.
<P>
	   Now, the top two Democrats in the state Assembly are having a tiff over what
the chamber's speaker says is the misplaced political "focus" of its majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaker Sheldon Silver said Monday it is too early for Majority Leader
Michael Bragman to worry about backing a candidate in the governor's race in
2002 with a president, congressional delegation and new state Legislature to
elect this November.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there has to be an appropriate focus on the year 2000," Silver
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver's comments served to confirm a report in Monday's New York Post of
tensions between Silver and Bragman over Bragman agreeing to be one of four
members of an advisory committee formed to promote state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall's candidacy for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post, citing unidentified sources, reported that Silver was miffed
Bragman didn't clear his participation on the committee with Silver, and also
annoyed that Bragman wasn't worrying more about the 2000 elections at this point
than on the next gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
	   Bragman said Monday evening that he had not discussed the issue with Silver.
</P>
<P>
	   "However, no one should question my focus or my support for Assembly
campaigns, for the campaign of Hillary Clinton or any other statewide race,"
Bragman said. "If anyone should do that, then it's correct to say that there
should be a rift between that person and me."
</P>
<P>
	   Bragman said he has been a devoted follower and adviser to Clinton's
campaign and, when her announcement tour hits Syracuse Wednesday, he said he was
a chief organizer of a forum she will hold at Syracuse University and of a
fund-raiser later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall and Andrew Cuomo, the federal housing secretary and son of former
Gov. Mario Cuomo, are considered the top possible Democratic candidates for
governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver is neutral in the 2002 governor's race. But the speaker is a staunch
supporter of Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination for president,
and Gore is very close to Andrew Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
	   As majority leader, Bragman is the No. 2 figure in the Assembly behind
Silver. Bragman serves as traffic cop for legislation as it moves onto the floor
of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Bragman, of upstate Onondaga County, and Silver, of Manhattan, have
worked together in their current posts for seven years in the Assembly, they
have never been particularly close and relations between the two have at times
been strained.
</P>
<P>
	   Bragman was not present at a news conference Silver called Monday to unveil
a series of managed care-related bills. Silver said he assumed Bragman was
attending to other Assembly business.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked whether problems had developed between himself and Bragman,
Silver said the only "rift" he knew about was the much-publicized falling out
that Republican Gov. George Pataki and Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, also
a Republican, have been experiencing.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki and Bruno have been fighting over whether the state should pick up
the counties' share of a new health insurance program, plus other policy issues
and perceived slights.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver appeared uncomfortable when pressed about his relations with Bragman
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that is not a productive use of our time here," he told reporters.

<HEADLINE> State appraiser's calculations questioned during cross-examination  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A federal government attorney wanted empirical
evidence. Instead, he got explanations from a state property appraiser during a
contentious cross-examination over the calculation of historic per-acre values
in the Cayuga Indian Nation land claim.
<P>
	   A U.S. District Court jury listened Monday as John D. Dorchester Jr.
acknowledged repeatedly that he used a qualitative analysis to peg the per-acre
cost of land in 1796 at between 45 cents and 55 cents for the Cayuga land claim
area. That figure was lower than what New York paid and later resold the same
land for.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no simple formula. There are no simple mathematics. Yes, it is a
qualitative answer," Dorchester said during the 10th day of testimony in the
damages trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Hank Meshorer spent the day trying to undermine
Dorchester's appraisal that the claim area is worth no more than $46 million for
its present-day market value and rental worth for 204 years of use and
occupancy.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal courts already have ruled that New York illegally acquired the
land from the Cayugas in 1795 and 1807 by failing to obtain federal approval for
the transactions. The nine-member jury is to decide how much compensation the
Cayugas should receive.
</P>
<P>
	   An appraiser for the federal government, which is siding with the Cayugas,
testified that the tribe should get $335 million for its lost ancestral lands in
Cayuga and Seneca counties.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Meshorer focused on how Dorchester established early market
value, turning to a report that Dorchester submitted to the court in which he
started with a base figure of $1.40 per acre in 1796 and reduced it to 45 cents
to 55 cents using a series of discounts because of the claim tract's large size.
Land prices come down as acreage increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Meshorer also asked why Dorchester's figure was lower than another appraisal
conducted in the mid-1970s that started with a base figure of $1.80 per acre.
That appraisal put more value on the claim area because of Cayuga Lake, which
stretches through it and eventually provided farmers with access to the Mohawk
and Susquehanna river systems and markets in Albany and Baltimore, Dorchester
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dorchester explained that he used a bracketing technique where he found high
and low values for both large and small tracts at that time, ranked all his
examples and then made adjustments for other market factors and variables to
reach his appraisal.
</P>
<P>
	   Meshorer said the extreme lot sizes Dorchester used, from 6 million acres to
60,000 acres, also left a wide margin for error, a point the appraiser disputed.
</P>
<P>
	   Meshorer then suggested that Dorchester's method was arbitrary and
subjective.
</P>
<P>
	   "You make it sound quantitative. But it's all qualitative. Surely you must
have done something quantitative to get your figures. Where's the math?"
Meshorer pressed.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not as simple a picture as you're trying to paint," Dorchester
responded.
</P>
<P>
	   In April 1795, three months before the state bought the Cayuga land, New
York lawmakers had passed a statute defining how it would be purchased for 50
cents an acre, subdivided into smaller lots, and then sold at auction for no
less than $2 an acre. New York reaped $278,000 for selling the land.
</P>
<P>
	   Meshorer questioned Dorchester why he evaluated the tract's "highest, best
use" as investment holdings and not as land that was destined to be subdivided
and developed, a much more valuable use. Particularly, when the state identified
it would break the tract up for resale in smaller lots, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seems like its highest and best use was preordained by the state,"
Meshorer said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dorchester stood his ground.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was being held for later development or its future potential. The
majority of these properties were purchased as speculative investments and later
resold," he answered."There was great supply but there was no demand."
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout questioning, New York Assistant Attorney General John Picket
interrupted with objections and repeated questions about what year Meshorer was
talking. From the witness stand, Dorchester frequently asked Meshorer to repeat
his questions or quibbled with him over the meaning of words.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton says abortion should be litmus test for Supreme  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton says that if elected to the
Senate, she would vote against anti-abortion judges who are nominated for
appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court.
<P>
	   She also committed to remain living in Chappaqua even if she loses the race.
"I look forward to spending years in that house," she said in a wide-ranging
interview Monday with The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady said that the way Supreme Court vacancies are filled in the
next administration will emerge as a theme of her campaign. "This is a very
important issue and I will be talking about it throughout the campaign because I
think people have a real choice in both their vote for president and Senate,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Her likely Republican opponent in the Senate race, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, said Sunday that he would not use a judge's position on Roe v.
Wade as a "litmus test" for a confirmation vote.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton said that if she were presented with a judge "on record as
opposing Roe v. Wade or a woman's right to choose, I cannot imagine I would vote
to confirm such a nominee."
</P>
<P>
	   In two public appearances Monday in Buffalo, the first lady seemed focused
-- in ways that haven't come across before -- on telling people who she is and
what she stands for. At an airport rally and a high-tech training center, she
repeatedly told audiences "I'll be on your side" and spoke again and again of
her "more than 30 years" of working on issues related to children, education and
health care.
</P>
<P>
	   She also talked about her roots in Chicago, a city which, just like Buffalo,
is located on the Great Lakes in what used to be known as the Rust Belt.
</P>
<P>
	   And her campaign materials, from banners to press releases, are increasingly
referring to her as simply "Hillary," which not only takes away the formality of
the title "first lady," but also erases any doubt about which Clinton is running
the show.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just seems like the easiest way for me to quickly be identified," she
told the AP. "That's what so many people now in the crowds that I'm in are
calling me and holding up signs, you know, with Hillary on it. It just makes a
lot of sense. This may be a campaign between two, first-name candidates."
</P>
<P>
	   She said President Clinton gives her advice but that there usually isn't
time to consult him before she takes a position on an issue.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said she does lobby him on New York issues. "New York has an
advocate in Washington in me," she said. "And I have certainly let my views be
known in the White House and in the administration on issues I've learned about
in the last seven months."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about her contact with the independent counsel's office, which
continues to investigate the Clintons' role in the Whitewater scandal,
dismissals from the White House travel office and other allegations, she said
simply: "It's been a long time. I can't remember."
</P>
<P>
	   She was more forthcoming on how the ongoing probe affects her reputation and
her campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "You would have thought they'd be over by now. I think everyone would have
expected that after 6 1/2 years, thousands upon thousands of documents and
investigations and committee hearings, that they would have reached their
conclusion," she said, adding that the investigation has "nothing to do with any
of my campaign decisions."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said she will devote much of her energy to reintroducing herself to
a public that often views her only through the prism of first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   "What I found as I began to travel around the state last summer is that I
was very well-known, but not much was known about me," she said. "I found many
people didn't know, hard as it may be to believe, that I practiced law or that
I'd been a children's advocate or that I'd given a million dollars away to
children's charities that I earned from my book."
</P>
<P>
	   She added that "when you come out of the White House ... there really is one
voice" -- the president's. "No matter how much you do to help create positive
results for the people as part of that overall agenda, it's only appropriate
that the American public doesn't know much about it," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She noted that Vice President Al Gore "had to say to himself, 'Hey, I need
to go out and tell my story, people don't know anything about me.' I learned
pretty much the same thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Does that mean she's reinventing herself the way Gore did?
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not moving to Nashville," she said. "I moved to Chappaqua."

<HEADLINE> Hillary Rodham Clinton unveils economic plan for upstate NY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Pledging that "we can bring good jobs to every
corner of New York," Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton has unveiled a
four-part strategy for economic recovery in upstate New York.
<P>
	   One day after announcing her candidacy, Clinton on Monday flew to Buffalo,
where many say the national economic tidal wave has barely caused a ripple.
</P>
<P>
	   "The people of upstate New York made the economy of the 20th century. We
still have the same resources. We still have the same intelligence. We still can
demonstrate that we have what it takes to lead the economy of the 21st century,"
Clinton said in a speech to about 100 people at Buffalo's Advanced Training
Center.
</P>
<P>
	   As she has in recent appearances, Clinton repeatedly turned to the pronoun
"we" in her continuing effort to bond with New Yorkers. She only moved into New
York state a month ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's four-part economic strategy included several points that she has
talked about in the past, including getting back more of the $15 billion that
New York sends annually to Washington which goes to other states.
</P>
<P>
	   She again called for lowering utility costs and air fares. To help lower
utility costs, Clinton said consumers shouldn't have to pay the bill for
utilities' nuclear plants and other non-competitive investments.
</P>
<P>
	   She also called for providing extra help to emerging high-tech companies by
such things as creating "tech bonds." Under that plan, state and local
governments would be able to issue bonds which would come with federal tax
credits and serve as an incentive to high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
	   She also called for expanding broadband technology to reach all areas of the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was greeted in Buffalo at an airport rally by about three dozen
people and as many members of the media.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a lot of work to do, but it will be fun," Clinton told one
supporter as she autographed campaign signs.

<HEADLINE> Law would attack crime by targeting drug houses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A new state effort to close drug dens and crack
houses will target the landlords who own the properties.
<P>
	   A landlord could be targeted after repeated police raids and convictions of
the same drug suspects living in or operating from leased properties, according
to a plan outlined Monday by state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Spitzer, stiff fines could compound for as long as it takes for
the landlord to rid the criminal element from the building.
</P>
<P>
	   The cycle of raid, arrest, jail, release and return to the same home is
destroying neighborhoods and the families who are trying to live in them, two
community activists said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "People are afraid to walk; people are afraid to use the telephone booth and
the traffic is going in and out all night," Linda Miller said.
</P>
<P>
	   "What I object to is all the people who come from the suburbs and get their
drugs," said Elfrieda Textores, who has lived her 68 years in the inner-city
neighborhood. "I'm tired of having people afraid to visit me."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the message," Miller said sternly: "The South End is not going to
tolerate this kind of behavior anymore."
</P>
<P>
	   "Drug dealers cannot be permitted to plant a flag in our neighborhoods,
claim it as their turf, and proclaim they are open for business," Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   His office is seeking court orders against a landlord and to keep five
alleged dealers from within 200 feet of one suspected marijuana operation in
Albany. The strategy will be duplicated statewide and eventually take on crack
houses and other centers of harder drugs and violence, Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clean Sweep is being tried in the Albany neighborhood where Miller and
Textores live first. While the civil action, backed by police reports and
records of convictions began Monday, Spitzer said a court injunction might not
be granted until March 22 under the law. Despite the delay, Spitzer said the
suspects are unlikely to move before the court acts.
</P>
<P>
	   That's how stubborn the players are and how persistent the problem is,
Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer said the constitutionality of the program is sound because property
owners are required by safety codes to report and deter crime in their
buildings. He also said the potential penalty - fines - is a measured,
reasonable response that will withstand a legal test.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are fundamentally shifting the focus of our attention," Spitzer said.
"We want to bring different tools to the situation."
</P>
<P>
	   Miller and Textores said it's about time.
</P>
<P>
	   They remember an editorial once said crime in her neighborhood was simply a
fact of life: live with it.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well," Miller said, "We don't think we have to live with it."

<HEADLINE> Long to Giuliani: Don't run for Senate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The leader of the New York Conservative Party says
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani fails on almost every issue that
conservatives hold dear.
<P>
	   "I think I would rather that he didn't run," Michael Long said during his
party's political action conference in Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Long also suggested that his party may field its own Senate candidate
against Giuliani and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Democrat, no matter
how damaging it might be to the Republican cause.
</P>
<P>
	   "Occasionally, conservatives have to take a tough stand," said Long, who
refused to say who his party is looking at as a possible candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by an almost 5-3
margin, no Republican has won statewide office in the past 25 years without the
Conservative Party's endorsement. Republican George Pataki beat then-Democratic
Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1994 on the strength of the Conservative Party vote.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Giuliani didn't back down. "Sure, we'd like to have the
endorsement," Giuliani spokeswoman Kim Serafin said. "However, the mayor will
not sacrifice principle for political expediency."
</P>
<P>
	   "The mayor does not and will not change his views for anybody," Giuliani
campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, unlike most states, major party candidates can run on several
ballot lines and the votes for them on all lines are then added together to
determine the election winner.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has routinely run for mayor with Liberal Party backing. But Long
has said that the only way Giuliani could win Conservative Party backing in his
Senate bid would be to give up Liberal Party support and come out in favor of a
ban on what critics call partial-birth abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani, like Clinton, is an abortion rights supporter.
</P>
<P>
	   "If he refuses to evolve or be open-minded on the issue I believe more than
75 percent of the people of New York consider a horrific act and infanticide
then, in fact, he has to accept the responsibility of that decision," Long said.
</P>
<P>
	   Long said he hasn't even talked to the mayor since a brief conversation in
August when the mayor said he would get back in touch.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's wrong on domestic partners, he's wrong on gays in the military, he's
wrong on gay rights, he's wrong on rent control, he's wrong on ... we could just
go on and on and on," Long said. "The question would be what issues is he right
on. He's right on (school) vouchers and he's a good strong administrator. But
being a strong administrator doesn't make you a good United States senator."
</P>
<P>
	   Long said he was actively looking for someone to run for the Senate seat but
refused to slam the door completely on Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we can find the right candidates, you'll be the first to know about it
immediately," Long said. "And clearly I think we will blow this race wide open
and that's what our intentions are to do UNLESS someone comes to us and is
willing to give to us the commitment that they will fight for conservative
principles in the United States Senate."
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Congressman Rick Lazio was one of the names Long seemed
interested in. Lazio was prepared earlier in the year to run for Senate, but he
stepped aside at the behest of Republican Party leaders. He also spoke to the
Conservative meeting in Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   "If he made a phone call, we're ready to move," Long said.
</P>
<P>
	   Long also called on the Republican Party leadership to ask Giuliani not to
take the Liberal Party endorsement, saying it would damage the GOP's
relationship with the Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
	   "If this happens, I consider it a break in a relationship that has been
going on for 25 years, and clearly that would mean that they are allowing it,"
he said. "If they allow him to accept the Liberal Party endorsement statewide,
then in fact they are not serious about the things I think they believe in."

<HEADLINE> Protesters support white officers' rights; memory of victim  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - If racial tension is an undercurrent in the trial of
four white police officers accused of killing a black man, it was a flood
outside the courtroom Monday.
<P>
	   "We're here to fight racism," said the Rev. Timothy Mitchell, a 69-year-old
minister speaking to Harlem Christian school students. "I have never seen as
much racism in my whole experience as what is happening now."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day of sporadic demonstrations, Thomas Chandler, another
black man, argued that racism is a key to the trial - but it's aimed at the four
white New York City police officers charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
	   "These officers would be treated differently if they were (members of) a
minority," said Chandler of suburban Albany and chairman of a local gun-owners'
rights group. "People are so willing to politicize the hatred ... They were
treated as probable murderers simply because they are white officers."
</P>
<P>
	   These protesters weren't organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton like the bused-in
rage a week ago from the Bronx, where the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo
happened one year ago. Monday's conflicts illustrated the complexity of race
relations, even within the black community, of the trial so racially charged it
was moved to Albany because an appeals court ruled the officers couldn't get an
impartial jury in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   At noon, a dozen students and their ministers from the Mount Pleasant
Christian Academy in Harlem quietly prayed, sang hymns and ranted in a small
rally against the racism they fear could leave them like Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   "What happened to Amadou Diallo could happen to any of us," said Kyle
Bollar, 21, of Long Island who attends the State University of New York at
Albany. "We're the next generation. We need to start fighting."
</P>
<P>
	   In the crowd was Mony Tambi who, like Diallo, is a West African immigrant.
He redirected his concerns of race back to the minister. Tambi said blacks must
confront racism by a "revolution in our hearts" and through an individual
initiative to overcome bias.
</P>
<P>
	   "How long are you going to sing?" he shouted back to the stage. "If we do
for ourselves and create opportunity for ourselves this won't happen," he said,
referring to the racism he fears fueled the Diallo shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   As disagreement rose within the crowd, the minister ended the debate with a
call for more hymns, drowning out Tambi.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd specifically addressed questions by reporters about Chandler's
comments, repeatedly saying racism fueled the quick reactions of the New York
City police officers who said they thought Diallo was an armed and dangerous
suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was an honest mistake," Chandler insisted, as four white colleagues
stood well behind him wearing placards that read "Freedom is Never Free."
</P>
<P>
	   "They had cornered a desperate man. If it was your son," Chandler said,
"wouldn't you want him to defend himself the best he could?"
</P>
<P>
	   Chandler argued that black activists who have led protests outside the
trial, while well intentioned, are hurting the cause of civil rights he shares
with them.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only reason the civil rights movement worked was people had respect for
equal treatment," he said. "We should be able to recognize bigotry."

<HEADLINE> Study: Child Health Plus results generally positive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The health and habits of poor people do not change
overnight even if they get access to health care coverage, a study of New York's
Child Health Plus program has concluded.
<P>
	   The study of more than 2,000 children - funded in part by the state Health
Department - showed many hopeful trends. They included an increase in visits to
primary care facilities, including a jump of 25 percent for preventive visits,
52 percent for acute visits and 42 percent for total visits, with
hospitalizations dropping by 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   About one third of parents reported improved health care for their children
after enrolling in Child Health Plus, and none noted a worse quality of care.
</P>
<P>
	   But according to the author of the study, Dr. Peter Szilagyi, the mere fact
that health coverage is available doesn't necessarily mean that everyone will
avail themselves of that care or do so in a diligent fashion.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the report, uninsured children are more likely than insured
children to delay seeking care, to use fewer ambulatory health services and to
have fewer visits for common pediatric conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   "Much of this past behavior continues even after the children are insured,"
said Szilagyi, a doctor at the Children's Hospital at Strong Memorial in
Rochester. "There were problems with patient follow up, it was tough to keep
patients coming back for regular appointments and there is no reason to believe
that similar results are not to be expected from the adult population if
insurance were guaranteed to them under Family Health Plus."
</P>
<P>
	   Szilagyi's study was released Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Child Health Plus program will serve as the model for a new planned
program, Family Health Plus, which state officials say will make
state-subsidized health coverage available to up to 1 million poor working New
York adults starting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also found that significantly more specialists were seen through
Child Health Plus, more than double the number before the program for all
children.
</P>
<P>
	   "The old adage is that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, if
you have access to preventive care you are more likely to avoid long term, more
serious injuries," said Richard Kirsch, executive director of Citizen Action of
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   State health officials are cautiously optimistic.
</P>
<P>
	   "On the one hand we're happy with the conclusion of this most recent study,
but we're also cautious about the future," said Rob Kenny, a spokesman for the
state Health Department.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one can make an individual go to the hospital, all that we can do is to
establish a relationship with an individual or family to keep them coming back
either for Child Health Plus or Family Health Plus," Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
	   Family Health Plus program is an initiative included in the Health Care
Reform Act 2000 approved by the state Legislature and Gov. George Pataki in
December.
</P>
<P>
	   It will initially cost $277 million. Funding in part will come from the
state's settlement with tobacco companies and through a near-doubling of the
state's tax on cigarettes to begin on March 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The study appeared in the February issue of Pediatrics and was also
partially funded by the Packard Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Reform groups try to keep pressure on over ballot access  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The governor and leaders of the state Legislature
owe it to the people of New York to rework state laws to make ballots more
accessible to more candidates, a government reformer says.
<P>
	   "We're simply asking them to practice democracy," Barbara Bartoletti of the
League of Women Voters said Monday. "We think they have a responsibility to the
constituents of this state."
</P>
<P>
	   An agreement engineered by a federal judge to open the March 7 presidential
primary to the top Republican candidates should not be the extent of ballot
access "reform" in 2000, Bartoletti and representatives of two other groups
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attempts by Gov. George Pataki and state GOP Chairman William Powers to
exclude Republican candidates in favor of their choice for the presidency, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, were a disaster for the prestige of New York Republicans
and the state as a whole, Bartoletti argued.
</P>
<P>
	   "People have ridiculed New York state," she said. "We are literally the
embarrassment of the nation."
</P>
<P>
	   There remains much confusion over whether the deal brokered by federal Judge
Edward Korman to open New York's primary ballot applies only to the March 7
primary or will have a longer-range effect on the state's exclusionary and
hyper-technical process of qualifying for the ballot, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Government reform groups have called for years for the system to be eased.
Their representatives said Monday they have sent Pataki and legislative leaders
a letter calling on them to approve a new primary system where all "serious"
presidential candidates automatically get on New York's ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   The groups said such "serious" candidacies could be defined as those which
either collect 5,000 petition signature statewide or which qualify for federal
matching funds - a process now requiring a candidate to raise at least $100,000
and collect 5,000 petition signatures in at least 20 states.
</P>
<P>
	   The groups, which also included Common Cause and the New York Public
Interest Research Group, said political parties in New York should also share
with all candidates lists of their enrolled members. Control of the lists is one
more way in which party bosses are able to boost the candidacies of their
presidential favorites and inhibit candidates who are out of favor with the
party establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Erik Joerss of Common Cause said making permanent changes would also prevent
reformers from having to lobby every four years for fairer ballot access rules,
since he said politicians and reporters only seem to focus on the state's
exclusionary system in each presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
	   "One of the definitions of insanity is to do the same thing over and over
again and to expect different outcomes," Joerss said.
</P>
<P>
	   The reformers also said a swift adoption of a new primary system would allow
more lenient access rules to apply to the 2000 state legislative races. Petition
signatures to qualify those candidates must be gathered by early June.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, who abandoned the fight against Bush's opponents in New York, has
said he does not believe candidates should be ruled off the ballot because of
technicalities.
</P>
<P>
	   State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said Monday he does not see the
immediate need for legislation. The deal worked out by Korman will solve the
ballot access problem for this upcoming presidential primary, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Of access to legislative ballots and wider-ranging changes to the nominating
system, Silver said, "at the appropriate time we'll deal with that, if
necessary."
</P>
<P>
	   Korman found a series of unconstitutional provisions in the current primary
qualification system, including the requirement that petition signers list the
town they live in instead of the hamlet or village. Korman said that provision
was on the books only to serve as a technicality to allow petition signatures to
be disqualified.

<HEADLINE> Top Assembly Democrats in spat over gubernatorial endorsement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - First the state's most powerful Republicans got into
a tussle.
<P>
	   Now, the top two Democrats in the state Assembly are having a tiff over what
the chamber's speaker says is the misplaced political "focus" of its majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaker Sheldon Silver said Monday it is too early for Majority Leader
Michael Bragman to worry about backing a candidate in the governor's race in
2002 with a president, congressional delegation and new state Legislature to
elect this November.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there has to be an appropriate focus on the year 2000," Silver
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver's comments served to confirm a report in Monday's New York Post of
tensions between Silver and Bragman over Bragman agreeing to be one of four
members of an advisory committee formed to promote state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall's candidacy for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post, citing unidentified sources, reported that Silver was miffed
Bragman didn't clear his participation on the committee with Silver, and also
annoyed that Bragman wasn't worrying more about the 2000 elections at this point
than on the next gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
	   Bragman said Monday evening that he had not discussed the issue with Silver.
</P>
<P>
	   "However, no one should question my focus or my support for Assembly
campaigns, for the campaign of Hillary Clinton or any other statewide race,"
Bragman said. "If anyone should do that, then it's correct to say that there
should be a rift between that person and me."
</P>
<P>
	   Bragman said he has been a devoted follower and adviser to Clinton's
campaign and, when her announcement tour hits Syracuse Wednesday, he said he was
a chief organizer of a forum she will hold at Syracuse University and of a
fund-raiser later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall and Andrew Cuomo, the federal housing secretary and son of former
Gov. Mario Cuomo, are considered the top possible Democratic candidates for
governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver is neutral in the 2002 governor's race. But the speaker is a staunch
supporter of Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination for president,
and Gore is very close to Andrew Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
	   As majority leader, Bragman is the No. 2 figure in the Assembly behind
Silver. Bragman serves as traffic cop for legislation as it moves onto the floor
of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Bragman, of upstate Onondaga County, and Silver, of Manhattan, have
worked together in their current posts for seven years in the Assembly, they
have never been particularly close and relations between the two have at times
been strained.
</P>
<P>
	   Bragman was not present at a news conference Silver called Monday to unveil
a series of managed care-related bills. Silver said he assumed Bragman was
attending to other Assembly business.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked whether problems had developed between himself and Bragman,
Silver said the only "rift" he knew about was the much-publicized falling out
that Republican Gov. George Pataki and Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, also
a Republican, have been experiencing.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki and Bruno have been fighting over whether the state should pick up
the counties' share of a new health insurance program, plus other policy issues
and perceived slights.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver appeared uncomfortable when pressed about his relations with Bragman
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that is not a productive use of our time here," he told reporters.

<HEADLINE> State appraiser's calculations questioned during cross-examination  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A federal government attorney wanted empirical
evidence. Instead, he got explanations from a state property appraiser during a
contentious cross-examination over the calculation of historic per-acre values
in the Cayuga Indian Nation land claim.
<P>
	   A U.S. District Court jury listened Monday as John D. Dorchester Jr.
acknowledged repeatedly that he used a qualitative analysis to peg the per-acre
cost of land in 1796 at between 45 cents and 55 cents for the Cayuga land claim
area. That figure was lower than what New York paid and later resold the same
land for.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no simple formula. There are no simple mathematics. Yes, it is a
qualitative answer," Dorchester said during the 10th day of testimony in the
damages trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Hank Meshorer spent the day trying to undermine
Dorchester's appraisal that the claim area is worth no more than $46 million for
its present-day market value and rental worth for 204 years of use and
occupancy.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal courts already have ruled that New York illegally acquired the
land from the Cayugas in 1795 and 1807 by failing to obtain federal approval for
the transactions. The nine-member jury is to decide how much compensation the
Cayugas should receive.
</P>
<P>
	   An appraiser for the federal government, which is siding with the Cayugas,
testified that the tribe should get $335 million for its lost ancestral lands in
Cayuga and Seneca counties.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Meshorer focused on how Dorchester established early market
value, turning to a report that Dorchester submitted to the court in which he
started with a base figure of $1.40 per acre in 1796 and reduced it to 45 cents
to 55 cents using a series of discounts because of the claim tract's large size.
Land prices come down as acreage increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Meshorer also asked why Dorchester's figure was lower than another appraisal
conducted in the mid-1970s that started with a base figure of $1.80 per acre.
That appraisal put more value on the claim area because of Cayuga Lake, which
stretches through it and eventually provided farmers with access to the Mohawk
and Susquehanna river systems and markets in Albany and Baltimore, Dorchester
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dorchester explained that he used a bracketing technique where he found high
and low values for both large and small tracts at that time, ranked all his
examples and then made adjustments for other market factors and variables to
reach his appraisal.
</P>
<P>
	   Meshorer said the extreme lot sizes Dorchester used, from 6 million acres to
60,000 acres, also left a wide margin for error, a point the appraiser disputed.
</P>
<P>
	   Meshorer then suggested that Dorchester's method was arbitrary and
subjective.
</P>
<P>
	   "You make it sound quantitative. But it's all qualitative. Surely you must
have done something quantitative to get your figures. Where's the math?"
Meshorer pressed.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not as simple a picture as you're trying to paint," Dorchester
responded.
</P>
<P>
	   In April 1795, three months before the state bought the Cayuga land, New
York lawmakers had passed a statute defining how it would be purchased for 50
cents an acre, subdivided into smaller lots, and then sold at auction for no
less than $2 an acre. New York reaped $278,000 for selling the land.
</P>
<P>
	   Meshorer questioned Dorchester why he evaluated the tract's "highest, best
use" as investment holdings and not as land that was destined to be subdivided
and developed, a much more valuable use. Particularly, when the state identified
it would break the tract up for resale in smaller lots, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seems like its highest and best use was preordained by the state,"
Meshorer said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dorchester stood his ground.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was being held for later development or its future potential. The
majority of these properties were purchased as speculative investments and later
resold," he answered."There was great supply but there was no demand."
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout questioning, New York Assistant Attorney General John Picket
interrupted with objections and repeated questions about what year Meshorer was
talking. From the witness stand, Dorchester frequently asked Meshorer to repeat
his questions or quibbled with him over the meaning of words.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton says abortion should be litmus test for Supreme  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton says that if elected to the
Senate, she would vote against anti-abortion judges who are nominated for
appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court.
<P>
	   She also committed to remain living in Chappaqua even if she loses the race.
"I look forward to spending years in that house," she said in a wide-ranging
interview Monday with The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady said that the way Supreme Court vacancies are filled in the
next administration will emerge as a theme of her campaign. "This is a very
important issue and I will be talking about it throughout the campaign because I
think people have a real choice in both their vote for president and Senate,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Her likely Republican opponent in the Senate race, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, said Sunday that he would not use a judge's position on Roe v.
Wade as a "litmus test" for a confirmation vote.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton said that if she were presented with a judge "on record as
opposing Roe v. Wade or a woman's right to choose, I cannot imagine I would vote
to confirm such a nominee."
</P>
<P>
	   In two public appearances Monday in Buffalo, the first lady seemed focused
-- in ways that haven't come across before -- on telling people who she is and
what she stands for. At an airport rally and a high-tech training center, she
repeatedly told audiences "I'll be on your side" and spoke again and again of
her "more than 30 years" of working on issues related to children, education and
health care.
</P>
<P>
	   She also talked about her roots in Chicago, a city which, just like Buffalo,
is located on the Great Lakes in what used to be known as the Rust Belt.
</P>
<P>
	   And her campaign materials, from banners to press releases, are increasingly
referring to her as simply "Hillary," which not only takes away the formality of
the title "first lady," but also erases any doubt about which Clinton is running
the show.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just seems like the easiest way for me to quickly be identified," she
told the AP. "That's what so many people now in the crowds that I'm in are
calling me and holding up signs, you know, with Hillary on it. It just makes a
lot of sense. This may be a campaign between two, first-name candidates."
</P>
<P>
	   She said President Clinton gives her advice but that there usually isn't
time to consult him before she takes a position on an issue.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said she does lobby him on New York issues. "New York has an
advocate in Washington in me," she said. "And I have certainly let my views be
known in the White House and in the administration on issues I've learned about
in the last seven months."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about her contact with the independent counsel's office, which
continues to investigate the Clintons' role in the Whitewater scandal,
dismissals from the White House travel office and other allegations, she said
simply: "It's been a long time. I can't remember."
</P>
<P>
	   She was more forthcoming on how the ongoing probe affects her reputation and
her campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "You would have thought they'd be over by now. I think everyone would have
expected that after 6 1/2 years, thousands upon thousands of documents and
investigations and committee hearings, that they would have reached their
conclusion," she said, adding that the investigation has "nothing to do with any
of my campaign decisions."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said she will devote much of her energy to reintroducing herself to
a public that often views her only through the prism of first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   "What I found as I began to travel around the state last summer is that I
was very well-known, but not much was known about me," she said. "I found many
people didn't know, hard as it may be to believe, that I practiced law or that
I'd been a children's advocate or that I'd given a million dollars away to
children's charities that I earned from my book."
</P>
<P>
	   She added that "when you come out of the White House ... there really is one
voice" -- the president's. "No matter how much you do to help create positive
results for the people as part of that overall agenda, it's only appropriate
that the American public doesn't know much about it," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She noted that Vice President Al Gore "had to say to himself, 'Hey, I need
to go out and tell my story, people don't know anything about me.' I learned
pretty much the same thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Does that mean she's reinventing herself the way Gore did?
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not moving to Nashville," she said. "I moved to Chappaqua."

<HEADLINE> Hillary Rodham Clinton unveils economic plan for upstate NY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Pledging that "we can bring good jobs to every
corner of New York," Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton has unveiled a
four-part strategy for economic recovery in upstate New York.
<P>
	   One day after announcing her candidacy, Clinton on Monday flew to Buffalo,
where many say the national economic tidal wave has barely caused a ripple.
</P>
<P>
	   "The people of upstate New York made the economy of the 20th century. We
still have the same resources. We still have the same intelligence. We still can
demonstrate that we have what it takes to lead the economy of the 21st century,"
Clinton said in a speech to about 100 people at Buffalo's Advanced Training
Center.
</P>
<P>
	   As she has in recent appearances, Clinton repeatedly turned to the pronoun
"we" in her continuing effort to bond with New Yorkers. She only moved into New
York state a month ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's four-part economic strategy included several points that she has
talked about in the past, including getting back more of the $15 billion that
New York sends annually to Washington which goes to other states.
</P>
<P>
	   She again called for lowering utility costs and air fares. To help lower
utility costs, Clinton said consumers shouldn't have to pay the bill for
utilities' nuclear plants and other non-competitive investments.
</P>
<P>
	   She also called for providing extra help to emerging high-tech companies by
such things as creating "tech bonds." Under that plan, state and local
governments would be able to issue bonds which would come with federal tax
credits and serve as an incentive to high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
	   She also called for expanding broadband technology to reach all areas of the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was greeted in Buffalo at an airport rally by about three dozen
people and as many members of the media.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a lot of work to do, but it will be fun," Clinton told one
supporter as she autographed campaign signs.

<TEXT>
    	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - Police on Monday were searching for the mother
of an infant found abandoned in a store parking lot here.
<P>
	   The baby was in good condition at Hackensack University Medical Center, said
spokeswoman Linda Nasta.
</P>
<P>
	   The baby, possibly a newborn, was found by two shoppers about 7:30 p.m. in

They only would say an investigation is continuing.
</P>
<P>
	   The Record of Hackensack reported for Tuesday's editions that the baby was
found wearing several layers of clothes, with a stack of baby clothes and a baby
bottle.

<HEADLINE> New Collectible Baseball Card Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    RENTON, Wash. (AP) -- The maker of the wildly successfully Pokemon trading
cards wants to give the venerable baseball card, its faltering rival, an update.
</P>
<P>
	   Renton-based Wizards of the Coast Inc. said Monday it will produce a
collectible trading card game based on major league baseball players called MLB
Showdown 2000, combining card collecting with strategy games and fantasy
baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   By purchasing cards, players will assemble lineups and play other "teams."
According to the company, players can change lineups, keep statistics, send in
relief pitchers or steal bases.
</P>
<P>
	   Starter sets will sell for $9.99 and "booster packs" with additional cards
will cost $2.99.
</P>
<P>
	   Wizards of the Coast plans to develop card-gaming leagues in which players
can face off -- similar to the leagues it has developed for its Pokemon and
Magic: The Gathering games.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has a multiyear deal with Major League Baseball and the Major
League Baseball Players Association. Financial terms were not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Agencies, Merrill Lynch Reach Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By CHELSEA J. CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Fourteen public agencies in an Orange County
investment pool have agreed to a $32.5 settlement with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the
brokerage they had accused of helping bankrupt the county in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement, reached Monday, effectively ends the county's bankruptcy
litigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "After weighing the substantial costs and distraction of continuing to
litigate, we determined it would be in the best interests of all parties to
bring this matter to a close," Merrill Lynch said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Santa Barbara City Attorney Daniel Wallace said the settlement was "good for
everyone involved."
</P>
<P>
	   "The most important thing is that these taxpayers recover all of their
money," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed settlement brings to an end a lawsuit filed by the 14 agencies
that accused Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest brokerage, of taking part in
former Orange County Treasurer Robert Citron's violation of his duties to
taxpayers and investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Citron's failed gamble on interest rates led to $1.64 billion in losses for
the county's investment pool, a savings bank for many schools, cities and water
and sewer districts. The losses forced the county to seek federal bankruptcy
protection in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Citron pleaded guilty to falsifying records and violating state securities
laws and served eight months in a prison work-release program.
</P>
<P>
	   The bankruptcy came after Citron took a $7 billion investment pool, borrowed
another $14 billion and invested heavily in interest rate-sensitive securities.
When the Federal Reserve forced interest rates sharply higher to curb inflation
in 1994, what had been a spectacularly successful strategy suddenly turned sour.
</P>
<P>
	   Citron blamed Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., accusing it of failing to disclose risks
associated with such investments. Merrill Lynch officials said they had warned
him.
</P>
<P>
	   Merrill Lynch paid the county $437.1 million to settle a lawsuit accusing
the firm of giving bad advice that contributed to the financial collapse. The
company later agreed to pay $2 million to settle Securities and Exchange
Commission accusations that it was negligent in warning investors about the risk
of buying the county bonds it underwrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The 14 agencies that declined to participate in Orange County's litigation
were paid for dropping their lawsuit against the county.
</P>
<P>
	   The agencies, both in and outside Orange County, included the cities of
Atascadero, Buena Park, Claremont, Milipitas, Montebello, Mountain View, Santa
Barbara and Yorba Linda. It also included redevelopment agencies in Santa
Barbara, Buena Park, Montebello and Yorba Linda and the Santiago County water
district.

<HEADLINE> U S West Pushing for Long-Distance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- U S West is accelerating its efforts to get into the
long-distance market within its local calling region.
</P>
<P>
	   The Denver-based Bell company, which has long-distance applications pending
in several states already, plans today to complete its filing process with the
remaining states in its region. U S West's territory covers 14 states.
</P>
<P>
	   State telephone regulatory commissions determine whether the company has
successfully opened its markets to local phone rivals -- a prerequisite for a
Bell company to begin offering long-distance to its own local customers.
</P>
<P>
	   These state commissions then can weigh in with a recommendation once U S
West files individual state applications with the Federal Communications
Commission. The FCC ultimately decides whether to give companies approval.
</P>
<P>
	   A committee made up of commissioners from the states in U S West's territory
has developed a regionwide test plan to make sure all the company's systems can
process orders from rivals who seek to lease lines from the Bell company's
network. That third-party testing will show whether the company's local markets
are open to competition, U S West officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are moving forward aggressively to offer consumers a complete,
integrated bundle of communications and information service," said U S West
Chairman Solomon Trujillo.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has customers in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Montana,
Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah,
Washington and Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Exam 2 Big Bank Failures  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers are examining two big bank failures that
involved fraud and cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. nearly $1 billion.
They also are looking over a recent nationwide increase in risky loans to people
with poor credit histories.
</P>
<P>
	   The two recent failures -- of First National Bank of Keystone, based in
Keystone, W.Va., and BestBank of Boulder, Colo. -- involved fraud and
contributed to last year's biggest annual loss to the FDIC's insurance fund
since the regional bank crises of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators and lawmakers are concerned about the eight U.S. bank failures
last year, which occurred amid a booming economy. Compounding the worry, the
FDIC is predicting that as many as 20 banks could go under this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, on Jan. 14, Iowa's banking superintendent closed the
Hartford-Carlisle Savings Bank of Carlisle, Iowa, and the FDIC was named
receiver. Regulators say fraud also was involved in that failure.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the FDIC told its 1,800 examiners to keep alert for warning
signs of possible fraud at the banks they inspect. And the agency recently
proposed that capital requirements be doubled for banks that specialize in
high-risk loans to people with inferior credit histories.
</P>
<P>
	   "The good news is that the American banking system has never been stronger"
and that the FDIC's insurance fund is at a record high level of some $29
billion, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the House Banking Committee, said
in a statement Monday. "The bad news is that there have been several recent bank
failures that have raised concerns about certain banking practices and types of
lending, as well as the regulatory response when problems have been identified."
</P>
<P>
	   The top federal banking regulators were testifying today at a Banking
Committee hearing on the recent failures.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach recently said some regulators may not have properly supervised the
Keystone bank, which grew by paying high interest rates to attract capital from
across the country, when it engaged in risky financial strategies.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it appears the FDIC was "stymied at key points" in its desire to
examine the bank's activities, and that the independent FDIC and the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency -- the Treasury Department agency that oversaw
the bank -- "failed to cooperate closely."
</P>
<P>
	   The FDIC's estimated $750 million loss caused by Keystone's collapse could
put it among the 10 most expensive ever in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, Leach has proposed legislation that would give the head of the
FDIC more authority over troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the Treasury agency has disputed Leach's view of events,
while FDIC Chairwoman Donna Tanoue has endorsed his proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've learned some things from these cases," Tanoue told The Associated
Press on Friday. "We want to improve our performance." She said the agency will
commit "whatever resources are necessary" to investigate suspected bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach also said the Banking Committee would "take a hard look" at the
high-interest risky loans, known as subprime loans, which regulators have been
warning banks about in recent months.
</P>
<P>
	   Like fraud, subprime loans also played a role in some of the eight U.S. bank
failures last year.
</P>
<P>
	   BestBank, for example, sold high-interest credit cards as part of a
travel-club membership to consumers with poor credit records. Its failure
drained some $232 million from the insurance fund, which backs each account up
to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been disagreement among banking regulators over the FDIC's
proposed definition of subprime borrowers. Critics of the proposal have
maintained that under the definition -- borrowers who have made two payments 30
or more days late or one payment 60 or more days late -- many community banks
that lend to low- and moderate-income people would be adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal applies to all forms of consumer credit, including home
mortgages, credit cards, auto loans and personal loans.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDIC says it has found about 150 banks and thrifts with significantly
high levels of subprime loans. Together, those institutions hold about 5 percent
of total banking industry assets.

<HEADLINE> Analysts Expect Dip in Oil Prices  </HEADLINE>
    By MARK BABINECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- Even as oil prices flirt with levels last seen at the onset
of the Gulf War, a new study is questioning how long international oil producers
will continue to hold down production.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 14th edition of their joint industry outlook, researchers from Arthur
Andersen and Cambridge Energy Research Associates said Monday that oil prices
currently hovering near $29 a barrel are likely to drop in the coming months as
OPEC gauges what the world can afford.
</P>
<P>
	   "OPEC and key non-OPEC producers are keenly aware of the risks of prices
rising too much as well as the risks of prices tumbling down toward single
digits once again," said the report, titled "World Oil Trends 2000."
</P>
<P>
	   In short, said Cambridge Energy president Joseph Stanislaw, producing
nations want to strike a balance between robust prices and affordable oil that
won't break energy-dependent countries, particularly Far East nations emerging
from economic crises.
</P>
<P>
	   "These prices for one quarter are fine. For two quarters, it's unsure. They
don't want to destroy their markets," Stanislaw said. "The question is, when
does (the high-price environment) impact world economic growth?"
</P>
<P>
	   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries likely will increase
production in the late spring to bring prices back down to a more manageable
level and blunt inflation, which could slow economic growth and stifle demand
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising oil prices have had a limited effect on inflation in the United
States, though certain industries are beginning to feel the pinch. Several
airlines have tacked on $20 fuel surcharges to round-trip air fares, while a
number of cargo companies have also raised rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Few in the industry seem confident that the market will sustain $29 per
barrel, nearly triple the price in December 1998. That outlook explains why
exploration companies have been slow to act, said Victor Burk, Arthur Andersen's
top energy expert.
</P>
<P>
	   "If oil producers believe the high oil prices that have prevailed since the
second half of 1999 are sustainable, that belief could create investment
incentives to increase worldwide oil production capacity even more," Burk said.
</P>
<P>
	   OPEC is scheduled to meet March 27 to make a decision on production levels.
Currently, OPEC is holding back 6 million barrels of potential daily production,
the study said. About 65 million barrels are produced worldwide each day.
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, the World Bank said last week it expected oil to fall from near
$30 to below $20 later this year, a price level that would both be profitable
for producers and a relief for consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, West Texas crude for delivery in March fell 42 cents to $28.50 in
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   OPEC's likely target would be for prices in the low-$20 range, Stanislaw
said, but he cautioned that the market should expect continued volatility.
</P>
<P>
	   World Oil magazine, an industry trade publication, predicted in its annual
forecast last month that prices could stabilize between $25 and $28, which
should entice production investment in late 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   World Oil researchers forecast a worldwide drilling increase of 21.9
percent, to 60,343 wells drilled from about 49,500 in the bust year of 1999.
U.S. activity is expected to see a more robust recovery, rising 30.6 percent to
24,416 wells drilled from 18,700 last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, in addition to restraint over price uncertainty, the merger frenzy by
the major oil companies and the slow recovery of independent companies have
taken the focus off of production, despite high prices, said Bill Gilmer, chief
economist of the Houston Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think anybody is going to bet their company on an oil price
forecast," Gilmer said.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Leak Blinded Missile Defense  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Last month's test of the Pentagon's experimental missile
defense system failed because of a coolant leak that rendered the missile
interceptor essentially blind at the last moment, The Washington Post reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   For all but the last six seconds of the interceptor's approximately
eight-minute flight from a U.S. Army range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific the
indications were that the interceptor would hit its target, Pentagon officials
said last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Nitrogen gas used to refrigerate the interceptor's heat-seeking sensors
leaked from a small metal tube, causing the sensors to fail and preventing the
interceptor from ``seeing'' the target well enough to steer itself into the
dummy warhead's path, the Post said, quoting unnamed defense officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials were quoted as saying that aside from the leak, almost
everything else went right during the Jan. 18 test, including first-time use of
satellites and ground-based tracking radar to guide the interceptor.
</P>
<P>
	   The next test of the anti-missile system has been delayed until the second
half of may because of last month's failed intercept, the officials told the
Post. The Pentagon and defense contractors want to make sure they know what went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   The system is designed to shoot down a small number of ballistic missiles of
the type being developed by North Korea and Iran. The Clinton administration
estimates that building the missile defense system will cost $12.7 billion.

Israelis Target Lebanon With Air Strikes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes launched a guerilla stronghold on
Lebannon power stations early Tuesday, retaliating for Hezbollah attacks that
killed five Israeli soldiers. The strike came after a week of bloody attacks by
the Muslim guerrillas and graphic footage of wounded Israelis on the evening
news in Israel. Islamic Hezbollah guerrillas have been fighting to drive the
Israelis out and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said last July 7 that Israel
would withdraw within a year.

Hackers Attack Yahoo!

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer vandals using a common type of electronic attack
overwhelmed Yahoo!, the most popular site on the Internet, and rendered the

Inc. spokeswoman said the company, worth roughly $93 billion, was the victim of
hackers flooding its equipment with repeated electronic requests. The vandals
did not gain access inside its computers, she said. The technique, called a
denial of service attack, is similar to pranksters repeatedly dialing a

Indiana OK's Ten Commandments Bill

Commandments in their buildings. Under the bill, the commandments could be
posted in schools, courthouses or on other government property if displayed with
other documents of historical significance that have formed and influenced the
U.S. legal system. Supporters say America based its system of laws on the 10
rules the biblical Book of Exodus says God gave to Moses. In 1980, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled that posting the commandments in schools violates First
Amendment protections against a government's promoting religion.

$1.84 Trillion 2001 Budget Unveiled

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton sent Congress his final budget Monday,
a $1.84 trillion plan to expand health care access and shrink the national debt.
He plans to cut taxes for the sick, elderly, poor and college-bound; spend more
for the environment, schools and gun-law enforcement; and erase the $3.7
trillion publicly held portion of the national debt by 2013. The proposal is
sure to be heavily reworked by Congress, where defiant Republicans dismissed it
as a gambit to bolster Vice President Al Gore's presidential bid and the

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Lebanon Air Strikes  </HEADLINE>
   By SAM F. GHATTAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes struck a guerrilla stronghold and
power stations across Lebanon early Tuesday, retaliating for Hezbollah attacks
that killed five Israeli soldiers. Witnesses said 15 people were wounded in the
heaviest airstrikes in months.
</P>
<P>
	   Large areas of Lebanon were plunged into darkness, including the capital of
Beirut, Baalbek and the cities of Sidon and Tyre in the south.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said the air raids began with concentrated attacks on Baalbek,
targeting a power station on the edge of the town and a Hezbollah stronghold.
The town immediately lost electricity. The power station was still burning hours
after the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   The 15 people injured, including four women and four children, lived in
houses near the station, witnesses said. Their injuries were caused by flying
glass and debris. Some houses in the area cracked and shop shutters were blown
off.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All we can remember is that we were hit and now we are here,'' said one of
the injured, 18-year-old Ibrahim Noon, who was hospitalized for cuts on his legs
and arms.
</P>
<P>
	   Damage to the Hezbollah position of Al-Aseera wasn't immediately clear. The
impact blew out windows and doors of apartments in Baalbek as jets roared over
the Shiite Muslim-populated city, chased by anti-aircraft fire. A television
relay station belonging to Hezbollah was also fired on.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli jets also hit power transformers in the mountains east of the
northern port city of Tripoli, knocking out power to some surrounding areas,
according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli jets repeatedly focused on a Beirut power station. Anti-aircraft
fire and tracers lit up the Beirut night sky. Witnesses said a missile hit the
road in front of the facility, creating a huge crater that prevented fire
fighters from reaching the site for 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Beirut was plunged into darkness as Israeli jets roared low over the city
for about half an hour. A huge ball of orange flame and clouds of smoke rose
from the Beirut station. The same station was hit twice before -- once in June,
when Israel previously punished Lebanon by targeting power stations, and once in
1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli army said attacks were in response to ``the severe escalation in
the activities of Hezbollah and other organizations in south Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's raids came hours after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
Security Cabinet ordered a ``harsh military response,'' according to a senior
Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Those who have harmed
us, will be harmed,'' Barak said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanon's Prime Minister Salim Hoss, in a statement issued Tuesday, said
Israel will not succeed in forcing the Lebanese to abandon their demands to
regain territory occupied by the Jewish state in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah has been fighting to drive the Israelis out of a security zone
they established in southern Lebanon in 1985 to protect the country's northern
settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks. Barak said last July 7 that
Israel would withdraw from the area within a year. He had hoped a pullout would
be through an agreement with Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, but
Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The dramatic details of the latest deaths in southern Lebanon and grisly
footage of the fighting raised public pressure on Barak to make good on his
promise to get out. Besides the five soldiers, a senior commander in the
Israel-allied South Lebanon Army died in Hezbollah attacks last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Strikes like the one Israel launched early Tuesday usually invite guerrilla
retaliation in the form of Katyusha rockets aimed at northern border towns. As
soon as the Israeli army ordered people into shelters Monday night, residents
fled the oft-hit town of Kiryat Shmona in convoys.

<HEADLINE> Federal budget contains New York goodies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Education and health care are cornerstones of Hillary
Rodham Clinton's newly official U.S. Senate campaign.
<P>
	   They also received hefty boosts in federal funding in President Clinton's
$1.84 trillion farewell budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's budget would increase spending by millions of dollars for
Head Start, after-school programs and school construction, all initiatives
embraced by the first lady. The president's plan would create more than 7,000
new Head Start slots in New York and would increase education spending by
millions of dollars largely through a class-size reduction initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's plan also contains a $10,000 college tuition tax credit at a
cost of $31 billion. The tuition tax break, popular with middle-class suburban
voters like those the first lady must woo in New York, was first put forward by
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-NY. The first lady has been pushing it lately on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
	   On the health front, the president's plan would spend $168 billion over 10
years to create a prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients.
Prescription coverage is another campaign theme of the first lady, who authored
the president's ill-fated health care reform plan.
</P>
<P>
	   But the president's spending plan isn't all good news for New York.
</P>
<P>
	   While Clinton in 1998 offered the federally owned Governor's Island for sale
to New York state for $1, the asking price was upped to some $30 million in the
fiscal year 2001 plan the Clinton administration unveiled Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   But a letter from White House Budget Director Jack Lew to Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., indicated that the White House was willing to knock
that down to "nominal price" once a plan incorporating public use was finalized.
</P>
<P>
	   New York state and city have agreed on a plan to turn the 172-acre island
into a tourist center complete with a major hotel, a conference and commercial
center, an arts and cultural exhibit hall, a sports complex and open space for
public use. Located in the middle of New York Harbor, Governor's Island has been
occupied only by migratory birds and a small caretakers staff since the U.S.
Coast Guard left in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has ordered the island sold for "fair market value" of $500 million
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, an analysis of the president's budget plan conducted by Schumer
and Rep. Nita Lowey, D-Westchester County, determined that it would bring in
hundreds of millions of dollars more for New York City than the GOP-led Congress
is currently spending.
</P>
<P>
	   "This plan makes it clear that the priorities of New Yorkers are the
priorities of the administration and the Democrats in Congress," Lowey said.
</P>
<P>
	   But some Republicans groused that the president's heavy-spending plan seemed
designed to boost his wife's Senate campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's targeting his tax proposals where he believes they can do her the most
good," said Rep. John Sweeney, R-Saratoga County.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Thomas Reynolds, a Republican from the Buffalo area, agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Clinton family is the most political family in America, so if there is
a way they could benefit from the budget they would," he said. "He's perfecting
his legacy as an indiscriminate big spender with this budget."
</P>
<P>
	   But Moynihan praised the president's discipline in paying down the debt.
</P>
<P>
	   "As I have said on numerous occasions, our first priority should be to pay
down the national debt," New York's senior senator said. "The president proposes
to do just that. Under his budget, the debt held by the public is eliminated by
2013."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the New York projects funded in the president's budget plan:
</P>
<P>
	   -$20 million to convert the James A. Farley Post Office into the new Penn
Station.
</P>
<P>
	   -$10 million for the East Side Access Project to connect the Long Island
Rail Road with the New York City subway's east side trains through Grand Central
Terminal.
</P>
<P>
	   -$10.3 million for Fort Drum Consolidated Soldier Support Center.
</P>
<P>
	   -$13.6 million for United States Military Academy at West Point for Cadet
Physical Development Center.
</P>
<P>
	   -$7 million to combat the Asian long-horned beetle, which has infested
thousands of trees in New York City.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 106, Nuggets 98  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN PETERS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal scored 10 of his 35 points in the final
quarter as the Los Angeles Lakers, down by as many as 17 points in the third
period, rallied to beat the Denver Nuggets 106-98 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   After trailing since the second quarter, Los Angeles tied it at 87 on Rick
Fox's 3-pointer with 6:51 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Kobe Bryant, who had 11 of his 29 points in the final quarter, and O'Neal
then took control down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal also had 13 rebounds and eight assists, and Bryant had nine rebounds
and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Antonio McDyess led Denver, which has lost nine straight on the road, with
24 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Nick Van Exel, who missed Denver's last game because of a groin strain, was
listed as questionable against the Lakers, but he started and scored 18 points
against his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
	   Down 67-52 early in the third quarter, the Lakers narrowed the gap to 67-61
with 8:04 left in the period. The Nuggets then pulled away again to open the
lead to 77-61 before the Lakers chipped it back down to 79-71 at the end of the
third.
</P>
<P>
	   A layup by O'Neal gave the Lakers a 97-96 lead 3:20 left and they stayed in
front the rest of the way. Another 3-pointer by Fox with 1:02 remaining gave Los
Angeles an eight-point pad and completed the scoring.
</P>
<P>
	   Thanks to a 20-6 run to start the second quarter -- keyed by some strong
scoring off the bench -- the Nuggets opened a 62-50 lead by halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Keon Clark and Chris Gatling scored six points each, both while playing less
than 10 minutes, as Denver's reserves outscored the Lakers' subs 22-6, mostly in
the second quarter as the Nuggets built a 45-33 lead in the opening six minutes
of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal had 18 points by halftime, and Bryant 10, while McDyess led Denver
with 16.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles led 27-25 at the end of the first quarter, with Bryant Stith
scoring 10 points to help Denver stay close.

<HEADLINE> Aussie Girl Survives Croc Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARWIN, Australia (AP) -- A young girl escaped from the jaws of an 8-foot
crocodile when her little brother distracted the beast by grabbing its tail,
their father said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Roy Harrington said his daughter Martina, 8, and son Paul, 5, were hunting
for turtles on Saturday in a creek in Australia's Northern Territory, when the
animal seized her and began dragging her into the water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I could see it pulling her down,'' Harrington told reporters. ``Paul
grabbed the tail of the croc and he threw his head up -- that gave Martina a
chance to get her feet out of his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Harrington said he then attacked and killed the crocodile with an ax.
</P>
<P>
	   Martina was treated at a clinic for bite wounds and released, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Saltwater crocodiles live in waterways throughout Australia's tropical
north.
</P>
<P>
	   The reptiles have been protected in Australia since the early 1970s and
their numbers have burgeoned.

<HEADLINE> Doctor who admitted drug use while treating patients testifies 2nd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The lawyer for a prominent fertility doctor on trial for
insurance fraud made sure in his cross examination of a key prosecution witness
that the jury remembers the witness had a serious drug problem.
<P>
	   Repeatedly on Monday, lawyer Theodore Wells pounded Dr. Neil Ratner with
questions about his drug use from 1967 through 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   "Did you know it was wrong to be under the influence of drugs while engaging
in patient care?" Wells asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes," Ratner answered.
</P>
<P>
	   "You knew it was wrong, but you kept it a secret from the medical licensing
board?" the lawyer asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes," the doctor answered.
</P>
<P>
	   Wells is using the drug history to diminish the credibility of Ratner's
testimony against Dr. Niels Lauersen, a 63-year-old Park Avenue obstetrician and
gynecologist accused of cheating insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Lauersen and Dr. Magda Binion, an anesthesiologist, are charged with
conspiracy, health care fraud and mail fraud for allegedly falsely billing
fertility surgeries that were not covered by insurance as gynecological
surgeries that were covered.
</P>
<P>
	   Ratner, 50, is a key witness for prosecutors, who want to prove Lauersen
conspired with those who worked with him to lie to insurance companies and then
cover up the deceit.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Ratner admitted using drugs while practicing medicine, telling
the jury in U.S. District Court, "I was stoned a lot of the time I was giving
anesthesia."
</P>
<P>
	   Ratner testified that he was regularly using drugs when he began working for
Lauersen in 1987. He said Lauersen instructed him to leave out any reference to
fertility procedures when insurance companies were billed.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Ratner told the jury that Lauersen once told him as it became
clear a federal investigation was under way that claiming fertility procedures
were gynecological procedures was a "woman's issue."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is discrimination against women. We're going to go after it that way
and I'm going to get a big woman lawyer," Ratner recalled Lauersen telling him
as he answered a final question from a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
	   As Wells began his cross examination of Ratner, he first asked, "I am not a
big woman lawyer, right?"
</P>
<P>
	   Then he immediately attacked Ratner's credibility, asking, "Are you on drugs
today?"
</P>
<P>
	   For the next several hours, Wells questioned Ratner about his drug use,
eliciting from the witness that he managed to hide his use of cocaine, marijuana
and other drugs from his medical colleagues for a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Wells asked him if he had deluded himself into thinking it was all right to
take drugs and treat people, too. Ratner said he had.
</P>
<P>
	   "You had years and years of success at fooling people, right?" Wells asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes," Ratner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ratner pleaded guilty in May 1998 to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and
health care fraud and to making a false statement regarding health care matters.
He has not been sentenced.

<HEADLINE> 'Filthy Five' go against tenacious 97  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Lawmakers are resurrecting a bill that would
force the state's five dirtiest power plants to limit their emissions.
<P>
	   "This legislation is to close, or to clean up ... the polluting profit
monsters that are existing within this state and are adding to the problems of
respiratory conditions and also to the health of our environment," said Rep.
Chris Caruso, D-Bridgeport, the proposal's chief sponsor.
</P>
<P>
	   Ninety-seven state lawmakers said Monday they support legislation that would
require the so-called "Filthy Five" to meet stricter pollution standards.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would require fossil fuel power plants in Bridgeport, New Haven,
Middletown, Norwalk and Montville to cut their production levels of nitrogen and
sulfur oxides by 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   After a similar bill passed last June on a 68-67 vote in the House, the
Legislature's Energy and Technology Committee never took it up again,
effectively killing it.
</P>
<P>
	   "Trying to deal with pollution at these plants is definitely on my agenda
and it's a priority," said Rep. Demetrios Giannaros, D-Farmington. Giannaros is
the energy committee's co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   "My plan is to push a bill through committee this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of last year's bill said the cleanup would have cut childhood
asthma and other breathing problems in the communities where the power plants
are. They also said the bill would mean cleaner air in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every day you delay, people are getting sicker from excessive power plant
pollution, and there is no excuse for it," Brooke Suter, a director of Clean
Water Action told lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the measure said last year it had the potential to derail the
electric deregulation law that required the power plants to be auctioned by the
end of the year. They said passing the legislation would hurt the value of the
plants.
</P>
<P>
	   NRG Energy Inc. of Minneapolis paid Northeast Utilities $460 million for the
Connecticut Light &AMP; Power plants in Montville, Norwalk and Middletown. The sale
also included a CL&AMP;P plant in Milford.
</P>
<P>
	   United Illuminating, which owned the New Haven and Bridgeport plants, sold
its plants to Wisvest Corp. of Milwaukee for $272 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Both companies said Monday they are willing to work with lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   But David Damer, an environmental affairs manager for Wisvest, said the
power plants have been improved to reduce emissions. He said any more upgrades
may be a waste of money.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our facilities are quite clean. Our emissions have gone down considerably
over the years," he said. "These controls would result in no measurable change
in air quality."
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Damer said it may be impossible for the plants to be upgraded the way
Connecticut lawmakers want.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's like taking a car that may be five years old, and - because the
technology has changed - now having it meet the standards that a new car today
would have to meet," he said.

<HEADLINE> DEP considers asking towns, cities to pay for larvae killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Towns could be asked to pay for the spraying of
mosquitoes that may carry the deadly West Nile-like encephalitis into
Connecticut.
<P>
	   Last fall, seven people died of West Nile encephalitis in New York and at
least 59 others, who experienced high fevers and brain swelling, were stricken
with the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no human cases of West Nile virus in Connecticut. But the disease
was linked to the die-off of hundreds of birds, primarily crows.
</P>
<P>
	   The DEP is considering asking towns and cities where birds died last year to
pay for larviciding, a preemptive attack that would kill 90 percent of mosquito
larvae before they hatch.
</P>
<P>
	   "Towns have always had the responsibility of maintaining their catch basins
and culverts," DEP spokeswoman Michele Sullivan said. "There are a variety of
options on the table that we are looking at, and that is one of them."
</P>
<P>
	   DEP Commissioner Arthur Rocque Jr. said his agency would prefer to assist
local governments with technical expertise and guidance on larvicides.
</P>
<P>
	   A DEP draft report estimates that it would cost about $20,000 per town to
apply a season's worth of larvicide.
</P>
<P>
	   Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Gov. John G. Rowland, said Monday that funding
for a mosquito war is not the kind of spending that the governor would pluck
from the state surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the kind of thing that would have to go on every year and you can't
really rely on the surplus to do so," Pagani said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some communities already plan to act.
</P>
<P>
	   "We certainly aren't going to wait for the state (DEP) to do anything," said
Beverly Aveni, executive aide to Stamford Mayor Dannel P. Malloy. "We have 7,000
catch basins in the city and we have a request for proposals out now for
larvicide."
</P>
<P>
	   Other communities are still looking for state assistance, but some say they
will have their own program is the state cooperation falls through.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to fight for it," Fairfield Health Director Art Leffert said,
"but if we lose, we will come up with a back-up plan."
</P>
<P>
	   In Stratford, a town that has had a mosquito larvicide program in place for
about five years, officials expect to treat more potential mosquito breeding
areas, with or without financial assistance from the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "A larva program to control mosquitoes before they can become a public
health threat is something every community should have," Stratford Health
Director Elaine O'Keefe said.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Keefe said she doubts that most communities could afford to launch a
larvicide program without some state assistance. Nevertheless, she said, she
would not expect the state to pick up the full tab.
</P>
<P>
	   A preliminary proposal under consideration last month had called for the
state to allocate $2 million for a comprehensive strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   Included in last month's plan was a mosquito surveillance and the
application of larvicide in 20 towns along a 62-mile stretch from Greenwich to
Madison.
</P>
<P>
	   The DEP has not proposed any specific plan to the General Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Media seeks access to arraignment of Kennedy nephew in 1975 murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Judge Maureen Dennis hears juvenile cases in a
small courtroom in a strip mall. Normally, the public is not allowed to witness
the proceedings.
<P>
	   But the case before her today is far from normal.
</P>
<P>
	   The "juvenile" is a 39-year-old nephew of the late U.S. Sen. Robert Kennedy.
He was to be arraigned in 1975 murder of childhood friend Martha Moxley.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Michael Skakel was just 15 at the time of the killing, his case must
be handled in juvenile court, at least initially.
</P>
<P>
	   Five newspapers have asked the judge to open the arraignment to the public,
something prosecutors and defense lawyers say they cannot remember happening
before in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the newspapers argued that Skakel has already effectively waived
his juvenile confidentiality rights, both because he is an adult and because his
name and the charges against him are already well-known across the country -
made public by his own attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel's lawyer went even further Monday, filing an affidavit signed by
Skakel in which Skakel says he does not object to holding the hearings in
public.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Michael Sherman said Skakel wants the proceeding open so that the
public can hear his side of the story.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right now, what's being printed is gross speculation, double hearsay and
assorted garbage," Sherman said. "Once the public sees what the evidence is and
what it is not, they will truly appreciate his innocence."
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Jonathan Benedict has taken no position on whether the hearing
should be open or closed.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Kravitz, a lawyer representing the newspapers, said the normal
protections given to juveniles do not apply in the Skakel case.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only reasons to close juvenile proceedings at all are because you are
worried about a child of tender years and the trauma that that child may undergo
if exposed to public access to the proceedings," he said. "But here, we're not
dealing with a child, and in fact we're dealing with an individual who has
already agreed that the media can attend."
</P>
<P>
	   The newspapers seeking the open hearing are The New York Times, The Hartford
Courant, Newsday, The Advocate of Stamford and the Greenwich Time.
</P>
<P>
	   Jude Dennis was expected to rule this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   If the judge rejects the request to open the hearing, the media lawyers were
expected to ask that the arraignment be delayed, so they could file an immediate
appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Hillary Bargar, a juvenile prosecutor in Bridgeport, said the law appears to
give the judge some discretion.
</P>
<P>
	   "Usually, the confidentiality issue is left to the defense attorney, which
he has already waived," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lorraine Murphy, trial court administrator for the Stamford-Norwalk judicial
district, said she did not know of any similar case in Connecticut. She said
other states with similar laws have opened juvenile proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel was charged with murder last month, more than 24 years after
Greenwich teen-ager Martha Moxley was found bludgeoned to death with a golf
club. She had been beaten to death with a 6-iron that was later matched to a set
owned by the Skakel family.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel's father, Rushton Skakel, is the brother of Kennedy's widow, Ethel.

<HEADLINE> Campus scene: blood in the snow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   VALHALLA, N.Y. (AP) - There was blood in the snow. There was crime-scene
tape around the blood. And there were dozens of students around the crime-scene
tape, some muttering nervously about the first dead body they'd seen outside a
funeral home.
<P>
	   In what a campus official said was the first shooting in the history of
Westchester Community College, a man accosted his former girlfriend, shot her in
the head as she tried to get away, then shot and killed himself as he ran away.
</P>
<P>
	   "His hand went up, then his head went back. He was still running, then he
fell," said Rayvon Miller of Greenburgh, a student who witnessed the suicide.
</P>
<P>
	   The wounded woman, Joy Thomas of Mount Vernon, was in critical condition at
the Westchester Medical Center. Detective William Rehm of the Westchester County
police said the gunshot wound to her temple was a glancing one and did not
appear to be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
	   Rehm said the woman was in a first-floor hallway of the Academic Arts
building at about 12:15 p.m. when a Yonkers man in his 20s, not a student,
confronted her.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was an ongoing prior relationship," Rehm said. "We have reason to
believe that that relationship may have been terminated by one party or the
other."
</P>
<P>
	   They argued and she tried to leave, Rehm said, but he followed and "she
obviously felt threatened. ... She went for the first open door she came to."
</P>
<P>
	   Just as she was going through the door, the man grabbed her from behind and
fired one shot from a handgun. She fell into the room, where a staff member and
a student had been meeting, and they shut the door behind her.
</P>
<P>
	   "Closing the door was good thinking on their part," the detective said. "It
ended the assault and forced the perpetrator to leave."
</P>
<P>
	   The attacker ran off across the snow-covered campus and was near the
school's Classroom Building when he shot himself. Blood marked the snow where he
fell, the gun still in his hand.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a numbing sensation to see someone lying there," said Don Gregory, a
journalism teacher. "You feel despair at not knowing what to do."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not really what you expect when you go to school," said Louis Ramirez,
a student from the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes were uninterrupted for the 20,500 students, but campus exits were
sealed for half an hour until police concluded that the dead man was the only
attacker.
</P>
<P>
	   The school offered a telephone hot line for worried parents and counseling
for any students troubled by the shootings.
</P>
<P>
	   Julius Ford, vice president of student services, said the building where the
first shooting occurred is patrolled by one unarmed guard. The school will
eventually review security, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Economy Is Stronger  </HEADLINE>
   By KEN GUGGENHEIM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- In a Mexican election year, the biggest question may not
be who wins. It's whether the transition will be accompanied -- yet again -- by
a devastating economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Economic problems have accompanied each of the last four presidential
transitions. The worst was in 1994, when the peso and stock market collapsed,
inflation and interest rates soared and Mexico fell into a recession.
Unemployment surged, debtors couldn't pay off loans and the banking system fell
apart. Many Mexicans still haven't recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   That crisis was felt way beyond Mexico. It affected U.S. pension plans and
mutual funds that had invested in Mexico, rocked economies throughout Latin
America and prompted a $50 billion U.S.-led international bailout.
</P>
<P>
	   In speech after speech, President Ernesto Zedillo has expressed confidence
there won't be a crisis this year, when his successor will be elected to a
six-year term. Many economists say he's right: the economy is in much better
shape than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet economic logic doesn't always overcome conventional wisdom. That wisdom
says that when there's a presidential election, there's a crisis. And fear of a
crisis could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unlike legal systems around the world in which you're innocent until
proven guilty, it would seem now the economy is guilty in the eyes of some
people,'' said Marco Provencio, spokesman for the Treasury department. ``Now it
has to be shown that there's not going to be an end-of-term crisis.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many Mexicans are proving to be tough judges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's almost a fact that (a crisis) is going to occur,'' said Ernesto
Fierro, a salesman. ``The government always says the same thing, and it's the
opposite that happens.''
</P>
<P>
	   Why crises have accompanied presidential transitions is debatable. Some have
been blamed on manipulations aimed at helping the candidate of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. Others have had more to do with
general economic bungling or difficult international conditions, such as a drop
in the price of oil, Mexico's main export.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1994 crisis was like the bursting of a bubble. Investor enthusiasm for
Mexico ran high when the country formed a trade bloc with the United States and
Canada on Jan. 1, 1994. Investors began to pull out following a guerrilla
uprising in Chiapas state and two major political assassinations. The government
spent its foreign reserves in a vain attempt to maintain the value of the peso
and nearly defaulted on billions of dollars in short-term debt pegged to the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   The government points out that the economy has changed. The peso floats
more-or-less freely. Once-secret economic statistics are now regularly released.
The government no longer issues bonds tied to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   Inflation has been falling, savings are up and the economy has been growing
slowly but steadily -- surviving international financial crises and falling oil
prices in 1998. Foreign reserves are at $30 billion and the government is
unlikely to drain them to protect the peso.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps the most important indicator is the current account deficit, a
measure of trade that includes merchandise, services and investments. It was 7
percent of the country's gross domestic product in 1994; it is now 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has also secured $23.7 billion in international credit lines
and refinancing to help it cope with any emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   If Zedillo needs incentive to avoid a crisis, he need only look at his
predecessor. Carlos Salinas went from international glory to national disgrace
when the crisis broke out weeks after his term ended. To this day, street
vendors mock him by selling Salinas masks.
</P>
<P>
	   Zedillo seems determined to avoid such a legacy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Zedillo has shown such an obsession in that he would prefer a PRI loss to
another'' end-of-term crisis, economist Jonathan Heath wrote in his book
``Mexico and the Sexenio Curse.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many economists laud the way Zedillo, a Yale-educated economist, has handled
the economy. A central bank survey in December of 27 private economic analysis
groups found that 89 percent believe there will be favorable economic conditions
in the first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet only 48 percent said it's a good time to invest, with the remaining 52
percent saying they weren't sure.
</P>
<P>
	   Why the hesitation? Because it's an election year and investors are wary.
</P>
<P>
	   The economy has its weaknesses. Poverty remains high, credit is in short
supply and the banking system still hasn't recovered from the last crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Some economists also believe the peso is overvalued, at least partly because
of the central bank's anti-inflation, tight-money policies. The peso
strengthened against the dollar in 1999 even though its purchasing power fell
because of 12.3 percent inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   And any turmoil could scare off investors nervous about a possible crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   That could be political violence, like the assassinations in 1994. Or a
major drop in oil prices. Or it could be rising U.S. interest rates, which could
lure investors away from Mexico. Or it could be a downturn in the economy of
Mexico's biggest trading partner, the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is nothing in financial logic or economic logic that tells us
there's going to be an end-of-term crisis. But I believe that anyone who
ventures to say there won't be an end-of-term crisis -- that remains to be seen.
Because I've heard that before,'' said Roberto Salinas Leon, director of
economic strategy for TV Azteca.

cognitive problems, according a new study that tracked 150 premature babies into
their teens.
</P>
<P>
	   Premature babies are known to run a higher risk of problems such as cerebral
palsy, mental retardation and vision and hearing trouble. The latest findings
bolster previous research linking prematurity to more subtle and long-term
cognitive difficulties.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no question that these children are at high risk," said Dr. Saroj
Saigal, a professor of pediatrics at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario,
who led the study. "We are raising the awareness that these children are likely
to have problems."
</P>
<P>
	   Saigal followed 150 premature babies, born in Ontario between 1977 and 1982.
Her study, published in the February issue of the journal Pediatrics, found that
academic difficulties that existed at age 8 continued into the teen-age years.
</P>
<P>
	   Those studied weighed between about 1 pound, 2 ounces and 2 pounds, 4 ounces
at birth and were born about two to three months early -- "the sickest of the
sickest babies that we see," Saigal said.
</P>
<P>
	   Their average age was 14 during the most recent follow-up.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly half were receiving special educational assistance, compared with
just 10 percent of a control group of children who were not born prematurely but
were similar in gender, age and social class. Twenty-five percent had repeated a
grade, compared with just 6 percent of the control group.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers and experts not involved in the study said the findings
should make parents, doctors and educators aware of the risks such children face
and the need for them to get help early.
</P>
<P>
	   Prematurity is on the rise, partly because of increases in multiple births
and in older women having babies. Medical advances have also helped an
increasing number of even the tiniest babies to survive.
</P>
<P>
	   The study found that fewer than half of the smallest premature children --
those born weighing 1 pound, 9 ounces and under -- scored in the normal range on
most intelligence and achievement tests.
</P>
<P>
	   And while 42 of the teens had nervous-system or sensory disorders such as
cerebral palsy, blindness and deafness, even those who didn't have such
disorders scored significantly lower on achievement tests than the control
group.
</P>
<P>
	   The study is one of the first to follow premature babies into their teens.
Saigal said it is not clear whether these youngsters go on to have difficulties
in adulthood; more research on that is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   About 11 percent of the nation's 4 million births are premature, which means
they occur before the 37th week of pregnancy. That is up from 9 percent a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 1.4 percent of all births, about 56,000 annually, are
considered very low birth weight, or less than about 3 pounds, up from 1.2
percent in 1987.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Maureen Hack, a Cleveland neonatologist who has studied developmental
problems in premature babies, said the learning difficulties may be caused by
bleeding in the brain, lack of oxygen to the brain and other problems linked to
prematurity.
</P>
<P>
	   "These things don't go away," Hack said.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Jet Forced To Land  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Sparks were seen flying from an engine on an Alaska
Airlines jetliner, moments after taking off from San Francisco International
Airport, according to airline and airport officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilot declared an emergency in order to get first priority to land, said
Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack Evans. The flight originated in Puerto Vallarta,
Mexico, and was on-route to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire trucks met the airplane after it landed safely about 7:45 p.m. PST
Monday, said airport duty manager Chris Ludwell. No injuries were reported among
the plane's 83 passengers and five crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a totally safe landing,'' said Ludwell.
</P>
<P>
	   The sparks, which were seen by airline personnel on about three other
aircraft and by San Francisco air-traffic controllers, did not cause any
apparent problems within the aircraft, said Ludwell and Evans.
</P>
<P>
	   The circumstances of Monday's problems bore a resemblance to a disastrous
Alaska Airlines flight a week ago, which killed all 88 people aboard in a crash
off the California coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Both planes had problems while on planned flight paths from Puerto Vallarta
to Seattle, via San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   Both planes were part of the MD-80 series aircraft. The fatal flight was an
MD-83; the flight Monday was an MD-80. Both were made by McDonnell Douglas, now
owned by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators suspect a problem with the horizontal stabilizer -- a part at
the rear of the plane -- caused the fatal crash. It was unclear what caused
Monday's problems in the left engine of the plane, located in the tail area.
Evans speculated that something, such as a bird, may have been sucked into the
engine.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots had no indication on their gauges that there was anything wrong with
the engine, said Evans.
</P>
<P>
	   Passengers on Monday's flight 289 were put on another plane to Seattle. The
plane stayed in San Francisco, where engineers examined it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The pilot would not have declared an emergency if not for air traffic
control issues in San Francisco,'' said Evans. He said the MD-80-series aircraft
and Alaska Airlines are safe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the thing that people need to keep in mind is that this aircraft
is one of the safest aircraft ever built in the history of aviation,'' Evans
said.

<HEADLINE> New Wheat Variety Introduced  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN MacDONALD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- North Dakota State University researchers are releasing
their first wheat variety bred specifically for scab resistance, calling it
better than virtually all other varieties available.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard red spring wheat, called Alsen, is the result of a decade-long
research project that crossbred three other wheat varieties after getting
breeding material from China. NDSU wheat breeder Richard Frohberg said it is
only the first in what researchers hope will be more resistant varieties in the
future.
</P>
<P>
	   Field trials show Alsen, while not immune to wheat scab, can fight off the
disease, Frohberg said. The characteristics of Alsen restricted the disease from
spreading in the wheat spike, even if a kernel becomes infected.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's good, but it's not perfect," Frohberg said Monday. "We believe that
with time, it will be possible to breed cultivars that are even better."
</P>
<P>
	   The NDSU Agricultural Experiment Station is releasing the wheat variety this
week for what is known as "seed increase." County crop improvement associations
will select farmers who will grow the crop specifically to make more seed
available.
</P>
<P>
	   Frohberg said Alsen will not be available for crop production until at least
the 2001 planting season.
</P>
<P>
	   Scab, the common name for Fusarium head blight, is a fungal disease that has
caused an estimated $2.6 billion in lost crops between 1991 and 1997. Scab
shrivels kernels of wheat and barley and produces toxins that can make the grain
unsuitable for food and animal feed.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers say Alsen proved to have better yields than other varieties
when grown in environments where scab is most prevalent. However, it does not
have better yields than other varieties of wheat when grown in areas where scab
is not a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers believe they will eventually come up with an even more
scab-resistant, higher-yielding alternative. But Frohberg said it is necessary
to make Alsen available to farmers as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think it's fair to growers to say, 'Please wait until we come up
with the perfect variety,"' Frohberg said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- Poultry farmers in Arkansas will receive $666,667 to
help move and bury millions of chickens killed when heavy snow collapsed the
roofs of their barns.
</P>
<P>
	   The money is the first governmental aid to farmers after a rare Southern
storm dumped more than a foot of snow on parts of southern and western Arkansas
on Jan. 27-28.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials estimate more than 10 million birds were killed. But because
their homes also were destroyed, poultry production could drop by 30 million --
less than 1 percent of the nation's annual production, industry representatives
have said.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we really are concerned about is not dead chickens and broken eggs,"
Gov. Mike Huckabee said Monday while announcing the money. "We're concerned
about families whose livelihoods have been, in many cases, forever interrupted,
and in some cases perhaps completely eroded."
</P>
<P>
	   The bulk of the money -- $500,000 -- comes from the Agriculture Department's
National Resources Conservation Service. The state is contributing another
$166,667 to meet a required 3-to-1 matching ratio.

<HEADLINE> Mexico University Tries Recovering  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Cleaning up the garbage and graffiti left behind by a 9
1/2-month student sit-in at Latin America's largest university might be the easy
part.
</P>
<P>
	   The more daunting task will be calming passions at the 270,000-student
National Autonomous University.
</P>
<P>
	   Interior Secretary Diodoro Carrasco, who oversees the police who carried out
Sunday's raid on the campus, conceded Monday that the crisis was not over.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the recovery of the installations is a fundamental step, but it
seems to me that it has to be followed by an enormous effort of reconciliation
in the university community,'' he said in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
	   University spokesman Roberto Vivanco said Monday that classes could resume
after officials clean up the campus. He gave no date.
</P>
<P>
	   It isn't clear how many students will show up. Some said they would boycott
classes until the more than 700 strike supporters arrested Sunday were freed.
And many other students had already abandoned the university for jobs or other
schools.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot return to class and leave our comrades inside,'' said Lorena
Estejel, 17, a high-school student who wants to study dentistry.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike was led by radicals who saw it as a struggle against global
free-market economics. It began as a protest against tuition increases but
continued long after officials rescinded them.
</P>
<P>
	   The long standoff at the university, known as UNAM, has shaken the
traditions of Mexico's system of higher education.
</P>
<P>
	   With almost no tuition, UNAM's classrooms mingle the children of Mexico's
elite with promising teen-agers from the slums. Most of the country's academic
scientific research is done there and UNAM's schools of law and economics have
produced four of the past five presidents.
</P>
<P>
	   President Ernesto Zedillo studied elsewhere, but the candidate favored to
succeed him this year, Francisco Labastida, is a UNAM graduate. Most key figures
in Zedillo's administration also attended UNAM. Even the leader of the leftist
Zapatista rebels studied at UNAM.
</P>
<P>
	   Campus politics can have long-term effects on national politics. And many
UNAM students and faculty who were opposed to the strike were also outraged by
the use of force to end it, viewing the move as a blow to the university's
cherished autonomy.
</P>
<P>
	   Memory of a 1968 government massacre of students was one reason why the
government avoided intervening for so long -- and why the eventual use of police
was so traumatic to many.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoping to heal those wounds, Rector Juan Ramon de la Fuente urged officials
to drop most charges against those arrested and to be lenient with those who are
convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   UNAM's size overshadows any in the United States. The University of
Texas-Austin, one of the biggest American universities, has just over 49,000
students.
</P>
<P>
	   But the strike prompted many students to take jobs or shift to other
universities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wanted to study at UNAM, but now, knowing how little prestige a degree
is going to have, I am going to have to go somewhere else,'' said Victor Manuel
Cabrera, an 18-year-old UNAM high school student waiting Monday outside the
federal attorney general's office for word of his sister, who was one of the
strikers arrested by police.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution uses neighbors to emphasize pause  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A police recruit who lived down the block from
Amadou Diallo claims the volley of gunfire that killed the West African
immigrant was broken by a pause lasting up to five seconds.
<P>
	   Testifying Monday at the trial of four police officers, the recruit, Thomas
Bell, became the third former neighbor of Diallo to describe hearing a brief
interruption in the shooting. The officers are accused of murdering Diallo last
year by firing 41 bullets into the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building at
12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The pause is significant because prosecutors could use it to argue that the
officers had a chance to realize Diallo was unarmed and stop firing. The
prosecution was expected to conclude its case today with testimony from the
medical examiner who performed the autopsy on the 22-year-old street vendor.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell, 28, told jurors that on the morning of the shooting he was on the
telephone with a cousin when gunfire erupted up the block from his apartment.
The witness said he heard four to five shots, followed by a three-to-five-second
pause, then a longer, final volley from several guns - a sequence he tapped out
on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys attacked Bell's credibility, suggesting he lived too far
away from the scene to be reliable. But the witness stuck to his story.
</P>
<P>
	   "A pause is a pause, sir," he told an attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28, Sean Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy,
27, have pleaded innocent to the second-degree murder charges. If convicted,
they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying of the unarmed black man by the four white officers produced a
wave of pretrial publicity and protests alleging widespread abuse of minorities
by police. In response, an appeals court moved the case to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege the plainclothes officers made a "conscious decision" to
shoot Diallo without warning; 19 bullets struck the victim. Defense attorneys
argue the shooting was a tragic mistake made after the victim ignored orders to
stop and pulled out a black wallet that appeared to be a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Monday, another Diallo neighbor, Ida Vincent, claimed that, moments
after the shooting, she overheard a man make a suspicious remark outside her
window.
</P>
<P>
	   "OK. OK. We're just going to say this," Vincent quoted the man as saying in
testimony the defense had sought to keep out.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Vincent took the stand, State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi
barred prosecutors from asking about the fragment of conversation because
Vincent didn't know who said it. Defense attorney John Patten had complained
that the young housewife's account would leave the false impression that police
"were somehow concocting a story."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, when Vincent began to testify about it, the defense objected. But the
judge overruled, saying the defense itself had "opened the door" by
cross-examining Vincent about another part of the same conversation - someone
cursing.
</P>
<P>
	   Vincent also testified that she had heard a pause in the gunfire.

<HEADLINE> Police: Gifted artist, musician and wrestler also a murderer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - There are two vastly different pictures of Thomas G.
Nelford, the young man police say murdered his girlfriend before killing himself
by jumping in front of a subway train.
<P>
	   His friends from his hometown of Oxnard, Calif., described the 23-year-old
as a wrestling star, a gifted musician and an artist. People who knew him at
Columbia University portrayed him as a Jekyll and Hyde person - he wouldn't let
women walk home alone because he feared for their safety, but he used drugs
frequently and was known as Weird Tom.
</P>
<P>
	   No one on Monday seemed to know why Nelford turned to drugs and dropped out
of the university in 1998. He still kept in touch with fraternity brothers and
his 19-year-old girlfriend, Kathleen Roskot, a Columbia lacrosse star from
Bayshore, Long Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Police are investigating whether Nelford's motive may have been anger
because Roskot wanted to break up with him.
</P>
<P>
	   Roskot's throat was slashed, and she was found naked Saturday afternoon on
the floor of her bedroom, a literary journal with a picture of the beatnik
author Jack Kerouac covering her face.
</P>
<P>
	   The placement of the journal may not have been a coincidence. Stark
similarities existed in Nelford's life and that of Kerouac, author of the 1950s
classic "On the Road."
</P>
<P>
	   Kerouac, who coined the term "Beat Generation" for himself and his starving
fellow writers Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs, was a high school football
star and won a scholarship to Columbia. But things at the Ivy League school
began to go wrong after Kerouac got into a fight with his coach, who refused to
let him play, according to biographies of the writer.
</P>
<P>
	   At about the same time, Kerouac's father lost his business and began
drinking heavily. A disillusioned Kerouac dropped out of Columbia. He began
hanging around New York with a crowd his parents disapproved of: Ginsberg and
company.
</P>
<P>
	   There are other similarities, as well. Kerouac, who died in 1969, also spent
time in California, where he turned to Buddhism and drank himself into oblivion.
According to one biography, "he was cracking up," an experience he recounted in
his last successful novel, "Big Sur."
</P>
<P>
	   And there's more: Kerouac's parents lived on Long Island as did Roskot's,
and through his first 40 years, he had failed to sustain a long-term romantic
relationship, although he often fell in love.
</P>
<P>
	   Friends in Oxnard and at Columbia said they were stunned by the news of
Nelford's actions.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Columbia student Betty Lai said Nelford would often walk her and
other women home at night so they would be safe.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was the sweetest boy," Lai told the New York Post. "But I guess he was
also a murderer."
</P>
<P>
	   "I trusted him around my family, my children," Todd Stoke, Nelford's
wrestling coach at Rio Mesa High School, said in several newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman who answered the Nelfords' telephone Monday said the family did not
wish to comment. The New York Times quoted Nelford's mother, Carolyn Nelford, as
saying reports her son was a drug user were "very cruel."
</P>
<P>
	   But several students at the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house, where Nelford
once lived, said his drug use was frequent. Fraternity president Rich Luthmann
said Nelford often did drugs out in the open, prompting the other members to
throw him out.
</P>
<P>
	   Other students said Nelford acted strangely and knew local homeless people
by name.
</P>
<P>
	   "We called him Weird Tom," said Corey Barnes, who lives next door to the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity house. "He seemed like a weird, crazy guy."
</P>
<P>
	   Hours after he allegedly killed Roskot, Nelford committed suicide by jumping
in front of a No. 1 train on West 181st Street. Investigators said he was
carrying Roskot's wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The medical examiner confirmed Monday that Roskot's death was a homicide and
Nelford's a suicide. Nelford's violent end was very much in contrast with the
young man people knew in Oxnard.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was the kind of guy you thought would do something good for himself,"
Andrew Ferrari, 23, told the Daily News of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Ferrari was on the wrestling team with Nelford for three years.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a good friend, a great wrestler and had a real promising outlook,"
Ferrari said. "Ever since I've known him, he's been a real nice guy. I never
expected anything like this."
</P>
<P>
	   At the end of last summer, Nelford was back in Oxnard, living in a van as he
wrote songs and dreamed of a music career, Luciano Basua Jr., 26, told the Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
	   "He told me he was writing a lot of songs and that a record producer had
taken an interest in his music," Basua said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nelford was also a gifted artist and had drawn a mural for the high school.
But he was best known for his wrestling prowess. In a 1994 article, the Los
Angeles Times described him as "arguably the best wrestler in Ventura County."
And Nelford was named athlete of the year in 1995 by his school. That year, he
came in fourth in the 152-pound category in the state wrestling tournament.
</P>
<P>
	   It's those memories that Stoke, Nelford's wrestling coach, still holds dear.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not trying to say Tommy's an angel who dropped directly from heaven,
but this was a good, very popular, well-liked young man who, around here, people
thought the world of," Stoke said. "I love Tommy."

<HEADLINE> $1.84 Trillion Budget Unveiled  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was so proud of what his final budget
would do about eliminating the publicly held part of the national debt that he
used a paint brush to draw a plunging blue line on a wall chart.
</P>
<P>
	   Angry Republicans, however, probably would have chosen the color red for
Clinton's last budget -- for the shame they charge he should feel about all his
new spending programs, his tax increases and his modest tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president proposed a laundry list of expensive, big-government
programs the country doesn't need and tax increases the Republicans in Congress
will never support,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides in the debate wasted no time in staking out their positions for a
debate that is certain to last all the way into November, when voters go to the
polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans contend that what voters want is less government and bigger tax
increases. Clinton argues that what the country needs to keep the current
prosperity going is a more balanced approach that addresses pressing needs such
as a lack of health care, pays down the federal debt and offers targeted tax
relief.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration will feel the Republican criticism firsthand
today as members of the president's Cabinet appear before various congressional
committees to defend the administration's spending and tax proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   In releasing the budget on Monday, Clinton said it was important that the
nation seize the current good times and bulging government surpluses to ``make
the most of this moment of promise to extend prosperity to all corners of our
nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's $1.84 trillion spending plan for the 2001 budget year, beginning
in October, would spend more for the environment, schools and gun-law
enforcement while still pledging to take steps to erase the $3.7 trillion
publicly held portion of the national debt by 2013.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also proposed a major expansion in the Earned Income Tax Credit that
helps the working poor, called for the government to provide health insurance
for 5 million of the 44 million Americans who do not have it and help the
elderly pay for drug prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans charged all the new spending programs were an effort to appeal
to voters in hopes they will reward Democratic candidates in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has all the things for everyone they feel they'll need to get Al Gore
elected president,'' House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kasich and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., told
reporters that their committees would move quickly to draw up a GOP spending and
tax blueprint that would differ drastically from Clinton's version.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before that work is accomplished, House Republicans were moving to
consider this week a 10-year, $182 billion plan to cut taxes for married
couples, including those who pay more than if they were single. This is just one
piece of their much larger $792 billion tax cut that Clinton vetoed last year.
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast, Clinton's budget would provide $351 million in more targeted
tax relief to help pay the costs of college education, ease the burden of
long-term nursing care and support retirement savings.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton also would raise $181 billion in other taxes, including a
25-cent-a-pack increase in cigarette taxes and $91 billion in higher taxes on
corporations by eliminating current tax benefits.

<P>
	   House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, signaled the GOP would
``strongly oppose'' all of Clinton's tax increase proposals again this year.
</P>
<P>
	   But even with the tough-sounding words, both sides may find ways to
compromise, if for no other reason so they can avoid a drawn-out budget fight
right before the fall elections.
</P>
<P>

administration on a reduction in the marriage tax penalty and possibly on a
program to offer the elderly help in paying for prescription drugs.

	   Both sides already have pledged to use two-thirds of the projected
surpluses, the amount generated by Social Security, to pay down the $5.7
trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   It is over the other one-third of the surplus, which Clinton says will
amount to $746 billion but the GOP believes is much larger, that the hardest
battles will be waged.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Senate Finance Committee William Roth, R-Del., sounded an optimistic
note, saying, ``I hope we can build on common ground and not miss the
opportunities before us.''

<HEADLINE> Genetic Discrimination Ban Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to fears that advances in medical research
could be abused by employers and others, President Clinton is barring federal
agencies from discriminating against workers on the basis of genetic tests.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's decision, which congressional aides said he would implement in an
executive order today, echoes a bill sponsored by Sens. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. The bill, which is pending in Congress, would
prohibit employers from refusing to hire people at risk for health problems and
insurers from refusing to sell them coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Monday
that Clinton would announce his decision during a speech at the American
Association for the Advancement of Science. White House aides declined comment.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the order, Clinton was expected to voice his support for the
Daschle-Kennedy legislation, which would extend assurances against abuse of
genetic information to the general public -- a step that would require
congressional action.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the bill said they hoped Clinton's action on behalf of federal
workers would focus attention on the need to take similar steps to protect
private sector employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Advances in genetic testing soon will allow doctors to predict the medical
futures of their patients. That has raised concerns that such information could
be used against those who are likely to suffer from cancer, diabetes, heart
disease or other ailments.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has been speaking out on the issue for years. In his 1998 State of
the Union speech, he declared that ``we must see that science serves humanity,
not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any
American,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ranit Schmelzer, Daschle's spokeswoman, said the Senate minority leader long
has argued that ``as more information about people's future health becomes
available it becomes important to protect that information.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``People shouldn't be discriminated against in employment or in other areas
because of some genetic information that may be available on them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The order Clinton was signing would restrict federal agencies' abilities to
collect or use genetic information, the sources said, including family medical
histories. The order was limited to civilian employees of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Exceptions to such data collection would be allowed in cases in which
workers give written consent as part of a health care program monitoring their
medical conditions. Another exception would be granted for gathering information
to study workplace safety.

<HEADLINE> Overheated Motors May Impact MD-80s  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW FORDAHL AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Worried about the problem suspected in the crash of
Alaska Airlines Flight 261, pilots may be inadvertently overheating the motors
on airplane stabilizers by repeatedly testing them before takeoff.
</P>
<P>
	   In the week since the Jan. 31 crash that killed 88 people, three MD-80
series jetliners have returned to their gates because of stabilizer problems.
Two can probably be traced to the pilots' testing and retesting the equipment,
airline officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It may be that some pilots are being overly cautious and are running
through their checks several more times than they typically do with their
stabilizer,'' said Jack Evans, an Alaska Airlines spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, both citing
sources they didn't identify, reported in Tuesday's editions that radar data
show a piece of Flight 261 may have broken off seconds before the plane plunged
into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Sources told the Post that preliminary analysis shows the object, without
the markings of an aircraft, appears to move with the prevailing winds as it
falls, indicating that it could be part of an aerodynamic surface, such as a
wing or tail.
</P>
<P>
	   But it is too early to say what exactly the image depicts or whether it
could have been part of the stabilizer, the section of the plane the crew
indicated was malfunctioning, the papers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The crew of Flight 261, en route from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San
Francisco and then Seattle, struggled with a stabilizer problem for at least 30
minutes before the plane corkscrewed into the Pacific. The MD-83 was trying to
make an emergency landing in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The horizontal stabilizer is a moveable, 40-foot wing mounted high on the
aircraft's tail. National Transportation Safety Board investigators have not
determined the cause of the crash but are focusing on the device.
</P>
<P>
	   The horizontal stabilizer controls the up-and-down motion of the plane
during flight. It is controlled by two motors that turn a jackscrew, similar to
the mechanism that controls garage door openers.
</P>
<P>
	   During a flight, the motors force more than 100 adjustments, slightly
changing the pitch as the airliner uses fuel and as other conditions change.
</P>
<P>
	   On the ground, the motors can last up to 90 seconds before overheating and
shutting down. It is usually not a problem in flight because of the cold
temperatures in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
	   After shutting down, the motors should become operative again after cooling
down for several minutes, said John Thom, spokesman for Boeing, which bought
McDonnell Douglas, maker of the MD-80 series planes, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are getting the word out there (to pilots) to make sure you give enough
time for these motors to cool down if you do go through the check again,'' Evans
said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, an Alaska Airlines MD-83 jet returned to the airport in Reno,
Nev., minutes after taking off for Seattle. The NTSB is investigating, but the
airline said it was probably caused by an overheated stabilizer motor.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, an Alaska MD-80 taxiing toward the runway in Seattle
experienced ``intermittent problems'' with the stabilizer motor. After returning
to the gate, the parts were swapped out and the plane took off without further
incident.
</P>
<P>
	   An American Airlines MD-83 flight out of Phoenix returned to the gate last
week with a stabilizer problem, but investigators said it may have been caused
by a faulty control switch in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's usually an increase in reports of concerns by pilots about similar
conditions after an accident,'' said Mitch Barker, an FAA spokesman in Seattle.
``It just raises the visibility and everyone's sensitivity to the possibility.''
</P>
<P>
	   Added Steve Roach, a pilot union official who flew MD-80s for three years:
``You don't change your procedures, but guys tend to focus a little bit more on
the systems involved. (Pilots) spend more time looking at those things, paying
attention to them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pete Harkovitch, who was a passenger on the jet that had to return to Reno,
said he will avoid MD-80 series planes until investigators figure out what
happened to Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was terrified,'' said the 42-year-old Fairbanks, Alaska, resident, who
flies two to three times a month. ``It was too close to the other accident that
killed so many innocent people. If MD-80s look like they're trouble-free, then
I'll go back on them, but if I had to fly tomorrow, I'd take something else.''

<HEADLINE> Officers go on trial for conspiracy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad believes that as
the New York Police Department launched an intensive internal investigation of
the brutal assault of Abner Louima, three officers were conspiring to fabricate
a story to absolve one of them.
<P>
	   During Monday's trial of former Officers Charles Schwarz, 35, Thomas Wiese,
37, and Thomas Bruder, 34, Vinegrad said the trio had told "lie after lie after
lie" to protect Schwarz from criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
	   "This case is about a search for the truth as to what Charles Schwarz did
and the efforts of these three defendants to keep the truth from coming out,"
Vinegrad told the jury in Brooklyn federal court, where Louima took to the stand
to again recount the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Vinegrad promised to prove Schwarz held the Haitian immigrant down as
another officer, Justin Volpe, rammed a piece of broomstick into Louima's
rectum, causing internal injuries, during a 1997 assault at a police precinct.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyers contend that Schwarz was not involved. They say the only
other person present, besides Volpe, was Wiese, Schwarz's partner, who entered a
station house bathroom as the assault was taking place but did not participate
or interfere.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz's attorney, Ronald Fischetti, said he would subpoena Volpe from
prison to testify that Schwarz was not involved in the attack and Schwarz
himself would deny it under oath.
</P>
<P>
	   "Chuck Schwarz will take that witness stand and tell you what happened - and
that he was falsely accused, wrongly convicted and imprisoned for a crime he did
not commit," Fischetti said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, Wiese and Bruder are charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice by
covering up Schwarz's role in the attack. The charge carries a penalty of up to
five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   During a trial last year, Volpe pleaded guilty and Schwarz was convicted of
violating Louima's civil rights. They face 30 years and possible life in prison,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   Under questioning by Vinegrad, Louima said two officers were in the bathroom
and he "heard the door open and close but did not see anyone" as he lay crouched
on the floor.
</P>
<P>
	   That suggestion - that a third person had entered the room during the
incident - was not mentioned in the earlier trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Louima has never identified the second officer in the attack, other than to
say it was the same one who drove him to the station, took away his property and
escorted him to the bathroom. It is undisputed that Schwarz was the driver, but
even Louima has said that the two officers - Schwarz and Wiese - look very much
alike.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph Tacopina, the attorney for Wiese, said his client was the first to
break the blue wall of silence - the mutual protection shield of police officers
- by going to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischetti suggested that the situation was more than a case of mistaken
identity and that Louima "knew very well who my client was" because it was
Schwarz who had booked him at the desk, taken his property and stood beside him
before Volpe took him away.

Clinton Unveils $1.84 Trillion Budget
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was so proud of what his final budget
would do about eliminating the publicly held part of the national debt that he
used a paint brush to draw a plunging blue line on a wall chart. Angry
Republicans, however, probably would have chosen the color red for Clinton's
last budget -- for the shame they charge he should feel about all his new
spending programs, his tax increases and his modest tax reductions. Both sides
in the debate wasted no time in staking out their positions for a debate that is
certain to last all the way into November, when voters go to the polls.

Paper: Leak Blinded Missile Defense System
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Last month's test of the Pentagon's experimental missile
defense system failed because of a coolant leak that rendered the missile
interceptor essentially blind at the last moment, The Washington Post reported
Tuesday. Nitrogen gas used to refrigerate the interceptor's heat-seeking sensors
leaked from a small metal tube, causing the sensors to fail and preventing the
interceptor from "seeing" the target well enough to steer itself into the dummy
warhead's path, the Post said, quoting unnamed defense officials.

the Muslim guerrillas and graphic footage of wounded Israelis on the evening

Inc. spokeswoman said the company, worth roughly $93 billion, was the victim of

Commandments in their buildings. Under the bill, the commandments could be
posted in schools, courthouses or on other government property if displayed with
other documents of historical significance that have formed and influenced the
U.S. legal system. Supporters say America based its system of laws on the 10
rules the biblical Book of Exodus says God gave to Moses. In 1980, the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Budget a Policy Manifesto  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- All presidential budgets are wish lists. President
Clinton's final budget is more: Not only does it amount to an election-year
manifesto but it seeks to project a policy legacy far beyond the expiration of
his term.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans mocked the $1.8 trillion budget submission, as opposition
parties always do. But in the coming months, the document will help frame the
nation's political debate, both in Congress and in the presidential and
congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Disparaged as a ``spending smorgasbord'' by House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Texas, the document proposes scores of spending increases in popular
programs along with $351 billion in selected tax cuts. It seeks to shore up
Medicare and Social Security and projects the elimination of the $3.7 trillion
national public debt in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
	   It is a culmination -- and extension -- of the Clinton agenda that has been
evolving over the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
	   Not since Ronald Reagan promised to cut taxes, increase defense spending and
balance the budget at the same time have such ambitious -- and seemingly
contradictory -- budget goals been set.
</P>
<P>
	   Of course, Reagan and the Democratic Congresses of the early 1980s couldn't
make the math work, and huge deficits resulted. Clinton has the luxury of
surpluses as far as the eye can see.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our success in reversing what once seemed to be uncontrollable growth in
the federal budget deficit has created more than prosperity,'' Clinton boasted
in submitting his fiscal 2001 budget on Monday. ``We have restored to America a
spirit of purpose and confidence.''
</P>
<P>
	   Following hard on his initiative-crammed State of the Union address,
Clinton's budget gives Vice President Al Gore and congressional Democratic
candidates a generous supply of campaign ammunition.
</P>
<P>
	   At least a dozen Gore campaign proposals were incorporated in the budget
document.
</P>
<P>
	   But it also enables both Democrats and Republicans to better define their
debate over tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How can we address the issue of tax fairness when his budget does not
substantially ease the marriage tax penalty?'' asked House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., for instance.
</P>
<P>
	   While Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota applauded
Clinton's budget finale as one of ``honest numbers'' and ``fiscal discipline,''
Republicans had a field day with its many spending proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, called it a ``fantasy
budget.'' Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., saw it as ``a
document to help Al Gore win election.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not really intended to be passed,'' said Domenici.
</P>
<P>
	   Well, presidential budgets seldom are.
</P>
<P>
	   Budgets are not legislation, only spending blueprints. Lawmakers consider
them, then craft and approve their own versions.
</P>
<P>
	   But the resulting congressional budget resolutions don't even go to the
White House for the president's signature. Actual decisions on spending and
taxes are made through separate appropriations and revenue bills.
</P>
<P>
	   Furthermore, while Congress appropriates money one year at a time,
presidential budgets make sweeping projections extending far into the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's 2001 budget envisions extending the solvency of Social Security
out to 2050 and of Medicare to 2013. And 10-year projections are routine.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition parties have been declaring presidential budgets ``dead on
arrival'' for years. But that oversimplifies budget dynamics, suggests Tom Mann,
a political science scholar at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
	   While all presidents make proposals that don't get enacted, ``seldom is a
president's budget simply discarded. It's an important part of the process,''
Mann said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes, Clinton's budget is a political document. But it's not irrelevant. It
seems to me that Clinton has been basically redefining his agenda for the last
several years, so the Republicans have to adapt to that,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mindful of being outmaneuvered in the past by Clinton, Republicans were
trying not to have it happen again.
</P>
<P>
	   And some took the political overtones, and the not-very-subtle attempt to
help Gore, in stride. ``It's all part of the system,'' Sen. Craig Thomas,
R-Wyo., suggested in a Senate speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans stressed that they have the same general objectives as Clinton
-- protecting the Social Security surplus, paying down the national debt and tax
relief and fairness -- and differed largely in specifics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope the president will work with Congress to achieve these commonsense
goals,'' Hastert said.

<HEADLINE> U.N.: Iraq Oil Production Will Drop  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraq's oil production will drop unless the Security
Council allows key spare parts to be sold to Baghdad so that it can upgrade its
oil sector, a senior U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Benon Sevan, head of the U.N. oil-for-food program, told the council Monday
that a drop in oil exports could affect humanitarian aid for Iraqis struggling
to cope with economic sanctions imposed after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the council had not responded to repeated appeals from U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to remove ``holds'' on applications to send
humanitarian supplies and oil sector equipment to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Iraq's oil industry continues to be in a lamentable state,'' Sevan said.
``We would appeal to all members of the council to reflect on the argument that
unless key items of oil industry equipment are made available and commissioned
within a short time, the production of oil is likely to drop. This is a very
clear warning.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vast majority of holds have been placed by the United States, which
remains concerned that dual-use items could be directed to weapons production.
Washington has also put holds on contracts from firms it views as
``questionable.''
</P>
<P>
	   The oil-for-food program, started in 1996, allows Iraq to sell oil under
U.N. financial controls, with proceeds funding U.N. humanitarian programs and
Persian Gulf War reparations as well as paying for oil spare parts.
</P>
<P>
	   Since May 1998, the council has authorized Iraq to buy $1.2 billion worth of
spare parts for the oil sector but only $250 million of oil sector equipment has
arrived -- partly because of delays in ordering and deliveries.
</P>
<P>
	   But $288 million worth of spares remains on hold, Sevan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has come under pressure from Russia and France, nations
that are eager to expand trade relations with Baghdad, to lift the holds.
</P>
<P>
	   Sevan reiterated Annan's recommendation that the Security Council authorize
an additional $300 million worth of spare parts, using revenue from the last
phase of the oil-for-food program, which has not been allocated.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. official said Washington is likely to increase the allocation for
spare parts after the council receives Sevan's report on the humanitarian
program and a survey of Iraq's oil sector due on March 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Diplomats said Washington was less flexible Monday when Russia raised the
possibility of using oil-for-food revenue to pay $11 million that Iraq owes the
United Nations and $23 million it owes the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.

<HEADLINE> Barbara Bush Back on Campaign Trail  </HEADLINE>
   By BRUCE SMITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Former first lady Barbara Bush has been down this
campaign road four times before for her husband, former President Bush. Now
she's at it again, for her son, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner for
the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a little surprised to find myself back on the campaign trail,'' said
Bush. Echoing her husband's famous ``no-new-taxes'' pledge, she added: ``I am
the woman who in 1992 said, 'Read my lips. No more campaigns.'''
</P>
<P>
	   But campaign she does. She was spending Monday and today in the state, with
appearances in Columbia, Woodruff, Anderson and Rock Hill. She travels to
Virginia on Wednesday, stopping at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville, and at events in Vienna and Glen Allen.
</P>
<P>
	   With her unflappable manner and self-effacing humor, she draws crowds in for
what seems to be more of an evening in the Bush family parlor than a campaign
appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is fun to get back out here and talk about somebody I really feel so
very strongly about,'' she said. ``This is the son who says to me things like,
when I pick up my fork, 'Go on Mom, eat it today and wear it tomorrow.'''
</P>
<P>
	   A recent trip to South Carolina in advance of its Feb. 19 Republican primary
was a bit of a homecoming. Her high school alma mater was Ashley Hall, a
prestigious girls school in Charleston.
</P>
<P>
	   During a stop at the College of Charleston, she was introduced as
``America's all-time favorite first lady'' by former Gov. James B. Edwards, who
served with her husband in Reagan's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush refuses to discuss policy -- she says her son is good at expressing his
own ideas -- but notes his record on welfare reform and education in Texas,
working with a Democratic-dominated Legislature, as evidence of his leadership.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do see him on television saying, 'You know everybody says I look like my
father.' But he said 'The truth is, I have my father's eyes and my mother's
mouth.' What do you think he means by that?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
	   There is also a serious side.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As president, he will restore dignity to the White House and will serve
with honor,'' Bush said. ``He will help restore Washington to a climate of
mutual respect.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a nation where mom, apple pie and the flag are cherished, a candidate's
mother can only help, said Blease Graham, a political scientist at the
University of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the touch and feel part of familiarity with a candidate,'' he said.
``It gives every mother and every father who hears her speak some insight into
her son, the candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   And, he said, it's tough for opponents to go negative on somebody's mom.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the college audience, questions were more about Bush and her family
than her son's qualifications to be president.
</P>
<P>
	   She ducked a question on advice she would give her daughter-in-law Laura --
``she really doesn't need it.'' She also spoke of her work on literacy
interspersed with gentle humor about her husband.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'll tell you what George did on his 75th birthday -- he jumped out of a
perfectly good airplane,'' she said, recalling her husband's much-publicized
parachute jump.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, she shared the podium at Ashley Hall with a student who wore a long
blue dress, white wig and white sweater for the part of Bush in a school play
about famous women.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush told the students her favorite subject was math -- ``my banker doesn't
know it, but I have that kind of mind.'' And she said she reread Jane Austin's
novels last summer ``because I didn't want to read about politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   The mom factor may just persuade some to vote for the Texas governor, said
Katherine Lang, a 15-year-old Ashley Hall student.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I actually think it would influence them a lot, especially because I agree
with my mom's opinions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   And images of mother and family should help throughout South Carolina,
Graham said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To the extent South Carolina may be more of a traditionalist state than
others, she may have a little extra appeal here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another Bush on the campaign doesn't hurt, said Mary DeMerrell Brady, who
graduated from Ashley Hall in 1943 with Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What helps the most is a familiar name,'' she said. ``You like to see a
name you know. The name tells you a lot.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Breaking Records  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE IVEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- For Deb Moriarty, the choice this winter has been coldly
stark: Fall behind in rent payments or freeze.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I started getting behind in November. In December I was still behind until
I received the fuel benefit,'' said the Scarborough, Maine, office assistant.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, with oil prices breaking record highs and all but $100 of her $459 fuel
assistance gone, Moriarty has even more cause for concern as fuel prices soar.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the Northeast oil costs continue to rise, driven by greater demand
following the arrival of wintry blasts of cold air and sustained production cuts
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The cost increase is most acute in the Northeast. The regional average rose
to about $2.10 per gallon in mid-January from about $1 a year ago, according to
the New Hampshire governor's planning office.
</P>
<P>
	   Moriarty has tried to cut back on her heating fuel use by covering windows
with plastic, dropping the thermostat to 62 degrees and putting on a sweater --
and a jacket.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the oil runs out I'm going to be in the same boat of making that
choice again,'' she said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of low-income people who have found their heating bills twice as
big as last winter have applied for government assistance, and even those who
can pay them report they are struggling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sooner or later I'll cut something out -- I don't know what my priorities
are yet, but you need heat,'' said 79-year-old William Gracia of Providence,
R.I.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to consumers grumbles, New England politicians have called on
Washington for relief. Last week, President Clinton approved $45 million in
federal emergency assistance to help out the frigid Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration now is trying to decide whether to dip into the
nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve for only the second time to drive down
prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Next week, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was scheduled to hold hearings
on the issue in Boston. The hearings also will explore whether price-gouging has
occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, fuel consumers have been hit with a double-whammy: the cost of
oil is $2.50 a gallon, and there's a short supply. Several heating companies on
Long Island and in Westchester County were completely without oil for parts of
last week, and industry officials say they are scrambling to keep up with high
demand.
</P>
<P>
	   The average price of heating oil in Maine rose to $1.78 a gallon, an
increase of 12 cents from last week and $1.04 higher than the statewide average
at this time last year, the State Planning Office said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Massachusetts, oil prices hit a record high of $2.04 a gallon on Monday
-- more than double the 90 cent price at the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This summer, we're changing to gas,'' said Lisa Raines. She said her
heating bill doubled this year at her three-family home in Boston's Dorchester
neighborhood. ``Enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
	   And business people across the region also were grappling with how to avoid
going into the red.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In my mind, I can't raise my prices 50 percent to cover what I'm trying to
grow now,'' said Bob Chafe, owner of Salisbury Gardens in Salisbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   His three greenhouses, where this spring's flowers are budding, burn through
about 225 gallons a day. Heating them at $1.70 a gallon is costing him $2,677 a
week, compared to $1,071 last year when he paid 68 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   He hopes to recoup his losses by growing more flowers than he normally
would.
</P>
<P>
	   The high price of diesel fuel also is forcing some truckers and transport
companies to pass the costs on to consumers or even keep their rigs off the
road.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anybody who's operating with the prices this high is out of his mind,''
said Mike McClellan, a 31-year-old independent trucker. ``I don't like parking
my truck, but that's an extra $440 or $450 a week that comes out of my pocket.''
</P>
<P>
	   McClellan said high fuel costs may force him to sell his truck and switch
jobs. With the national average at $1.45 a gallon, larger transport companies
are taking drastic steps too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're refusing to take freight into some of those high-priced areas,''
said Roy Romans, chairman of an Omaha, Neb., company. ``Where we can't get fuel
surcharges that will cover the cost, we just turn down the business.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Targets Accounting Gimmicks  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's new budget proposes undoing some
accounting gimmicks enacted last fall. In effect, though, he would use them for
a second time in just a few months and ease spending next year by $10 billion
without really saving a nickel.
</P>
<P>
	   As last autumn's negotiations on the fiscal 2000 budget wound down, White
House and congressional bargainers needed to save several billion dollars. So
they shook hands on some budget contrivances to make the numbers fit.
</P>
<P>
	   For one, they agreed to delay a payday for military and some civilian
federal workers from late September of this year into early October. Since
fiscal 2001 begins on Oct. 1, that had the effect of pushing $4.3 billion in
spending into fiscal 2001 -- freeing up money for fiscal 2000, the year they
were working on at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget Clinton sent Congress on Monday is for fiscal 2001. Needing some
savings for that year, he proposed flipping the payday back into late September
-- which is fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   If that happens, the money would come out of the fiscal 2000 budget. Since
that year's budget is now written, that's no longer a problem.
</P>
<P>
	   The process creates $4.3 billion of room for fiscal 2001, which is now the
focus of the budget-writers, even though the government would spend the exact
same amount of money. Only the timing of the expenditure is different.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans agreed to the time shift last fall, and could submit to them
again if additional savings are needed by the time Congress completes work on
the fiscal 2001 budget this fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's budget provides a table describing the shifts, saying they would
``restore traditional ... timing'' of the payments.
</P>
<P>
	   The same thing happened with payments due on some federal contracts. About
$1.8 billion of these payments, originally due this September, were pushed into
October by last fall's budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's budget would reverse the process, pushing the payments back into
2000 and freeing up $1.8 billion more for fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton didn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1997 budget-balancing agreement between Clinton and Congress pushed
payment of $4 billion worth of veterans' and supplemental security income
benefits from next September into October.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's budget would shove them back into September again.
</P>
<P>
	   Total budget ``savings'' for fiscal 2001: $10 billion, all of it shifted
back into 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Clinton proposed pushing some Medicare payments the 1997 act
pushed from September 2002 into October 2002 back into September -- ``saving''
$4.5 billion for fiscal 2003, which begins Oct. 1, 2002.

<HEADLINE> Former CNN Exec Takes PBS Helm  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Expect no changes in PBS's educational mission and
noncommercial stance under new president Pat Mitchell. She says that's a
strength the Public Broadcasting Service must build upon.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are offering a unique service in this broadcasting world," said
Mitchell, a former talk show host and Turner Broadcasting executive introduced
Monday as PBS's fifth president.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell, 57, takes over for Ervin Duggan, who left last fall after saying
he had fulfilled his objectives.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell said PBS's mission represents an advantage it should publicize at a
time when viewers are concerned about whether huge media companies will mean
fewer independent voices on television.
</P>
<P>
	   "PBS is a brand that we know the public trusts," she said, adding that she
didn't mean that as a dig against Turner, which is owned by Time Warner,
recently bought by America Online.
</P>
<P>
	   PBS's board unanimously chose Mitchell at a meeting in Key West, Fla., over
the weekend. She was selected for her ability to help the system plan for its
future and to find consensus among the 346 public TV stations that make up the
service, board chairman Colin Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell also said he hoped to use Mitchell's expertise to help PBS stations
increase their international and local news coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell worked in local TV news before becoming a correspondent for NBC's
"Today" show in 1979. She left to develop and be host of the Emmy-winning
syndicated talk show "Woman to Woman," and later worked for ABC and CBS.
</P>
<P>
	   She joined Turner in 1992, heading a division that produced nonfiction
programming for CNN, TBS and TNT, including CNN's epic "Cold War" documentary
series.
</P>
<P>
	   In that position, she heard from some nonfiction producers that a cumbersome
PBS bureaucracy sometimes made it difficult to get the go-ahead for programs.
She hopes to streamline the process.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the programming genres PBS once had to itself -- nature
documentaries, historical documentaries, educational children's shows -- are now
widely available on cable. Mitchell said PBS's programming is different.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not making programming to appease the greatest number of eyeballs for
advertisers," she said. "We're making programming to serve the public."
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell pledged adherence to PBS's non-commercial mandate. Some critics
have questioned PBS's commitment, since it will often run messages crediting
underwriters for its programming. But Mitchell said that's a lot different than
interrupting a show several times for commercials, and that PBS needs the
funding for its shows.
</P>
<P>
	   One of her first tasks will be finding a new chief programming executive for
PBS. Kathy Quattrone, who last held that job, left in May for Discovery
Communications.

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Spokesman Leaving Post  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- James P. Rubin, chief spokesman for and trusted adviser
to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, will leave in April, move to London
and help his wife, CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour, take care of their
first child.
</P>
<P>
	   After seven years as Albright's spokesman, first at the United Nations,
where she was U.S. ambassador, and then at the State Department, Rubin said
Monday he needs time to decompress before deciding what to do next.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At this stage in life, I am doing three stressful things -- going to a new
country where I only partly speak the language, leaving my career and having a
baby,'' Rubin told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
	   The baby is due in March.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright suggested impending fatherhood was Rubin's main motivation in
leaving the limelight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've just become a grandmother, and I can tell you it's a lot easier to be
a grandmother than to become a father,'' she said. ``He has to get ready for
those duties.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright added: ``Obviously, Mr. Rubin has been very important in everything
that we've done.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said she would ``mourn'' his departure.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Albright said career foreign service officer Richard Boucher
would succeed Rubin.
</P>
<P>
	   Sometimes spokesman for James A. Baker III, Lawrence Eagleburger and Warren
Christopher when they were secretaries of state, Boucher has served as U.S.
ambassador to Cyprus and consul general in Hong Kong. Currently, he is
coordinator for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum.
</P>
<P>
	   Operating with authority uncommon for a spokesman, Rubin provided advice to
Albright on a range of foreign policy issues, particularly arms control and the
Balkans. He and Albright played leading roles in influencing Clinton to
intercede in Kosovo to stop atrocities.
</P>
<P>
	   Their hawkish stances, shared by Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., for whom Rubin
had worked, led to NATO's bombardment of Yugoslavia to end Serb-led
incarceration and murder of ethnic Albanians in that Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Rubin lately has championed a U.S. space-based weapons
program, which many arms-control analysts with whom he worked almost two decades
ago fear could touch off a buildup in offensive nuclear arms to try to overcome
the anti-missile defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is due to make a decision by summer on a limited, ground-based
missile defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin also is an ardent champion of the administration's policy of prodding
Israel to relinquish land to the Arabs in exchange for pledges of peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin, 39, said he had ``a great run in government'' and that it would be
very hard to find another job like it.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, he said, ``I don't know what I am going to do next, except that I
am going to help Christiane take care of our baby in London.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Health Investments  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans say there is hope for enactment
of major health care legislation this year, including new prescription drug
benefits for senior citizens, if Democrats are flexible on proposals President
Clinton has put forward in his new budget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If President Clinton and House Democrats put aside election-year politics,
there is significant hope for a compromise on a number of issues,'' said House
Republican Conference Chairman J.C. Watts of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
	   In his 2001 budget, released Monday, Clinton proposed the biggest increase
in government spending on health care since the 1960s. He asked Congress for
$195 billion over the next decade for new Medicare prescription benefits, and
for younger Americans without health insurance, he wants another $110 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The president was in part responsible for the death of some similar health
care proposals last year, when he vetoed a broad Republican tax-cut package.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton cited rising government surplus projections in boosting by $77
billion the administration's previous request for cash to improve prescription
coverage for the elderly, even though Republicans rejected the previous, more
modest version as too expensive.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the new money, $35 billion would go to create a reserve account for sick
retirees whose very high drug bills would barely be dented by the limited
Medicare coverage the administration previously proposed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some seniors have absolutely enormous bills that they have no way of
paying,'' Clinton said. He offered no details about how the catastrophic
coverage would work, saying he would try to work it out with Congress'
collaboration.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Republicans would prefer to target help to low-income senior citizens
through tax credits or state block grants or to increase opportunities for
Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in HMOs that cover drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's plan would create an optional Medicare drug benefit in 2002,
covering half of retirees' prescription costs up to a $1,000 cap. Those
participating would pay a $26-a-month premium.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, for younger Americans, Clinton wants to make health insurance
more accessible through new spending on existing state and federal programs, as
well as tax credits to defray the cost of private coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Together, his initiatives for the young and old would require the biggest
government commitment to health-care spending since Medicare -- now a
$220-billion-a-year program -- was created in 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Republicans and some moderate Democrats support a $70 billion
plan for a standard health insurance tax credit for individuals and families not
covered by employers or public assistance programs -- about 27 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Clinton's proposals is $76 billion over 10 years to extend coverage to
4 million parents of children eligible for state-run Medicaid and Child Health
Insurance Programs, known as CHIPs. He is also asking for an additional $13.6
billion to get more children enrolled in CHIPs.
</P>
<P>
	   He would give tax credits to Americans who want to buy insurance from a
previous employer under existing COBRA laws and those caring for an elderly or
disabled relative at home.
</P>
<P>
	   And for the third year running, Clinton will ask Congress to let people aged
55 to 64 who lack health insurance buy into Medicare, now limited to those 65
and older.

<HEADLINE> Small Town Clashes Over Development  </HEADLINE>
   By AMY WESTFELDT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROOSEVELT, N.J. (AP) -- The first big quarrel in this small borough was over
whether it should even exist. That issue was won by no less than Albert
Einstein.
</P>
<P>
	   The scientist came down from his Princeton home in 1936 to debate a union
leader about whether President Franklin D. Roosevelt's proposal to create a
self-sustaining, utopian farming community was a good one.
</P>
<P>
	   He won the debate, and so was born Jersey Homesteads, named later after the
president who founded it.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 60 years later, Roosevelt's 900 or so residents have morphed from
Jewish farmers into an eclectic group of artists, intellectuals and
environmentalists who still pride themselves on being fighters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're very active and very vocal about our feelings,'' says Mayor Michael
Hamilton. ``Most of the time we're able to still wave at each other on the
streets and say hello to each other in the post office.''
</P>
<P>
	   That might explain why the battle raging in Roosevelt these days has been
more intense than most. A developer wants to build hundreds of new retirement
community homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have been called in to break up Council meetings. A mayor who
supported development was voted out of office. And after losing preliminary
approval to build 65 homes, one developer said he would never return, calling
his dealings with the town ``a very, very, brutal, frustrating and bitter
experience.''
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of new housing say it will help ease a tax burden in this borough
of flat-roofed homes shielded from strip malls by cornfields. The town has no
major businesses and one of the state's highest property tax rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Roosevelt also has virtually no crime, a town center with nothing but a post
office, a deli and an elementary school of about 80 students. Opponents of
development say the housing will double the town's population and destroy the
community atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
	   Roosevelt has places on the National and New Jersey Register of Historic
Places for its Bauhaus-style homes, its wetlands and history as one of about 100
communities in the nation created as planned farming communities during the New
Deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The government built Jersey Homesteads specifically for Jewish garment
workers more than 50 miles away in New York City. The workers were paid $500
each to move there and run both a farm and a clothing factory.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor leaders opposed it because it was nonunion, but Einstein and others
called it a social utopia that gave city workers a chance for suburban life.
</P>
<P>
	   The utopia failed around World War II, however, because the garment workers
had little farming skill. The government sold the homes to the workers and to a
group of liberal artists and intellectuals who found the town's history
intriguing.
</P>
<P>
	   The town managed the next half-century to remain relatively untouched by the
suburban growth surrounding it. About 15 new homes were built on the dozen
streets that make up the town, students learned in classes of 10 and residents
walked a few blocks to hike in the woods.
</P>
<P>
	   Town officials, however, wrote ordinances in the past few years that made
available large parcels for land for residential development. A former mayor,
Bert Ellentuck, said taxes from new homes would help shore up a 60-year-old
infrastructure that includes a failing sewer plant and roads in need of repair.
</P>
<P>
	   The zoning ordinances brought Matzel &AMP; Mumford of Hazlet in 1998 to the town
with a proposal for 65 homes in a cornfield surrounded by woods, a few homes and
the town cemetery.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents objected to the number of houses and said the developers' plan
wouldn't protect an environment of sweetgum and beech trees, rare ferns and the
endangered wood turtle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They thought they could put one over on a little town,'' said Rod Tulloss,
a biologist who is leading an effort to seek state and private grants to buy up
acres of undeveloped land in town.
</P>
<P>
	   Tulloss and others said the developers monopolized hearings with their own
witnesses and tried to push through a project that would force the town to
provide more services.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They missed a tremendous opportunity to solve some fiscal problems for the
town,'' said Roy DeBoer, the company's project manager. He said in 20 years, he
had never had a worse experience with a project. Witnesses were cross-examined
for days on ``garbage minutia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Planning Board rejected Matzel &AMP; Mumford's preliminary application
because the hearings hadn't allowed time for opposing witnesses, but welcomed
the company to apply again. DeBoer said it wouldn't return.
</P>
<P>
	   Another developer, U.S. Home in Freehold, is in discussions to build 350
homes on a wheatfield off the town's main road. Town officials recently asked
for a proposal with slightly fewer homes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're really like a family,'' Hamilton said. If developers like U.S. Home
are allowed to come in, ``just for the sake of lowering taxes, we'll develop
every parcel in town that's open space.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll double the size of the town overnight.''

<HEADLINE> Deutch Security Clearances Eyed  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former CIA director John Deutch, already cut off from the
spy agency's secrets, is waiting to learn whether he also will lose security
clearances that now allow him to work in the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen acknowledged Monday that Deutch, still has
some Pentagon security clearances, despite losing clearances from the CIA last
summer for downloading classified documents into his home computer
</P>
<P>
	   After weekend news reports about Deutch's continued access to classified
defense information, the Pentagon's inspector general asked the CIA for its
evidence on Deutch's security breaches, Cohen told reporters. ``I think it
should have been done sooner, but it was not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before becoming CIA director, Deutch served as deputy secretary of defense
from 1994 to 1995. He now acts as a consultant for several organizations with
defense contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said Deutch's broad Pentagon security clearances were revoked when the
CIA acted, but he retains access to ``some top-secret information in terms of a
narrow area of technology.'' Limited industrial clearances normally are given to
defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
	   The secretary said taking those away would require a legal determination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There must be a compelling level of evidence that would support removing
him from income-producing activities,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Department lawyers will have to decide whether the evidence against
him is ``sufficient that we can, with due-process, terminate the relationship,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said he has no evidence Deutch had compromised any Pentagon
intelligence or operations in his activities.
</P>
<P>
	   The industrial clearance allows Deutch, a professor at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, to serve as a paid consultant on defense contracts with
the MIT, SAIC Corp. and Raytheon Corp., Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Porter Goss, R-Fla.,
expressed surprise Monday that Deutch had kept his Pentagon security clearances
even after having his CIA ones revoked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that the removal of access to sensitive material should apply
universally,'' Goss said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   A former CIA intelligence officer himself, Goss said Deutch's ``admission
that he used bad judgment'' should result in a penalty that would apply equally
to the Pentagon.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Report Stresses NATO Success  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Pentagon report on the NATO air war over Kosovo
concludes it was an ``overwhelming success,'' without allied combat casualties,
but also pointed out some military shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
	   Allied forces demonstrated ``unrivaled military prowess'' in the 78-day war
that ended last June, with Serb forces being driven out of the Serb province,
the review sent to Congress this week said.
</P>
<P>
	   It added, however, that lessons of the conflict may require some changes in
doctrine, training, organization and technology, including improvements in U.S.
precision warfare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We forced Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, degraded
his ability to wage military operations and rescued over 1 million refugees,''
Defense Secretary William Cohen said in the report's introduction.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the NATO campaign ensured the stability of Eastern Europe, thwarted
ethnic cleansing and ensured NATO's credibility.
</P>
<P>
	   The report calls for a strengthening of European military capabilities. It
does not, however, cover operations of the NATO force still in Kosovo or the
fact that Yugoslav President Milosevic remains in power under Western economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   The largely self-congratulatory review, which accompanied the Defense
Department's 2001 fiscal budget proposals, outlines enhancements already planned
for precision strike, electronic warfare, intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance capabilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The harshest self-criticism is reserved for one of the biggest U.S. errors:
the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, which killed three Chinese and
soured relations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a result of a failure in the process of identifying and validating
proposed targets,'' the report said, adding that methods used were ``severely
flawed.'' The report said immediate corrective actions were taken, however.
</P>
<P>
	   The report covers relations with Russia and considerations of a ground
option but offers no new details on the depth of concern over Russia's
opposition to the campaign, or the debates within NATO over whether to use
ground forces.
</P>
<P>
	   It notes that the operation was conducted without a single combat fatality
among the 19 nations allied against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
	   However, it added, ``This achievement cannot be expected in every future
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
	   The report contained no assessment of civilian or Serb casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, Cohen said Monday he has no basis for judging the accuracy of a
Human Rights Watch report claiming 500 civilian casualties in the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   He said every recommended target was reviewed to avoid unnecessary civilian
casualties. ``We don't want to see any innocent people harmed, and we took
extraordinary care to achieve those results,'' Cohen said.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Jet Forced To Land  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT ANDREWS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Sparks were seen flying from an engine on an Alaska
Airlines jetliner, moments after taking off from San Francisco International
Airport, according to airline and airport officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilot declared an emergency in order to get first priority to land, said
Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack Evans. The flight originated in Puerto Vallarta,
Mexico, and was on-route to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire trucks met the airplane after it landed safely about 7:45 p.m. PST
Monday, said airport duty manager Chris Ludwell. No injuries were reported among
the plane's 83 passengers and five crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a totally safe landing,'' said Ludwell.
</P>
<P>
	   The sparks, which were seen by airline personnel on about three other
aircraft and by San Francisco air-traffic controllers, did not cause any
apparent problems within the aircraft, said Ludwell and Evans.
</P>
<P>
	   The sparks were noticed when the plane was about 200 feet off the ground,
said a second airport duty manager, Dennis Neves.
</P>
<P>
	   The circumstances of Monday's problems bore a resemblance to a disastrous
Alaska Airlines flight a week ago, which killed all 88 people aboard in a crash
off the California coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Both planes had problems while on planned flight paths from Puerto Vallarta
to Seattle, via San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   Both planes were part of the MD-80 series aircraft. The fatal flight was an
MD-83; the flight Monday was an MD-80. Both were made by McDonnell Douglas, now
owned by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators suspect a problem with the horizontal stabilizer -- a part at
the rear of the plane -- caused the fatal crash. It was unclear what caused
Monday's problems in the left engine of the plane, located in the tail area.
Evans speculated that something, such as a bird, may have been sucked into the
engine.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots had no indication on their gauges that there was anything wrong with
the engine, said Evans.
</P>
<P>
	   Passengers on Monday's flight 289 were put on another plane to Seattle. The
plane stayed in San Francisco, where engineers examined it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The pilot would not have declared an emergency if not for air traffic
control issues in San Francisco,'' said Evans. He said the MD-80-series aircraft
and Alaska Airlines are safe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the thing that people need to keep in mind is that this aircraft
is one of the safest aircraft ever built in the history of aviation,'' Evans
said.

<HEADLINE> Consumers See Some Telecom Changes  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It laid the groundwork for a booming Internet economy and
the explosion of the wireless communications industry.
</P>
<P>
	   But four years after its passage, a pivotal rewrite of U.S.
telecommunications law is still trying to crack open old monopolies to new
competition. Since the 1996 Telecommunications Act, cable TV rates have risen
three times faster than inflation and the regional Bell companies still claim
the lion's share of the local phone market.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My cable bill is outrageous! The rate has steadily increased with no
changes in service or quality,'' Debbie Williams of Aloha, Ore., wrote this
summer to a consumer group in Washington. Bob Palinchak of Cordova, Tenn.,
griped that an array of monthly charges has caused his phone bill to increase
even when he makes few calls.
</P>
<P>
	   The chief regulator responsible for implementing the law, signed by
President Clinton four years ago today, credits it with fueling the current
growth in online use and other services.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The big picture is that the whole telecommunications and information
sectors of our economy are just booming,'' Federal Communications Commission
Chairman William Kennard said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``We've
really never seen anything like this in the history of communications in the
world where you have so much investment so quickly, a myriad of new services
being provided to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
	   House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley, R-Va., one of the bill's
co-authors, said consumers are beginning to see choices in markets once
controlled by monopolies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would have liked to have seen it go quicker,'' Bliley said. But ``it's
coming.''
</P>
<P>
	   Fledgling businesses have spent billions of dollars to offer local phone and
data services to compete with the regional Bells. AT&AMP;T has invested heavily in
its ambitious plan to use cable lines to deliver local phone service, while MCI
WorldCom and Sprint say their combined merger could enable then to reach local
customers through fixed wireless systems.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Bell companies and GTE still have most of the local market.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is hardly full-fledged realistic competition,'' said Adam Thierer a
fellow in economic policy at Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators point to the success of wireless phone service in giving
consumers more options. Almost all Americans now have a choice of three or more
wireless providers, according to the FCC, and prices have steadily declined.
</P>
<P>
	   New long-distance plans -- boasting rates as low as 5-cents a minute -- have
led to a decrease in the price of state-to-state calls of 2 percent between the
time before the act was passed and December 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   But consumer groups, in a scathing letter to Clinton said most Americans are
not benefitting from falling rates because of an extra $4 billion a year in
assorted charges now tagged on to their monthly phone bills.
</P>
<P>
	   New competition could come as the Bell companies aggressively seek
permission to offer long-distance in their territory. In one of the biggest
milestones since the act's passage, Bell Atlantic received FCC approval in
December to provide its local customers in New York with long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States Telecom Association, which represents local phone
companies, says the time is ripe for the FCC to remove regulatory hurdles
keeping its members out of voice and data long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
	   And consumers are still waiting to see lower cable TV rates -- which have
increased nearly 27 percent between the time right before the law was enacted
until December 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers and others hope that legislation passed last year allowing direct
broadcast satellite companies to beam local channels to their customers will
help bolster competition.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Lebanon Air Strikes  </HEADLINE>
   By SAM F. GHATTAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes struck across Lebanon early
Tuesday, destroying three major power stations and targeting a guerrilla base in
retaliation for Hezbollah attacks that have killed five Israeli soldiers in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifteen civilians were reported wounded in the Israeli airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
	   Large areas of Lebanon plunged into darkness either because of the
destruction of the power grid or as a precautionary shut down by local
authorities to protect installations from further damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The capital Beirut, the town of Baalbek in the eastern Bekaa Valley and the
cities of Sidon and Tyre in the south were blacked out for most of the night.
Power was gradually restored to limited areas by the morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Electricity Minister Suleiman Traboulsi imposed a regime of severe
rationing, saying damage to the power grid was heavy and estimated losses
exceeded ``many times'' the $25 million in destruction caused by similar
airstrikes in June.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli army said the attacks were in response to ``the severe
escalation in the activities of Hezbollah and other organizations in south
Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's raids came hours after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
Security Cabinet ordered a ``harsh military response,'' according to a senior
Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Those who have harmed us
will be harmed,'' Barak said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanon does not have the military capability to counter an Israeli attack,
but strikes like the ones launched early Tuesday usually invite guerrilla
retaliation in the form of Katyusha rockets aimed at Israel's northern border
towns.
</P>
<P>
	   As soon as the Israeli army ordered people in border areas into shelters
Monday night, residents fled the oft-hit town of Kiryat Shemona in convoys. But
by Tuesday morning, the guerrillas fighting to end Israel's occupation of a
border zone in southern Lebanon had held their fire.
</P>
<P>
	   A Hezbollah statement said that because northern Israelis had taken cover,
the guerrillas ``reserve the right to retaliate at the appropriate time which
could come very soon.''
</P>
<P>
	   The group also said in its first comment on the airstrikes that the action
will not protect Israeli forces against continued Hezbollah attacks in the
south. It did not give an account of any losses from a raid on a Hezbollah base.
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanon's Prime Minister Salim Hoss, in a statement issued Tuesday, said
Israel will not succeed in forcing the Lebanese to abandon their demands to
regain territory occupied by the Jewish state in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah has been fighting to drive the Israelis out of a security zone
they established in southern Lebanon in 1985 to protect the country's northern
settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks. Barak said last July 7 that
Israel would withdraw from the area within a year. He had hoped a pullout would
be through an agreement with Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, but
Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The dramatic details of the latest deaths in southern Lebanon and grisly
footage of the fighting raised public pressure on Barak to make good on his
promise to get out. Besides the five soldiers, a senior commander in the
Israel-allied South Lebanon Army died in Hezbollah attacks last week.

<HEADLINE> Administration Seeks Embassy Safety  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Since the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania 18 months ago, the Clinton administration has been replacing and
repairing the most vulnerable U.S. missions but now says Congress must pursue
the issue more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration is asking Congress to approve $1.05 billion for embassy
security for fiscal 2001 and also to appropriate $3 billion annually over the
three ensuing years for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   Historically, Congress resists advance appropriations, but the
administration hopes lawmakers will make an exception for embassy security given
the risk to overseas missions from terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
	   About 80 percent of the missions fall short of department security
standards. Beyond that, terrorist groups have threatened to attack American
interests overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is whether to accept the recommendations of an independent panel
that a year ago urged Congress to appropriate $14 billion over 10 years to help
protect American diplomats.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, precisely 18 months after the East Africa bombings, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright recommended, as part of the administration's 2001
budget submission, outlays of $1.05 billion for fiscal 2001 as well as the
multiyear appropriation.
</P>
<P>
	   For fiscal 2000, Congress appropriated $567 million, more than $800 million
short of what the Accountability Review Panel, led by the former chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William Crowe, had recommended.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowe said Monday he was pleased with the 2001 request even though the
figure was still almost a third less than his panel had recommended.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whatever figure you turn in, you're always going to get a little less,''
Crowe said in a telephone interview. ``I'm going to keep agitating.'' He spoke
before the administration disclosed its intention to request an advance
appropriation.
</P>
<P>
	   Marshall Adair, president of the union that represents career diplomats,
welcomed the higher priority being given to embassy security. But he complained
the administration was still about $1 billion behind where it should be after
two years, based on the recommendations of the Crowe panel.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright acknowledged that the $1.05 billion contemplated for fiscal 2001,
plus the advance appropriation request, was not sufficient.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she was ordering a review of current plans ``to ensure that
cooperation encountering threats to our security from whatever source is at the
highest level.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our goal is to ensure that as far as humanly possible and consistent with
their professional responsibilities, our people are fully protected.''

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Defense Minister Killed  </HEADLINE>
   By DUSAN STOJANOVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Less than a month after the slaying of Serbia's
most notorious warlord, the Yugoslav defense minister was fatally shot in a
Belgrade restaurant.
</P>
<P>
	   Pavle Bulatovic, 52, was shot and wounded Monday in the restaurant of the
soccer club Rad in a Belgrade residential area.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said Bulatovic later died in a Belgrade military hospital. Two others
with him at the restaurant were wounded in the attack, police said in a
statement carried by the official Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting follows last month's killing of Serbia's most notorious
warlord, Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan, who was gunned down in a plush
Belgrade hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a dozen prominent people, some close to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, have been killed in Belgrade in the past decade. Most of the
killings have never been solved.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yugoslav government said in a statement that Bulatovic ``was the victim
of a classic terrorist act.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police said an unidentified attacker fired through a window of the
restaurant, wounding Bulatovic and the two others from behind.
</P>
<P>
	   Montenegrin police officials said Bulatovic, restaurant owner Mirko
Knezevic, and a banker identified as Vuk Obradovic were shot by a man using an
automatic weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   A few hours after the shooting, the table where Bulatovic sat at a corner of
the popular but not fancy restaurant was covered with blood and the floor was
littered with debris. Pieces of plates and broken glass were scattered around.
Bullet holes were seen on the walls.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic, 52, had served as the defense minister of Yugoslavia since 1994.
He is a member of a pro-Serbian faction in Montenegro that is loyal to
Milosevic. Bulatovic's Socialist People's Party is at odds with the pro-Western
Montenegrin government of President Milo Djukanovic.
</P>
<P>
	   Montenegro is the smaller republic that makes up Yugoslavia along with
Milosevic's Serbia.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic, largely a figurehead minister, was very close to Momir Bulatovic,
the Yugoslav premier and a close ally of Milosevic. The two were not related.
</P>
<P>
	   Miodrag Vlahovic, an analyst in Montenegro's capital, Podgorica, said the
latest killing could be the result of a ``conflict of interests'' concerning
business arrangements between top Yugoslav officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic is survived by his wife and two children.

<HEADLINE> Trump Unveils Health Care Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Still undecided over whether to leap into the
presidential contest, developer Donald Trump is proposing that the unemployed be
given vouchers to buy health care.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our current system is a complicated mess which leads to many Americans
without access to any affordable quality health care,'' Trump says in remarks
prepared for delivery today.
</P>
<P>
	   The Associated Press obtained a copy on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   But the New York billionaire has said he is having serious doubts about
whether the Reform Party can heal its own wounds, inflicted by factional
infighting.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump will meet with advisers at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla.,
this weekend to make his decision, said his strategist, Roger Stone. The
reception Trump gets to his health care plan will be taken into consideration,
Stone said.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump says unemployed people should get vouchers to buy some of the basic
coverage that most workers get. He'd also expand Medicare to include a new
prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The present government bureaucracy managing Medicare and Medicaid could be
slashed, saving the system billions of dollars,'' Trump contends in his remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 40 million Americans have no health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton's ill-fated health care campaign in 1993 also included a
proposal to require all employers to offer their workers health care insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump's plan appears most similar to those offered by Democratic
presidential candidates Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore, both of whom
propose expanding Medicare and making health insurance affordable for more
people.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's plan, the most ambitious and expensive at an estimated $65 billion
a year, would do away with Medicaid and offer subsidies to help poor and
middle-income people buy health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican candidates primarily favor expanding tax-protected medical
savings accounts to help people buy their own coverage. Pat Buchanan, the only

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Seek Core Democrats  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Stumping for the support of core Democratic
constituencies, Bill Bradley lamented the demise of affirmative action programs
while presidential rival Al Gore renewed his tough assaults on Bradley's
centerpiece health care plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore courted labor in New York and Bradley pursued blacks in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to move our collective humanity a few feet forward,'' Bradley said
Monday in Tampa, Fla., where he issued a staunch defense of affirmative action
in a state where it's being ended.
</P>
<P>
	   At a union hall, Vice President Gore criticized Bradley's style, saying he
campaigns ``by running down the progress and achievements of the Democratic
Party over the past seven years.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also took his courtship of Democratic groups to new heights, taking to
the stage at Lincoln Center with the New York City Gay Men's Chorus to sing
``The Battle Hymn of the Republic.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Florida, Bradley cast himself as a defender of affirmative action
programs under fire. Gov. Jeb Bush has a plan to replace affirmative action in
university admissions and the awarding of state contracts with increased
outreach efforts and broader anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me be very clear, giving people opportunity, trusting them with
responsibility and holding them accountable is not a preference,'' Bradley said.
``It is the standard by which the march of progress is made in America.''
</P>
<P>
	   He directly criticized Bush -- the brother of GOP presidential front-runner
George W. Bush -- for moving to end Florida's affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A governor sets a tone, a president sets a tone,'' said Bradley. ``This
sets the wrong tone.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also pointed to the increasingly diverse nature of Florida to argue
that affirmative action was being ended at precisely the moment it was most
needed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will not yield to anyone who believes that affirmative action is no
longer necessary,'' he said. ``Yes, we have made progress, but we still have a
long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was focusing on racial harmony today in South Carolina, where he
planned to argue that the Confederate flag should lowered from the Statehouse
because it symbolizes a racist past.
</P>
<P>
	   He also planned to renew his criticisms of George W. Bush for speaking at
Bob Jones University, which Bradley argued discriminated on the basis of race.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Gore ripped into Bradley, once again claiming that the
former New Jersey senator would fritter away the projected budget surplus with a
giant health care plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Stumping in New York City, Gore warned that Bradley's health plan would cost
New York more than any state in the country. He also prepared to argue today in
Florida, a state with a large senior population, that Bradley's proposal would
harm the nursing home industry by easing standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's aides fired back that Gore was wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The vice president long ago lost any credibility on this issue,'' said
spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
	   With the local issues and living rooms of Iowa and New Hampshire a memory,
the Democratic rivals must assemble coalitions to form majorities in key
primaries beginning March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's been Gore who has built strong ties to key Democratic
constituencies including labor and minorities over the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside analysts said it won't be easy for Bradley to push past such deeply
rooted feelings among core Democratic supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gore is much better known among black politicians for a much longer period
of time,'' said Merle Black of Emory University. ``I don't know how Bradley
breaks through that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show Gore with a big lead nationally over Bradley. The latest Field
Poll in California, where both rivals will finish the week, showed Gore 41
points ahead of Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   But the competition for core Democratic groups could lay land mines for the
general election if, for example, Bradley and Gore try to one-up each other on
affirmative action. By contrast, Bill Clinton courted moderates in 1992 by
challenging black groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republicans will gleefully take notes and throw it back at them in the
fall,'' said Hugh Graham of Vanderbilt University.

<HEADLINE> Bush Aims at Rival Who Isn't There  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- George W. Bush campaigned to tarnish John McCain's
reform mantle, vowing to ``take it to him,'' as Delaware Republicans voted today
in a presidential primary bypassed by the senator who trounced the front-running
governor in their first round.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can play as rough as anybody,'' said McCain. ``There is a little of the
fighter pilot left in me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and Steve Forbes were the campaigners in Delaware, where Republicans
were voting from 7 a.m. EST until 8 p.m. at only 28 polling places across the
state in a party-run primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes complained that the establishment was trying to make it difficult to
vote so he wouldn't upset Bush. ``The elites know how to work these things,''
the self-financed candidate said in Dover, third stop in a Monday of leisurely
campaigning in conservative southern Delaware.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he was optimistic. The Bush camp was confident, aiming at a vote
that would ease the impact of McCain's 19-point landslide over Bush in the New
Hampshire primary a week ago. Forbes ran a far-back third there.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is on the Delaware ballot, but did not campaign here, heading instead
for South Carolina, where he and Bush meet in a crucial primary on Feb. 19, and
Michigan, scene of the action three days later.
</P>
<P>
	   That's where McCain said he will meet Bush's campaign fire and double it.
``We won't just respond, we will respond doubly,'' McCain said while campaigning
in Michigan. ``There will be a price to pay and we will have a lot of fun while
we're doing it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning in Dover, Bush accused McCain of saying one thing and doing
another on campaign reform. He said he is the ``reformer with results'' to show
the voters.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain sneered that he guessed Bush had become a reformer and ``it's his
first day on the job.'' The Arizona senator said he can take on an Al Gore
Democratic ticket on campaign finance scandals and Bush can't because he doesn't
want to overhaul the system.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush contends the McCain plan for campaign finance reform would unfairly
damage Republicans by restricting their donations but not the spending of
organized labor in behalf of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republicans, past their nice guy beginnings, sounded a bit like
Democrats Gore and Bill Bradley, who have been trading charges of negative
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Bush has launched ``a series of attacks on me, and it's fine,
it's fine.'' He also said they were wrong, and broadcast an ad attacking the
Bush offensive.
</P>
<P>
	   It accuses Bush of breaking a promise to run a positive campaign. ``Do we
really want another politician in the White House America can't trust?'' the
McCain ad asks.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush took the harder line and changed his campaign format after weekend
strategy sessions in Austin, Texas, on tactics to counter McCain's gains in and
after New Hampshire. ``The days of smiling and letting John McCain define me are
over,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor is still the national front-runner for the 2000
nomination, but McCain has whittled the margin in public opinion polls. He's
also gained in the polls in the battle states of South Carolina and Michigan,
and in California, which votes on March 7 in the biggest primary of all.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to remind people that in this race there is one person who can
stand up and say, 'I'm a reformer with results,''' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he's delivered reforms as governor. He said McCain runs as the
advocate of campaign finance reform, but uses his influence as chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee in raising funds to run for president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hear him say 'Let's have campaign finance reform,' '' Bush said, ``and
on the other hand, he says 'Let's pass the plate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas, campaigning for Bush in South Carolina,
said McCain was criticizing a system he is ``milking for campaign donations.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said he is a proven reformer, advocating a gift ban in Congress, an
overhaul of campaign finance laws and an end to corporate tax loopholes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have a long record of reform and it's very well known,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's scrap with McCain dominated his campaign day in Delaware, with scant
mention of Forbes. Bush said he was competing here, unlike McCain, because he is
a national candidate. ``I'm not picking and choosing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won the Delaware primary four years ago, gaining 33 percent of the
vote to beat Bob Dole, who did not campaign, in deference to New Hampshire,
which insists on a week to itself. To avoid that situation in 2000, Delaware
Republicans opted out of the state primary on Saturday -- Gore won that
Democratic vote -- and financed their own election.

<HEADLINE> Gore, McCain in Close S.C. Race  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arizona Sen. John McCain has narrowed the gap nationally
in his race with George W. Bush and is locked in a tight struggle with the Texas
governor in South Carolina, according to new polls.
</P>
<P>
	   The surveys attested to dramatic shifts that have been apparent in the GOP
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   An ABC-Washington Post poll released Monday gave Bush 48 percent, and McCain
43 percent, while Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes were in the low single digits in
the race to win South Carolina's Feb. 19 primary. The difference between Bush
and McCain was just outside the 4.5 percentage point error margin for most
likely voters.
</P>
<P>
	   And McCain has cut into Bush's lead in national polls since late January
when the Texas governor led by about 50 points, according to several new
surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   The ABC-Post poll in South Carolina was designed to measure the sentiments
of those very likely to vote in a primary with relatively low turnout. Turnout
in the past three GOP primaries has averaged below 10 percent of the state's
voting age population, ABC pollster Gary Langer noted. This poll allowed for
slightly higher voter participation in such a competitive primary, about 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   On 10 of 11 personal qualities, McCain scored higher than Bush in the
ABC-Post poll. South Carolina's potential voters saw him as more likely to say
what he really thinks, not a typical politician, someone who knows world affairs
and who has an inspiring personal story.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush performed better than McCain among core Republican groups in South
Carolina, leading among those who identify themselves as Republicans,
conservatives and members of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
	   More than four out of five said McCain would be a good commander in chief,
while two-thirds said that of Bush. McCain's overall performance was stronger
with the inclusion of more independents and Democrats, who can vote in the
state's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   At the national level, Bush led McCain, 56 percent to 34 percent, in a
CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll taken after McCain's win in the New Hampshire GOP
primary on Feb. 1, compared with a 65-16 lead for Bush in the days immediately
after he won the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   A Zogby poll showed Bush leading McCain 48 percent to 30 percent among
likely voters in Republican primaries. The ABC-Post poll had Bush at 63 percent
and McCain at 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Bush supporters have said he gives the GOP the best hope of victory in
November, and the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll indicated that a majority, 57
percent, still feels Bush gives Republicans the best chance of winning the White
House, while 39 percent said that of McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has caught up with Bush in how the public views them personally, with
67 percent viewing the Arizona senator favorably, compared with 51 percent who
said that in late January in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll. Only 12 percent had
an unfavorable view of McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's favorable rating was at 63 percent, down slightly from the 71 percent
in October, while 31 percent viewed him unfavorably, up slightly from 21 percent
in October.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican race recently has focused on who is more of a Washington
insider and who is the outsider challenging the system. Interestingly, more
people saw Bush as a Washington insider, 35 percent, than saw McCain, a member
of Congress since 1983, as an insider, 27 percent, in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup
poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Six out of 10 people said McCain wants to be president because he has a
sincere desire to help the country, while people were about evenly split on
whether Bush wanted political power or wanted to help the country.
</P>
<P>
	   In national polls of likely voters in the Democratic primaries, Vice
President Al Gore has a 30-point to 50-point lead over Bill Bradley, depending
on the poll.
</P>
<P>
	   The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of 1,018 people, including 878 registered
voters, and the Zogby poll of 1,024 likely voters were taken Friday through
Sunday. They both had error margins of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The
ABC-Post poll of 1,013 people nationwide and 490 of the most likely voters in
South Carolina was taken Thursday through Sunday. It had an error margin of plus
or minus 3 percentage points nationally and 4.5 percent for the most likely
voters in South Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Fossils Being Plundered by Thieves  </HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH A. WRIGHT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KEMMERER, Wyo. (AP) -- Flying his patrol plane over the scrubland, Steve
Rogers notes five or six areas of freshly overturned earth. He sees a faint
cloud of dust and veers over for a better look.
</P>
<P>
	   A herd of pronghorn antelope, he suspects. They are not what Rogers is
searching for aboard his high-soaring Cessna.
</P>
<P>
	   On this expanse of frozen terrain where 50 million years ago tropical and
subtropical plants and animals thrived along two freshwater lakes, Rogers is
hunting fossil thieves.
</P>
<P>
	   Protected by the vastness of the West, the looters plunder the rich ground
of fossils -- hoping for perfectly preserved specimens that typically will be
displayed on rock slabs or inlaid in countertop and floor tiles as home decor.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the 1980s, commercial and scientific groups have clashed over how to
manage fossils on public land. Moves in Congress to open up the land to
commercial interests have stalled, as have efforts by scientists to protect
fossils more extensively.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, investigators say fossils, valued by scientists for their
portraits of prehistoric times, are being destroyed or stolen and sold worldwide
on a burgeoning black market.
</P>
<P>
	   As a pilot and investigator for the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department,
Rogers has received death threats at his unlisted home telephone number and seen
a ``wanted'' poster of himself, offering $40,000 for his capture. He once found
his two house cats on the front porch with their necks broken.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I guess I'm too dumb to be scared off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Green River Formation, as Rogers' beat is known, draws worldwide
interest from scientists and commercial dealers because of its abundant,
well-preserved marine specimens. One area, known as ``the turtles'' for its
turtle fossils, ``is a known high-crime area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But while paleontologists dig up fossils carefully from the strata, studying
under what conditions the animals lived and died, fossil thieves tend to hack
away with screwdrivers, shovels or other tools. They toss aside the less
valuable fossils.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's unbelievable. They are throwing away more fossils than they are
taking,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fossil sales are booming over the Internet, in rock shops and art galleries.
Prices range from $5 to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on rarity and
intricacy. Top-dollar fossils depict perfectly preserved skeletons, feathers and
even the skin markings of animals.
</P>
<P>
	   As sales flourish, crime follows.
</P>
<P>
	   Worldwide, the theft of fossils is gaining momentum, with Russia, China,
Australia and the United States leading the way, said Angela Meadows, program
manager of cultural property for Interpol in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, many fossils are not worth enough for police to pursue, no matter how
priceless they are to science.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It just isn't something a lot of governments have focused on and probably
because the fossils have low monetary value,'' Meadows said. ``You can buy a
mammoth tusk for $2,000, depending on the condition.''
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign law enforcement are not particularly interested in tracking down
Wyoming fossils smuggled overseas. Rogers said he would have to convince foreign
police that the smugglers may be moving other contraband, such as guns and
drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   A multi-agency task force called Operation Rock Fish, named after the most
common fossil found in Wyoming, has netted several hundred suspects since its
creation in 1993. Rogers said arrest figures are unavailable because the various
agencies have not coordinated them.
</P>
<P>
	   The best way to crack down on fossil stealing is to catch thieves
red-handed, but that is difficult in the West. A ranger for the U.S. Bureau of
Land Management in Wyoming patrols an average of 3 million acres; Rogers alone
patrols about 500 square miles of the Green River Formation, which encompasses
thousands of square miles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's often hard to sneak up on them,'' said Bill Vernon, chief ranger for
the bureau.
</P>
<P>
	   Paleontologists complain that laws against fossil theft have lagged behind
the times. Unlike Civil War cannons or other cultural artifacts, the theft of
fossils from public land falls under a statute that penalizes the theft of
government property.
</P>
<P>
	   No maximum punishment exists because the penalty hinges on a fossil's value.
Consequently, scientists say most fossil thieves get no more than a slap on the
wrist.
</P>
<P>
	   Marion Zenker, a commercial fossil dealer for the South Dakota-based Black
Hills Institute, questions police claims about the extent of fossil smuggling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're one of the largest earth science supply houses in the world,'' she
said. ``If there were a huge black market out there, we would know about it.''

<HEADLINE> Hillary Talks Abortion With the AP  </HEADLINE>
   By BETH J. HARPAZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton says that if she is elected to
the Senate she would vote against anti-abortion judges who are nominated to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I cannot imagine I would vote to confirm such a nominee,'' she said in a
wide-ranging interview Monday with The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's presumed Republican opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who is also an abortion rights supporter, has said he wouldn't rule
out voting to confirm a judge who held anti-abortion views.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's interview came the day after she announced her Senate candidacy
and during the start of a four-day campaign swing that was to continue today in
Rochester.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady seemed focused -- in ways that haven't come across before --
on telling people who she is and what she stands for. In Buffalo, she repeatedly
told audiences ``I'll be on your side'' and spoke constantly of her ``more than
30 years'' of working on issues related to children, education and health care.
</P>
<P>
	   Having lived in the shadow of her husband's presidency for seven years,
Clinton said that like Vice President Al Gore, she must create an independent
image to succeed as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the vice president had to say to himself, `Hey, I need to go out
and tell my story. People don't know anything about me,''' Clinton said. ``I
learned the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, her campaign literature and her banners routinely refer to her
simply as ``Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It just seems like the easiest way for me to quickly be identified,'' she
said. ``There was an impression that I got that people were just unaware of how
I had spent my life before the White House and that there was also a similar gap
on awareness on what I had done in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady told the AP that she did not know whether President Clinton
might want to run again for elective office. There has been speculation that he
might want to run for the Senate himself, perhaps from his home state of
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't say never to anything, but I think he's got lots of ideas about
things he wants to do. He wants to remain very active in the public debate here
in our country and around the world. ... But I don't know all that he would do
in the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton sought to raise concerns about just how well the blunt-spoken
Giuliani would do in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't show up in the Senate and demand that your 99 colleagues do what
you tell them to do,'' she said. ``You've got to be able to work with people one
day who you may disagree with the next day.''
</P>
<P>
	   But asked if she felt Giuliani had the wrong temperament for the Senate, she
said: ``That is a question that the people of New York will have to ask
themselves. I think I would be a very good senator for New York.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also implied that Giuliani couldn't necessarily be counted on to
maintain what has been his largely moderate record in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've seen it time and time again -- people who claim to be independent,
all of a sudden vote with the Republican leadership because if they don't, they
don't get support raising funds for their campaigns, they don't get the
committee assignments that they want,'' she said. ``That's just the way that
party operates.''
</P>
<P>
	   She also picked up a plug from Gore, who was campaigning in New York City on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's join together now to elect Hillary Rodham Clinton the next senator
from New York,'' Gore told cheering union members. ``Your voice will be heard
and her vote will be cast for you.''
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady also expressed a desire to have the independent counsel's
office that has been looking into Whitewater affair and other allegations of
impropriety against the Clintons wind up its work.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that everyone would have expected that after 6 1/2 years,
thousands upon thousands of documents and investigations and committee hearings,
that they would have reached their conclusion and I would hope that they do in
an efficacious manner,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Clinton said the ongoing probe still hanging over her and the
president was not having an impact on her campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That has nothing to do with any of my campaign decisions or how I'm trying
to present myself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also said that win or lose, she plans to maintain the roots she
planted last month when she moved into the $1.7 million house she and the
president purchased in Chappaqua in suburban Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I look forward to spending years in that house,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Oil Production Said Will Drop  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraq's oil production will drop unless the Security
Council allows key spare parts to be sold to Baghdad so that it can upgrade its
oil sector, a senior U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Benon Sevan, head of the U.N. oil-for-food program, told the council Monday
that a drop in oil exports could affect humanitarian aid for Iraqis struggling
to cope with economic sanctions imposed after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the council had not responded to repeated appeals from U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to remove ``holds'' on applications to send
humanitarian supplies and oil sector equipment to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Iraq's oil industry continues to be in a lamentable state,'' Sevan said.
``We would appeal to all members of the council to reflect on the argument that
unless key items of oil industry equipment are made available and commissioned
within a short time, the production of oil is likely to drop. This is a very
clear warning.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vast majority of holds have been placed by the United States, which
remains concerned that dual-use items could be directed to weapons production.
Washington has also put holds on contracts from firms it views as
``questionable.''
</P>
<P>
	   The oil-for-food program, started in 1996, allows Iraq to sell oil under
U.N. financial controls, with proceeds funding U.N. humanitarian programs and
Persian Gulf War reparations as well as paying for oil spare parts.
</P>
<P>
	   Since May 1998, the council has authorized Iraq to buy $1.2 billion worth of
spare parts for the oil sector but only $250 million of oil sector equipment has
arrived -- partly because of delays in ordering and deliveries.
</P>
<P>
	   But $288 million worth of spares remains on hold, Sevan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has come under pressure from Russia and France, nations
that are eager to expand trade relations with Baghdad, to lift the holds.
</P>
<P>
	   Sevan reiterated Annan's recommendation that the Security Council authorize
an additional $300 million worth of spare parts, using revenue from the last
phase of the oil-for-food program, which has not been allocated.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. official said Washington is likely to increase the allocation for
spare parts after the council receives Sevan's report on the humanitarian
program and a survey of Iraq's oil sector due on March 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Diplomats said Washington was less flexible Monday when Russia raised the
possibility of using oil-for-food revenue to pay $11 million that Iraq owes the
United Nations and $23 million it owes the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises, Japanese Stocks Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar rose to a five-and-a-half month high against
the yen Tuesday afternoon on deepening concern Japan's economic recovery may
take longer than expected. Tokyo stocks edged lower.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. dollar was trading at 109.34 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange
market at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT) Tuesday, jumping 1.52 yen from late Monday and
extending gains from its overnight level of 108.78 yen in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 76.55 points, or 0.38
percent, to close at 19,868.88. On Monday, the average closed up 111.86 points,
or 0.92 percent, at 19,945.43.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. currency was lifted on buying from both U.S. and Japanese trust
banks, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The yen extended an overnight retreat provoked by comments from Japan's
chief economic planner, Taichi Sakaiya, who said in a Sunday television
interview that the economy likely shrank during the October-December quarter.
Sakaiya reiterated the comments Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sakaiya's remark initiated the yen sell-off abroad as two quarters of
contraction are regarded as a recession," said Takeo Suzuki, assistant manger of
foreign exchange at Nomura Trust and Banking.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas traders found little consolation in assurances by the economic
planner that the government still expects to hit its growth target of 0.6
percent for the fiscal year ending March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was also supported by continued signs of strength in the U.S.
economy, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 107.26 yen, up from 105.99 yen
late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, the benchmark Nikkei edged lower as investors took
profits on high-flying technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said some sellers took their cue from an overnight retreat by stocks
on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.4 percent to
10,905.79 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial shares were also hurt by news that the Tokyo metropolitan
government is considering a new corporate tax on major banks.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section fell 17.23 points, or 0.98 percent, to 1,737.55. On Monday the TOPIX
finished up 13.56 points, or 0.77 percent, at 1,754.78.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.9000
percent from 1.8500 percent Monday. Its price fell 0.42 point to 98.55.

Clinton Unveils $1.84 Trillion 2001 Budget

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was so proud of what his final budget
would do about eliminating the publicly held part of the national debt that he
used a paint brush to draw a plunging blue line on a wall chart. Angry
Republicans, however, probably would have chosen the color red for Clinton's
last budget -- for the shame they charge he should feel about all his new
spending programs, his tax increases and his modest tax reductions. Both sides

<HEADLINE> NHL Now a League of Many Nations  </HEADLINE>
    By ALAN ROBINSON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- The 1998 Nagano Olympics proved it. So did the World team's
9-4 rout in the All-Star game. The NHL is a league of many nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Clearly, there is a new world order in what now is the inappropriately named
National Hockey League, whose regular season resumes tonight with eight games.
</P>
<P>
	   There are numerous unresolved issues to be settled as the final two months
of the season play out -- most important, the crowded race to win the Stanley
Cup. As many as 10 teams look to be legitimate contenders, led by Detroit, St.
Louis and New Jersey, but with Philadelphia, Florida, Dallas, Colorado, Toronto
and Phoenix not far behind.
</P>
<P>
	   Injuries no doubt will play a big factor -- has Dallas played a game yet
with its full cast of Stars? -- as will any deals made by the March 14 trading
deadline. There will also be speculation whether this is the final season for
two aging All-Stars, Mark Messier and Ray Bourque.
</P>
<P>
	   The financial state of the smaller-market Canadian clubs is another point of
concern, especially because the Canadian government pulled the plug on a bailout
plan.
</P>
<P>
	   But what is becoming the centerpiece story of this 1999-2000 season is the
NHL's diversity, not just in its talent, but its nationalities.
</P>
<P>
	   The brightest stars in a league once ruled by Lemieux and Gretzky, Richard
and Howe now are named Bure and Jagr and Hasek. And the NHL is finding those
stars not in Kanata and Medicine Hat, but Kladno and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   A quarter-century ago, 90 percent of the NHL was North American-born. Now,
it's only 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   This torrent of European talent, let loose a decade ago when the Berlin Wall
tumbled down and Communism collapsed throughout Europe, has altered not only the
NHL's statistics sheet and its standings, but its very personality.
</P>
<P>
	   The balance of power clearly shifted to the East during the
European-dominated 1998 Olympics in Nagano, won by the Czech Republic. Canada
didn't even medal in its most popular sport, and the only mark left by the
United States was on its dormitory room walls.
</P>
<P>
	   The trend that began in Nagano is playing out in the NHL. One year after the
league was stuck in a defensive mode, unable to free itself from its own neutral
zone trap, scoring is up -- a byproduct not only of the European influence, but
the 4-on-4 overtime format that has significantly cut down on ties.
</P>
<P>
	   Scoring leader Jaromir Jagr of Pittsburgh especially likes 4-by-4 -- it has
so speeded up overtime, perhaps it should be called 4-on-the floor -- and he has
proposed the league play it for 60 minutes, every game, every night.
</P>
<P>
	   "The players now are so big and strong and the rinks are too small," Jagr
said. "If I was going to make hockey better, I would either make the rinks
bigger or play 4-on-4 all the time. It's more exciting for the fans, they stand
the whole five minutes in overtime."
</P>
<P>
	   Jagr (Czech Republic) and Pavel Bure (Russia) are heating up a scoring race
that previously looked to be a Jagr runaway and now features four Europeans
among the top 10 scorers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bure and St. Louis forward Pavol Demitra combined Sunday for five of the
nine World team goals, all of them scored by Eastern Europeans. Of the game's 13
goals in Toronto's Air Canada Centre, only four were by Canadians or Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   The NHL could even gets its first European-born coach as early as next
season, when Czech Republic coach Ivan Hlinka is expected to replace Herb Brooks
in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
	   Uh, oh, Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Wayne Gretzky, now simply the Retired One, thinks he knows why the Canadian
influence no longer dominates the NHL.
</P>
<P>
	   "The one thing that we seemed to have lost that the Jean Beliveaus, Bobby
Orrs and Gordie Howes of the world had is creativity and imagination," Gretzky
said. "That creativity was basically founded by the fact they would go to ponds
and skate for six, seven, eight hours a day, choose up sides, have two nets and
no goalies, and away you go."
</P>
<P>
	   Frozen ponds, no doubt, like the one frequented by Gretzky, Howe and Mario
Lemieux during the already popular film clip shot last Friday for ABC's All-Star
telecast. The film, which featured current-day stars Jagr, Bure, Eric Lindros
and Paul Kariya playing on a frozen lake, was meant to symbolize the passing of
the torch from one NHL generation to the next.
</P>
<P>
	   But who would have guessed a few years ago the route traveled by that torch
would be through Moscow, not Montreal?
</P>
<P>
	   "When you lose players like Wayne Gretzky and Mario in the last short period
of time, there's some slack to be pulled in," said Bure, who had three goals and
an assist Sunday to win the MVP award and a new truck. "It was like changing
generations, and it meant a lot to me."

<HEADLINE> UConn Women Remain No. 1 in AP Poll  </HEADLINE>
    By CHUCK SCHOFFNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Connecticut had enough convincing victories to make up for one narrow loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite its first loss of the season, 72-71 at home to Tennessee,
Connecticut remained a solid No. 1 Monday in The Associated Press women's
basketball poll.
</P>
<P>
	   The only difference: The Huskies were not a unanimous pick as they were each
of the four previous weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut (20-1), which has been No. 1 all season, received 27 of the 44
first-place votes from a national media panel. That was enough to give the
Huskies a 41-point lead over Tennessee, which jumped past Georgia and Louisiana
Tech into the No. 2 spot.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut defeated Tennessee last month in Knoxville and also has defeated
eight other teams that are currently ranked or have been in the Top 25.
</P>
<P>
	   Old Dominion had a similar experience in 1979. The Lady Monarchs were No. 1
when they lost to South Carolina 73-49, but remained at the top of the poll the
rest of the season and won the national championship.
</P>
<P>
	   There were few changes elsewhere in the Top 25, which had only one newcomer.
Stanford, which has been in and out of the poll twice this season, returned for
a third time at No. 24. Illinois dropped out.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut bounced back from the loss to Tennessee to beat Seton Hall
86-34, a game the Huskies led 41-8 at halftime. The Huskies had 1,073 points in
the voting.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee (19-3) also beat Vanderbilt and Alabama during the week. The Lady
Vols received six first-place votes and 1,032 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia (23-2) remained third with 10 first-place votes and 1,023 points.
Louisiana Tech (17-2) dropped from second to fourth despite winning three games
by margins of 45, 40 and 39 points. The Lady Techsters received one first-place
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The rest of the Top Ten stayed the same. Notre Dame was fifth and Penn State
sixth, followed by LSU, Iowa State, Texas Tech and Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
	   North Carolina State held at No. 11, but the Wolfpack will have to play the
rest of the regular season without center Summer Erb, who broke two bones in her
left foot in the final minute of her team's victory over North Carolina last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wolfpack won their first game without her, beating Florida State 72-62
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   UC Santa Barbara was 12th and Auburn 13th, followed by Duke, Purdue,
Arizona, Oklahoma, Old Dominion, Boston College and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
	   Mississippi State, Virginia, Kansas, Stanford and Tulane completed the Top
25.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma, the only Big 12 team unbeaten in league play, jumped five places
to match its highest ranking since holding the No. 17 spot March 2, 1986. The
Sooners have a big game tonight at Iowa State, which has only one conference
loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford was last ranked two weeks ago, when it was 24th, but dropped out
after losing to Washington. The Cardinal got back in after beating UCLA and
Southern Cal.
</P>
<P>
	   UCLA fell from 15th to 20th for the biggest drop in the poll. Tulane slipped
four places after its most lopsided loss at home since 1991, 81-62 to Marquette.
</P>
<P>
	   Illinois (17-8), 23rd last week, dropped out after splitting two games. The
Illini lost to Michigan, their fourth loss in six games, then beat Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Leak Blinded Missile Defense  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A coolant leak that rendered a missile interceptor
essentially blind at the last moment is being blamed for last month's failed
test of the Pentagon's experimental missile defense system, The Washington Post
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   For all but the last six seconds of the interceptor's approximately
eight-minute flight from a U.S. Army range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific the
indications were that the interceptor would hit its target, Pentagon officials
said last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Nitrogen gas used to refrigerate the interceptor's heat-seeking sensors
leaked from a small metal tube, causing the sensors to fail and preventing the
interceptor from ``seeing'' the target well enough to steer itself into the
dummy warhead's path, the Post said in today's editions, citing unnamed defense
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials were quoted as saying that aside from the leak, almost
everything else went right during the Jan. 18 test, including first-time use of
satellites and ground-based tracking radar to guide the interceptor.
</P>
<P>
	   The next test of the anti-missile system has been delayed until the second
half of may because of last month's failed intercept, the officials told the
Post. The Pentagon and defense contractors want to make sure they know what went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   The system is designed to shoot down a small number of ballistic missiles of
the type being developed by North Korea and Iran. The Clinton administration
estimates that building the missile defense system will cost $12.7 billion.

<HEADLINE> Democrat Fund-Raising Trial Starts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Jusice Department, kicking of trial against a former
fund-raiser, says Maria Hsia concealed the source of more than $100,000 in
illegal donations.
</P>
<P>
	   Hsia's lawyer, meanwhile argues that the Los Angeles immigration consultant
is the victim of ``a smear job'' by federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The system breaks down'' because of people like Hsia, who ``time and time
again engaged in these schemes'' in the 1996 election campaign, prosecutor Eric
Yaffe told the U.S. District Court jury in opening statements on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In becoming ``a major player in the Democratic Party,'' Yaffe said, Hsia
tapped well-to-do business acquaintances secretly to reimburse straw donors and
conduits for cash who were falsely listed in federal election records as
contributors.
</P>
<P>
	   Hsia faces five felony counts of causing various Democratic campaign
treasurers unwittingly to file false reports with the Federal Election
Commission. Two charges deal with a 1995 Clinton-Gore fund-raiser in California,
two revolve around Democratic fund-raisers in Washington and at a Buddhist
temple in California, and the fifth deals with a fund-raiser at the same temple
for Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyer Nancy Luque said Hsia is a community activist who wanted
Asian-Americans to become part of the political process. ``Maria didn't ask any
person who made a contribution ... where they got money,'' said Luque. ``So
don't ask, don't tell.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The prosecutors want you to believe that her asking for contributions
caused someone six steps removed to lie,'' but ``Maria Hsia is not responsible
for what other people do,'' said Luque. ``Maria Hsia never lied.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yaffe said that for a fund-raiser at a Buddhist Temple in California
attended by Vice President Gore, Hsia handed an envelope with $100,000 in checks
to Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang, who will testify against Hsia.
</P>
<P>
	   The temple treasury was the source of many of the contributions, although
election records falsely listed individual people as the donors, said Yaffe.
</P>
<P>
	   Yaffe said the temple reimbursed Hsia for some of her own political
contributions. Luque denied that, saying that Hsia was simply being paid for
immigration-related work she did for the temple.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman dismissed the heart of the prosecution's
case in 1998, saying they used ``Alice-in-Wonderland'' logic to claim she was to
blame for false campaign filings.
</P>
<P>
	   An appeals court reinstated the charges. That court said, ``It is not
entirely clear what defects the district court found in the government's
theory.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court cleared the way for the trial last month by refusing to
hear Hsia's appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   As the Justice Department battled in court last year to bring the February
1998 indictment to trial, two Buddhist nuns who prosecutors regarded as crucial
to their case left the country to spend time with their religious order in
Taiwan. Bench warrants have been issued for their arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent court papers, prosecutors said that one of the missing nuns
``would typically receive a telephone call from defendant Hsia to obtain
political contributions, and ... on occasion, ... would provide the conduit
checks to defendant Hsia.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two missing nuns ``destroyed documents once the temple's activities were
discovered,'' the department said.

<HEADLINE> Lopez on Comb's Mind After Shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Rapper Sean "Puffy" Combs seemed more worried about his
girlfriend, actress Jennifer Lopez, than anyone else when police took them into
custody after a nightclub shooting, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
	   The papers were filed Monday in Manhattan's State Supreme Court, where Combs
pleaded innocent to gun possession charges stemming from his Dec. 27 arrest
after three people were shot at a nightclub near Times Square.
</P>
<P>
	   Police stopped Combs and Lopez in the rapper's 1999 Lincoln Navigator around
3 a.m., after it ran a red light about 10 blocks from the club. Police say that
they found a 9 mm handgun in the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
	   The court papers say that while going to the police precinct, Combs
"repeatedly, spontaneously, and not in response to questioning, asked officers
why Jennifer Lopez was being arrested."
</P>
<P>
	   The papers also say Combs asked officers "whether Ms. Lopez would be
released if anyone claimed ownership of the gun, and whether it was too late for
someone to claim ownership of the gun."
</P>
<P>
	   Lopez was released without being charged. She was not in court Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs refused comment after his arraignment.
</P>
<P>
	   Benjamin Brafman, one of Combs' lawyers, said his client is an innocent
victim of his own fame.
</P>
<P>
	   "Once you reach celebrity status, everything is blown out of proportion,"
Brafman said. "If Sean Combs were not who he is, this matter might have been
resolved at the precinct level."

<HEADLINE> PBS Film Studies 'The Greeks'  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Capturing the glory of ancient Greece is a tough job for
a documentary film. A pottery shard generally lacks the emotional wallop of a
Civil War photograph.
</P>
<P>
	   But "The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization" pulls off an Olympian task: It
turns the distant, dusty past into a story that carries the visual and dramatic
impact expected by modern viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   The PBS program, airing 8-10:30 p.m. EST Wednesday, is a benchmark for
pre-archival filmmaking, a lyrically cinematic work that draws on the latest
technology to bring the world's first democracy to life.
</P>
<P>
	   With actor Liam Neeson as effective narrator, "The Greeks" pulls us into a
time 2,500 years ago dominated by towering figures such as Socrates and
Pericles, graced by astounding architecture, art, drama -- and undermined by
empire-building and war.
</P>
<P>
	   "What was amazing was how this period, a very short period, could throw up
quite so many innovative people anywhere you look, in philosophy, medicine,
drama," said producer Anthony Geffen.
</P>
<P>
	   "I hope this puts the Greek world on the syllabus in America. This world is
all around in America, in buildings and in the way we think."
</P>
<P>
	   And in how we're governed. The miracle of democracy's birth is worth
considering, especially in a presidential election season in which U.S. citizens
can speak loudest (or not; in 1996, fewer than half of those eligible to vote
did).
</P>
<P>
	   Part of a series that is to include films on the Islamic, Napoleonic,
British and Roman empires, "The Greeks" took more than three years to produce
and drew on contributors that included production designers from "Saving Private
Ryan."
</P>
<P>
	   Scenes of battle and mob uprisings are deftly re-created with computer
imagery and creative camerawork. Even artifacts are vital; the cups believed to
have held Socrates' fatal dose of hemlock add resonance to scenes of the
philosopher's final moments.
</P>
<P>
	   And despite a lack of portraits or statues, the documentary manages to bring
us face to face with prominent Greeks of the 5th and 6th centuries B.C. who
serve as focal points for history.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleisthenes, credited with establishing the first Athenian democracy, and
Themistocles, the general who defeated the mighty Persian Empire with warships
called triremes, are among those portrayed by actors as living statues.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had to get into the audience's mind; you had to live with those
characters," said Geffen. The actors, selected by historians based on written
descriptions, represent just one of the film's innovations.
</P>
<P>
	   "We storyboarded it like a movie. We knew, shot by shot, everything we
wanted to try to achieve," said veteran filmmaker Geffen ("The Promised Land,"
"Jerusalem, City of Heaven"), who worked with writer-director Cassian Harrison.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wanted people to feel what it's like to be looking out across the bow of
a ship and see hundreds of triremes coming against you. I wanted the feeling of
what it would be like to have walked into the Parthenon and seen that 40-foot
statue of Athena."
</P>
<P>
	   To show the Parthenon complete with the golden goddess it once sheltered,
the filmmakers employed glass paintings, scale models, computer imagery -- and a
bit of luck. "There was a half-scale model of the inside of the Parthenon in
Nashville, of all places," Geffen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Like a good movie, the result is seamlessly entertaining.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a lot of complicated processes, but I don't think they look
complicated," Geffen said. "In other words, I don't think people will say 'Oh,
that's a special effect."'
</P>
<P>
	   "The Greeks," the first of the "Empires" series, is part of a mini-empire of
its own, with a companion book written by historian Paul Cartledge, a Web site
(www.pbs.org/empires/the greeks) that includes Greek language lessons, and a DVD
version with additional content.
</P>
<P>
	   The additional material allowed the film the freedom to be focused, Geffen
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the documentary has moved on and we don't have to make a 15-part
series. I don't think people want to sit through them," he said, since the
resources exist if viewers are hungry for more information.
</P>
<P>
	   "This film is not the CD-ROM of ancient Greeks. I hope people will continue
the journey on all the other mediums," Geffen said.

<HEADLINE> Long to Giuliani: Don't run for Senate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The leader of the New York Conservative Party says
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani fails on almost every issue that
conservatives hold dear.
<P>
	   "I think I would rather that he didn't run," Michael Long said during his
party's political action conference in Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Long also suggested that his party may field its own Senate candidate
against Giuliani and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Democrat, no matter
how damaging it might be to the Republican cause.
</P>
<P>
	   "Occasionally, conservatives have to take a tough stand," said Long, who
refused to say who his party is looking at as a possible candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by an almost 5-3
margin, no Republican has won statewide office in the past 25 years without the
Conservative Party's endorsement. Republican George Pataki beat then-Democratic
Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1994 on the strength of the Conservative Party vote.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Giuliani didn't back down. "Sure, we'd like to have the
endorsement," Giuliani spokeswoman Kim Serafin said. "However, the mayor will
not sacrifice principle for political expediency."
</P>
<P>
	   "The mayor does not and will not change his views for anybody," Giuliani
campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani, appearing on Buffalo's WBEN-AM radio this morning, said again that
he didn't know if he would make a formal announcement of his Senate candidacy.
But when asked if he was running, he said: "Looks that way right now. It feels
that way."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani dismissed Long's advice that he not run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think he can really stop me from running," the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you try to go lock-step in line with all these political parties, you
really lose your effectiveness as a leader. You also lose your effectiveness as
a senator," Giuliani added.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked whether he needed the backing of the Conservative Party to win, the
mayor said, "I need the backing of the people of New York, that's what I need to
win, not the backing of a particular party."
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, unlike most states, major party candidates can run on several
ballot lines and the votes for them on all lines are then added together to
determine the election winner.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has routinely run for mayor with Liberal Party backing. But Long
has said that the only way Giuliani could win Conservative Party backing in his
Senate bid would be to give up Liberal Party support and come out in favor of a
ban on what critics call partial-birth abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani, like Clinton, is an abortion rights supporter.
</P>
<P>
	   "If he refuses to evolve or be open-minded on the issue I believe more than
75 percent of the people of New York consider a horrific act and infanticide
then, in fact, he has to accept the responsibility of that decision," Long said.
</P>
<P>
	   Long said he hasn't even talked to the mayor since a brief conversation in
August when the mayor said he would get back in touch.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's wrong on domestic partners, he's wrong on gays in the military, he's
wrong on gay rights, he's wrong on rent control, he's wrong on ... we could just
go on and on and on," Long said. "The question would be what issues is he right
on. He's right on (school) vouchers and he's a good strong administrator. But
being a strong administrator doesn't make you a good United States senator."
</P>
<P>
	   Long said he was actively looking for someone to run for the Senate seat but
refused to slam the door completely on Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we can find the right candidates, you'll be the first to know about it
immediately," Long said. "And clearly I think we will blow this race wide open
and that's what our intentions are to do UNLESS someone comes to us and is
willing to give to us the commitment that they will fight for conservative
principles in the United States Senate."
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Congressman Rick Lazio was one of the names Long seemed
interested in. Lazio was prepared earlier in the year to run for Senate, but he
stepped aside at the behest of Republican Party leaders. He also spoke to the
Conservative meeting in Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   "If he made a phone call, we're ready to move," Long said.
</P>
<P>
	   Long also called on the Republican Party leadership to ask Giuliani not to
take the Liberal Party endorsement, saying it would damage the GOP's
relationship with the Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
	   "If this happens, I consider it a break in a relationship that has been
going on for 25 years, and clearly that would mean that they are allowing it,"
he said. "If they allow him to accept the Liberal Party endorsement statewide,
then in fact they are not serious about the things I think they believe in."

<HEADLINE> Federal budget contains New York goodies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Education and health care are cornerstones of Hillary
Rodham Clinton's newly official U.S. Senate campaign.
<P>
	   They also received hefty boosts in federal funding in President Clinton's
$1.84 trillion farewell budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's budget would increase spending by millions of dollars for
Head Start, after-school programs and school construction, all initiatives
embraced by the first lady. The president's plan would create more than 7,000
new Head Start slots in New York and would increase education spending by
millions of dollars largely through a class-size reduction initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's plan also contains a $10,000 college tuition tax credit at a
cost of $31 billion. The tuition tax break, popular with middle-class suburban
voters like those the first lady must woo in New York, was first put forward by
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-NY. The first lady has been pushing it lately on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
	   On the health front, the president's plan would spend $168 billion over 10
years to create a prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients.
Prescription coverage is another campaign theme of the first lady, who authored
the president's ill-fated health care reform plan.
</P>
<P>
	   But the president's spending plan isn't all good news for New York.
</P>
<P>
	   While Clinton in 1998 offered the federally owned Governors Island for sale
to New York state for $1, the asking price was upped to some $300 million in the
fiscal year 2001 plan the Clinton administration unveiled Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   But a letter from White House Budget Director Jack Lew to Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., indicated that the White House was willing to knock
that down to "nominal price" once a plan incorporating public use was finalized.
</P>
<P>
	   New York state and city have agreed on a plan to turn the 172-acre island
into a tourist center complete with a major hotel, a conference and commercial
center, an arts and cultural exhibit hall, a sports complex and open space for
public use. Located in the middle of New York Harbor, Governors Island has been
occupied only by migratory birds and a small caretakers staff since the U.S.
Coast Guard left in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has ordered the island sold for "fair market value" of $500 million
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, an analysis of the president's budget plan conducted by Schumer
and Rep. Nita Lowey, D-Westchester County, determined that it would bring in
hundreds of millions of dollars more for New York City than the GOP-led Congress
is currently spending.
</P>
<P>
	   "This plan makes it clear that the priorities of New Yorkers are the
priorities of the administration and the Democrats in Congress," Lowey said.
</P>
<P>
	   But some Republicans groused that the president's heavy-spending plan seemed
designed to boost his wife's Senate campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's targeting his tax proposals where he believes they can do her the most
good," said Rep. John Sweeney, R-Saratoga County.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Thomas Reynolds, a Republican from the Buffalo area, agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Clinton family is the most political family in America, so if there is
a way they could benefit from the budget they would," he said. "He's perfecting
his legacy as an indiscriminate big spender with this budget."
</P>
<P>
	   But Moynihan praised the president's discipline in paying down the debt.
</P>
<P>
	   "As I have said on numerous occasions, our first priority should be to pay
down the national debt," New York's senior senator said. "The president proposes
to do just that. Under his budget, the debt held by the public is eliminated by
2013."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the New York projects funded in the president's budget plan:
</P>
<P>
	   -$20 million to convert the James A. Farley Post Office into the new Penn
Station.
</P>
<P>
	   -$10 million for the East Side Access Project to connect the Long Island
Rail Road with the New York City subway's east side trains through Grand Central
Terminal.
</P>
<P>
	   -$10.3 million for Fort Drum Consolidated Soldier Support Center.
</P>
<P>
	   -$13.6 million for United States Military Academy at West Point for Cadet
Physical Development Center.
</P>
<P>
	   -$7 million to combat the Asian long-horned beetle, which has infested
thousands of trees in New York City.

<HEADLINE> Genetic Discrimination Ban Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to fears that advances in medical research
could be abused by employers and others, President Clinton is barring federal
agencies from discriminating against workers on the basis of genetic tests.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's decision, which congressional aides said he would implement in an
executive order today, echoes a bill sponsored by Sens. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. The bill, which is pending in Congress, would
prohibit employers from refusing to hire people at risk for health problems and
insurers from refusing to sell them coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Monday
that Clinton would announce his decision during a speech at the American
Association for the Advancement of Science. White House aides declined comment.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the order, Clinton was expected to voice his support for the
Daschle-Kennedy legislation, which would extend assurances against abuse of
genetic information to the general public -- a step that would require
congressional action.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the bill said they hoped Clinton's action on behalf of federal
workers would focus attention on the need to take similar steps to protect
private sector employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Advances in genetic testing soon will allow doctors to predict the medical
futures of their patients. That has raised concerns that such information could
be used against those who are likely to suffer from cancer, diabetes, heart
disease or other ailments.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has been speaking out on the issue for years. In his 1998 State of
the Union speech, he declared that ``we must see that science serves humanity,
not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any
American,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ranit Schmelzer, Daschle's spokeswoman, said the Senate minority leader long
has argued that ``as more information about people's future health becomes
available it becomes important to protect that information.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``People shouldn't be discriminated against in employment or in other areas
because of some genetic information that may be available on them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The order Clinton was signing would restrict federal agencies' abilities to
collect or use genetic information, the sources said, including family medical
histories. The order was limited to civilian employees of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Exceptions to such data collection would be allowed in cases in which
workers give written consent as part of a health care program monitoring their
medical conditions. Another exception would be granted for gathering information
to study workplace safety.

<HEADLINE> Sopranos Earns 4 Award Nominations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- "The Sopranos" dominated the dramatic TV category for
the Directors Guild of America awards on Monday, picking up four of the five
nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   The HBO show about a New Jersey crime family earned directing nods for
series creator David Chase for the pilot episode, Daniel Attias for the episode
"46 Long," Henry J. Bronchtein for "Nobody Knows Anything" and Allen Coulter for
"College."
</P>
<P>
	   It was the most nominations ever for a series in a single category. "ER"
earned three nominations for dramatic series directing and one for TV movie for
the two-hour pilot in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Director Thomas Schlamme took the fifth dramatic series nomination this year
for his pilot episode of "The West Wing" on NBC.
</P>
<P>
	   Schlamme also earned a nomination for comedy series directing for the "Small
Town" episode of "Sports Night." Other comedy directing nods went to James
Burrows for the "Will &AMP; Grace" episode "Yours, Mine, Ours"; Pamela Fryman for
the "Frasier" episode "The Flight Before Christmas"; Katy Garretson for the
"Frasier" episode "Dr. Nora"; and Victoria Hochberg for the "Sex in the City"

an episode of the "Late Show with David Letterman," Dennie A. Gordon for "Tracey
Takes On ... End of the World," Louis J. Horvitz for the Academy Awards
ceremony, Rob Marshall for "Annie" and Beth McCarthy Miller for the "Saturday
Night Live 25th Anniversary."
</P>
<P>
	   The 52nd annual DGA awards will be presented March 11 in Los Angeles.

	   "Concertos Nos. 1 and 2/Piano Quintet" (Sony Classical) -- Shostakovich
</P>
<P>
	   This recording of three works by Shostakovich includes liner notes that tout
him as the greatest composer of the 20th century, and the performances support
the argument.
</P>
<P>
	   For those who think of the Russian's music only as a somber, melancholy
reflection of his country's constant political and social turmoil, the piano
concertos will be jarring. They're filled with enthralling energy, exuberance
and even humor. With sudden stops and starts, the pieces sound like something
out of silent-movie theater, which is where Shostakovich once played piano. The
cinematic touch is such that the first movement of the second concerto is used
in the recent movie release, "Fantasia 2000."
</P>
<P>
	   Pianist Yefim Bronfman coaxes a full range of emotions from both concertos,
and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen, is in top
form.
</P>
<P>
	   The playfulness of the concertos is in contrast to a more intense, more
subdued, more characteristically Shostakovichian mood on the Piano Quintet. It's
beautiful, and beautifully played by Bronfman and the Juilliard String Quartet.

	   "Somewhere Near Paterson" (Signature Sounds) -- Richard Shindell
</P>
<P>
	   Ask a group of songwriters which other songwriters they admire and Richard
Shindell's name is likely to come up more than once. His songs are finely
crafted depictions of life, sung in the deep-timbred voice of someone who has
reflected deeply and clearly.
</P>
<P>
	   What keeps Shindell ahead of the pack of deep-thinking singer-songwriters
with acoustic guitars is his sharp and inventive writing, which hits a high on
"Somewhere Near Paterson."
</P>
<P>
	   The songs cover a diverse group of topics -- a Wall Street trader who wants
a prescription to keep him sharp, a refugee family pondering the nature of God
and the need for coats, a man preparing to commit suicide by storm.
</P>
<P>
	   The one cover, Buddy and Julie Miller's aching "My Love Will Follow You,"
stands out, along with the buoyant "Spring."
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, there's the brilliant "Transit," about a "murderous horde" of
commuters from New York City "hell-bent on Saturday" who are so busy giving each
other the finger and jockeying for position they don't even notice they've
missed their exits.

player and see how long it takes before someone asks, "Hey, who is this?"
</P>
<P>
	   Claude "Fiddler" Williams, who celebrates his 82nd birthday Feb. 22, cut his
teeth playing guitar and violin in jazz bands around Kansas City in the 1920s
and '30s. A brief stint with Count Basie was followed by work with a variety of
bands, mostly across the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
	   Anything age has taken away in fire, it has made up for in tone and
approach. Williams swings sweetly through 10 songs, backed by a the New Orleans
pianist Henry Butler and a group of New York musicians who support Williams with
empathy and style.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution uses neighbors to emphasize pause  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A police recruit who lived down the block from
Amadou Diallo claims the volley of gunfire that killed the West African
immigrant was broken by a pause lasting up to five seconds.
<P>
	   Testifying Monday at the trial of four police officers, the recruit, Thomas
Bell, became the third former neighbor of Diallo to describe hearing a brief
interruption in the shooting. The officers are accused of murdering Diallo last
year by firing 41 bullets into the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building at
12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The pause is significant because prosecutors could use it to argue that the
officers had a chance to realize Diallo was unarmed and stop firing.
</P>
<P>
	   Testimony resumed this morning as Dr. Joseph Cohen, the medical examiner who
performed the autopsy on the 22-year-old street vendor, described his findings.
</P>
<P>
	   "He had 19 gunshot wounds to his body," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said he found whole bullets and bullet fragments in Diallo's body and
clothes; that toxicological tests found no traces of drugs or alcohol in the
body; and that the young man was 5 foot 6 and 150 pounds.
</P>
<P>
	   In the previous day's testimony, Bell, 28, told jurors that on the morning
of the shooting he was on the telephone with a cousin when gunfire erupted up
the block from his apartment. The witness said he heard four to five shots,
followed by a three-to-five-second pause, then a longer, final volley from
several guns - a sequence he tapped out on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys attacked Bell's credibility, suggesting he lived too far
away from the scene to be reliable. But the witness stuck to his story.
</P>
<P>
	   "A pause is a pause, sir," he told an attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28, Sean Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy,
27, have pleaded innocent to the second-degree murder charges. If convicted,
they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying of the unarmed black man by the four white officers produced a
wave of pretrial publicity and protests alleging widespread abuse of minorities
by police. In response, an appeals court moved the case to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege the plainclothes officers made a "conscious decision" to
shoot Diallo without warning; 19 bullets struck the victim. Defense attorneys
argue the shooting was a tragic mistake made after the victim ignored orders to
stop and pulled out a black wallet that appeared to be a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Monday, another Diallo neighbor, Ida Vincent, claimed that, moments
after the shooting, she overheard a man make a suspicious remark outside her
window.
</P>
<P>
	   "OK. OK. We're just going to say this," Vincent quoted the man as saying in
testimony the defense had sought to keep out.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Vincent took the stand, State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi
barred prosecutors from asking about the fragment of conversation because
Vincent didn't know who said it. Defense attorney John Patten had complained
that the young housewife's account would leave the false impression that police
"were somehow concocting a story."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, when Vincent began to testify about it, the defense objected. But the
judge overruled, saying the defense itself had "opened the door" by
cross-examining Vincent about another part of the same conversation - someone
cursing.
</P>
<P>
	   Vincent also testified that she had heard a pause in the gunfire.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 100.05; Nasdaq Rises  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened sharply higher today after the government
reported that workers' productivity surged at the close of 1999, suggesting that
the economy can continue to grow without giving rise to inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 100.05 at 11,005.84.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 16.55 at 1,439.55, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 72.89 at
4,394.66, pushing past its record of 4,321.77 set yesterday.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose after the Labor Department said productivity -- defined as the
amount of output for each hour of work -- rose at a 5 percent annual rate in the
fourth quarter, the strongest showing since the last three months of 1992
</P>
<P>
	   The report surpassed analysts' expectations and reassured many investors
that inflation remains under wraps. Stocks have been pressured so far this year
by worries that the Federal Reserve will sharply raise interest rates to keep
inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
	   While most economists see little evidence of actual inflation, four rate
increases since last June have done little to slow the growth of the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue-chip stocks, which have been under heavy pressure from investors who
fear that higher interest rates will cut into corporate profits, rebounded
sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial services stocks fared best. American Express rose 2 7/16 to 164
7/8 and J.P. Morgan rose 2 1/2 to 121 3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 12-to-7 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 149.29 million shares.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.00 to 538.39.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.4 percent. European indexes
were sharply higher, lending strength to Wall Street. Germany's Xetra DAX index

was up 2.9 percent in afternoon trading.

<HEADLINE> Debate Starts on Clinton Budget  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was so proud of what his final budget
would do about eliminating the publicly held part of the national debt that he
used a paint brush to draw a plunging blue line on a wall chart.
</P>
<P>
	   Angry Republicans, however, probably would have chosen the color red for
Clinton's last budget -- for the shame they charge he should feel about all his
new spending programs, his tax increases and his modest tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president proposed a laundry list of expensive, big-government
programs the country doesn't need and tax increases the Republicans in Congress
will never support,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides in the debate wasted no time in staking out their positions for a
debate that is certain to last all the way into November, when voters go to the
polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans contend that what voters want is less government and bigger tax
increases. Clinton argues that what the country needs to keep the current
prosperity going is a more balanced approach that addresses pressing needs such
as a lack of health care, pays down the federal debt and offers targeted tax
relief.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton administration officials faced skeptical Republican lawmakers today
as they fanned out on Capitol Hill to defend the president's budget. Jacob Lew,
head of the president's Office of Management and Budget, told the House Budget
Committee today that the administration had put together a balanced spending
plan that would meet the nation's priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president has recognized the need to maintain the fiscal discipline
that has brought us not only unprecedented budgetary progress, but also the
strongest economy in memory,'' Lew told the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   In releasing the budget on Monday, Clinton said it was important that the
nation seize the current good times and bulging government surpluses to ``make
the most of this moment of promise to extend prosperity to all corners of our
nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's $1.84 trillion spending plan for the 2001 budget year, beginning
in October, would spend more for the environment, schools and gun-law
enforcement while still pledging to take steps to erase the $3.7 trillion
publicly held portion of the national debt by 2013.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also proposed a major expansion in the Earned Income Tax Credit that
helps the working poor, called for the government to provide health insurance
for 5 million of the 44 million Americans who do not have it and help the
elderly pay for drug prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans charged all the new spending programs were an effort to appeal
to voters in hopes they will reward Democratic candidates in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has all the things for everyone they feel they'll need to get Al Gore
elected president,'' House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kasich and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., told
reporters that their committees would move quickly to draw up a GOP spending and
tax blueprint that would differ drastically from Clinton's version.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before that work is accomplished, House Republicans were moving to
consider this week a 10-year, $182 billion plan to cut taxes for married
couples, including those who pay more than if they were single. This is just one
piece of their much larger $792 billion tax cut that Clinton vetoed last year.
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast, Clinton's budget would provide $351 million in more targeted
tax relief to help pay the costs of college education, ease the burden of
long-term nursing care and support retirement savings.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton also would raise $181 billion in other taxes, including a
25-cent-a-pack increase in cigarette taxes and $91 billion in higher taxes on
corporations by eliminating current tax benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, signaled the GOP would
``strongly oppose'' all of Clinton's tax increase proposals again this year.
</P>
<P>
	   But even with the tough-sounding words, both sides may find ways to
compromise, if for no other reason so they can avoid a drawn-out budget fight
right before the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Domenici and Kasich said they believed common ground could be found with the
administration on a reduction in the marriage tax penalty and possibly on a
program to offer the elderly help in paying for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides already have pledged to use two-thirds of the projected
surpluses, the amount generated by Social Security, to pay down the $5.7
trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   It is over the other one-third of the surplus, which Clinton says will
amount to $746 billion but the GOP believes is much larger, that the hardest
battles will be waged.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Senate Finance Committee William Roth, R-Del., sounded an optimistic
note, saying, ``I hope we can build on common ground and not miss the
opportunities before us.''

<HEADLINE> Genetic Discrimination Ban Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to fears that advances in medical research
could be abused by employers and others, President Clinton is barring federal
agencies from discriminating against their employees on the basis of genetic
tests.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's decision was being implemented in an executive order today. It
echoes legislation sponsored by Sens. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   The bills would prohibit all employers from refusing to hire people at risk
for health problems and insurers from refusing to sell them coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House said Clinton would announce his order during a speech at the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the order, Clinton was expected to voice his support for the
pending bills, which would extend assurances against abuse of genetic
information to the general public -- a step that would require congressional
action.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the bills said they hoped Clinton's action on behalf of
federal workers would focus attention on the need to take similar steps to
protect private-sector employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Advances in genetic testing soon will allow doctors to predict the medical
futures of their patients. That has raised concerns that such information could
be used against those who are likely to suffer from cancer, diabetes, heart
disease or other ailments.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was being joined by Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National
Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health, and Dr.
Shirley Malcolm, head of the directorate for education and human resources
programs at the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has been speaking out on the issue for years. In his 1998 State of
the Union speech, he declared that ``we must see that science serves humanity,
not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any
American,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ranit Schmelzer, Daschle's spokeswoman, said the Senate minority leader long
has argued that ``as more information about people's future health becomes
available it becomes important to protect that information.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``People shouldn't be discriminated against in employment or in other areas
because of some genetic information that may be available on them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's order prohibits federal employers from requiring or requesting
genetic tests as a condition of being hired or receiving benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Further, federal employers would not be allowed to deny employees promotions
or overseas posts because of a genetic predisposition for certain illness.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the order, obtaining or disclosing genetic information about employees
or potential employees is banned, except when necessary to provide medical
treatment to employees, insure workplace health and safety or provide occupation
and health researchers access to data.

<HEADLINE> Leak Caused Missile Defense Problem  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A coolant leak that rendered a missile interceptor
essentially blind at the last moment is being blamed for last month's failed
test of the Pentagon's experimental missile defense system, Pentagon officials
said today.
</P>
<P>
	   The setback is likely to mean a delay in the next interceptor test, which
had been scheduled for April. An official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said today the next test probably will be pushed back to May.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon officials were meeting today with officials from Raytheon Corp.,
manufacturer of the interceptor, to discuss when the next test should take
place.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can confirm there was a nitrogen leak and it undoubtedly was a factor''
in the interceptor's failure to hit its target, the official said. ``We can't
say conclusively, though, that it was the only factor.''
</P>
<P>
	   For all but the last six seconds of the interceptor's approximately
eight-minute flight from a U.S. Army range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific,
the indications were that the interceptor would hit its target, Pentagon
officials said last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Nitrogen gas used to refrigerate the interceptor's heat-seeking sensors
leaked from a small metal tube, causing the sensors to fail and preventing the
interceptor from ``seeing'' the target well enough to steer itself into the
dummy warhead's path, two Pentagon officials said. Both spoke on condition they
not be identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of the failure were first reported in today's editions of the
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials said that aside from the leak, almost everything else went
right during the Jan. 18 test, including first-time use of satellites and
ground-based tracking radar to guide the interceptor.
</P>
<P>
	   The system is designed to shoot down a small number of ballistic missiles of
the type being developed by North Korea and Iran. The Clinton administration
estimates that building the missile defense system will cost $12.7
billion.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Vet Receives Medal of Honor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After more than 30 years, Alfred Rascon is finally
receiving the nation's highest military honor for risking his own life to save
three others during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
	   Rascon, of Laurel, Md., was receiving the Medal of Honor from President
Clinton today during a ceremony at the White House. The ceremony officially
closes a decades-old battle to award the distinction for the heroics that
Rascon, then a 21-year-old Army medic, performed on March 16, 1966.
</P>
<P>
	   That day, Rascon's platoon came under attack in a Vietnamese jungle. Rascon
ran past flying bullets to reach a fallen comrade. He was shot in the hip and
suffered several shrapnel wounds; a grenade exploded in his face.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Rascon dragged his colleague to safety and, despite his wounds, went
out again to deliver ammunition to a machine gunner. He then covered two badly
wounded soldiers with his body, absorbing grenade blasts and saving both their
lives.
</P>
<P>
	   Rascon was honorably discharged from active duty later in 1966 and placed in
the Army reserves. He was recommended for the Medal of Honor, but necessary
paperwork and witness statements were lost.
</P>
<P>
	   Rascon went on to graduate from college and the Army's Infantry Officers
Candidate School. A native of Chihuahua, Mexico, Rascon became a naturalized
American citizen in 1967. He returned to Vietnam for a second tour in the 1970s,
this time as a military adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   Rascon, a civil servant since 1983, is inspector general of the Selective
Service System in Arlington, Va.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 64.22; Nasdaq Up 61.72  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today after the government reported that
workers' productivity surged at the close of 1999, suggesting that the economy
can continue to grow without giving rise to inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
64.22 at 10,970.01.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 14.04 at 1,437.04, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 61.72 at
4,383.49, pushing past its record of 4,321.77 set Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks benefited from the Labor Department's report today that productivity
-- defined as the amount of output for each hour of work -- rose at a 5 percent
annual rate in the fourth quarter, the strongest showing since the last three
months of 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The report surpassed analysts' expectations and reassured many investors
that inflation remains under wraps. Stocks have been pressured so far this year
by worries that the Federal Reserve will sharply raise interest rates to keep
inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
	   While most economists see little evidence of actual inflation, four rate
increases since last June have done little to slow the growth of the U.S.
economy. Analysts said today's report indicated that while the Fed may continue
raising rates at its next meeting, an increase sharp enough to derail stocks
isn't likely.
</P>
<P>
	   "This report will probably not prevent the Fed from tightening on March 21,
but it will keep them on the course of gradualism and caution," said David Orr,
chief economist at First Union Securities Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue-chip stocks, which have been under heavy pressure from investors who
fear that higher interest rates will cut into corporate profits, rebounded
sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial services stocks fared best. American Express rose 1 3/4 to 164
3/16 and J.P. Morgan rose 2 1/16 to 120 15/16.
</P>
<P>
	   The most widely held technology stocks were also higher. IBM rose 3 1/8 to
117 1/8 and Microsoft gained 2 5/16 to 108 15/16.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Amazon.com rose 5 5/16 to 80 5/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 334.86 million shares, compared with 294.42
at the same time Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.31 to 536.70.

<HEADLINE> Officers go on trial for conspiracy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A defense lawyer today hammered at lies, contradictions
and inconsistencies in Abner Louima's story as he sought to prove that former
police officer Charles Schwarz was not a participant in the station house
assault on him.
<P>
	   In particular, attorney Ronald Fischetti grilled the Haitian immigrant on
his famous utterance that cops had said, at the time of his 1997 arrest, that it
was "Giuliani time" in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Louima acknowledged again, on his second day on the witness stand, that he
testified to that under oath several times before admitting a family adviser had
told him to say it to the press, the FBI and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   "You knew it was perjury, but you've never been charged?" asked Fischetti.
</P>
<P>
	   "No, sir," Louima said.
</P>
<P>
	   The alleged "Giuliani time" comment spurred street demonstrations and other
public reaction to the implication that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had given police
a free hand to abuse people of color.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischetti also pressured Louima to admit that he never paid income taxes on
$10,000 he earned as a used car salesman in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is there any doubt that the law requires you to pay taxes?" asked the
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes, sir," replied Louima, apparently not understanding the question.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz and two other cops are accused in Brooklyn federal court of
conspiring to conceal Schwarz's role in the August 1997 attack on Louima, who
was sodomized by another officer with a broomstick after his arrest on minor
charges at a street disturbance in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
	   By impugning Louima's credibility, Fischetti hoped to undercut his claim
that Schwarz was the second officer in the 70th Precinct bathroom during the
assault by then-Officer Justin Volpe.
</P>
<P>
	   During a trial last year, Volpe pleaded guilty of violating Louima's civil
rights and is serving 30 years. Schwarz is appealing his conviction last year on
the same charge.
</P>
<P>
	   In Monday's opening, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad said Schwarz, 35,
Thomas Wiese, 37, and Thomas Bruder, 34, had told "lie after lie after lie" to
protect Schwarz from criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
	   "This case is about a search for the truth as to what Charles Schwarz did
and the efforts of these three defendants to keep the truth from coming out,"
Vinegrad told the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Vinegrad promised to prove Schwarz held Louima down as Volpe rammed the
broomstick into his rectum, causing internal injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyers contend that Schwarz was not involved. They say the only
other person present, besides Volpe, was Wiese, Schwarz's partner, who entered a
station house bathroom as the assault was taking place but did not participate
or interfere.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischetti said he would subpoena Volpe from prison to testify that Schwarz
was not involved in the attack and Schwarz himself would deny it under oath.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, Wiese and Bruder are charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice by
covering up Schwarz's role in the attack. The charge carries a penalty of up to
five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Under questioning by Vinegrad, Louima said two officers were in the bathroom
when he "heard the door open and close but did not see anyone" as he lay
crouched on the floor.
</P>
<P>
	   That suggestion - that a third person had entered the room during the
incident - was not mentioned in the earlier trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Louima has never identified the second officer in the attack, other than to
say it was the same one who drove him to the station, took away his property and
escorted him to the bathroom. It is undisputed that Schwarz was the driver, but
even Louima has said that the two officers - Schwarz and Wiese - look very much
alike.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph Tacopina, the attorney for Wiese, said his client was the first to
break the blue wall of silence - the mutual protection shield of police officers
- by going to the authorities.

said today the next test probably will be pushed back to May.
</P>
<P>
	   But Defense Secretary William Cohen, testifying before the Senate Armed
Services Committee on the Pentagon's fiscal 2001 budget request, said that
despite the malfunction, ``I believe we are on track.'' Cohen said the failure
``resulted in the last five or six seconds of the flight.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said that President Clinton will be ready to make a decision this
summer, as scheduled, on whether to commit to actually deploying such a system.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Medical examiner says Diallo hit while on the ground  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Amadou Diallo was shot several times while falling
down and lying on the ground, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy
testified today.
<P>
	   In tracing the path of the bullets, Dr. Joseph Cohen testified that one of
the bullets went through the bottom of Diallo's right shoe and came out of his
toe. "The entrance is on the undersurface of his shoe and it passes upward
through his toe," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said that another wound, on Diallo's right leg, was definitely fired
while he was lying on the ground. The wound "is in my opinion is a wound that
was inflicted when he was necessarily down."
</P>
<P>
	   In describing yet another wound, this one to Diallo's left leg, Cohen noted
the "strikingly upward trajectory of the bullet." That means the bullet traveled
from lower leg to the upper part, suggesting that Diallo was lying down or
falling backwards when the bullet was fired.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen also described a wound to the chest that hit Diallo's aorta, the main
vessel carrying blood to the heart. Because there was very little bleeding from
other wounds, Cohen believes the aortic wound was "inflicted early in the
sequence," causing most of the blood loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Another early shot, Cohen asserted, paralyzed Diallo by going through his
spine and causing him to fall.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are any number of wounds that could have been inflicted while he was
going down," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, Cohen said, Diallo "had 19 gunshot wounds to his body."
</P>
<P>
	   The pathologist said that he found whole bullets and bullet fragments in
Diallo's body and clothes; that toxicological tests found no traces of drugs or
alcohol in the body; and that the young man was 5 foot 6 and 150 pounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen's testimony came a day after a police recruit who lived down the block
from Diallo claimed the volley of gunfire that killed the West African immigrant
was broken by a pause lasting up to five seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Testifying Monday at the trial of four police officers, the recruit, Thomas
Bell, became the third former neighbor of Diallo to describe hearing a brief
interruption in the shooting. The officers are accused of murdering Diallo last
year by firing 41 bullets into the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building at
12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The pause is significant because prosecutors could use it to argue that the
officers had a chance to realize Diallo was unarmed and stop firing.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell, 28, told jurors that on the morning of the shooting he was on the
telephone with a cousin when gunfire erupted up the block from his apartment.
The witness said he heard four to five shots, followed by a three-to-five-second
pause, then a longer, final volley from several guns - a sequence he tapped out
on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys attacked Bell's credibility, suggesting he lived too far
away from the scene to be reliable. But the witness stuck to his story.
</P>
<P>
	   "A pause is a pause, sir," he told an attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28, Sean Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy,
27, have pleaded innocent to the second-degree murder charges. If convicted,
they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying of the unarmed black man by the four white officers produced a
wave of pretrial publicity and protests alleging widespread abuse of minorities
by police. In response, an appeals court moved the case to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege the plainclothes officers made a "conscious decision" to
shoot Diallo without warning; 19 bullets struck the victim. Defense attorneys
argue the shooting was a tragic mistake made after the victim ignored orders to
stop and pulled out a black wallet that appeared to be a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Monday, another Diallo neighbor, Ida Vincent, claimed that, moments
after the shooting, she overheard a man make a suspicious remark outside her
window.
</P>
<P>
	   "OK. OK. We're just going to say this," Vincent quoted the man as saying in
testimony the defense had sought to keep out.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Vincent took the stand, State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi
barred prosecutors from asking about the fragment of conversation because
Vincent didn't know who said it. Defense attorney John Patten had complained
that the young housewife's account would leave the false impression that police
"were somehow concocting a story."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, when Vincent began to testify about it, the defense objected. But the
judge overruled, saying the defense itself had "opened the door" by
cross-examining Vincent about another part of the same conversation - someone
cursing.
</P>
<P>
	   Vincent also testified that she had heard a pause in the gunfire.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was so proud of what his final budget
would do about eliminating the publicly held part of the national debt that he
used a paint brush to draw a plunging blue line on a wall chart.
</P>
<P>
	   Angry Republicans, however, probably would have chosen the color red for
Clinton's last budget -- for the shame they charge he should feel about all his
new spending programs, his tax increases and his modest tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president proposed a laundry list of expensive, big-government
programs the country doesn't need and tax increases the Republicans in Congress
will never support,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides in the debate wasted no time in staking out their positions for a
debate that is certain to last all the way into November, when voters go to the
polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans contend that what voters want is less government and bigger tax
increases. Clinton argues that what the country needs to keep the current
prosperity going is a more balanced approach that addresses pressing needs such
as a lack of health care, pays down the federal debt and offers targeted tax
relief.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton administration officials faced skeptical Republican lawmakers today
as they fanned out on Capitol Hill to defend the president's budget. Jacob Lew,
head of the president's Office of Management and Budget, told the House Budget
Committee today that the administration had put together a balanced spending
plan that would meet the nation's priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president has recognized the need to maintain the fiscal discipline
that has brought us not only unprecedented budgetary progress, but also the
strongest economy in memory,'' Lew told the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Senate Finance Committee, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said
Republicans should not assume that rosy surplus projections will materialize to
pay for large, irreversible tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a new economy, but it makes old virtues all the more important,''
Summers said. ``Those virtues are savings and prudence.''
</P>
<P>
	   The panel's chairman, Sen. William Roth, R-Del., argued that the
administration's refusal to consider tax cuts prior to larger overhauls of
Social Security and Medicare amounted to ``moving the goal posts after the
kickoff.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``In effect, you're sort of ruling out a tax cut,'' Roth said. ``You're sort
of laying down conditions that you have to recognize are not going to be
realized.''
</P>
<P>
	   In releasing the budget Monday, Clinton said it was important that the
nation seize the current good times and bulging government surpluses to ``make
the most of this moment of promise to extend prosperity to all corners of our
nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's $1.84 trillion spending plan for the 2001 budget year, beginning
in October, would spend more for the environment, schools and gun-law
enforcement while still pledging to take steps to erase the $3.7 trillion
publicly held portion of the national debt by 2013.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also proposed a major expansion in the Earned Income Tax Credit that
helps the working poor, called for the government to provide health insurance
for 5 million of the 44 million Americans who do not have it and help the
elderly pay for drug prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans charged all the new spending programs were an effort to appeal
to voters in hopes they will reward Democratic candidates in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has all the things for everyone they feel they'll need to get Al Gore
elected president,'' House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kasich and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., told
reporters that their committees would move quickly to draw up a GOP spending and
tax blueprint that would differ drastically from Clinton's version.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before that work is accomplished, House Republicans were moving to
consider this week a 10-year, $182 billion plan to cut taxes for married
couples, including those who pay more than if they were single. This is just one
piece of their much larger $792 billion tax cut that Clinton vetoed last year.
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast, Clinton's budget would provide $351 million in more targeted
tax relief to help pay the costs of college education, ease the burden of
long-term nursing care and support retirement savings.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton also would raise $181 billion in other taxes, including a
25-cent-a-pack increase in cigarette taxes and $91 billion in higher taxes on
corporations by eliminating current tax benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, signaled the GOP would
``strongly oppose'' all of Clinton's tax increase proposals again this year.
</P>
<P>
	   But even with the tough-sounding words, both sides may find ways to
compromise, if for no other reason so they can avoid a drawn-out budget fight
right before the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Domenici and Kasich said they believed common ground could be found with the
administration on a reduction in the marriage tax penalty and possibly on a
program to offer the elderly help in paying for prescription drugs.

<HEADLINE> MDs Say Smoking Is Drug Dependence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- Smoking should be viewed as a drug dependence "second to no
other," according to a report released Tuesday by a doctors' group which labeled
nicotine as addictive as heroin or cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   The report by the tobacco advisory group of the Royal College of Physicians
called for an aggressive campaign and a huge financial commitment from the
government to help people give up cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
	   It said cigarettes should be regulated just as other drugs are by a body
with the power to restrict the number of additives and amount of nicotine in
them.
</P>
<P>
	   The state National Health Service also should foot the bill for nicotine
replacement therapies such as gum and patches for smokers who want to quit, and
manufacturers should be barred from using the words "light" or "mild" on low-tar
cigarettes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The central conclusion of this report is that cigarette smoking should be
understood as a manifestation of nicotine addiction, and that the extent to
which smokers are addicted to nicotine is comparable with addiction to 'hard'
drugs such as heroin or cocaine," it said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This conclusion has fundamental implications for the design and
implementation of public health policy on the control and prevention of
cigarette smoking."
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Party government already has launched a major anti-smoking
initiative after the publication last year of a policy paper called "Smoking
Kills."
</P>
<P>
	   Its goal is to reduce the number of percentage of Britons who smoke from 28
percent in 1996 to 26 percent by 2005 and 24 percent by 2010.
</P>
<P>
	   The Royal College of Physicians' report said one in five deaths in Britain
is caused by smoking, and called for the establishment of an independent
committee of experts to examine the options for nicotine regulation and report
their findings to the government.
</P>
<P>
	   John Carlisle, the spokesman for the Tobacco Manufacturers Association,
criticized the report, characterizing the connection between tobacco and hard
drugs as "misplaced."
</P>
<P>
	   "Some 12 million poeple have given up smoking in the last 20 years,"
Carlisle said. "Unlike hard drugs, thousands take up the habit and give up the
habit each day, and they don't have to beat up old ladies to finance it."
</P>
<P>
	   "Essentially, this is not a new report," he said. "There's no new scientific
evidence. It's merely a collection of existing research, which has been about
for some time."
</P>
<P>
	   But Clive Bates, director of the anti-smoking group Action on Smoking and
Health, applauded the report's conclusions, saying, "The fact that they are
legal is irrelevant -- cigarettes are hard drugs by any physical or medical
definition."

<HEADLINE> Genetic Discrimination Ban Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to fears that advances in medical research
could be abused by employers and others, President Clinton is barring federal
agencies from discriminating against their employees on the basis of genetic
tests.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's decision was being implemented in an executive order today. It is
based on legislation sponsored by Sens. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   The bills would prohibit all employers from refusing to hire people at risk
for health problems and insurers from refusing to sell them coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House said Clinton would announce his order during a speech at the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the order, Clinton was expected to voice his support for the
pending bills. Supporters said they hoped Clinton's action on behalf of federal
workers would focus attention on the need to take similar steps to protect
private-sector employees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it sends a powerful message to the private sector about how
they'll need to deal with the advances in science,'' White House press secretary
Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   Advances in genetic testing soon will allow doctors to predict the medical
futures of their patients. That has raised concerns that such information could
be used against those who are likely to suffer from cancer, diabetes, heart
disease or other ailments.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was being joined by Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National
Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health, and Dr.
Shirley Malcolm, head of the directorate for education and human resources
programs at the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has been speaking out on the issue for years. In his 1998 State of
the Union speech, he declared that ``we must see that science serves humanity,
not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any
American,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ranit Schmelzer, Daschle's spokeswoman, said the Senate minority leader long
has argued that ``as more information about people's future health becomes
available it becomes important to protect that information.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``People shouldn't be discriminated against in employment or in other areas
because of some genetic information that may be available on them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's order prohibits federal employers from requiring or requesting
genetic tests as a condition of being hired or receiving benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Further, federal employers would not be allowed to deny employees promotions
or overseas posts because of a genetic predisposition for certain illness.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the order, obtaining or disclosing genetic information about employees
or potential employees is banned, except when necessary to provide medical
treatment to employees, insure workplace health and safety or provide occupation
and health researchers access to data.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 86.56; Nasdaq Up 59.06  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today after the government reported that
workers' productivity surged at the close of 1999, suggesting that the economy
can continue to grow without giving rise to inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
86.56 at 10,992.35.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 13.44 at 1,436.44, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 59.06 at
4,380.83, pushing past its record of 4,321.77 set Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks benefited from the Labor Department's report today that productivity
-- defined as the amount of output for each hour of work -- rose at a 5 percent
annual rate in the fourth quarter, the strongest showing since the last three
months of 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The report surpassed analysts' expectations and reassured many investors
that inflation remains under wraps. Stocks have been pressured so far this year
by worries that the Federal Reserve will sharply raise interest rates to keep
inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
	   While most economists see little evidence of actual inflation, four rate
increases since last June have done little to slow the growth of the U.S.
economy. Analysts said today's report indicated that while the Fed may continue
raising rates at its next meeting, an increase sharp enough to derail stocks
isn't likely.
</P>
<P>
	   "This report will probably not prevent the Fed from tightening on March 21,
but it will keep them on the course of gradualism and caution," said David Orr,
chief economist at First Union Securities Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue-chip stocks, which have been under heavy pressure from investors who
fear that higher interest rates will cut into corporate profits, rebounded
sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial services stocks fared best. American Express rose 2 3/16 to 164
5/8 and J.P. Morgan rose 2 7/8 to 121 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   The most widely held technology stocks were also higher. IBM rose 2 7/8 to
116 7/8 and Microsoft gained 2 3/8 to 109.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Amazon.com rose 5 5/8 to 80 5/8. A potential rival, online
retailer Buy.com Inc., rose in its initial public offering of stock. Shares were
priced at 13, opened at 30 1/8 and were trading at 27 9/16. Buy.com bills itself
as an Internet superstore, providing a wide range of products after originally
concentrating on computers.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 481.32 million shares, compared with 419.06
at the same time Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.38 to 535.77.

<HEADLINE> Small town with utopian history fighting over development  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROOSEVELT, N.J. (AP) - The first big quarrel in this small borough was
over whether it should even exist. That issue was won by no less than Albert
Einstein.
<P>
	   The scientist came down from his Princeton home in 1936 to debate a union
leader about whether President Franklin D. Roosevelt's proposal to create a
self-sustaining, utopian farming community was a good one.
</P>
<P>
	   He won the debate, and so was born Jersey Homesteads, named later after the
president who founded it.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 60 years later, Roosevelt's 900 or so residents have morphed from
Jewish farmers into an eclectic group of artists, intellectuals and
environmentalists who still pride themselves on being fighters.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're very active and very vocal about our feelings," says Mayor Michael
Hamilton. "Most of the time we're able to still wave at each other on the
streets and say hello to each other in the post office."
</P>
<P>
	   That might explain why the battle raging in Roosevelt these days has been
more intense than most. A developer wants to build hundreds of new retirement
community homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have been called in to break up Council meetings. A mayor who
supported development was voted out of office. And after losing preliminary
approval to build 65 homes, one developer said he would never return, calling
his dealings with the town "a very, very, brutal, frustrating and bitter
experience."
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of new housing say it will help ease a tax burden in this borough
of flat-roofed homes shielded from strip malls by cornfields. The town has no
major businesses and one of the state's highest property tax rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Roosevelt also has virtually no crime, a town center with nothing but a post
office, a deli and an elementary school of about 80 students. Opponents of
development say the housing will double the town's population and destroy the
community atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
	   Roosevelt has places on the National and New Jersey Register of Historic
Places for its Bauhaus-style homes, its wetlands and history as one of about 100
communities in the nation created as planned farming communities during the New
Deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The government built Jersey Homesteads specifically for Jewish garment
workers more than 50 miles away in New York City. The workers were paid $500
each to move there and run both a farm and a clothing factory.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor leaders opposed it because it was nonunion, but Einstein and others
called it a social utopia that gave city workers a chance for suburban life.
</P>
<P>
	   The utopia failed around World War II, however, because the garment workers
had little farming skill. The government sold the homes to the workers and to a
group of liberal artists and intellectuals who found the town's history
intriguing.
</P>
<P>
	   The town managed the next half-century to remain relatively untouched by the
suburban growth surrounding it. About 15 new homes were built on the dozen
streets that make up the town, students learned in classes of 10 and residents
walked a few blocks to hike in the woods.
</P>
<P>
	   Town officials, however, wrote ordinances in the past few years that made
available large parcels for land for residential development. A former mayor,
Bert Ellentuck, said taxes from new homes would help shore up a 60-year-old
infrastructure that includes a failing sewer plant and roads in need of repair.
</P>
<P>
	   The zoning ordinances brought Matzel &AMP; Mumford of Hazlet in 1998 to the town
with a proposal for 65 homes in a cornfield surrounded by woods, a few homes and
the town cemetery.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents objected to the number of houses and said the developers' plan
wouldn't protect an environment of sweetgum and beech trees, rare ferns and the
endangered wood turtle.
</P>
<P>
	   "They thought they could put one over on a little town," said Rod Tulloss, a
biologist who is leading an effort to seek state and private grants to buy up
acres of undeveloped land in town.
</P>
<P>
	   Tulloss and others said the developers monopolized hearings with their own
witnesses and tried to push through a project that would force the town to
provide more services.
</P>
<P>
	   "They missed a tremendous opportunity to solve some fiscal problems for the
town," said Roy DeBoer, the company's project manager. He said in 20 years, he
had never had a worse experience with a project. Witnesses were cross-examined
for days on "garbage minutia," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Planning Board rejected Matzel &AMP; Mumford's preliminary application
because the hearings hadn't allowed time for opposing witnesses, but welcomed
the company to apply again. DeBoer said it wouldn't return.
</P>
<P>
	   Another developer, U.S. Home in Freehold, is in discussions to build 350
homes on a wheatfield off the town's main road. Town officials recently asked
for a proposal with slightly fewer homes.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're really like a family," Hamilton said. If developers like U.S. Home
are allowed to come in, "just for the sake of lowering taxes, we'll develop
every parcel in town that's open space.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll double the size of the town overnight."

<HEADLINE> Congress Examines Big Bank Failures  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers are examining two big bank failures that
involved fraud and cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. nearly $1 billion.
They also are looking over a recent nationwide increase in risky loans to people
with poor credit histories.
</P>
<P>
	   The two recent failures -- of First National Bank of Keystone, based in
Keystone, W.Va., and BestBank of Boulder, Colo. -- involved fraud and
contributed to last year's biggest annual loss to the FDIC's insurance fund
since the regional bank crises of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Seldom is a wake-up call as loud and clear as the one emanating from the
tiny town of Keystone, West Virginia,'' Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the
House Banking Committee, said at a hearing today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly, the risks illuminated by Keystone and several of the other recent
failures demand, the full, coordinated and timely attention of the federal bank
and thrift regulators, particularly before the industry faces any future
economic downturn,'' Leach said.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators and lawmakers are concerned about the eight U.S. bank failures
last year, which occurred amid a booming economy. Compounding the worry, the
FDIC is predicting that as many as 20 banks could go under this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, on Jan. 14, Iowa's banking superintendent closed the
Hartford-Carlisle Savings Bank of Carlisle, Iowa, and the FDIC was named
receiver. Regulators say fraud also was involved in that failure, which will
cost the FDIC's insurance fund $18 million to $25 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the Banking Committee's senior Democrat,
urged people to ``keep the recent failures in perspective.'' He noted that
during the banking crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s, some 3,000 banks,
thrifts and credit unions failed in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the FDIC told its 1,800 examiners to keep alert for warning
signs of possible fraud at the banks they inspect. And the agency recently
proposed that capital requirements be doubled for banks that specialize in
high-risk loans to people with inferior credit histories.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach said ``the good news is that the American banking system has never
been stronger'' and the FDIC's insurance fund is at a record high level of some
$29 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach said some regulators may not have properly supervised the Keystone
bank, which grew by paying high interest rates to attract capital from across
the country, when it engaged in risky financial strategies.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it appears the FDIC was stymied at key points in its desire to
examine the bank's activities, and that the independent FDIC and the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency -- the Treasury Department agency that oversaw
the bank -- ``failed to cooperate closely.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Comptroller John D. Hawke Jr., testifying at the hearing, insisted that
his agency's relationship with the FDIC ``has been cooperative and productive.''
</P>
<P>
	   The FDIC's estimated $750 million loss caused by Keystone's collapse could
put it among the 10 most expensive ever in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, Leach has proposed legislation that would give the head of the
FDIC more authority over troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawke said the objective of Leach's proposal -- to make coordination between
the FDIC and the Comptroller's office smoother and more efficient -- already has
been achieved and legislation isn't needed.
</P>
<P>
	   FDIC Chairwoman Donna Tanoue, on the other hand, endorsed the proposal. She
said it would ``enable the FDIC and other bank regulators to proceed in a
unified, coordinated effort to ensure stability in the banking industry and to
minimize losses to the insurance fund.''
</P>
<P>
	   Leach also said the Banking Committee would ``take a hard look'' at the
high-interest risky loans, known as subprime loans, which regulators have been
warning banks about in recent months.
</P>
<P>
	   Like fraud, subprime loans also played a role in some of the eight U.S. bank
failures last year.
</P>
<P>
	   BestBank, for example, sold high-interest credit cards as part of a
travel-club membership to consumers with poor credit records. Its failure
drained some $232 million from the insurance fund, which backs each account up
to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been disagreement among banking regulators over the FDIC's
proposed definition of subprime borrowers. Critics of the proposal have
maintained that under the definition -- borrowers who have made two payments 30
or more days late or one payment 60 or more days late -- many community banks
that lend to low- and moderate-income people would be adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal applies to all forms of consumer credit, including home
mortgages, credit cards, auto loans and personal loans.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDIC says it has found about 150 banks and thrifts with significantly
high levels of subprime loans. Together, those institutions hold about 5 percent
of total banking industry assets.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rebukes Europe on Security  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen and members of the Senate
Armed Services Committee joined today in rebuking European allies for failing to
modernize their military and relying too heavily on the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   They also suggested that European delays in providing a civilian police
force for Kosovo are jeopardizing peacekeeping there.
</P>
<P>
	   Even as President Clinton and Congress are moving to increase defense
spending, ``You look across the Atlantic and you look at their budgets and
they're cutting their budgets,'' Cohen said. ``They can't spend any less. They
should spend more.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the committee chairman, announced that he would
seek to link future U.S. payments for Kosovo to obtaining an assurance from the
president that European allies were meeting their commitments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have to live up to those commitments,'' Warner said. ``The United
States simply cannot pull ... the sole oar in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen found a receptive audience in building on a theme he sounded last
week. In that speech to the Munich Conference on Security Policy, he challenged
European allies to increase their defense spending to meet the goals they have
set for matching U.S. military capabilities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So, it's a message that needs to be repeated from the very highest
levels,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   European allies ``have to reform the way in which they shape their forces.
They have to move away from having forces that are designed to contend against a
Soviet invasion across a central front.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our European friends ... cannot continue to rely upon the United States to
carry the heavy load,'' Cohen said. In addition to providing a two-thirds share
of the 78-day air war against Yugoslavia, ``We are carrying a very major load
today.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said a civilian police force of 6,000 is required in Kosovo, but there
are only 1,900 international police, of which 400 are Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We do not have adequate judges. They do not have adequate jails. They do
not have a judicial system. And so, we're in a situation in which people who get
arrested have to be released for lack of a judicial system. This is a
responsibility of the international community. The Europeans must also bear a
fair share of that responsibility and they have yet to do so,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the committee, said
peacekeeping efforts in the Balkans ``could disintegrate unless the European
Union carries out its commitment to provide $36 million in urgently needed funds
immediately, and unless the European Union adds a substantially greater number
of civilian police.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The European Union can talk all it wants about plans to provide a
militarily strong European pillar within NATO under the European security and
defense identify, but that's just rhetoric,'' Levin said. ``The reality is their
failure to meet their current commitments in Kosovo. Our military forces are
neither trained to be policemen nor should they be expected to perform that
mission.''

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading heavily
today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   The company had an operating loss of $3.2 million in the quarter ended Dec.
31, compared to an operating profit of $146.3 million a year earlier. British
Airways said it was hurt by the proliferation of low-cost fares in the market.
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street's
expectations of $1.10 a share, but the strong results were largely due to a
falling income tax rate. Analysts expressed concern over rising costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The French company, the world's fourth-largest producer of consumer
electronics, reported a 19 percent jump in revenues for 1999. Thomson cited
strong sales of products like digital video discs and digital decoders.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will replace Safeskin Corp. in the S&AMP;P SmallCap 600 Index after
the close of trading on Tuesday. Companies added to stock indexes often get a
boost as fund managers who try to mirror an index's performance buy shares of
the newly added company.
</P>
<P>
	   The company widened its losses in the fourth quarter, to $1.38 per share
from 61 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 1998. Global TeleSystems
operates a fiber optic network across Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares rose for a second straight session after the company was added to the
Internet Stock Review "Watch List" for 2000. The review is an online newsletter

<HEADLINE> Autobahn Crashes Hurt Audi Make  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The sleek, ground-hugging Audi TT won acclaim for
its futurist design and responsive handling when the German roadster came to
market in 1998 -- selling nearly 55,000 worldwide and 6,000 in the United States
since.
</P>
<P>
	   But what was once a driver's dream machine has been tarnished by a series of
deadly crashes in which speed-loving Germans pushed the high performance car to
the limit, lost control and rocketed off the autobahn.
</P>
<P>
	   Panic over the car's safety piqued when the former East German road rally
champion Peter Hommel totaled his TT and died last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Now Audi is responding to a wave of consumer concern with a voluntary recall
to retrofit the cars with the latest braking technology called ESP, or
Electronic Stability Program. It's the second stage in a recall program that
earlier upgraded the car's suspensions and installed a rear spoiler.
</P>
<P>
	   Restoring the luster to the premium brand sports compact and regaining the
trust of leery car fanatics will set the company back an estimated $75 million,
Audi said Friday, as company chairman Franz-Josef Paefgen tried to soothe
drivers' shattered nerves.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish to apologize formally to our TT customers for the uncertainty which
has emerged in the last few months," Paefgen said. "Our initiative is intended
to put an end to the uncertainty."
</P>
<P>
	   Audi is still haunted by memories of the sudden acceleration allegations
that extinguished the brand in American markets during the 1980s. Investigators
eventually cleared the carmaker of wrongdoing, but Audi is moving quickly this
time to refit the $31,000 car despite its claim there are no design or
manufacturing flaws.	   The first fatal crash happened late last summer. And
after several more nonfatal crashes, Audi announced in October an offer to
replace the suspension and install a rear spoiler at no charge to all TT
customers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   But with three more deadly crashes reported in January, Audi stepped up the
pace. All told, Audi says it is investigating roughly 55 crashes -- all of
which, including the five fatal ones, occurred only in Germany. All five
fatalities apparently occurred after the drivers pushed their cars past 110
miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning next month, customers can have the ESP system -- which comes
standard on all new Audi TT's -- installed in their older models for about $325.
The new technology brakes each wheel independently to prevent the tail end of
the speedy compact from swinging out around curves and pulling the car off the
road.
</P>
<P>
	   The hitch is that it's only available to customers who can bring their car
to Audi's production plant outside Munich, Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Company spokesman Axel Engel was adamant that the series of crashes was
symptomatic of German driving culture and shouldn't spark alarm elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is completely a German issue. We don't have any complaints from
anywhere else in the world," Engel said. "How people drive their car is
something we can't control."
</P>
<P>
	   On Germany's autobahn, the elaborate network of expressways that often has
no posted speed, cars zip along at 100 miles an hour or more. With a top speed
of 140 miles an hour, the TT is too much temptation for some drivers.
</P>
<P>
	   The company wasn't planning to introduce the ESP retrofitting offer in the
United States unless there was major demand, Engel said, citing the modest U.S.
speed limits.
</P>
<P>
	   "The problem with the TT is that we have a lot of people who are first-time
sports car drivers" attracted by the relatively low price, said Christian
Breitsprecher, an auto analyst with Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
	   "So now people who used to drive compacts have a real sports machine in
their hands, and maybe they just can't handle it."
</P>
<P>
	   Audi says it's unfair to stigmatize the TT because there are no comparisons
to show that it is any more crash-prone than its competitors, especially
Porsche's high speed Boxster which doesn't offer ESP technology. Of the 55,000
TT's sold worldwide, 25,000 are on the road in Germany. Since October, 18,000
cars have been retrofitted for better safety, Engel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Only a handful of lawsuits have been brought against the company -- mostly
focusing on the cost of refitting, not damages from the crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   But this is not the first problem with the TT. Last August, the company
recalled 46 cars from its year 2000 line in the United States because of a
problem that could cause gasoline leaks.

<HEADLINE> Addictive Powers of Tobacco Examined  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- Tobacco smoke can be as addictive as heroin or cocaine,
according to a report released Tuesday by a doctors' group, which called for the
government to finance smokers' efforts to quit.
</P>
<P>
	   The report by the tobacco advisory group of the Royal College of Physicians
called for an aggressive advertising campaign and other government-funded
programs to help people give up cigarettes. It said cigarettes should be
regulated just as other drugs, by an independent committee with the power to
restrict the number of additives and amount of nicotine in them.
</P>
<P>
	   One in five deaths in Britain is caused by smoking, the report said, citing
previous studies.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's National Health Service also should foot the bill for nicotine
replacement therapies such as chewing gum and patches for smokers who want to
quit, and manufacturers should be barred from using the words "light" or "mild"
on low-tar cigarettes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Cigarette smoking should be understood as a manifestation of nicotine
addiction," the report said. "The extent to which smokers are addicted to
nicotine is comparable with addiction to 'hard' drugs such as heroin or
cocaine."
</P>
<P>
	   The report said smoking should be viewed as a drug dependence "second to no
other." The document called for the establishment of an independent committee of
experts to examine the options for nicotine regulation and report their findings
to the government.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Party government already has begun a major anti-smoking
initiative. It aims to reduce the percentage of Britons who smoke from 28
percent in 1996 to 26 percent by 2005 and 24 percent by 2010.
</P>
<P>
	   John Carlisle, the spokesman for the Tobacco Manufacturers Association,
criticized the report, characterizing the connection between tobacco and hard
drugs as "misplaced."
</P>
<P>
	   "Some 12 million people have given up smoking in the last 20 years,"
Carlisle said. "Unlike hard drugs, thousands take up the habit and give up the
habit each day, and they don't have to beat up old ladies to finance it."
</P>
<P>
	   "Essentially, this is not a new report," he said. "There's no new scientific
evidence. It's merely a collection of existing research, which has been about
for some time."
</P>
<P>
	   But Clive Bates, director of the anti-smoking group Action on Smoking and
Health, applauded the report's conclusions, saying, "The fact that they are
legal is irrelevant -- cigarettes are hard drugs by any physical or medical
definition."

    LONDON (AP) -- European stocks finished mostly higher Tuesday, buoyed by
Deutsche Telekom boosting Frankfurt's Xetra-DAX Index to a record close.
</P>
<P>
	   The DAX index rose 3.5 percent to close at an all-time high of 7,549.88 and

<HEADLINE> Hasbro Earnings Up 18 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL ZOLL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Hasbro Inc.'s fourth-quarter earnings rose 18
percent from a year ago, beating expectations thanks to strong sales of Pokemon
toys, Furby dolls and hand-held electronic games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pawtucket, R.I.-based company said Tuesday that it earned $155.4
million, or 79 cents per share, compared with $131.8 million, or 65 cents per
share, in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the nation's
second-largest toymaker to earn 75 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter increased 22 percent to $1.6 billion, compared with
$1.3 billion one year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Fueling the gains were strong sales of Furby, the interactive furry doll
that was introduced in 1998 but still sold a stunning 12 million units last
year. Also lifting sales and profits were its hand-held electronic games, most
of which are made by its Tiger Electronics division, and its toys based on the
popular Japanese cartoon Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also credited strong sales of core brands such as Monopoly,
Yahtzee and Trivial Pursuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Wizards of the Coast, which Hasbro bought in September, accounted for about
$237 million in sales. Wizards sells Pokemon trading cards as well as the
popular game Dungeons &AMP; Dragons.
</P>
<P>
	   Strength in those divisions helps offset troubles in other areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasbro met its sales forecast for toys based on the new "Star Wars" movie
"Episode I: The Phantom Menace," but some analysts said the performance was
disappointing. The company hopes for a boost from the movie's spring video
release.
</P>
<P>
	   "They started off the year giving this a lowball estimate of $650 million
(in sales), which is what they hit," said Joseph Kinnison, a Minneapolis-based
analyst at American Express Financial Advisors. "I think we all knew that that
was the worst-case scenario."
</P>
<P>
	   Jill Krutick, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, blamed "waning enthusiasm"
for some Star Wars products. She said that they had about $100 million to $150
million in excess inventory of the line.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasbro's interactive software unit fared poorly in the fourth quarter and
for the year, with a $53 million after-tax loss for all of 1999. The company
blamed the shortfall partly on an industry-wide slump in video and CD-ROM sales.
</P>
<P>
	   "The company said its original (interactive software) plan going into the
year was $300 million revenue. They missed by 25 percent," Kinnison said. "I
don't think this was a Hasbro-specific indication. The rampant price discounting
we've seen in the education segment may have spilled over."
</P>
<P>
	   The fourth-quarter results excluded a $141.6 million pre-tax charge to cover
costs from a reorganization that included cutting 2,200 jobs or 19 percent of
its work force, closing two plants and shifting much of its manufacturing to
Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking into account consolidation costs, Hasbro's net income for the quarter
ended Dec. 26 was $57.7 million or 29 cents a share, compared to $131.8 million,
or 65 cents per share, the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   Net earnings for the year increased 30 percent to $286.6 million, or $1.42
per share, compared to $220 million, or $1.07 per share, the year before. Sales
for the year increased 28 percent to $4.2 billion, compared to $3.3 billion the
year before.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasbro remains second to toymaker Mattel, which saw $5.5 billion in sales
last year. Mattel's chief executive officer Jill Barad stepped down last week
after the El Segundo, Calif.-based company reported a steep loss in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasbro owns the Playskool, Kenner, Tonka, Milton Bradley, Parker Brothers
and Galoob toy and game brands. This summer, Hasbro plans to launch Games.com,
an online games portal.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasbro shares were down 12 1/2 cents at $15.93 3/4 in afternoon trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Hallmark Branches Out Into Flowers  </HEADLINE>
    By JASON STRAIT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The company that marketed "I love you" into the
world's largest greeting card business has entered the arranged flower industry
just in time for Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Hallmark Inc., which holds 47 percent of the greeting card market, is
starting to offer next-day delivery of what it claims are the "freshest flowers"
available in the $15 billion floral industry.
</P>
<P>
	   It's the first new venture under the greeting card company's ambitious
strategy announced in October to triple annual sales over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the first thing out of the box," said Hallmark spokeswoman Linda
Odell. "It is something that customers have told us for some time that they
expect from us."
</P>
<P>
	   Customers in five U.S. test markets can pick from 15 flower arrangements
advertised at Hallmark stores. The bouquets vary from a dozen Santa Marta roses
at $49.95 to 15 pink French tulips for $69.95, plus shipping costs.
</P>
<P>
	   However, shoppers can't walk out of a Hallmark store with a bouquet in-hand.
Once purchased, an electronic order is sent to Memphis, Tenn., where the flowers
are boxed along with a vase and shipped out for overnight delivery.
</P>
<P>
	   Odell said Hallmark's flowers are up to a week fresher because of the
centralized Memphis greenhouse, creating a system that takes the bouquets from
"the hands of the grower to the hands" of the customer.
</P>
<P>
	   At Carol's Hallmark store in Sacramento, Calif., bouquet sales have been
slow, but better than expected since the product was introduced in November,
said store owner Carol Denello.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have these men that just want to stop in on their way home or to a date
to pick up flowers," she said. "Everyone waits to the last minute, that was my
concern about it."
</P>
<P>
	   The Kansas City-based company launched Hallmark Flowers starting in October
at stores in Albany, N.Y; Charlotte, N.C.; Columbus, Ohio; Portland, Ore.; and
Sacramento. The flower arrangements also can be purchased over the Internet at
the company's Web site www.hallmark.com.
</P>
<P>
	   The project is tentatively set to run through Mother's Day, but could expand
and become a permanent fixture, depending on its success.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think there is a lot of opportunity in this market," Odell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hallmark's new venture is its first leap outside its traditional line of
greeting cards and gifts. The company's goal is to increase annual sales from
$3.9 billion in 1999 to $12 billion by 2010. That would mean an increase of 10
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're not going to make $12 billion selling just greeting cards, I can
tell you that. So I guess this is one way they plan on finding new revenue
sources," said Eric Bosshard, a greeting card analyst with Midwest Research in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
	   Bosshard said that growth in the greeting card market has slowed in recent
years to about 4 percent annually. Hallmark's 1998 sales were up 5.4 percent
from 1997, and in 1996 sales were up 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   American Greetings, Hallmark's top competitor, also has branched out into
new markets by manufacturing its own balloons and candles.
</P>
<P>
	   "The one common thread in the greeting card business is that it seems to be
slowing. So you have all these companies grasping at other kinds of products,"
Bosshard said.
</P>
<P>
	   At Carol's Hallmark in Sacramento, Denello said she had been selling about
four bouquets a week. An average of five to 10 arrangements had been purchased a
week at a Hallmark Creations store in Charlotte, said assistant manager Aimee
Foote.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was very surprised that Hallmark got into it, but it's gone over really
well," Foote said.
</P>
<P>
	   It didn't go over as well with florist Richard Lisenby.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisenby is co-owner of Elfrieda's Flowers Inc., just two doors down from
Hallmark Creations in Charlotte. He said Hallmark has not cut into his business
and he doesn't expect what he calls Hallmark's impersonal delivery system to win
over many Valentine's Day shoppers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the customer that orders it understands that what they're
getting is a box of flowers and a vase," he said. "It's a paint-by-number floral
kit."
</P>
<P>
	   And Bosshard, the analyst, believes that Hallmark could have trouble
breaking into the arranged floral market because there are already so many
choices.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't see them as an immediate threat to florists," he said.

<P>
	   Restoring the luster to the premium brand sports compact and regaining the
trust of leery car fanatics will set the company back an estimated $75 million,
Audi said Friday, as company chairman Franz-Josef Paefgen tried to soothe
drivers' shattered nerves.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish to apologize formally to our TT customers for the uncertainty which
has emerged in the last few months," Paefgen said. "Our initiative is intended
to put an end to the uncertainty."
</P>
<P>
	   Audi is still haunted by memories of the sudden acceleration allegations
that nearly extinguished the brand in American markets during the 1980s.
Investigators eventually cleared the carmaker of wrongdoing, but Audi is moving
quickly this time to refit the $31,000 car despite its claim there are no design
or manufacturing flaws.
</P>
<P>
	   The first of five fatal crashes happened late last summer. And after several
more nonfatal crashes, Audi announced in October an offer to replace the
suspension and install a rear spoiler at no charge to all TT customers
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   But with three more deadly crashes reported in January, Audi stepped up the
pace. All told, Audi says it is investigating roughly 55 crashes -- all of
which, including the five fatal ones, occurred only in Germany. All five
fatalities apparently occurred after the drivers pushed their cars past 110
miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning next month, customers can have the ESP system -- which comes
standard on all new Audi TT's -- installed in their older models for about $325.
The new technology brakes each wheel independently to prevent the tail end of
the speedy compact from swinging out around curves and pulling the car off the
road.
</P>
<P>
	   The hitch is that it's only available to customers who can bring their car
to Audi's production plant outside Munich, Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Company spokesman Axel Engel was adamant that the series of crashes was
symptomatic of German driving culture and shouldn't spark alarm elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is completely a German issue. We don't have any complaints from
anywhere else in the world," Engel said. "How people drive their car is
something we can't control."
</P>
<P>
	   On Germany's autobahn, the elaborate network of expressways that often has
no posted speed, cars zip along at 100 miles an hour or more. With a top speed
of 140 miles an hour, the TT is too much temptation for some drivers.
</P>
<P>
	   The company wasn't planning to introduce the ESP retrofitting offer in the
United States unless there was major demand, Engel said, citing the modest U.S.
speed limits.
</P>
<P>
	   "The problem with the TT is that we have a lot of people who are first-time
sports car drivers" attracted by the relatively low price, said Christian
Breitsprecher, an auto analyst with Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
	   "So now people who used to drive compacts have a real sports machine in
their hands, and maybe they just can't handle it."
</P>
<P>
	   Audi says it's unfair to stigmatize the TT because there are no comparisons
to show that it is any more crash-prone than its competitors, especially
Porsche's high speed Boxster which doesn't offer ESP technology. Of the 55,000
TT's sold worldwide, 25,000 are on the road in Germany. Since October, 18,000
cars have been retrofitted for better safety, Engel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Only a handful of lawsuits have been brought against the company -- mostly
focusing on the cost of refitting, not damages from the crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   But this is not the first problem with the TT. Last August, the company
recalled 46 cars from its year 2000 line in the United States because of a
problem that could cause gasoline leaks.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today after the government reported that
workers' productivity surged at the close of 1999, suggesting that the economy
can continue to grow without giving rise to inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
69.49 at 10,975.28.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 15.29 at 1,438.29, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 79.87 at
4,401.64, pushing past its record of 4,321.77 set Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks benefited from the Labor Department's report today that productivity
-- defined as the amount of output for each hour of work -- rose at a 5 percent
annual rate in the fourth quarter, the strongest showing since the last three
months of 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The report surpassed analysts' expectations and reassured many investors
that inflation remains under wraps. Stocks have been pressured so far this year
by worries that the Federal Reserve will sharply raise interest rates to keep
inflation from accelerating.
</P>
<P>
	   While most economists see little evidence of actual inflation, four rate
increases since last June have done little to slow the growth of the U.S.
economy. Analysts said today's report indicated that while the Fed may continue
raising rates at its next meeting, an increase sharp enough to derail stocks
isn't likely.
</P>
<P>
	   "This report will probably not prevent the Fed from tightening on March 21,
but it will keep them on the course of gradualism and caution," said David Orr,
chief economist at First Union Securities Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue-chip stocks, which have been under heavy pressure from investors who
fear that higher interest rates will cut into corporate profits, rebounded
sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial services stocks fared best. American Express rose 2 3/4 to 165
3/16 and J.P. Morgan rose 4 1/4 to 121 13/16.
</P>
<P>
	   The most widely held technology stocks were also higher. IBM rose 3 9/16 to
117 9/16 and Microsoft gained 2 7/8 to 109 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Amazon.com rose 7 27/32 to 82 27/32. A potential rival,
online retailer Buy.com Inc., rose in its initial public offering of stock.
Shares were priced at 13, opened at 30 1/8 and were trading at 25 15/16. Buy.com
bills itself as an Internet superstore, providing a wide range of products after
originally concentrating on computers.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks gained support today from the rising U.S. dollar, which soared to a
five-month high against the Japanese yen. A strong dollar makes imports cheaper,
providing an additional hedge against inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 714.57 million shares, compared with 623.80
at the same time Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.39 to 535.78.

<HEADLINE> Berlin Film Festival Wants Respect  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL GEITNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Despite a new flashy setting, the Berlin International Film
Festival is still struggling to be taken seriously by Hollywood even as it turns
50: Organizers aren't even sure if one of the two stars they're honoring will
show up.
</P>
<P>
	   The festival, known as the Berlinale, opens Wednesday with the world
premiere of local boy Wim Wenders' independent flick, "The Million Dollar
Hotel," starring Mel Gibson -- whose attendance, like honoree Robert DeNiro,
remained unconfirmed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike festivals in Cannes or Venice, where films like "Fight Club" and
"Cradle Will Rock" were seen last year for the first time anywhere, none of the
big-budget U.S. movies competing for Berlin's Golden Bear statue are world
premieres.
</P>
<P>
	   Hollywood's Berlin offerings -- "The Talented Mr. Ripley," "The Beach," "The
Hurricane," "Magnolia," "Man on the Moon" and "Any Given Sunday" -- all have
opened in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Berlinale has a new location -- the snazzy, just-opened Potsdamer Platz
complex built on what used to be the no man's land of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether it makes the event more glamorous, though, is yet to be seen. So
far, the only thing the new location has meant for certain is that staging the
festival is not getting any cheaper, the government's culture czar said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Naumann urged organizers last year to find ways to raise the
festival's international profile, and said Tuesday that he would have liked to
see Hollywood save at least one premiere for Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   "That would have been my dream," he told reporters. However, he said,
"market conditions in the United States" seem to make it impossible.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the problem is timing: To be eligible for an Academy Award
nomination, which get announced in Hollywood at the same time the festival is
running, the movie has to have been shown commercially in Los Angeles the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   Anyone who debuts a film in Berlin, then, has to wait almost a year before
the next nominations come around -- and risk fading from memory.
</P>
<P>
	   Hollywood tends to use the Berlinale as a springboard for the European
launch of its winter films, bringing in star power to generate publicity before
the films hit local theaters. Leonardo DiCaprio and Gwyneth Paltrow are among
those coming to Berlin this year.
</P>
<P>
	   It can be hard to entice Hollywood's A-list to come to cold, gray Berlin.
DeNiro, who's been here three times when he had a new film to promote, has yet
to commit this year, even though the festival is honoring him with a
retrospective.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, French star Jeanne Moreau, who's also receiving a special
tribute, is planning on staying for a whole week, organizers say.
</P>
<P>
	   Festival boss Moritz de Hadeln says the star quotient doesn't concern him.
Instead, he has stressed the festival's "European touch" this year, with
premieres from France, Italy, Russia, Turkey, Spain's Catalonia region and even
Serbia among the 21 in competition.
</P>
<P>
	   With the 10th anniversary of German unification coming up this fall, new
offerings from Oscar-winning German directors Volker Schloendorff, who did "The
Tin Drum," and Pepe Danquart, who did "Black Rider," both deal with the
psychological trauma of rejoining east and west.
</P>
<P>
	   Polish director Andrzej Wajda, who's getting a lifetime achievement award at
the Academy Awards this year, is on the jury, chaired by Chinese star Gong Li.
Winners will be announced Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Naumann has backed away from his earlier criticism, declining to
compare this year's Berlinale with its competitors. "Berlin will stay Berlin,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Forbes square of in Delaware, McCain a wild card  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DOVER, Del. (AP) - George W. Bush and Steve Forbes battled Tuesday in a
Republican primary skipped by the field's hottest candidate, John McCain, who
turned his attention to the South and a critical contest ahead.
<P>
	   Their rival's absence didn't diminish the stakes for Bush and Forbes, each
badly needing a victory after McCain trounced them in last week's New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   "Give me a chance to lead," the Texas governor asked a gathering of Delaware
senior citizens before flying to South Carolina to prepare for his Feb. 19
showdown with McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, campaigning to the last at a nursing home, pledged to end
inheritance taxes as part of his flat tax plan. "You should be allowed to leave
this world unmolested by the IRS," he told about 60 senior citizens in a
reception room down the hall from a polling place.
</P>
<P>
	   With little hope in South Carolina, he was flying to Michigan, which has its
Republican primary on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain didn't campaign here but was on the ballot and hoped to pick up votes
while remaining in South Carolina. That state's primary will test whether he is
a one-state wonder or a contender who can foil Bush and his backers in the GOP
establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   In South Carolina on Tuesday, McCain said he would not ignore the harsher
Bush criticism that has been coming in the past few days. "And we're going to
respond harder than we're hit, and that's an old tactic in warfare," the former
Navy pilot said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Delaware primary yielded the winner only 12 convention delegates, and
perhaps a spurt of momentum heading into South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the top three candidates, conservative Alan Keyes was on the
ballot, though he did not campaign here. Gary Bauer, who dropped out of the race
last week, also was listed.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had the backing of the party establishment, and by most accounts was
the favorite. Forbes won the state's primary in 1996 and spent tens of thousands
of dollars to build an organization this time around.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was a factor, too with Republicans giving the absentee candidate a
second look after his New Hampshire romp.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading up to the vote, Forbes tried to make the case that McCain's New
Hampshire landslide damaged the front-running Bush and made it a wide open race.
His distant third-place finish in New Hampshire put his own campaign on the
ropes, and he sought a strong finish in Delaware to revive his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to South Carolina, Bush unveiled a new message designed to
undercut McCain's signature issue of political reform. He all but called the
senator a hypocrite for attacking lobbyists while seeking their donations. And
Bush said that he, not McCain, had a record of reform.
</P>
<P>
	   "I stand before you as a governor who led my state to managed (health) care
reform. Some people in Washington say we can't get anything done because of all
the lobbyists and special interests," Bush said Tuesday, not mentioning McCain.
"That's somebody who doesn't understand how to lead."
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates also accused each other of breaking a pledge to run positive
campaigns. McCain noted that some of the veterans who endorsed Bush in South
Carolina accused McCain of abandoning veterans and POWs as a congressman, after
being imprisoned himself in Vietnam. McCain said that charge was "beyond the
pale."
</P>
<P>
	   The bickering underscored what is at stake in upcoming contests. Despite his
financial and organizational advantages, Bush faces a serious threat from the
Arizona senator. And McCain has only one victory under his belt and can hardly
afford losses to his party's front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   ---
</P>
<P>
	   After Delaware and South Carolina, the GOP campaign moves to Feb. 22
primaries in Arizona and Michigan. Bush has campaigned hard in McCain's home
state, and is supported by Arizona Gov. Jane Hull. McCain hasn't ceded any
ground in Michigan, where Bush is backed by Gov. John Engler.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia conducts its primary Feb. 29, and Bush is backed there by Gov.
James Gilmore. More than a dozen states hold primaries or caucuses on March 7,
when the nominee could be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won in Delaware four years ago, gaining 33 percent of the vote to
beat Bob Dole, the eventual nominee. But Forbes was the only GOP candidate to
campaign in Delaware that year, with the others staying away in deference to New
Hampshire's insistence on being the first and only contest in the opening week
of primary competition.
</P>
<P>
	   To avoid a replay in 2000, Delaware Republicans opted out of the state
primary last Saturday to hold a party-run election Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Genetic Discrimination Ban Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to fears that advances in medical research
could be abused by employers and others, President Clinton barred federal
agencies today from discriminating against their employees on the basis of
genetic tests.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton expressed his amazement at the rapid progress science has made in
understanding human genetics and said it is time to consider the consequences.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This extraordinary march of human understanding imposes on us a profound
responsibility to make sure that the age of discovery can continue to reflect
our most cherished values,'' he told an American Association for the Advancement
of Science audience. ``We must protect our citizens' privacy -- the bulwark of
personal liberty, the safeguard of individual creativity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's decision was implemented today in an executive order based on
legislation sponsored by Sens. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., and Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the order, Clinton supported the pending bills, which would
prohibit all employers from refusing to hire people at risk for health problems
and insurers from refusing to sell them coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   The president said concerns about the use of genetic information could
discourage people from seeking crucial tests that would improve their lives.
``If we do not protect the right to privacy, we may actually impede the reach of
these breakthroughs in the lives of ordinary people, which would be a profound
tragedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters said they hoped Clinton's action on behalf of federal workers
would focus attention on the need to take similar steps to protect
private-sector employees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it sends a powerful message to the private sector about how
they'll need to deal with the advances in science,'' White House press secretary
Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   Advances in genetic testing soon will allow doctors to predict the medical
futures of their patients. That has raised concerns that such information could
be used against those who are likely to suffer from cancer, diabetes, heart
disease or other ailments.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was joined by Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Human
Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Shirley
Malcolm, head of the directorate for education and human resources programs at
the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has been speaking out on the issue for years. In his 1998 State of
the Union speech, he declared that ``we must see that science serves humanity,
not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any
American,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ranit Schmelzer, Daschle's spokeswoman, said the Senate minority leader long
has argued that ``as more information about people's future health becomes
available it becomes important to protect that information.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``People shouldn't be discriminated against in employment or in other areas
because of some genetic information that may be available on them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's order prohibits federal employers from requiring or requesting
genetic tests as a condition of being hired or receiving benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Further, federal employers would not be allowed to deny employees promotions
or overseas posts because of a genetic predisposition for certain illness.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the order, obtaining or disclosing genetic information about employees
or potential employees is banned, except when necessary to provide medical
treatment to employees, insure workplace health and safety or provide occupation
and health researchers access to data.

<HEADLINE> Internet site to help consumers manage finances  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - General Electric Co. took a leap into cyberspace
Tuesday, introducing an Internet site aimed at helping consumers manage their
personal finances.
<P>
	   The GE Financial Network, located at www.gefn.com, joins a growing number of
online services where consumers can do everything from invest in mutual funds to
apply for mortgages.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, whose products range from light bulbs and appliances to jet
engines and the NBC television network, last year set its sights on transferring
its "brick and mortar" businesses onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   The company set up smaller-scale sites to sell insurance and mortgages and
reported more than $1 billion in online sales in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The new Web site is GE's first major online initiative aimed at consumers,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We recognize that this medium is here to stay, that this will be the way
consumers manage their financial lives," said Bill Goings, head of GEFN. "This
makes information available in a very easy-to-use format. We're trying to be the
one source."
</P>
<P>
	   The GEFN site includes information on annuities, auto and life insurance,
loans and mutual funds, company officials said. Consumers can also set up a
savings account or apply for a credit card and obtain immediate approval online.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said several special features are aimed at helping consumers
tailor the site to their needs. The Financial Toolkit includes a glossary of
terms and aids to calculate quotes for insurance and loans. The Rep Finder helps
consumers locate nearby professionals within GE's network to create custom plans
or answer questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeffrey Runnfeldt, an analyst with Dain Rauscher Wessels, said GE is the
latest financial services company to recognize it needs an Internet presence.
But he doesn't expect the site to replace any consumer's own banking service.
</P>
<P>
	   "GE definitely needs to be out there," he said. "It's a pretty well-designed
and effective distribution channel for them, but it's just their own products."
</P>
<P>
	   GEFN is an initiative of GE Capital, the company's financial services arm.

<HEADLINE> Outgoing IMF Head's State of Union  </HEADLINE>
    By HARRY DUNPHY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michel Camdessus, retiring as head of the International
Monetary Fund after 13 years, declared the world economy in generally good shape
Tuesday but said rising oil prices pose a considerable uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
	   In a farewell news conference, the 66-year-old Frenchman discussed his
successes and failures in dealing with global financial crises that hit Asia,
Russia and Latin America and in making the 182-nation organization more open and
accountable.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am happy to be leaving as we see the world economy exceeding all
forecasts for growth," said Camdessus, whose last day as managing director is
next Tuesday. "It has something to do with our efforts, and I am proud to say
that."
</P>
<P>
	   The IMF has arranged multibillion dollar rescue packages for crisis-hit
countries starting with Mexico in 1994. It has also helped countries in the
former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe make a sometimes successful transition to
become market economies.
</P>
<P>
	   While welcoming the brightening global economic outlook, Camdessus said "one
of the question marks of this very moment" is the threat posed by oil prices
that have been edging toward $30 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   He said oil industry analysts are forecasting a price decline, but "no one
can be sure. In this context I approve the prudence of central banks in the
world that want to take the necessary steps" to contain inflation by raising
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus will be replaced temporarily by his deputy, Stanley Fischer, an
American. The United States and the other major industrialized nations have been
unable so far to agree on a permanent replacement. By unwritten rule, a European
heads the IMF and an American leads the World Bank, its sister lending
institution.
</P>
<P>
	   Among his failures, Camdessus said, was not changing the image some held of
the IMF as a hardhearted lending organization whose belt-tightening austerity
measures to countries in trouble put people out of work and raise food prices
and political uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are still people around the world who can without provoking an outcry
say the IMF kills babies," Camdessus said. "You have all the demagogues in the
world pretending we don't serve the common good. It's the price we pay, ...
crosses that we have to carry."
</P>
<P>
	   But he said criticism of the IMF has subsided as the world's economic
outlook has improved and polices it recommended have begun to work in countries
such as South Korea, Thailand and Brazil.

	   Asked what lessons the IMF learned its experience in Russia, where the IMF
record has been mixed, Camdessus said he regrets sharing the illusion with the
industrialized countries that a transition to market economy, starting in 1991
when the Soviet Union broke up, could have been accomplished rapidly.

IMF, if everyone was prepared to take as many risks as the IMF did," Camdessus
said.

	   He said the fund also was frustrated in Russia by poor implementation of the
IMF reform package, corruption and a lack of political will by the Duma, the

<HEADLINE> Shalala Wants Better CDC Bookkeping  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A high-ranking government accountant will make sure that
one of the nation's largest health agencies properly tallies all the taxpayer
money it spends fighting killer viruses, Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Shalala moved to clean up bookkeeping by the Atlanta-based Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, which last week acknowledged it had misled
Congress, for a second time, about how it spends some of its disease-fighting
money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am taking what I consider to be very aggressive and unprecedented
actions to rectify the problem,'' Shalala told a House Appropriations health
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   Last October, CDC Director Jeffrey Koplan acknowledged his agency misspent
about half of the $22.7 million it received from Congress to study chronic
fatigue syndrome. Koplan again apologized last week, this time for how his
agency dealt with $7.5 million in annual funding intended to fight hantavirus.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress never said CDC must spend all that money against hantavirus, an
often deadly infection spread by mice that struck 24 Americans last year. But
the CDC told Congress it had done so, even though it really spent some of the
money fighting outbreaks of other mysterious killer viruses.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers now question if they can trust CDC employees to be truthful about
any financial issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Shalala instructed her department's chief financial officer to certify that
all expenditures by the CDC's infectious diseases branch are performed and
documented properly. In addition, all senior scientists in that branch will
receive special budget training.
</P>
<P>
	   A congressman in charge of CDC's funding questioned whether if the agency
has ``a very cavalier approach'' in spending and accounting for taxpayer money.
Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., suggested appointing non-government financial
consultants might work better.
</P>
<P>
	   Koplan will further address those concerns when CDC employees testify before
lawmakers Thursday, Shalala said.

</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnes &AMP; Noble.com's sales in the fourth quarter
more than tripled from a year ago, but its losses widened as the
Internet retailer spent heavily during the holiday season to lure
shoppers to its Web site. The New York-based company said today it
lost $38.36 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $31.35
million a year ago. On a per-share basis, the losses remained the
same at 27 cents a share. The figures were in line with the
estimates of Wall Street analysts. Fourth-quarter sales rose to
$82.13 million from $25.88 million a year ago. Barnes &AMP; Noble.com

	   Productivity Leaps in 4th Quarter
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A surge in American workers' productivity
during the final three months of last year helped boost their
productivity growth for all of 1999 to 2.9 percent, the best
performance in seven years. Productivity -- defined as output per
hour of work -- rose at a 5 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter, the strongest showing since the last three months of 1992,
the Labor Department said today. That was an even better showing
than the 4.3 percent rate of increase many analysts were
forecasting. The fourth-quarter gain matched the upwardly revised
rate of growth in the third quarter. For all 1999, productivity
rose 2.9 percent, the largest spurt of growth since a 4.1 percent
gain in 1992. In 1998, productivity rose 2.8 percent.

that workers' productivity surged at the close of 1999, suggesting
that the economy can continue to grow without giving rise to
inflation. In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 63.60 at 10,969.39. Broader stock
indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up
15.29 at 1,438.29, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 81.29 at
4,403.06, pushing past its record of 4,321.77 set yesterday. Stocks
benefited from the Labor Department's report today that
productivity -- output per hour of work -- rose at a 5 percent annual
rate in the fourth quarter, the strongest showing since the last
three months of 1992.

acclaim for its futurist design and responsive handling when the
German roadster came to market in 1998 -- selling nearly 55,000
worldwide and 6,000 in the United States since. But what was once a
driver's dream machine has been tarnished by a series of deadly
crashes in which speed-loving Germans pushed the high performance
car to the limit, lost control and rocketed off the autobahn. Now
Audi is responding to a wave of consumer concern with a voluntary
recall to retrofit the cars with the latest braking technology
called ESP, or Electronic Stability Program. It's the second stage
in a recall program that earlier upgraded the car's suspensions and
installed a rear spoiler.

<HEADLINE> Deutch Gives Up Pentagon Clearances  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Deutch, the former CIA director who has admitted to
agency security violations, asked the Pentagon today to discontinue his Defense
Department industrial security clearances.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch said in a letter to Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre that he has
no need for access to Pentagon classified information and therefore prefers that
his clearances be discontinued. He lost his CIA clearance last summer after
downloading sensitive files into his home computer.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch's letter was transmitted to Hamre today by his attorney at the
Washington law office of Williams &AMP; Connolly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has been Mr. Deutch's practice since his CIA clearance was suspended by
Director Tenet last August to avoid access to any classified information,
including classified documents, meetings and conversations,'' the letter states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Therefore, there is no need to continue these industrial security
clearances at this time and he asks that they be discontinued.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the time CIA Director George Tenet suspended Deutch's security clearance
at the agency, the Pentagon cut off Deutch's access to Defense Intelligence
Agency information. But the Pentagon allowed Deutch to keep his industrial
security clearances, which allowed him to have access to some classified
information.
</P>
<P>
	   Before becoming CIA director, Deutch served as deputy secretary of defense
from 1994 to 1995. He now is a professor at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and acts as a consultant for several organizations with defense
contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   After weekend news reports about Deutch's continued access to classified
defense information, the Pentagon's inspector general asked the CIA for its
evidence on Deutch's security breaches, Cohen told reporters. ``I think it
should have been done sooner, but it was not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before becoming CIA director, Deutch served as deputy secretary of defense
from 1994 to 1995. He now acts as a consultant for several organizations with
defense contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said Deutch's broad Pentagon security clearances were revoked when the
CIA acted, but he retains access to ``some top-secret information in terms of a
narrow area of technology.'' Limited industrial clearances normally are given to
defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
	   The secretary said taking those away would require a legal determination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There must be a compelling level of evidence that would support removing
him from income-producing activities,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Department lawyers will have to decide whether the evidence against
him is ``sufficient that we can, with due-process, terminate the relationship,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said he has no evidence Deutch had compromised any Pentagon
intelligence or operations in his activities.
</P>
<P>
	   The industrial clearance allows Deutch, a professor at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, to serve as a paid consultant on defense contracts with
the MIT, SAIC Corp. and Raytheon Corp., Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Porter Goss, R-Fla.,
expressed surprise Monday that Deutch had kept his Pentagon security clearances
even after having his CIA ones revoked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that the removal of access to sensitive material should apply
universally,'' Goss said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   A former CIA intelligence officer himself, Goss said Deutch's ``admission
that he used bad judgment'' should result in a penalty that would apply equally
to the Pentagon.

<HEADLINE> Inflation-Impeding Productivity Up  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A key to economic vitality that also bodes well for
continuing low inflation posted the best performance last year since 1992, a 2.9
percent uptick in American workers' productivity for 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   A burst in fourth-quarter productivity -- defined as the amount of output
for each hour of work -- contributed to the strong performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Productivity rose by a larger-than-expected 5 percent annual rate in the
final three months of last year, the biggest growth spurt since the fourth
quarter of 1992, the Labor Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street was buoyed by the report, which suggested the economy can
continue to grow briskly without triggering inflation as long as healthy
productivity gains are recorded.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones stock average was up around 60 points and the Nasdaq around 80
points in afternoon trading. Bonds prices rose as the yield on the bellwether
30-year Treasury bonds fell to 6.25 percent from 6.34 percent late Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The productivity miracle has provided another astounding picture of the
U.S. economy," said First Union economist David Orr.
</P>
<P>
	   The improvement in last year's productivity marked the strongest gain since
a 4.1 percent increase in 1992. In 1998, productivity rose 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's called using every worker just about as efficiently as possible,"
said Joel Naroff, economist with Naroff Economic Advisors.
</P>
<P>
	   Healthy productivity gains are the keys to prosperity and rising living
standards, economists said. Sizable gains means companies can pay employees
more, hold the line on prices and still deliver increased profits to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   Generally, productivity goes up when the unemployment rate -- now at a
30-year low of 4 percent -- goes down, particularly when the economy is growing
rapidly, economists said. Companies look to increase worker output to help keep
up with robust demand.
</P>
<P>
	   There's a possibility that productivity gains can be threatened when labor
markets are as tight as they are now, however, because employers can have
trouble finding scarce workers to fill openings.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists said that didn't happen last year as employers managed to squeeze
more productivity out of workers, which the economists credited to faster
computers and other technological advances.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're continuing to enjoy the thrust of computers and other information
technologies. That is really the primary driver of productivity gains," said
Wells Fargo economist Sung Won Sohn.
</P>
<P>
	   But if productivity falters, pressures for higher wages can result in a
sharp run-up in prices. That possibility worries Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan and other economists.
</P>
<P>
	   But in 1999, growth slowed in unit labor costs, a major barometer of
underlying inflation pressures. Those costs rose just 1.8 percent last year,
compared with a 2.4 percent increase in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   And during the fourth quarter, unit labor costs fell at a 1 percent rate,
the biggest drop since the first quarter of 1996. In the third quarter, unit
labor costs declined by a 0.3 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve bumped up interest rates by a quarter of a percentage
point last week, the fourth increase since June, to slow the sizzling economy
and keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the good news on productivity, many economists continue to believe
Fed policy-makers probably will raise rates again at their next meeting on March
21. But analysts said Tuesday's the report reduces the odds of aggressive rate
action by the Fed.
</P>
<P>
	   "While the latest productivity report should relieve inflation anxieties, it
will not keep the Fed from tightening," said Merrill Lynch economist Stan
Shipley.
</P>
<P>
	   The gains in productivity also suggests that "the economic expansion will
continue through 2000," said Richard Yamarone, economist with Argus Research
Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   The economy entered a historic 107 months of uninterrupted growth last week,
surpassing the record 106 months set in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with robust economic growth, inflation has been tame. The "core" rate
of inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, rose just 1.9
percent last year, the best performance since 1969.

<HEADLINE> Regents want to grade schools by number of students passing state  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York public school students aren't the only ones
facing tougher grading under the state Board of Regents' push to raise academic
standards in the state.
<P>
	   Education Commissioner Richard Mills and Regents Chancellor Carl Hayden on
Tuesday announced a plan to grade the state's schools by the number of students
that pass the state's new, tougher tests for elementary, intermediate and high
school students.
</P>
<P>
	   The state already puts out yearly report cards and statistical breakdowns on
the schools. The worst performing schools are put on the state's Schools Under
Registration Review (SURR) list.
</P>
<P>
	   But the new grading system - categorizing schools as either "Exceeding
Standards," "Meeting Standards," "Below Standards," or "Farthest From Standards"
when fully phased in - will let parents know in a simple fashion how their
children's school is doing when it comes to state standards, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   "What this adds is an evaluation of the school in relation to the
standards," Mills said. "It's quite a bit beyond what we had."
</P>
<P>
	   The report card "just gives you all the data," Deputy Commissioner James
Kadamus said. "There's no qualitative judgment being made, there's no criteria
for evaluating it. And so it's left up to local districts to tell you whether
they think they're doing well or not doing well."
</P>
<P>
	   "This says, 'Are you doing well against what the state is setting as a
standard for schools?"'
</P>
<P>
	   Mills would make the judgment on the schools based on the scores of fourth
and eighth grade math and English tests. High schools would be graded on the
state's senior Regents exams and how many students graduate.
</P>
<P>
	   Mills said he would decide annually how students should be doing on those
exams, which will decide what category the schools fall under. "And each year,
those numbers are going to go up," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The lower three categories would go into effect immediately if approved,
Hayden said. "Exceeding Standards" would only be available starting in the 2001
school year, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   An extra category of "Rapidly Improving" can be added behind any category to
let parents know their children's school is making improvements, Hayden said.
"We felt it was important to recognize improvement," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Regents will vote on the plan in May.
</P>
<P>
	   Schools that don't make the grade - falling into the "Below Standards" or
"Farthest From Standards" categories - would face extra Education Department
supervision while schools that do well would face less supervision, Mills said.
Details are still being worked out, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Regents on Tuesday also asked the state Legislature to approve $90
million in spending over the next five years to improve the state's libraries.
Sixty percent of the state libraries are more than 50 years old, almost half
lack full accessibility for the disabled and 38 percent don't have adequate
wiring for the Internet, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, 73 percent of New York households use public libraries, he said.
The national average is 63 percent, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Something needs to be done," he said.

	   The tobacco industry has been under mounting pressure for selling a product
the American Cancer Society calls the leading cause of cancer. All 50 states
reached settlements in which tobacco companies will pay them $246 billion for
the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department also sued the industry last September, seeking
additional billions of dollars to repay federal health-insurance costs. And, a
Florida jury ruled in a class-action lawsuit last July that the cigarette makers
produced a defective and deadly product. That jury is now considering damages
that industry lawyers say could exceed $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges the major tobacco companies fixed prices
during meetings of cigarette company lawyers who "frequently discussed, and
reached agreements regarding, future price increases for cigarettes."
</P>
<P>
	   Daniel W. Donahue, deputy general counsel for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., one
of the defendants, said the lawsuit "is totally without any basis in fact or
law, and we certainly intend to defend the case."
</P>
<P>
	   Donahue said the issues of price increases and competitive practices "were
always avoided" at the meetings of industry lawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael York, an attorney for Philip Morris, said the lawsuit was "so
meritless on its face the only conclusion one can draw is that it's simply a
maneuver by lawyers for more fees."
</P>
<P>
	   Those named defendant include Philip Morris Cos.; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Holdings Inc.; Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., a unit of British American
Tobacco Co., Ltd.; Lorillard Tobacco Co., a unit of Loews Corp.; and Liggett
Group, a unit of Brooke Group Ltd.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit said there was virtually no cigarette price competition from the
1950s until 1980, when Liggett introduced low-price "generic discount"
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
	   Other companies introduced generic brands, and after a 1993 price war, a
price increase announced by Philip Morris signaled to the other companies "that
they would resume their illegal agreement not to compete in the U.S. cigarette
market on the basis of price," the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
	   On numerous occasions in the following years, cigarette companies quickly
matched each other's price increases, the lawsuit said. Wholesalers often
received notification of price increases from the tobacco companies within hours
or even within minutes of each other, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies also worked together to fix prices and allocate market shares
outside the United States, the lawsuit alleged.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington D.C. firm of Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld &AMP; Toll is leading a
group of 25 law firms that filed the case.

	   Barnes &AMP; Noble.com's Losses Widen
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnes &AMP; Noble.com's sales in the fourth quarter
more than tripled from a year ago, but its losses widened as the
Internet retailer spent heavily during the holiday season to lure
shoppers to its Web site. The New York-based company said today it
lost $38.36 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $31.35
million a year ago. On a per-share basis, the losses remained the
same at 27 cents a share. The figures were in line with the
estimates of Wall Street analysts. Fourth-quarter sales rose to
$82.13 million from $25.88 million a year ago. Barnes &AMP; Noble stock
was down 11/16 at 11 this afternoon.

	   Productivity Leaps in 4th Quarter
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A surge in American workers' productivity
during the final three months of last year helped boost their
productivity growth for all of 1999 to 2.9 percent, the best
performance in seven years. Productivity -- defined as output per
hour of work -- rose at a 5 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter, the strongest showing since the last three months of 1992,
the Labor Department said today. That was an even better showing
than the 4.3 percent rate of increase many analysts were
forecasting. The fourth-quarter gain matched the upwardly revised
rate of growth in the third quarter. For all 1999, productivity
rose 2.9 percent, the largest spurt of growth since a 4.1 percent
gain in 1992. In 1998, productivity rose 2.8 percent.

	   Autobahn Crashes Hurt Audi Make
</P>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The sleek, ground-hugging Audi TT won
acclaim for its futurist design and responsive handling when the
German roadster came to market in 1998 -- selling nearly 55,000
worldwide and 6,000 in the United States since. But what was once a
driver's dream machine has been tarnished by a series of deadly
crashes in which speed-loving Germans pushed the high performance
car to the limit, lost control and rocketed off the autobahn. Now
Audi is responding to a wave of consumer concern with a voluntary
recall to retrofit the cars with the latest braking technology
called ESP, or Electronic Stability Program. It's the second stage
in a recall program that earlier upgraded the car's suspensions and
installed a rear spoiler.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today after the government reported that

can continue to grow without giving rise to inflation.

<P>
	   Stocks benefited from the Labor Department's report today that productivity
-- defined as the amount of output for each hour of work -- rose at a 5 percent
annual rate in the fourth quarter, the strongest showing since the last three
months of 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The report surpassed analysts' expectations and reassured many investors
that inflation remains under control. Stocks have been pressured so far this
year by worries that the Federal Reserve will sharply raise interest rates to
keep inflation from accelerating.
</P>
<P>
	   While most economists see little evidence of actual inflation, four rate
increases since last June have done little to slow the growth of the U.S.
economy. Analysts said today's report indicated that while the Fed may continue
raising rates at its next meeting, an increase sharp enough to derail stocks
isn't likely.
</P>
<P>
	   "This report will probably not prevent the Fed from tightening on March 21,
but it will keep them on the course of gradualism and caution," said David Orr,
chief economist at First Union Securities Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue-chip stocks, which have been under heavy pressure from investors who
fear that higher interest rates will cut into corporate profits, rebounded
sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial services stocks fared best. American Express rose 2 3/8 to 164
13/16 and J.P. Morgan rose 1 11/16 to 120 9/16.

	   On the Nasdaq, Amazon.com rose 8 1/4 to 83 1/4. A potential rival, online
retailer Buy.com Inc., rose in its initial public offering of stock. Shares were
priced at 13, opened at 30 1/8 and were trading at 25 7/16. Buy.com bills itself
as an Internet superstore, providing a wide range of products after originally
concentrating on computers.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S.-traded shares of news organization Reuters rose 23 5/8 to 123. The

percent.

<HEADLINE> Defense lawyers grill Louima on past lies, contradictions in story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Citing a string of lies and contradictions made under
oath, defense attorneys sought Tuesday to impugn Abner Louima's claim that an
officer who arrested him during a 1997 street disturbance also took part in the
police station assault on Louima.
<P>
	   Ronald Fischetti, the lawyer for former Officer Charles Schwarz, hammered
Louima on questions ranging from what happened in the precinct house bathroom to
his failure to pay income taxes and his claim, later disavowed, that police had
referred to a supposed crackdown on minorities as "Giuliani time."
</P>
<P>
	   Under cross-examination, Louima said for the first time that he had seen the
bathroom door close as he lay prostrate on the floor, just before Officer Justin
Volpe rammed a stick into his rectum. On Monday, he had testified only that he
"heard the door open and close."
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph Tacopina, who represents defendant Thomas Wiese, also reminded the
Haitian immigrant that less than a week after the Aug. 9, 1997, incident, he
told a state grand jury he didn't know what the second officer in the room was
doing and that nobody was holding him down - as opposed to his current statement
that the same officer who arrested him and drove him to the station had held him
down during the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   "Five days after the incident, your memory wasn't as good as it was today?"
Tacopina asked. "Yes," the witness replied.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, 34, Wiese, 37, and Thomas Bruder, 34, are charged with conspiring
to obstruct justice by concealing Schwarz's participation in the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   They claim that Schwarz, who is appealing a previous conviction for
violating Louima's civil rights, was never in the bathroom and that Wiese walked
in during the incident but did not take part or interfere.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense also grilled Louima on contradictory statements from previous
testimony as to whether Volpe or the unidentified second officer had put his
foot on Louima's mouth after he cried out in pain.
</P>
<P>
	   In earlier testimony, Louima said he could not distinguish the driver from
his partner because they had similar haircuts and "looked alike." He now says
the driver - meaning Schwarz - was bigger across the shoulders, something he
hadn't said previously.
</P>
<P>
	   By impugning Louima's credibility, the defense sought to convince the
Brooklyn federal court jury that his version of events is not trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischetti focused at length on Louima's famous assertion to reporters,
prosecutors and the state grand jury in 1997 that police at the arrest scene had
said it was "Giuliani time."
</P>
<P>
	   The comment, implying that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had given police a free
hand to abuse people of color, triggered a storm of protests including an
anti-police march by thousands across the Brooklyn Bridge.
</P>
<P>
	   Louima later admitted the story was false, saying he had been induced to
tell it by a family adviser "to get the people responsible for justice to take
it (his case) seriously."
</P>
<P>
	   "You knew it was perjury, but you've never been charged?" asked Fischetti.
</P>
<P>
	   "No, sir," Louima said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischetti also pressured Louima to admit he never paid income taxes on
$10,000 he earned as a used car salesman in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is there any doubt that the law requires you to pay taxes?" asked the
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes, sir," replied Louima, apparently not understanding the question.
</P>
<P>
	   In Monday's opening, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad said Schwarz,
Wiese and Bruder had conspired in "lie after lie after lie" to protect Schwarz
from criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
	   "This case is about a search for the truth as to what Charles Schwarz did
and the efforts of these three defendants to keep the truth from coming out,"
Vinegrad said.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rican clemency inspires bill to revamp pardon process  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Inspired by President Clinton's hotly debated offer of
clemency to 16 Puerto Rican nationalists, a New York congressman unveiled
legislation on Tuesday to include victims in the pardon process.
<P>
	   The Clinton administration came under fire for the clemency offer,
especially when it was revealed that the victims of FALN bombings were left out
of the process even as advocates of the Puerto Rican prisoners attended meetings
with high-level administration officials.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were ignored," said Joe Connor, whose father was killed in the bombing
of Fraunces Tavern in New York City some 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pardon Attorney Reform and Integrity Act, sponsored in the House by Rep.
Vito Fossella, R-Staten Island, would require the U.S. Pardon Attorney to
solicit input from crime victims and to keep them apprised of key events in the
clemency process. It would also mandate that law enforcement agencies be
notified when a clemency procedure was initiated and would seek their input as
well.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said Tuesday the agency was
already considering internal regulations to incorporate more victim input after
the flap over the Puerto Ricans release.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said there were clear constitutional
concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   "The partisan nature of this effort is evident in how clearly it conflicts
with the constitution," Kennedy said. "We don't enact executive orders telling
Congress how to schedule its floor debates. They have no business interfering in
the constitutional separation of powers and they know better."
</P>
<P>
	   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the
bill was not intended to infringe on the president's exclusive right grant to
grant clemency. But because the president typically seeks input from the pardon
attorney and the Justice Department in clemency proceedings, it would provide a
chance for the victim and law enforcement views to be heard.
</P>
<P>
	   "It does not dictate how the president uses the pardon power given to him in
the Constitution," the Utah Republican said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The president will still be able to disregard the pardon attorneys reports,
use another agency, ask anyone in the world for advice or exercise pardon power
without anyone's counsel."
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch, who held several Congressional hearings on the clemency, is
sponsoring the bill in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The FALN - the Spanish initials for the Armed Forces of National Liberation
- was responsible for a wave of bombings in the late 1970s and early 198s that
left six dead and scores wounded. The Clinton administration maintains that none
of those offered clemency in August were directly responsible for killing or
wounding anyone.
</P>
<P>
	   The president has said he extended clemency because of the
disproportionately long sentences they were surviving. Clinton required all
those accepting the offer to renounce violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 16 jailed nationalists offered clemency, 14 accepted.
</P>
<P>
	   Some critics claim the president made the clemency offer to help his wife's
U.S. Senate bid in New York, which is home to some 1.3 million Puerto Ricans.
Mrs. Clinton first supported the offer then changed her mind and condemned it,
much to the dismay of the state's Puerto Rican leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Fossella denied that the bill was being introduced to further embarrass the
first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think she's doing a good enough job of that on her own," Fossella said.
"This has nothing to do, in my opinion, with her candidacy for the Senate. It
has everything to do with the power and privilege invested in the president of
the United States."

<HEADLINE> GOP Criticizes Clinton's Budget  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans criticized President Clinton's $1.84 trillion
budget Tuesday as a ``roadmap for doing nothing'' on GOP-sought tax cuts because
it supposes politically unrealistic progress on long-term problems of Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In effect, you're sort of ruling out a tax cut,'' Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers at a hearing Tuesday. ``You're sort of laying down conditions
that you have to recognize are not going to be realized.''
</P>
<P>
	   At hearings on both sides of Capitol Hill, Clinton administration officials
and their Democratic allies repeated their theme that modest tax cuts should fit
into a larger framework that first uses projected budget surpluses to pay down
debt, begin guaranteeing the future solvency of the two big retirement programs
and ensure adequate government spending levels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It can be done,'' Summers said. ``It needs to be done in the right way, at
the right time.''
</P>
<P>
	   The fiscal 2001 budget Clinton submitted Monday includes $351 billion over
10 years in tax relief geared toward lower- and middle-class people, although
the net tax cut falls to only $170 billion over the decade once an accompanying
$181 billion in tax increases on cigarettes, corporations and others are
factored in.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans want much larger tax cuts, to come only from the budget surplus
without offsetting tax increases. They plan to start implementing that this week
with House votes on a 10-year, $182 billion bill to cut income taxes for
millions of married couples, including those who pay more tax than if they were
single. It is the first of several tax-cut measures likely to move in the
GOP-led Congress this year, each one a part of a 10-year, $792 billion tax cut
Clinton vetoed last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., called the GOP approach a
``tax-cut feeding frenzy'' that ignores the greater needs of Social Security and
Medicare. ``They must come up with a budget that puts aside real money to pay
off debt and strengthen Social Security and Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
	   Toward that end, House Democrats plan to offer an alternative marriage
penalty bill that would cost $89 billion over 10 years but would not take effect
until the retirement programs and public debt are settled. That bill is about
twice the size of Clinton's $45 billion marriage penalty proposal, mainly
because it includes more couples that have only one household income than does
the president's.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans noted that Clinton has not submitted a Social Security rescue
plan and has not agreed to put the brakes on government spending until these
long-term questions are settled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In many ways, it seems to me to be a road map for doing nothing,'' Roth
said about the president's tax-cut restrictions.
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury Secretary Summers warned that using rosy surplus projections for
irreversible acts such as deep tax cuts could trigger new deficits or force
future tax increases if the economy falls short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a new economy, but it makes old virtues all the more important,''
Summers said. ``Those virtues are savings and prudence.''
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond the tax fight, Republicans complained that the budget proposed dozens
of new government programs and would shower largesse on favored political
constituencies, although independent analysts said the budget's growth as a
share of the economy would be the lowest in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have distributed money to virtually every sector,'' House Budget
Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, told White House officials. ``This is a
Santa Claus approach.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, Education Secretary Richard Riley told the Senate Budget
Committee that the president's proposals for tax credits to pay interest on
school improvement bonds was a ``wise use'' of the tax code.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some might argue that the growing federal budget surplus should be used
for broad-based cuts, but what I see and hear when I visit schools is very
different,'' Riley said. ``What I hear is very near to a consensus on paying
down debt and investing in the education of our children.''
</P>
<P>
	   Again, Republicans took issue with Clinton's spending levels. Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., said if Congress gave Clinton all of his requests ``then the
succession of presidents won't get anything at all.''

<HEADLINE> Bank of New York, Regulators Agree  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Bank of New York, currently embroiled in a Russian
money-laundering investigation, signed an agreement Tuesday with state and
federal regulators promising to beef up the monitoring of its accounts for
"suspicious activity."
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement comes four months after Thomas Renyi, chairman of the Bank of
New York, admitted the bank had been lax in handling $7 billion that moved
through its accounts from Russian sources between 1996 and August of last year.
</P>
<P>
	   To remedy those lapses, the Bank of New York signed an agreement with the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the New York State Banking Department. It
was not ordered to pay any penalties.
</P>
<P>
	   In the agreement, the Bank of New York pledged to enhance its customer
screening program, report suspicious activities and present a plan describing
the steps the bank "will continue to take to strengthen compliance with regard
to anti-money laundering procedures and suspicious activity reporting."
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the money that moved through the bank allegedly came from Russian
importers attempting to evade taxes. Investigators also are investigating
whether some of the money came from criminal activity, and were transferred
through accounts at the Bank of New York in order to mask their origin.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine accounts at the Bank of New York were connected to Peter Berlin, a
Russian emigre, and his company, Benex International. Berlin is married to Lucy
Edwards, an ex-Bank of New York executive. Both Berlin and Edwards, together
with their partner Aleskey Volkov, have been charged by the Manhattan U.S.
attorney's office with conspiring to operate a wire-transfer business.
</P>
<P>
	   All three defendants have denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony last September before the House Banking Committee, Renyi
acknowledged, "Allowing these accounts to remain open and active without
sufficient questioning was a lapse on the part of the bank."
</P>
<P>
	   Though some bank employees raised questions about the excessive activity in
the accounts, Renyi said, "The questions were not pursued with sufficient vigor
or follow-through, and the questioners relied too heavily on the fact that Mr.
Berlin was married to a well-regarded bank officer, Lucy Edwards, who had
referred the accounts."
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Tuesday, he said the agreement with regulators "reaffirms our
commitment to meet the highest operating and ethical standards in everything we
do."

<HEADLINE> Medical examiner says Diallo hit while on the ground  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - When the shooting started, Amadou Diallo was
paralyzed by a bullet that damaged his spinal cord.
<P>
	   By the end, another bullet entered the bottom of Diallo's right shoe and
exited the top of a toe, a medical examiner testified Tuesday at the murder
trial of four police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   "You couldn't be upright to sustain (the toe wound), unless someone was
underneath the floor shooting upward," Dr. Joseph Cohen told jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen testified that several more of the 19 bullets that struck Diallo
entered him while he was falling or already down - further proof, prosecutors
say, that the four officers intended to kill the unarmed West African immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are any number of wounds that could have been inflicted while he was
going down," said Cohen, who worked in New York City at the time of Diallo's
death.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen - the last of 12 prosecution witnesses - is now with the Riverside
County, Calif., medical examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28, Sean Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy,
27 - all white - have pleaded innocent to charges they murdered the unarmed
black man by firing 41 bullets into the vestibule of his Bronx apartment
building at 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999, without warning. If convicted, they face
a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense claims Diallo ignored orders to halt, then pulled out a black
wallet that appeared to be a gun. It also argues that the bullets from the
officers' high-powered semiautomatic weapons were fired fast enough for Diallo
to stay on his feet, possibly up against a wall, throughout the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Testifying in sometimes gruesome detail, Cohen used morgue photos and
anatomical diagrams to show the jurors how the full metal jacket bullets took
deadly, crisscrossing paths from Diallo's chest to toes.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's mother, Kadiatou, who has attended the trial each day since it
began last week, was not in the courtroom. At one point, Supreme Court Justice
Joseph Teresi barred a crime scene photo of the body from being shown on
television; the trial is being broadcast live.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 19 bullets that hit Diallo, only three remained in his body, Cohen
said. A ballistics report shows at least two of the three were fired by Carroll.
Another bullet passed through Diallo's body and pierced his pager.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen focused on a bullet that hit Diallo square in the chest before tearing
through his aorta - the main vessel carrying blood to the heart - hitting his
spine and exiting his back.
</P>
<P>
	   Because there was little or no bleeding from other wounds, Cohen said he
believes the aortic wound was "inflicted early in the sequence," causing the
victim to lose nearly half the blood in his body. He estimated that the same
bullet would have caused the victim to fall within two seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said that another wound - in which the bullet hit the lower part of
his right leg and lodged behind the knee - "in my opinion is a wound that was
inflicted when he was necessarily down." In describing yet another wound, this
one to Diallo's left leg, Cohen noted the "strikingly upward trajectory of the
bullet."
</P>
<P>
	   The pathologist also said that he found whole bullets and bullet fragments
in Diallo's body and clothes and that toxicological tests found no traces of
drugs or alcohol in the body.
</P>
<P>
	   On cross-examination, defense attorney Stephen Worth charged that Cohen was
"grasping at straws" with some of his conclusions. Cohen admitted he could not
be certain which bullet hit Diallo first. He also conceded he made up to 20
revisions in his autopsy report.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying of Diallo by the four officers produced a wave of pretrial
publicity and protests alleging widespread abuse of minorities by police. In
response, an appeals court moved the trial to Albany.

<HEADLINE> Bradley says Republicans 'bottom-fish' on flag  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Democrat Bill Bradley lashed out at the two
leading Republican presidential candidates Tuesday, accusing them of trying to
"bottom-fish for votes" by refusing to condemn flying of the Confederate flag
over the state Capitol.
<P>
	   "That flag shows the true colors of the Republicans who want to be
president," declared Bradley. "That flag should not fly another day over the
state Capitol."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley went to historically black Benedict College to launch his stinging
assault on Republicans, generally sparing Democratic rival Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   "The weakness and passivity of the Republicans on this issue is appalling,"
said Bradley. "At a time when leadership, courage and principles should guide
our leaders on this issue, both George Bush and John McCain have instead
embraced the narrow political expediency of the Republican Party."
</P>
<P>
	   The issue is a hot one in South Carolina, and Bradley was sending a clear
signal to minority voters in important early states like New York and
California, part of a big round of primaries March 7 that could settle the
Democratic presidential nomination. South Carolina Democrats vote two days
later.
</P>
<P>
	   The Confederate flag has flown over the South Carolina Statehouse since
1962. Flag backers argue that it stands for the state's Southern heritage, while
critics argue it symbolizes slavery and a racist past.
</P>
<P>
	   State senators continued to grapple with the issue Tuesday as
behind-the-scene discussions about possibly moving the flag to a park on
Statehouse grounds moved to impassioned speeches on the Senate floor. But there
was no agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Both McCain and Bush have argued that flying the flag is a local issue with
which they don't want to interfere. That drew scorn from Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is expediency that ignores a hateful and shameful past in an effort to
bottom-fish for votes from the most right-wing elements of the Republican
Party," said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   While the fight between Gore and Bradley has heated up in recent days,
Bradley spent most of Tuesday bashing Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a clear difference between the two parties," said Bradley. "Al
Gore and I say take the flag down. John McCain and George Bush say leave it up."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also criticized Bush for delivering a speech last week at Bob Jones
University, which lost its tax-exempt status in the 1970s because of racial
discrimination. The school now admits black students but still bans interracial
dating.
</P>
<P>
	   "By simply going there he was sending a message that the new conservatism
isn't a whole lot different than the old conservatism," said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides said Bradley wanted to underscore the differences between the parties,
and McCain and Bush are stumping hard for the state's GOP primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is spending heavy amounts of campaign time focusing on racial
harmony issues. He went to Florida Monday to tout affirmative action, and was
heading for Ohio and a town meeting on diversity.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley did cast one glancing blow at Gore, again bringing up fund-raising
scandals that dogged the vice president in the 1996 election that Bradley argues
will be fodder for Republicans this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need a Democratic presidential candidate who isn't just dedicated to
these issues, but who can win," said Bradley. "That means a Democratic candidate
who talks straight with the people, who levels with them and who cannot be
attacked with the fund-raising scandals of 1996 that are a stain on our party."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who argues that racial harmony is central to his campaign, offered
some of his toughest rhetoric to date on the flag.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Confederate flag that flies over the Capitol of this state was flown
for over a century in defense of slavery and segregation," said Bradley. "That
flag is not a symbol of Southern heritage. That flag is a symbol of the fight to
preserve segregation."

<HEADLINE> GOP Introduces Bill on Clemency  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prompted by last year's presidential clemency for Puerto
Rican separatists, Republicans introduced a bill Tuesday that would give victims
and law enforcement more say in the clemency process.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure, said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
will ensure that Justice Department officials, ``when assisting the president in
a clemency review, focus on public safety, not politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation, sponsored in the House by Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y., would
require the Justice Department to notify victims of key events in the clemency
process. Law enforcement would be given the opportunity to express views on the
impact of clemency on the individuals affected, and whether granting clemency
will increase the threat of terrorism or other criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch said the legislation had the support of groups such as the National
Organization for Victim Assistance, the Fraternal Order of Police and the FBI
Agent's Association, but was meeting resistance at the Justice Department, where
the constitutionality of the measure has been questioned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They don't want this bill filed, they've made that clear,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said the administration was
already working with Congress on legislation that addressed the concerns of
crime victims.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will certainly take a look at the (Hatch) legislation and consider the
constitutional implications,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch said the measure does not dictate how the president uses the pardon
power given to him in the Constitution, and is meant only to give the president
a wider range of views if he turns to the Justice Department's Office of Pardon
Attorney for advise on a clemency request.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation grew out of last August's controversy after President
Clinton offered clemency to 16 Puerto Rican separatists affiliated with the
FALN, or Armed Forces of National Liberation, the group held responsible for a
wave of bombings in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Fourteen accepted the offer,
which was conditioned on the prisoners renouncing violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Some law enforcement groups opposed the action, and Republicans accused the
White House of trying to curry political favor with the Puerto Rican community.
The White House denied that politics was involved, saying those offered clemency
had served lengthy sentences and were not directly involved in activities that
killed or maimed people.
</P>
<P>
	   Family members of two victims who died in a 1975 FALN bombing joined Hatch
and Fossella at their news conferences: Joe Connor, who lost his father, and
Diana Berger Ettenson, who lost her husband.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The power of clemency is like no other power,'' Berger Ettenson said. ``It
must be well thought-out and well used.''

<HEADLINE> Deutch Gives Up Pentagon Clearances  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Deutch, the former CIA director who has admitted to
agency security violations, asked the Pentagon today to discontinue his Defense
Department industrial security clearances.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon officials said they would do so, although there was no official
announcement of the action.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch said in a letter to Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre that he has
no need for access to Pentagon classified information and therefore prefers that
his clearances be discontinued. He lost his CIA clearance last summer after
downloading sensitive files into his home computer.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch's letter was transmitted to Hamre today by his attorney at the
Washington law office of Williams &AMP; Connolly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has been Mr. Deutch's practice since his CIA clearance was suspended by
Director Tenet last August to avoid access to any classified information,
including classified documents, meetings and conversations,'' the letter states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Therefore, there is no need to continue these industrial security
clearances at this time and he asks that they be discontinued.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the time CIA Director George Tenet suspended Deutch's security clearance
at the agency, the Pentagon cut off Deutch's access to Defense Intelligence
Agency information. But the Pentagon allowed Deutch to keep his industrial
security clearances, which allowed him to have access to some classified
information.
</P>
<P>
	   Before becoming CIA director, Deutch served as deputy secretary of defense
from 1994 to 1995. He now is a professor at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and acts as a consultant for several organizations with defense
contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   After weekend news reports about Deutch's continued access to classified
defense information, the Pentagon's inspector general asked the CIA for its
evidence on Deutch's security breaches, Cohen told reporters. ``I think it
should have been done sooner, but it was not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before becoming CIA director, Deutch served as deputy secretary of defense
from 1994 to 1995. He now acts as a consultant for several organizations with
defense contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said Deutch's broad Pentagon security clearances were revoked when the
CIA acted, but he retains access to ``some top-secret information in terms of a
narrow area of technology.'' Limited industrial clearances normally are given to
defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
	   The secretary said taking those away would require a legal determination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There must be a compelling level of evidence that would support removing
him from income-producing activities,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Department lawyers will have to decide whether the evidence against
him is ``sufficient that we can, with due-process, terminate the relationship,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said he has no evidence Deutch had compromised any Pentagon
intelligence or operations in his activities.
</P>
<P>
	   The industrial clearance allows Deutch, a professor at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, to serve as a paid consultant on defense contracts with
the MIT, SAIC Corp. and Raytheon Corp., Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Porter Goss, R-Fla.,
expressed surprise Monday that Deutch had kept his Pentagon security clearances
even after having his CIA ones revoked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that the removal of access to sensitive material should apply
universally,'' Goss said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   A former CIA intelligence officer himself, Goss said Deutch's ``admission
that he used bad judgment'' should result in a penalty that would apply equally
to the Pentagon.

<HEADLINE> Officials says revenue being lost to timber thieves who face little  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Three generations of commitment to forests by Mike
Birmingham's family is paying off. The market has never been better, prices have
increased more than 100 percent in three decades and the value of the trees will
only grow.
<P>
	   Yet he's thinking of dropping it all like a towering oak.
</P>
<P>
	   "A logger who comes in can steal a lifetime of profits in one week," said
Birmingham, a 54-year-old Kinderhook tree grower who's been victimized by timber
thieves.
</P>
<P>
	   Poachers are increasingly cutting into the state's $300 million timber
industry that employs 3,000 loggers, keeps 250 sawmills buzzing and supplies the
state's furniture industry.
</P>
<P>
	   But as lucrative as the timber market is, it can't beat its dark side.
Stealing just two choice trees a week can be a $100,000 annual business, state
and industry officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   "With modern equipment you can illegally take a thousand trees in a day and
do it with impunity," said Birmingham, who is also employed by the state as a
forestry expert.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Adirondacks, thieves stole $250,000 in timber five years ago working
unseen deep in one property owner's forest. In central New York, a thief read an
obituary of a woman in a wooded area and stole $20,000 worth of timber while her
grieving relatives planned her funeral.
</P>
<P>
	   And one group of timber owners is losing at least $100,000 a year, according
to the lowest estimate. That group is New York taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   If ever caught, thieves of trees worth as much as $2,000 each on public land
face prosecution. The fine? $10 a tree.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is outrageous that the fine for damaging or removing trees from the
(state) Forest Preserve has been unchanged since 1909," David Greenwood of the
Adirondack Council said.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one can know exactly how widespread timber theft from the Forest
Preserve is," Greenwood told senators at a hearing Tuesday. "There are too few
enforcement officers to cover the millions of acres of Forest Preserve and there
is no way for a buyer at a mill to discern an illegally cut tree from one that
was legally taken."
</P>
<P>
	   In the state's rich publicly owned forests of Cattaraugus County, $100,000
worth of mature cherry trees highly sought by furniture makers was stolen in
1998. In the process, soil, groundwater and erosion control measures may have
been damaged along with winter shelters for deer.
</P>
<P>
	   In one of the most severe sentences in timber theft in the state, the logger
was sentenced this month to 30 days in jail, ordered to turn over 28 acres of
his own land to the state, and pay a fine - of $15,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The state timber was worth $100,000. If it had grown until it was scheduled
for sale in a couple years, it would have fetched as much as $150,000, said
James Beil, assistant director of lands and forests at the state Department of
Environmental Conservation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate committees on agriculture and rural resources are trying to find
ways to stop this thievery as well as unscrupulous business dealings.
</P>
<P>
	   But most agreed the penalties for the widespread yet often undetected
larceny must be increased for crimes on public and private land.
</P>
<P>
	   In Birmingham's case, he followed sound business practices of assessing his
140 acres, marking its boundaries regularly, managing the forest for optimal
growth of up to 15 percent year, and was still hit by thieves at forests he and
his father own in Cattaraugus County at least four times.
</P>
<P>
	   He found the men he thought stole his best timber on 3 acres in 1992 along
with a neat stack of his logs. He called local police who tried to investigate,
but found it a morass of laws and burdens of proof. He said they chalked it up
to a private business dispute. The logs were released to the logger.
</P>
<P>
	   After spending more than $5,000 in civil proceedings to reclaim the timber,
he was compensated with $9,000. He said the market could have gotten him
$14,000, but he wouldn't have cut it then. If the timber still stood today, he
figures he could get $20,000 for it.
</P>
<P>
	   "The incentive to steal is much greater and the laws haven't changed,"
Birmingham said. "And I'm getting too old to climb the wood lots."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Mulls U.S. Defense System  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a probable one-month testing delay caused by a
mechanical failure in the last U.S. missile interceptor test, President Clinton
intends to decide this summer as scheduled whether to build a national missile
defense, Pentagon officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president has made it very clear that he would ... be in a position to
make a decision sometime this summer,'' Cohen told the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   As Cohen testified about the administration's proposed $277 billion 2001
defense budget, officials at the Pentagon provided a more detailed explanation
of why last month's test failed. And they said the setback makes it likely that
the next test, scheduled for April, will be moved to May.
</P>
<P>
	   Although data from last month's test are still under review, it appears that
the main problem was a leak in a tube carrying coolant to two infrared sensors
aboard the interceptor. Without the proper cooling, the sensors were unable to
``see'' the target warhead, which made the interceptor fly by blindly, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials discussed the coolant problem on condition they not be identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen told senators that despite the malfunction, ``I believe we are on
track'' to determining the feasibility of the intercept technology.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president will be in a position to make a determination, and we will
see, as the tests unfold, whether or not the technology has matured to that
extent and what progress, if any, is made with our European allies as well as
with the Russians,'' Cohen said. Russia and many Western allies in Europe are
critical of the missile defense project.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon officials met Tuesday with officials from Raytheon Corp.,
manufacturer of the interceptor, to discuss when the next test should be.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can confirm there was a nitrogen leak, and it undoubtedly was a

<HEADLINE> Judge postpones arraignment to consider access request  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Kennedy nephew charged in a 1975 murder in
upscale Greenwich will not be arraigned until next month, while a juvenile court
judge considers whether the public should be able to attend.
<P>
	   Michael Skakel, whose father is the brother of Sen. Robert Kennedy's widow,
was to be arraigned in juvenile court on Tuesday. Skakel is 39, but was 15 year
old at the time the victim, Martha Moxley, was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Moxley was also 15. Both families lived in the upscale Belle Haven area of
Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
	   Juvenile court proceedings are ordinarily closed to the public to protect
the youthful defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   Five newspapers - The New York Times, The Hartford Courant, Newsday, The
Advocate of Stamford and the Greenwich Time- had asked Judge Maureen Dennis to
open the proceedings - a request endorsed by Skakel himself.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspapers argued that Skakel is now an adult and the facts of the case
are well known - made public, in fact, by Skakel's attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   After hearing arguments from the prosecution, the defense and lawyers for
the newspapers, Dennis postponed Skakel's arraignment - scheduled for late
Tuesday afternoon - and said she would issue a written ruling on the access
issue early next month.
</P>
<P>
	   "We resent the delays," said Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman. "It's been 25
years. We're ready to get this case going."
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel, who was not present at Tuesday's hearing, "wants as many people as
possible to see how bad this evidence is," Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
	   If the judge rejected the request to open the hearing, the media lawyers had
planned to ask that the arraignment be delayed so they could file an immediate
appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict said he hopes to have the case
moved quickly to adult court. He said he understood the judge's desire to
consider the access request.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a decision that could have a lot of impact on future juvenile
proceedings in Connecticut," Benedict said.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel was charged with murder last month, more than 24 years after Moxley
was found bludgeoned to death.

<HEADLINE> Magician Doug Henning dead at 52  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Doug Henning, the mustachioed hippie magician who helped
repopularize his craft in the 1970s and spoke of giving audiences "a sense of
wonder," has died. He was 52.
<P>
	   Henning had suffered from liver cancer for five months. His office in
Toronto said he died Monday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Henning's showmanship and boyish enthusiasm helped revive a genre that had
lagged in popularity for decades. Several Broadway shows and an annual NBC
television special offered audiences to an entertaining mix of music, comedy and
spectacles like a vanishing elephant.
</P>
<P>
	   "You could see that there was a great deal of joy in what he did," said The
Amazing Kreskin, a friend and fellow performer. "He tended to float through his
work. ... You felt a flavor that you were kind of soaring into another
dimension, and of course, really, that's what he was trying to communicate."
</P>
<P>
	   Born near Winnipeg, Canada, Henning said he first became fascinated with
magic as a child, when he saw a performer levitate a woman on "The Ed Sullivan
Show."
</P>
<P>
	   Henning's shaggy hair, bushy mustache and tie-dyed shirts - replaced later
by more flamboyant shimmery costumes - became well-known in the United States in
the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
	   His rock musical "The Magic Show" ran on Broadway for more than four years
in the '70s. Audiences flocked to see Henning make women disappear in sections
and mix his magic with music and comedy.
</P>
<P>
	   The attention he won on Broadway helped Henning land an NBC special called
"The World of Magic."
</P>
<P>
	   He recreated Harry Houdini's "Water Torture Escape" before a live audience
and NBC made the show an annual event. The shows won an Emmy award and seven
Emmy nominations and made Henning's name.
</P>
<P>
	   He toured the country several times, performing magic for regional
audiences, and returned to Broadway in the 1980s with "Merlin" - nominated for
five Tony awards - and "Doug Henning's World of Magic."
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a kind of Peter Pan who led magic away from the tuxedo approach and
brought it into a modern, fun format," said Phil Willmarth, executive editor of
The Linking Ring magazine, in Durham, N.C. "His real genius was in bringing back
the real terrific illusions of the past, which hadn't been seen by most people
in generations."
</P>
<P>
	   Henning said he wanted to help his audiences recapture a childlike sense of
wonder.
</P>
<P>
	   "Wonder is very necessary in life," he once said. "When we're little kids,
we're filled with wonder for the world - it's fascinating and miraculous. A lot
of people lose that. They become cynical and jaded, especially in modern day
society. Magic renews that wonder."
</P>
<P>
	   A devotee of transcendental meditation, Henning said his life changed when
he met the movement's leader, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, in 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   "He showed that you could have a higher level of outlook on life and not be
simply a mechanical magician," Kreskin said. "His outlook, his spirituality
became part of his performing style."
</P>
<P>
	   In the mid-1980s, Henning stopped performing to devote himself to the
meditation movement full-time.
</P>
<P>
	   He sold many of his illusions to competitor David Copperfield and ran
unsuccessfully in elections in England in 1992 and Canada in the mid-1990s as a
member of the Natural Law party, which was founded by the Maharishi.
</P>
<P>
	   He spent his last years working with the Maharishi on plans for a
transcendental meditation theme park called Veda Land, which he hoped to build
in Niagara Falls, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
	   Henning is survived by his wife, Debbie.

<HEADLINE> SBC To Provide Web to Wider Area  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DALLAS (AP) -- SBC Communications is investing in a provider of high-speed
Internet access as a way to enter new markets, a major condition in the
government's approval of SBC's merger with fellow local phone monopoly
Ameritech.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal announced Tuesday calls for SBC said Telefonos de Mexico, a
frequent partner, to invest $150 million in Network Access Solutions Corp.,
which supplies Web access to businesses via digital subscriber line, or DSL,
primarily on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Telmex and SBC, the local phone provider in most of the Southwest and
Midwest, already hold a small stake in Network Access, and the new agreement
will increase their combined interest to about 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   With the new infusion of cash, Network Access plans to expand from the
Northeast and mid-Atlantic, both dominated by Bell Atlantic, into the
southeastern states served by BellSouth and the western states served by U S
West.
</P>
<P>
	   San Antonio-based SBC will use that network to introduce its own brand of
DSL service in those regions, competing with the other three Baby Bells on their
own turf for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   Last fall, to win federal approval for the Ameritech merger, SBC promised to
introduce local phone and Internet services in 30 new markets served by the
other Baby Bells. The Network Access deal marks the first major initiative to
satisfy those conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is another step that will help us accelerate our expansion into 30
major markets, expand our customer base and enhance service to existing
customers," said Ron Blake, president of SBC Telecom.
</P>
<P>
	   In Tuesday's stock trading, SBC's shares rose 37 1/2 cents to $42.25 on the
New York Stock Exchange, while Network Access fell $1.37 1/2 a share to $33.75
on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An EgyptAir pilot seeking asylum in England who says he
has information about October's deadly crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 will be
interviewed by U.S. accident investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall, whose agency is
investigating the crash that killed 217 people off the coast of Massachusetts,
announced the decision Tuesday to send two staffers to London. He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   EgyptAir pilot Hamdi Hanafi Taha sought asylum last week after landing a
plane at London's Heathrow Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Airline officials say Taha has no special knowledge about the cause of the
Oct. 31 crash near the island of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither American nor Egyptian investigators have released any official
findings on the cause of the crash of the Boeing 767.
</P>
<P>
	   Some U.S. sources have speculated the plane's co-pilot, who died in the
crash, deliberately brought the jet down. Egyptian authorities hotly dispute
that theory. They say the most likely cause is an unexplained problem in the
plane's tail section.

<HEADLINE> Study Looks At McGwire's Supplement  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDSEY TANNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Androstenedione, the supplement used by slugger Mark
McGwire, really does raise testosterone above normal levels and could be
hazardous, Harvard researchers say in a study financed by major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   A study last year found that the over-the-counter drug had no effect on
testosterone levels or strength and instead may promote breast enlargement,
heart disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   The new study lasted just one week and did not measure whether andro can do
what promoters have claimed -- make bigger muscles. But the researchers said
andro could have that effect because it increases levels of the male hormone.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a patient of mine came to me and asked whether he should take
androstenedione, I would caution against it simply because we don't know what
the long-term effects are," said Dr. Benjamin Z. Leder, the Harvard University
endocrinologist who led the study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Side effects of elevated testosterone levels include acne, male pattern
baldness and a decrease in "good" cholesterol, which could lead to heart
disease. In women, high testosterone can also cause increased body hair,
deepening of the voice and other male characteristics.
</P>
<P>
	   Androstenedione supplements are made of a naturally occurring steroid
hormone the body uses to make testosterone. When supplements of testosterone are
taken in high doses, they are known to have an anabolic effect -- increasing
muscle size and strength.
</P>
<P>
	   Andro sales soared after McGwire acknowledged using it in 1998, the year he
hit a record 70 home runs for the St. Louis Cardinals. He has since said he has
stopped using it.
</P>
<P>
	   Andro is considered a dietary supplement, but the federal government is
reviewing whether it should be reclassified as a steroid, which would remove it
from store shelves and make it available by prescription only for legitimate
medical uses.
</P>
<P>
	   It is banned by the Olympics, the NCAA, the NFL and the men's and women's
tennis tours, but not by major league baseball. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig
has been awaiting the Harvard study results to decide whether to take a stronger
stance.
</P>
<P>
	   The study of 42 men found increases in testosterone levels when andro was
taken for seven days in a single daily 300-milligram dose -- an amount that is
probably far smaller than what athletes and bodybuilders use.
</P>
<P>
	   The subjects, ages 20 to 40, were divided into three groups and received
either no androstenedione, 100 mg daily or 300 mg daily.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 300 mg group, testosterone levels in the blood increased by an
average of 34 percent by the seventh day, though levels had returned to normal
by the following day. The lower dose had no significant effect on testosterone
levels, though levels of the female hormone estrogen increased substantially
with both doses.
</P>
<P>
	   An eight-week Iowa State University study published last year in JAMA found
no increased testosterone levels with 300 mg, but the dosages were given in 100
mg increments three times daily. The authors of that study and the new research
said the dosage differences probably explain the new findings.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iowa study also found that andro increased levels of estrogen, which in
men can result in breast enlargement and other feminizing effects.
</P>
<P>
	   The new study results "will be factored into the federal review of the
proper classification" for andro, said Robert Housman, deputy director for
strategic planning for White House drug adviser Barry McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
	   Rob Manfred, executive vice president of labor and human resources for the
baseball owners, said Tuesday there are no immediate plans for a policy change.
"We've had the results for a very short period of time," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Players' union official Gene Orza had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Gary Wadler, an associate professor at New York University's medical
school who has worked with McCaffrey, said the findings should come as no
surprise. He advocates reclassifying androstenedione as a prescription drug.
</P>
<P>
	   "We now see what we all knew, just being in the business," he said.

<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean prices slumped Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade
after rains in Argentina improved crop prospects in that drought-affected
nation. Grains also settled lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Forecasts for more showers pressured soybeans after the overnight rains
lessened concern about crop damage in Argentina, the world's No. 3
soybean-producing nation.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, a U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast projected long-term
U.S. soybean acreage as climbing by 1.2 million acres in 2000-01, at a time when
world supplies already are top-heavy.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn futures were little changed, although the Argentine rains set a bearish
tone.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Mulls U.S. Defense System  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The next U.S. missile interceptor test will likely be
delayed by a month due to a mechanical failure in the last test, but President
Clinton still intends to decide this summer whether to commit to building a
national missile defense, Pentagon officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president has made it very clear that he would ... be in a position to
make a decision sometime this summer,'' Cohen told the Senate Armed Services
Committee while testifying on the administration's proposed $277 billion defense
budget for fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Pentagon officials, meanwhile, provided a more detailed explanation of
why last month's test failed. They said the setback makes it likely that the
next test, scheduled for April, will be moved to May.
</P>
<P>
	   Although data from last month's test is still under review, it appears the
key problem was a leak in a tube carrying coolant to two infrared sensors aboard
the interceptor. Without the proper cooling, the sensors were unable to ``see''
the target warhead, and so the interceptor flew by blindly, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials discussed the coolant problem on condition they not be identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said that despite the malfunction, ``I believe we are on track'' to
determining the feasibility of the intercept technology.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president will be in a position to make a determination and we will
see, as the tests unfold, whether or not the technology has matured to that
extent and what progress, if any, is made with our European allies as well as
with the Russians,'' Cohen said, referring to foreign criticism of the missile
defense project.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon officials met Tuesday with officials from Raytheon Corp.,
manufacturer of the interceptor, to discuss when the next test should take
place.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can confirm there was a nitrogen leak and it undoubtedly was a factor''
in the interceptor's failure to hit its target, one Pentagon official said. ``We
can't say conclusively, though, that it was the only factor.''
</P>
<P>
	   For all but the last six seconds of the interceptor's approximately
eight-minute flight from a U.S. Army range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific,
the indications were that the interceptor would hit its target.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Longer-Acting Presriptions on Way  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer 
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumers over the past decade have grown accustomed to
once-a-day prescription drugs to treat allergies, high blood pressure and other
maladies.
</P>
<P>
	   By the end of next year, get ready for even more convenience: medications
that can be taken once-a-week or even less often. At the forefront of this trend
are new versions of existing medicines that treat osteoporosis, depression,
anemia and growth hormone deficiency.
</P>
<P>
	   The move to longer-acting drugs is intended to make sure people take their
pills, particularly the elderly who often are prescribed multiple drugs to deal
with chronic illnesses. Patients who fail to take all their prescription are
less likely to maintain their health or recuperate faster from an illness,
studies show.
</P>
<P>
	   But there could be a downside to once-a-week doses.
</P>
<P>
	   Some pharmacy experts caution that people may have trouble remembering to
take their drugs if the medication is not part of a daily routine. And they
worry that longer-acting drugs remain longer in the bloodstream, which could
magnify any side effects.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some drugs can be tolerated well once a week, while others may increase the
risk of toxicity," said Dr. Charles Flexner, associate professor of clinical
pharmacology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   Less frequent dosing, though, is a welcome change for people who require
injections.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's hard for a parent to give their kid a shot, so it's fabulous that we
don't have to worry about it every day," said Adrienne Collis, El Segundo,
Calif., who gives her daughter Shannon an injection of human growth hormone in
her arm twice a month.
</P>
<P>
	   Shannon was one of several thousand patients nationwide taking part on tests
on the longer-acting growth hormone, which up to nowhad to be given by injection
every day. Taking the longer-acting drug the past two years, Shannon, 13, has
grown about four inches and now stands 4 feet 7 inches, several inchesbelow
normal.
</P>
<P>
	   By this summer, Genentech Inc. plans to launch its twice-a-month version of
human growth hormone called Nutropin Depot, which was approved in December by
the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Because human growth hormone is often given to children for many years,
getting a weekly shot instead of daily "is the biggest new development since the
development of human growth hormone itself," said Dr. Mitchell Geffner, chief of
pediatric endocrinology at the Mattel Children's Hospital at the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug companies believe more patients will take all of their medicine if they
only need one dose a week, meaning fewer pills will sit unused in medicine
cabinets, leading to a rise in sales of refills. Companies also are expected to
be able to charge more for the newer medicines. Prices have yet to be set for
the new series of longer-lasting drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "The logic is pretty compelling," said Dr. Marty Silverstein, who leads the
health group at the Boston Consulting Group. He said at least 25 percent of
prescriptions are wasted because people don't take all their medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other companies developing longer-acting drugs, Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. this
spring is expected to apply for FDA approval for a weekly version of its
top-selling antidepressant Prozac, now given once-a-day. Merck &AMP; Co. is awaiting
FDA approval for a weekly version of its once-a-day osteoporosis pill Fosamax.
Amgen and Johnson &AMP; Johnson are also working on weekly drugs to treat anemia in
patients receiving chemotherapy and kidney dialysis.
</P>
<P>
	   "History tells us the drugs with the better formulations that are more
patient-friendly win hands down," said Steve Arlington, head of pharmaceutical
research at the PriceWaterhouseCoopers consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug companies have been able to develop longer-acting medicines by using
higher dosages and altering the mechanism in which the medicine is released into
the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
	   Still years away is the development of once-a-lifetime drugs with the help
of gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
	   Health insurers also are helping fuel the need for medicines given less
frequently. "Insurance companies want to make sure people take the drugs they
are paying for," said Stephen Tang, a national director of A.T. Kearney health
care consulting practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug companies have some experience with drugs taken less than once a day.
For example, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn makes the injectable contraceptive Depo Provera,
which is taken once every three months. Though Depo Provera has been used in the
United States since 1992, sales still lag far behind daily birth control pills.
Analysts say women don't want to be bothered going to the doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
	   But injections at home are a convenience for youngsters like Shannon Collis,
who gets a shot of growth hormone every other Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Shannon Collis said if she had to get an injection of growth hormone every

<HEADLINE> D.C. Cops Seek Payment From Govt.  </HEADLINE>
   By DERRILL HOLLY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- City officials pressed Congress on Tuesday to give local
police annual payments to help cover the costs of security at events like the
Million Man March, national abortion protests and demonstrations near foreign
embassies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've expended almost $4 million out of our budget to cover overtime
costs,'' said Chief Charles H. Ramsey told a Capitol Hill news conference,
citing several activities in the past 12 months that generated significant
expenses for his department.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the New Year's Eve's American Millennium Celebration was held on
the National Mall, the city police department provided the lion's share of
security for the event, Ramsey noted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had 700 people that I devoted to assist with that,'' said Ramsey, who
also mentioned the NATO 50th Anniversary in April and demonstrations linked to a
planned Neo-Nazi rally in August as examples of events that cost district
taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars each.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the events are usually peaceful, district police are routinely
called out to augment smaller contingents deployed by the U.S. Capitol and Park
Police and the General Services Administration's Federal Protective Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The costs should be borne by American taxpayers,'' said Del. Eleanor
Holmes Norton, D-D.C. The district's nonvoting representative to Congress has
introduced a bill authorizing a federal contribution to cover the district's
public safety costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Prior to the passage of the 1997 Revitalization Act that helped the district
government escape its financial crisis, Congress made a public safety payment to
the city each year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The amounts ranged from $5 million to $30 million annually depending on
the need,'' Norton said, expressing support for reimbursements in that range.
</P>
<P>
	   Language in the act also recognizes that as the nation's capital, the
district faced certain ``unusual costs'' such as assisting with the security of
national and foreign dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the president moves outside of the White House complex, our police
line the streets,'' Norton said.

<HEADLINE> Turk Court Rejects Lawyer's Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's highest administrative court Tuesday rejected
a second appeal to restore the citizenship of a lawmaker who outraged the
government by wearing an Islamic head scarf into Parliament, the Anatolia news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The government stripped Merve Kavakci of her citizenship, saying she had
become a U.S. citizen without asking permission from Turkish authorities as
required by law. Kavakci became a U.S. citizen through her American husband,
from whom she is now divorced.
</P>
<P>
	   Secularism is strictly enforced in Turkey, where Islamic head scarves are
banned in schools and public offices.
</P>
<P>
	   Kavakci had asked the court to cancel the Cabinet decision, allowing her to
regain her citizenship and serve in Parliament. The court had already rejected
that request in September.
</P>
<P>
	   Kavakci can still ask the court's general council to review the case. The
U.S.-educated computer scientist could not be reached for comment on the latest
ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Kavakci, a member of the pro-Islamic Virtue Party, has not returned to
Parliament since May, when she was booed out of the swearing-in session for
wearing the head scarf.

<HEADLINE> Study Looks At McGwire's Supplement  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDSEY TANNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Androstenedione, the supplement once used by Mark McGwire,
really does raise testosterone above normal levels and could be hazardous,
Harvard researchers say in a study financed by major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   A study last year found that the over-the-counter drug had no effect on
testosterone levels or strength and instead may promote breast enlargement,
heart disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   The new study lasted just one week and did not measure whether andro can do
what promoters have claimed -- make bigger muscles. But the researchers said
andro could have that effect because it increases levels of the male hormone.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a patient of mine came to me and asked whether he should take
androstenedione, I would caution against it simply because we don't know what
the long-term effects are," said Dr. Benjamin Z. Leder, the Harvard University
endocrinologist who led the study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Side effects of elevated testosterone levels include acne, male pattern
baldness and a decrease in "good" cholesterol, which could lead to heart
disease. In women, high testosterone can also cause increased body hair,
deepening of the voice and other male characteristics.
</P>
<P>
	   Androstenedione supplements are made of a naturally occurring steroid
hormone the body uses to make testosterone. When supplements of testosterone are
taken in high doses, they are known to have an anabolic effect -- increasing
muscle size and strength.
</P>
<P>
	   Andro sales soared after McGwire acknowledged using it in 1998, the year he
hit a record 70 home runs for the St. Louis Cardinals. He has since said he has
stopped using it.
</P>
<P>
	   Andro is considered a dietary supplement, but the federal government is
reviewing whether it should be reclassified as a steroid, which would remove it
from store shelves and make it available by prescription only for legitimate
medical uses.
</P>
<P>
	   It is banned by the Olympics, the NCAA, the NFL and the men's and women's
tennis tours, but not by major league baseball. Baseball commissioner Bud Selig
has been awaiting the Harvard study results to decide whether to take a stronger
stance.
</P>
<P>
	   The study of 42 men found increases in testosterone levels when andro was
taken for seven days in a single daily 300-milligram dose -- an amount that is
probably far smaller than what athletes and bodybuilders use.
</P>
<P>
	   The subjects, ages 20 to 40, were divided into three groups and received
either no androstenedione, 100 mg daily or 300 mg daily.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 300 mg group, testosterone levels in the blood increased by an
average of 34 percent by the seventh day, though levels had returned to normal
by the following day. The lower dose had no significant effect on testosterone
levels, though levels of the female hormone estrogen increased substantially
with both doses.
</P>
<P>
	   An eight-week Iowa State University study published last year in JAMA found
no increased testosterone levels with 300 mg, but the dosages were given in 100
mg increments three times daily. The authors of that study and the new research
said the dosage differences probably explain the new findings.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iowa study also found that andro increased levels of estrogen, which in
men can result in breast enlargement and other feminizing effects.
</P>
<P>
	   The new study results "will be factored into the federal review of the
proper classification" for andro, said Robert Housman, deputy director for
strategic planning for White House drug adviser Barry McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
	   Rob Manfred, executive vice president of labor and human resources for the
baseball owners, said Tuesday there are no immediate plans for a policy change.
"We've had the results for a very short period of time," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Players' union official Gene Orza had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Gary Wadler, an associate professor at New York University's medical
school who has worked with McCaffrey, said the findings should come as no
surprise. He advocates reclassifying androstenedione as a prescription drug.
</P>
<P>
	   "We now see what we all knew, just being in the business," he said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Texts Lack End-of-Life Care  </HEADLINE>
    By KATE N. GROSSMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Leading medical textbooks generally do not include enough
information on how to care for patients at the end of their lives, a new study
found.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous studies have concluded that many patients die in pain unnecessarily
or in hospitals rather than at home. Inadequate training has been blamed for the
deficient care -- and doctors have reported increasing anxiety about treating
dying patients.
</P>
<P>
	   "The information exists, but it's not being relayed" to medical students,
said Dr. Michael W. Rabow, the study's lead author and an assistant professor of
medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. "Pain goes untreated
primarily because the focus is on extending life."
</P>
<P>
	   Textbooks covering surgery, AIDS and oncology were the worst offenders, the
researchers said in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
Textbooks with the highest percentage of helpful end-of-life care content --
such as social and spiritual issues and ethics -- were in family medicine,
geriatrics and psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
	   Textbooks are especially important because they help "establish the standard
practice for health care," Rabow said. In addition for being used to train
medical students and residents, textbooks also are a reference for more
experienced doctors.
</P>
<P>
	   Rabow and his colleagues reviewed 50 best-selling medical textbooks from a
variety of specialties, including several diseases that often lead to death.
They assessed the information available in the textbooks in 13 areas --
including pain management, psychological issues, ethics and physician roles.
They rated the material in each textbook as helpful, minimal or absent.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the researchers found helpful information in about one-fourth of
those 13 categories. No information was found in half of the categories.
</P>
<P>
	   Textbooks with the least end-of-life content included those on infectious
diseases and AIDS -- 70 percent of the expected content was absent; and oncology
and hematology -- 62 percent of the content was missing.
</P>
<P>
	   Primary care medicine and psychiatry had the highest percentage of helpful
content -- 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Nicholas Christakis, who was not involved with the study and specializes
in hospice and palliative care at the University of Chicago, said the study
confirmed that "Americans die needlessly bad deaths."
</P>
<P>
	   "Textbooks are not the only problem or the magic bullet that will solve it,
but it's an important step," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The authors did say that some changes are already under way. Publishers are
commissioning updates in end-of-life content in textbooks in nursing, pediatrics
and psychiatry and in two medical textbooks.
</P>
<P>
	   And, the authors report, national accreditation and licensing organizations
are increasingly requiring a higher standard of competence in end-of-life care.

<HEADLINE> McCain continues to close in on Bush in New York poll  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Riding high from their New Hampshire victories,
Republican Sen. John McCain and Democratic Vice President Al Gore saw huge jumps
Tuesday in their numbers in a New York presidential primary poll.
<P>
	   McCain more than doubled his New York numbers after defeating Texas Gov.
George W. Bush in New Hampshire, becoming the choice of 39 percent of likely
Republican voters in the Empire State.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush still led with 48 percent in the Marist College's Institute for Public
Opinion poll. Publisher Steve Forbes came in at 3 percent and 14 percent were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   But in December, McCain was preferred by only 15 percent of Republican
voters, compared to Bush's 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we're seeing in New York part of the New Hampshire bounce for
McCain," Marist pollster Lee Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Democrats, Vice President Al Gore has opened a substantial lead over
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, the poll said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was favored by 54 percent of the likely Democratic voters while Bradley
was favored by 35 percent, the poll indicated. In December, the two men were in
a statistical dead heat with the vice president at 43 percent and the former New
York Knicks basketball star at 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "New York is probably Bradley's best place but it doesn't mean that it's
going to be a good place for him," Miringoff said. "Right now he's not
connecting with enough mainstream Democrats."
</P>
<P>
	   The New Hampshire victories for McCain and Gore made the difference,
Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not that New Yorkers wait to see what New Hampshireites do, but New
Hampshire provides a lot of attention and it also demonstrates the strength of
the campaign," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attempts by some New York Republicans to keep McCain off the presidential
primary ballot in parts of the state also helped the senator, Miringoff said. A
federal judge forced the state GOP to allow McCain, Forbes and Alan Keyes to
compete with Bush on the primary ballot across the entire state.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that whole controversy provided McCain some additional exposure he
normally wouldn't have gotten on the very issue that he's trying to emphasize,
that he's a reformer battling his way through the entrenched power structure,"
Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York's presidential primary is March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley needs a primary win soon to keep Gore from running away with the
Democratic nomination, Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   "What's happened since New Hampshire and Iowa is that the margins have
widened, and although Bradley has a home-court advantage in New York, it doesn't
guarantee that he'll do any better here than anywhere else," Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   The telephone poll of 944 registered voters was conducted Feb. 2-3 and on
Sunday. The margin of error for the sample of 223 likely Republican voters was
plus or minus 6.5 percentage points. It was 5.5 percentage points for the sample
of 297 likely Democratic voters.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Hospital Alters No-Tell Policy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FARMINGTON, N.M. (AP) -- Boy or girl? Until this week, a northern New Mexico
hospital said that was none of your business -- even if you were the mother.
</P>
<P>
	   The San Juan Regional Medical Center had been refusing to tell pregnant
women undergoing ultrasounds the gender of their babies.
</P>
<P>
	   Karon Lyon, community services director for the hospital, said there was the
informal policy not to release the gender because ultrasounds were not always
accurate.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the hospital decided to begin using a release form that would
free it of any liability in case of a mistake.
</P>
<P>
	   Heidee Hodges, 24, was disappointed to learn that she would not know her
baby's gender after a recent ultrasound at the center. She wanted to know so she
could prepare a nursery.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's my baby and my body. I think they should tell you," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Bernstein, a spokesman for the American College of Radiology in
Virginia, said the no-tell policy was unusual.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not aware of any similar policy in the country," he said.

<HEADLINE> Deutch Gives Up Pentagon Clearances  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Deutch, the former CIA director who lost his access
to agency secrets last summer for violating security rules, volunteered Tuesday
to give up his Defense Department industrial security clearances.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon officials said they would discontinue Deutch's access to industrial
secrets, in line with his request.
</P>
<P>
	   The actions are highly unusual and result from the CIA's discovery last
summer that Deutch had downloaded classified documents into his unsecured home
computer, in violation of security rules, while he was head of the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch previously had been deputy secretary of defense. He spent 38 years in
public service before leaving the CIA in December 1996. He has not been accused
of compromising Pentagon or CIA secrets.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch said in a letter to Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre that he has
no need for access to Pentagon classified information and therefore prefers that
his three remaining Pentagon clearances be discontinued. His industrial security
clearances gave him access to classified information about defense technologies;
such clearances commonly are granted to people working on Defense Department
contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch's letter was transmitted to Hamre today by his attorney at the
Washington law office of Williams &AMP; Connolly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has been Mr. Deutch's practice since his CIA clearance was suspended by
Director Tenet last August to avoid access to any classified information,
including classified documents, meetings and conversations,'' the letter states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Therefore, there is no need to continue these industrial security
clearances at this time and he asks that they be discontinued.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the time CIA Director George Tenet suspended Deutch's security clearance
at the agency, the Pentagon cut off Deutch's access to Defense Intelligence
Agency information. But the Pentagon allowed Deutch to keep his industrial
security clearances, which allowed him to have access to some classified
information.
</P>
<P>
	   When he acted against Deutch, Tenet said the CIA had found no evidence that
national security information was lost due to Deutch's security lapses, but
``potential for damage to U.S. security existed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
said Tuesday it was hard for him to conceive of any other outcome than for
Deutch to lose all security clearances.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby called the fact that Deutch still had Pentagon clearances, six months
after his CIA clearances were revoked, ``mind boggling.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby's committee met behind closed doors with CIA Inspector General L.
Britt Snider and was hoping that Deutch would accept its invitation to also
appear to discuss his security violations. Shelby said committee lawyers were in
contact with Deutch and his lawyers to try to work out an arrangement for such
an appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   A Deutch associate, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he expected
Deutch to comply with the committee's wish. The associate said Deutch was
traveling Tuesday and not available for direct comment.
</P>
<P>
	   If Deutch does not come voluntarily, the committee will consider issuing a
subpoena to compel his appearance, Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it is important that he come to the committee and let him explain
his version of events and his side of the story,'' Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before becoming CIA director, Deutch served as deputy secretary of defense
from 1994 to 1995. He now is a professor at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and acts as a consultant for several organizations with defense
contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   After weekend news reports about Deutch's continued access to classified
defense information, the Pentagon's inspector general asked the CIA for its
evidence on Deutch's security breaches, Defense Secretary William Cohen told
reporters. ``I think it should have been done sooner, but it was not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The industrial clearance allows Deutch to serve as a paid consultant on
defense contracts with the MIT, SAIC Corp. and Raytheon Corp., Pentagon
officials said.

<HEADLINE> On eve of budget address, Rowland announces surplus spending plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Governor John G. Rowland said Tuesday he wants to
use the state's $241 million revenue surplus to pay for school construction,
bail out the University of Connecticut Health Center and upgrade the
government's computer system.
<P>
	   A day before his annual budget address to the Legislature, Rowland also said
$33.4 million should be funneled into the state's emergency Rainy Day Fund, and
$17.5 million should be used for a hospital tax cut.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland proposed sinking $90 million into school construction, $30 million
into improved Internet access in schools, and $7.5 million into updating the
state's computer systems. He also wants to use $3.5 million to move the
Department of Information and Technology into new offices.
</P>
<P>
	   Using the surplus to pay for those programs will help lower the state's
debt, Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
	   "One-time funding and debt avoidance are prudent uses of the surplus,
because they will help keep future budgets lower," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a proposal already backed by leading Democrats, Rowland said he wants to
give the UConn Health Center a one-shot, $20 million bailout.
</P>
<P>
	   The health center - composed of a biomedical research center, the John
Dempsey Hospital and UConn's medical and dental schools - faces a $21 million
deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland and key lawmakers have said they're willing to help the health
center if an oversight board controls how the money is doled out.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic leaders say they support many of Rowland's proposals, but
criticized the governor for not including funding for open space, housing and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader George Jepsen said he's pleased that Rowland is not
pushing another tax rebate - an initiative previously paid for with surplus
dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very heartening to see that he's not going to do rebates and he's
buying into the framework that ... we ought to be looking at the surplus as a
vehicle for investing in Connecticut's future," said Jepsen, D-Stamford. "It's a
very positive step forward."
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland also proposed using the surplus to help the Department of Mental
Health and Department of Children and Families develop new programs and
services. He also wants to use $1 million for detection and control of
mosquito-transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland's plan also gives $2 million in one-time funding to expand the arts
in Connecticut cities, and gives $5.5 million to OPSAIL 2000, a Tall Ships
event.
</P>
<P>
	   "This proposal recognizes that excessive spending commitments in good fiscal
times create an appetite that cannot be met when times get tight," Rowland said.
"That's why none of the surplus spending represents ongoing program
expenditures."

<HEADLINE> Magician Doug Henning dead at 52  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Doug Henning, the mustachioed hippie magician who helped
repopularize his craft in the 1970s and spoke of giving audiences "a sense of
wonder," has died. He was 52.
<P>
	   Henning had suffered from liver cancer for five months. His office in
Toronto said he died Monday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Henning's showmanship and boyish enthusiasm helped revive a genre that had
lagged in popularity for decades. Several Broadway shows and an annual NBC
television special offered audiences an entertaining mix of music, comedy and
spectacles like a vanishing elephant.
</P>
<P>
	   "You could see that there was a great deal of joy in what he did," said The
Amazing Kreskin, a friend and fellow performer. "He tended to float through his
work. ... You felt a flavor that you were kind of soaring into another
dimension, and of course, really, that's what he was trying to communicate."
</P>
<P>
	   Born near Winnipeg, Canada, Henning said he first became fascinated with
magic as a child, when he saw a performer levitate a woman on "The Ed Sullivan
Show."
</P>
<P>
	   Henning's shaggy hair, bushy mustache and tie-dyed shirts - replaced later
by more flamboyant shimmery costumes - became well-known in the United States in
the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
	   His rock musical "The Magic Show" ran on Broadway for more than four years
in the '70s. Audiences flocked to see Henning make women disappear in sections
and mix his magic with music and comedy.
</P>
<P>
	   "When Doug opened that show on Broadway, that was the starting point of a
huge boom in magic that has continued to this day," said Lance Burton, a Las
Vegas-based magician. "Every magician that's out there working today owes Doug
Henning a great debt."
</P>
<P>
	   The attention he won on Broadway helped Henning land an NBC special called
"The World of Magic."
</P>
<P>
	   He recreated Harry Houdini's "Water Torture Escape" before a live audience
and NBC made the show an annual event.
</P>
<P>
	   Henning toured the country several times, performing magic for regional
audiences, and returned to Broadway in the 1980s with "Merlin" - nominated for
five Tony awards - and "Doug Henning's World of Magic."
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a kind of Peter Pan who led magic away from the tuxedo approach and
brought it into a modern, fun format," said Phil Willmarth, executive editor of
The Linking Ring magazine, in Durham, N.C. "His real genius was in bringing back
the real terrific illusions of the past, which hadn't been seen by most people
in generations."
</P>
<P>
	   Henning said he wanted to help his audiences recapture a childlike sense of
wonder.
</P>
<P>
	   "Wonder is very necessary in life," he once said. "When we're little kids,
we're filled with wonder for the world - it's fascinating and miraculous. A lot
of people lose that. They become cynical and jaded, especially in modern day
society. Magic renews that wonder."
</P>
<P>
	   A devotee of transcendental meditation, Henning said his life changed when
he met the movement's leader, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, in 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   In the mid-1980s, Henning stopped performing to devote himself to the
meditation movement full-time.
</P>
<P>
	   He sold many of his illusions to competitor David Copperfield and ran
unsuccessfully in elections in England in 1992 and Canada in the mid-1990s as a
member of the Natural Law party, which was founded by the Maharishi.
</P>
<P>
	   He spent his last years working with the Maharishi on plans for a
transcendental meditation theme park called Veda Land, which he hoped to build
in Niagara Falls, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
	   Henning is survived by his wife, Debbie.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Chechnya Will Drag On  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia claims to have regained control of Chechnya's
capital Grozny, but the battle for the rebellious region is far from over,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told senators Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebel forces, evading federal troops, have fled the capital to the south,
the west and distant hills, she said in testimony before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. ``They are guerrilla fighters, and I think that this will
go on,'' Albright testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's acting president, Vladimir Putin, believes he can solve separatist
and terrorism problems in the republic with force, Albright said. But in
discussing Chechnya with him, she said, she ``made clear that their brutality
towards innocent civilians and what they were doing with refugees was not
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said she told Putin during the three-hour Kremlin conversation last
Wednesday that ``they needed to have a political dialogue in order to end it.''
</P>
<P>
	   On another tough issue, however, Albright said Putin seemed open-minded
about anti-missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton is to decide this summer to go ahead with an anti-missile
interceptor program as a defense against attack from North Korea, Iran and other
countries that U.S. officials consider ``rogue states.''
</P>
<P>
	   Russia has warned this could touch off an arms race to find ways to get
around anti-missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not saying here that this is any kind of an easy proposition,''
Albright said in reply to Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who had his own talks last
week with Russian officials in Moscow. ``What struck me about him was that he is
willing to talk.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a mixed bag,'' Albright said, a slight shift in her assessment of the
man Boris Yeltsin picked as his successor when he quit as president on New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are certain parts about him where I see him as being very pragmatic
and a problem-solver,'' she said. ``And in other cases, I found him in denial.
Chechnya is one of those cases.''
</P>
<P>
	   In answering senators' questions, Albright did not compliment the acting
president as a reformer, as she did after he took over from Yeltsin. But she
said: ``He is willing to talk. He is somebody you can have a conversation
with.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said Putin, a former KGB secret police officer, may approve
political talks with Chechens eventually, but not now. And, she said, she has
not heard back on her proposal to have a commission go to the restive republic
on a humanitarian mission.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright appeared before the committee to testify on the State Department's
request for $22.7 billion for international affairs in the fiscal year starting
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., called the budget request enormous
but did not confront Albright. In fact, he saluted her as ``a great lady who is
very special to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sounding a familiar theme, Albright said foreign spending amounts to one
penny for each dollar in the budget and said the United States spends less
proportionately on its foreign policy than any other democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our foreign policy enters the 21st century living hand-to-mouth,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> Wholesalers Sue Tobacco Industry  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal lawsuit targeted the tobacco industry anew
Tuesday, accusing it of carrying out a "long-running and systematic" plan to fix
cigarette prices charged to wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, asserts that the major U.S.
cigarette manufacturers met secretly to make illegal agreements on wholesale
prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Two cigarette wholesalers, Buffalo Tobacco Products of Buffalo, N.Y., and F
&AMP; F Tobacco Products of Bryan, Texas filed the lawsuit, which seeks triple
damages and class-action status to represent all wholesalers hurt by the alleged
price-fixing.
</P>
<P>
	   The tobacco industry has been under mounting pressure for selling a product
the American Cancer Society calls the leading cause of cancer. All 50 states
reached settlements in which tobacco companies will pay them $246 billion for
the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department also sued the industry last September, seeking
additional billions of dollars to repay federal health-insurance costs. And, a
Florida jury ruled in a class-action lawsuit last July that the cigarette makers
produced a defective and deadly product. That jury is now considering damages
that industry lawyers say could exceed $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges the major tobacco companies fixed prices
during meetings of cigarette company lawyers who "frequently discussed, and
reached agreements regarding, future price increases for cigarettes."
</P>
<P>
	   Daniel W. Donahue, deputy general counsel for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., one
of the defendants, said the lawsuit "is totally without any basis in fact or
law, and we certainly intend to defend the case."
</P>
<P>
	   Donahue said the issues of price increases and competitive practices "were
always avoided" at the meetings of industry lawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael York, an attorney for Philip Morris, said the lawsuit was "so
meritless on its face the only conclusion one can draw is that it's simply a
maneuver by lawyers for more fees."
</P>
<P>
	   Those named defendants include Philip Morris Cos.; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Holdings Inc.; Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., a unit of British American
Tobacco Co., Ltd.; Lorillard Tobacco Co., a unit of Loews Corp.; and Liggett
Group, a unit of Brooke Group Ltd.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit said there was virtually no cigarette price competition from the
1950s until 1980, when Liggett introduced low-price "generic discount"
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
	   Other companies introduced generic brands, and after a 1993 price war, a
price increase announced by Philip Morris signaled to the other companies "that
they would resume their illegal agreement not to compete in the U.S. cigarette
market on the basis of price," the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
	   On numerous occasions in the following years, cigarette companies quickly
matched each other's price increases, the lawsuit said. Wholesalers often
received notification of price increases from the tobacco companies within hours
or even within minutes of each other, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies also worked together to fix prices and allocate market shares
outside the United States, the lawsuit alleged.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington D.C. firm of Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld &AMP; Toll leads a group
of 25 law firms that filed the case.

<HEADLINE> Radio Liberty Reporter Feared Dead  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNA DOLGOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- A Radio Liberty reporter is missing -- and his colleagues
fear he may be dead, another casualty of the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian military officials claim to have turned over Andrei Babitsky to
Chechen rebels nearly a week ago, but he has not been heard from since. Chechen
commanders say they don't have him and never did.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Andrei was with Chechen field commanders, he would have certainly found
a telephone,'' Radio Liberty's Moscow bureau chief, Savic Shuster, said Tuesday.
``If he is alive and keeping silent, there is a reason for that. Or he is not
alive.''
</P>
<P>
	   Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said Tuesday that Babitsky was
alive and well, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. It said he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian authorities have tried to tightly control information about the
Chechnya offensive that began in September, mindful of the public outrage that
marked the 1994-96 Chechnya war.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky had angered the government by questioning its reports, and some
Russian officials even accused him of fighting with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky, 35, last called home on Jan. 15. Ten days later, the Russian
government said he had been arrested but would be released soon. Then, the
government announced that Babitsky was turned over last Thursday to the rebels,
at his request, in exchange for three Russian prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
	   The swap raised fears for his safety, as the Russians said they no longer
bore any responsibility for Babitsky's life.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It could not even be characterized as barbarity, but as savagery,'' Genri
Reznik, a lawyer for U.S.-sponsored Radio Liberty, told a news conference
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Suspicion is also mounting about whether the swap ever took place at all.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do not believe my husband is alive and well,'' Babitsky's wife,
Lyudmila, said after the Russians announced the exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Presidential aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky showed reporters what he said was
Babitsky's written statement agreeing to the exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky's colleagues called the document an ``unprofessional fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it had been done professionally, Babitsky would have read on camera the
statement that he has supposedly written,'' Shuster said.
</P>
<P>
	   The official reason for Babitsky's arrest was that he did not have a
government permit to report in Chechnya. Other Western reporters have been
detained for the same reason, but quickly released. Accreditation is only issued
to Russia's pro-government media, which back the official view of the war.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky has worked for Radio Liberty since the early 1990s and reported on
the earlier Chechnya war. He is not the only reporter to question the
government, but he has reported primarily from rebel-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The government heavily criticized him after he reported Russian losses in a
rebel attack in December on Minutka Square in Grozny. The Russian military
initially denied its troops entered the square, although several journalists,
including an Associated Press reporter, counted the bodies of more than 100
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky also gave the rebels a lot of coverage at a time when the
government was urging reporters not to put ``terrorists'' on the air.
</P>
<P>
	   At Radio Liberty's request, leaders in Chechnya's separatist government have
been checking with field commanders about Babitsky -- but to no avail, Shuster
said. The station also has been unable to reach the Russian soldiers supposedly
exchanged for Babitsky.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is now clear that the rather mystical exchange ... is a sleight of hand
meant to conceal an obviously unlawful action -- or, more likely, a heinous
crime,'' Boris Pustintsev, head of the civil rights group Citizens' Watch, wrote
in an article published Tuesday in the Moscow Times daily.
</P>
<P>
	   Pustintsev also suggested the case illustrated the heavy-handed methods of
acting President Vladimir Putin, a former KGB officer. Putin is seen as a
shoo-in in Russia's March 26 presidential election, although he remains a
largely enigmatic figure.
</P>
<P>
	   If Putin ``was from the start aware of this operation -- and we can smell
his KGB methods from miles away -- then there's no doubt what life under this
guarantor of rights will be like,'' Pustintsev wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, meanwhile, insisted Tuesday he would protect press freedoms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am deeply convinced that there will be no development, no future at all
in the country if we suppress civil rights and freedom of press,'' Putin said in
an interview on ORT television.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 51.81; New Nasdaq High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index sprinted to another new record
today after the government reported that workers' productivity is rising
sharply, offering a potential buffer against inflation. Blue-chip stocks shared
in the good fortune, but pared their gains late in the session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rose 104.80 to 4,426.57, cruising past its previous record of
4,321.77, set Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.81 to close at 10,957.60. The
blue-chip index rose as much as 100 points early in the session.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 18.39 to 1,442.63.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-7 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,600 up, 1,452 down and 474 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.04 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 915.14 million in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.93 to 536.32.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose after the Labor Department said productivity -- defined as the
amount of output for each hour of work -- rose at a 5 percent annual rate in the
fourth quarter, the strongest showing since the fourth quarter of 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The report surpassed analysts' expectations and reassured many investors
that inflation remains under control. Stocks have been pressured so far this
year by worries that the Federal Reserve will sharply raise interest rates to
keep inflation from accelerating.
</P>
<P>
	   While most economists see little evidence of actual inflation, four rate
increases since last June have done little to slow the growth of the U.S.
economy. Analysts said today's report indicated that while the Fed may raise
rates again at its next meeting, an increase sharp enough to derail stocks isn't
likely.
</P>
<P>
	   "This report will probably not prevent the Fed from tightening on March 21,
but it will keep them on the course of gradualism and caution," said David Orr,
chief economist at First Union Securities Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue-chip stocks, which have been under heavy pressure from investors who
fear that higher interest rates will cut into corporate profits, rebounded on
the report. Financial services stocks, which are highly sensitive to inflation,
fared best.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart rose after a Lehman Brothers analyst said the stock should reach
100 within 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow also gathered strength as investors who favor value stocks over the
high-growth technology sector returned to some battered stocks, said Larry
Lawler, manager of equity trading at Dreyfus Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some value players are coming in and picking their spots, but I would need
a couple more days to be convinced that value is back in vogue," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks showed no sign of flagging. Widely held tech leaders like
IBM and Microsoft rose.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Amazon.com rose sharply. A potential rival, online retailer
Buy.com Inc., rose in its initial public offering of stock, although its gains
were a mere shadow of the double-digit punch most technology IPOs had last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares were priced at 13 and opened at 30 1/8, then edged lower in afternoon
trading.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S.-traded shares of news organization Reuters rose. The company announced
plans to spend $802 million to transform itself into an Internet company that
delivers instant financial data to consumers as well as financial institutions
worldwide. Reuters also said its 1999 earnings rose 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Reuters' sharp leap underscored the high premium investors are placing on
technological advances, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The theme is still technology," Lawler said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks gained support today from the rising U.S. dollar, which soared to a
five-month high against the Japanese yen. A strong dollar makes imports cheaper,
providing an additional hedge against inflation.

<HEADLINE> Two in Austrian Cabinet Criticized  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE JAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- New accusations of extreme right-wing sentiment are
being leveled against two Cabinet ministers, adding to the controversy over
Joerg Haider's Freedom Party and its key role in helping to govern Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   The two are Infrastructure Minister Michael Schmid and Justice Minister
Michael Krueger, both members of the right-wing Freedom Party that took office
last week as part of a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
	   As an official in Styria province, Schmid subsidized a far-right magazine
whose publisher was found guilty of denying the Holocaust. Krueger has in the
past described Nazi death camps as ``punishment camps for civilians.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both ministers are on record as defending their words or actions. Krueger
told state television late Monday that his comments had been taken out of
context. The weekly Format quoted Schmid, in statements made seven years ago, as
defending his decision to use Freedom Party funds to support the far-right
publication Aula.
</P>
<P>
	   Repeated telephone calls Tuesday to the two ministers' offices were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
	   President Thomas Klestil rejected two other ministers proposed by Haider out
of fear they would increase international opposition to the new government.
</P>
<P>
	   One of those rejected, Thomas Prinzhorn, had said that under the previous
government, immigrants were given free ``hormone treatments ... to increase
their fertility.'' The other, Hilmar Kabas, was responsible for last year's
Freedom Party election posters that warned of ``over-foreignization'' -- a term
associated with the Hitler epoch.
</P>
<P>
	   Hans Magenschab, spokesman for Klestil, suggested the president also would
have rejected Schmidt and Krueger as ministers, ``but these stories about them
were not known to him'' when he approved the government.
</P>
<P>
	   The formation of a coalition including Haider's party has sparked
international outrage.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider opposes immigration and European integration. He also made past
statements lauding the Nazi's ``orderly employment policy'' and praised former
members of the Waffen SS. He has since apologized for those comments.
</P>
<P>
	   In an unprecedented move to isolate Vienna for its shift to the right, the
other 14 members of the European Union froze bilateral diplomatic relations with
Austria. Israel recalled its ambassador.
</P>
<P>
	   Protected by 600 police, the Austrian parliament convened Tuesday for a
special session to debate the international isolation. But opposition parties
hold only 79 seats in the 183-seat parliament, and a vote of no-confidence in
the new Cabinet headed by Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel failed.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has repeatedly said he and his party are not racist or anti-Semitic.
Critics, however, say the revelations about Schmid and Krueger are further cause
for concern about the direction of Austria under a government where the far
right holds half the ministerial posts.
</P>
<P>
	   Krueger's concentration camp comments smack of Hitler-era propaganda, which
tried to present inmates of concentration camps as criminals deserving
punishment, said Brigitte Baier, deputy head of the Documentation Center of the
Austrian Resistance, which monitors right-wing extremism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Concentration camps were not punishment camps but camps for destroying
people out of racist or political motives,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> First Russian Candidate Registered  </HEADLINE>
   By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov on Tuesday became the
first candidate approved for Russia's March 26 presidential election, though
polls show him still far behind acting President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
	   A poll released Tuesday showed 58 percent of respondents would choose Putin
if the vote were held now, to 15 percent for Zyuganov, Putin's leading opponent.
The nationwide poll conducted Jan. 31 by the All-Russia Opinion Research Center
had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Central Electoral Commission approved Zyuganov's candidacy in a
unanimous vote Tuesday after reviewing the required 500,000 signatures of
support he had submitted, commission spokesman Artyom Golev said. It also
approved his property and income declarations.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the documents filed for his candidacy, Zyuganov has two
apartments and earned $17,000 in 1998-99. He also reported having two bank
accounts, one with $570 and the other with $80. As a member of parliament he
receives a free apartment, car and other perks.
</P>
<P>
	   The income is low by Western standards but is similar to the reported
incomes of other Russian politicians -- and significantly more than that earned
by most ordinary Russians.
</P>
<P>
	   Zyuganov, who came in second to incumbent Boris Yeltsin in the 1996
presidential election, predicted Tuesday that the campaign would be unfair. He
said some candidates had easy access to the media while others were denied it --
an indirect reference to state-controlled television channels, which tend to
give Putin blanket, favorable attention.
</P>
<P>
	   The Communist chief also warned that the election results could be
falsified. He repeated his claim that the results of the December parliamentary
elections had been fixed in six regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The current authorities are not capable of running elections honestly,''
Zyuganov told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission is to consider Putin's registration on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, a longtime KGB agent with little governing experience, has been vague
about his electoral platform but is widely liked for his law-and-order image.
</P>
<P>
	   In a television interview Tuesday, he said, ``One has to be tough and
demanding. ... People are tired of weak government.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also dismissed fears voiced often in the West that he would lead Russia
toward dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am deeply convinced that there will be no development, no future at all
in the country if we suppress civil rights and freedom of press,'' he said.
Those freedoms ``guarantee the state won't slide into the mire of
totalitarianism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-nine people have announced their intention to run in the election.
Prominent candidates include Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal
Yabloko party, and ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. But the levels of
support for candidates other than Putin and Zyuganov were all in the single
digits, according to the Opinion Research Center poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Another poll, studying reasons for Putin's broad popularity, showed that the
majority of respondents like the 47-year-old Putin for his relatively young age
and good health -- in contrast to the ailing, 69-year-old Yeltsin, who stepped
down Dec. 31. That poll was released by the ROMIR polling agency on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin has been vague about his electoral platform. When asked again about it
Tuesday, he promised to reveal details at a later time.

    	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Democrat Bill Bradley lashed out at the two
leading Republican presidential candidates Tuesday, accusing them of trying to
"bottom-fish for votes" by refusing to condemn flying of the Confederate flag
over the state Capitol.
<P>
	   "That flag shows the true colors of the Republicans who want to be
president," declared Bradley. "That flag should not fly another day over the
state Capitol."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley went to historically black Benedict College to launch his stinging
assault on Republicans, generally sparing Democratic rival Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   "The weakness and passivity of the Republicans on this issue is appalling,"
said Bradley. "At a time when leadership, courage and principles should guide
our leaders on this issue, both George Bush and John McCain have instead
embraced the narrow political expediency of the Republican Party."
</P>
<P>
	   The issue is a hot one in South Carolina, and Bradley was sending a clear
signal to minority voters in important early states like New York and
California, part of a big round of primaries March 7 that could settle the
Democratic presidential nomination. South Carolina Democrats vote two days
later.
</P>
<P>
	   The Confederate flag has flown over the South Carolina Statehouse since
1962. Flag backers argue that it stands for the state's Southern heritage, while
critics argue it symbolizes slavery and a racist past.
</P>
<P>
	   State senators continued to grapple with the issue Tuesday as
behind-the-scene discussions about possibly moving the flag to a park on
Statehouse grounds moved to impassioned speeches on the Senate floor. But there
was no agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Both McCain and Bush have argued that flying the flag is a local issue with
which they don't want to interfere. That drew scorn from Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is expediency that ignores a hateful and shameful past in an effort to
bottom-fish for votes from the most right-wing elements of the Republican
Party," said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   While the fight between Gore and Bradley has heated up in recent days,
Bradley spent most of Tuesday bashing Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a clear difference between the two parties," said Bradley. "Al
Gore and I say take the flag down. John McCain and George Bush say leave it up."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also criticized Bush for delivering a speech last week at Bob Jones
University, which lost its tax-exempt status in the 1970s because of racial
discrimination. The school now admits black students but still bans interracial
dating.
</P>
<P>
	   "By simply going there he was sending a message that the new conservatism
isn't a whole lot different than the old conservatism," said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides said Bradley wanted to underscore the differences between the parties,
and McCain and Bush are stumping hard for the state's GOP primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is spending heavy amounts of campaign time focusing on racial
harmony issues. He went to Florida Monday to tout affirmative action, and was
heading for Ohio and a town meeting on diversity.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley did cast one glancing blow at Gore, again bringing up fund-raising
scandals that dogged the vice president in the 1996 election that Bradley argues
will be fodder for Republicans this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need a Democratic presidential candidate who isn't just dedicated to
these issues, but who can win," said Bradley. "That means a Democratic candidate
who talks straight with the people, who levels with them and who cannot be
attacked with the fund-raising scandals of 1996 that are a stain on our party."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley received a bit of a slap, too. He was handed a letter by state party
chairman Dick Harpootlian at the airport as he was leaving saying it was time
for him to drop out of the race and support Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley camp rejected the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who argues that racial harmony is central to his campaign, offered
some of his toughest rhetoric to date on the flag.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Confederate flag that flies over the Capitol of this state was flown
for over a century in defense of slavery and segregation," said Bradley. "That
flag is not a symbol of Southern heritage. That flag is a symbol of the fight to
preserve segregation."

<HEADLINE> Bill To Strip Belfast's Powers OK'd  </HEADLINE>
   By KRISTIN GAZLAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Lawmakers overwhelmingly passed a bill Tuesday that would
allow the British government to strip Northern Ireland's fledgling
administration of its powers this week -- an emergency measure meant to prevent
its total collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   The 352-11 House of Commons vote came after Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson warned that legislators had no choice following the
Irish Republican Army's refusal to disarm in support of the province's 1998
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   There remained only one step before the bill passed to the upper House of
Lords -- a ceremonial final ``reading'' required under British law that does not
necessarily entail a recorded vote. The measure is expected to become law
Thursday once it goes through the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
	   The major Protestant party within the power-sharing Cabinet, the Ulster
Unionists, agreed to form the four-party coalition -- which includes the
IRA-linked Sinn Fein -- only on condition that IRA would begin to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   A disarmament commission's report last week said the IRA had made no
concrete commitments, triggering the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson, who transferred considerable responsibilities to the Belfast
administration only two months ago, said in these circumstances it was ``clearly
foreseeable'' that the body ``will simply fall apart'' if powers weren't
immediately taken back.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Tuesday, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams directly appealed to Prime
Minister Tony Blair not to suspend the administration's powers, warning it would
render any start to IRA disarmament impossible.
</P>
<P>
	   As Martin McGuinness, a former IRA commander who is now Sinn Fein's minister
for education in the Cabinet, looked on from the visitors' gallery, Mandelson
said those arguing for the power-sharing Cabinet to continue were offering ``a
false choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   The reality, he said, was ``between pause and bust.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``A pause in the operation of the institutions, far from seeing them lying
in collapse, will preserve the institutions and allow them to be revived at a
later date,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson said he intended to use the bill's powers to resume ``direct
rule'' from London -- the quasi-colonial form of government originally imposed
in Northern Ireland in 1972 -- on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Adams also used a Commons room for a news conference. He, like McGuinness,
is an elected member of British Parliament, but can't take part in debates
because he refuses to take the oath of office, which would require him to pledge
support to Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Good Friday agreement is under the greatest threat so far since it
came into existence,'' Adams said, accusing the British government of backing
``a unilateral deadline'' sought by the Ulster Unionists.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., in Belfast,
Adams sounded exasperated, claiming to have done all he could to win an IRA
commitment to disarm. He wondered ``what role I have to play as a messenger who
continuously gets shot.''
</P>
<P>
	   But others blamed Sinn Fein for not delivering on its end of a bargain
struck in November under the mediation of American diplomat George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
	   In exchange for the Ulster Unionists' accepting Sinn Fein as Cabinet
colleagues, Sinn Fein declared for the first time that disarmament was
``essential,'' and the IRA opened negotiations with the province's 3-year-old
disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The Good Friday accord proposed that the IRA should completely disarm by
May, but specified no starting point. The IRA has never accepted that goal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ulster Unionists plan to ballot grassroots members Saturday on whether
to remain in the Cabinet. If they call for withdrawal, forming a new Cabinet
would prove extremely difficult because it would require a new election in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   Given the rising Protestant hostility to cooperating with Sinn Fein, the
Ulster Unionists -- previously able to command support from only half the
province's Protestants -- would probably suffer further losses.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Cabinet's senior Catholic minister, Seamus Mallon, warned that the
looming suspension could prove permanent.
</P>
<P>
	   He cited his personal experience in Northern Ireland's only previous attempt
to share power between Protestants and Catholics, a Cabinet that collapsed in
1974.
</P>
<P>
	   Politicians back then had hoped that the Cabinet would soon resume
operations, he recalled. ``It was resumed,'' he said. ``It took one quarter of a
century to resume it.''

<HEADLINE> Doctors, lawyers say auto accident claim regs too harsh  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Until this month, car accident victims in New York
with lingering aches and pains were allowed three months to alert an insurance
carrier about doctor's visits.
<P>
	   On Feb. 1, that deadline was shortened to 30 days - a period of time lawyers
and doctors call "brutally short."
</P>
<P>
	   Coordinated by the New York Public Interest Research Group, lawyers and
doctors associations on Tuesday announced a lawsuit filed in state Supreme Court
in Manhattan to undo the new regulations. The changes also affect their billing
deadlines. Starting this month, doctors, chiropractors and physical therapists
have 45 days to bill insurers - they previously had 80.
</P>
<P>
	   "This requires you to report the extent of injuries before you realize how
bad you've been hurt," said Gene De Santis, from the New York State Trial
Lawyers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   NYPIRG called the deadline for seeing a doctor the shortest in the nation
among states that have no-fault rules similar to New York.
</P>
<P>
	   In Massachusetts, if an accident is caused by an unidentified motor vehicle,
there is a four-year statute of limitations for injured people to seek benefits.
Michigan allows one year and Kansas allows two. Pennsylvania also has a 30-day
deadline, but its regulations add "or as soon as practicable thereafter."
</P>
<P>
	   The New York State Insurance Association, which pushed for the regulations,
say the new deadlines can help the group stop fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   The Insurance Association said it pushed for four years for the change and
expected opposition from medical groups.
</P>
<P>
	   "On balance, we feel legitimate claims will get paid and the people
performing medical frauds will get taken out of business," said Bernard
Bourdeau, president of the Insurance Association.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that under the old rules, a fraudulent chiropractor could treat a
patient three times a week for six months before insurers saw a bill - and had
the opportunity to contest it. He said fraudulent claims are most common in the
New York City area.
</P>
<P>
	   In the case of a mother whose daughter was injured on a school bus crash
last year, a misunderstanding caused a delay in filing a claim, said Albany
lawyer John Powers. Just over 30 days passed by the time she had filed claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Powers said the delay happened because she did not have a car and was
therefore unfamiliar with New York's no-fault laws.
</P>
<P>
	   The no-fault laws require insurers to cover anyone injured in an accident,
regardless of who caused it. Under the no-fault laws, if a person is injured in
a vehicle accident, their own vehicle insurer pays medical bills. If the injured
person is not insured, then the insurer of the other vehicle pays.
</P>
<P>
	   In the case of the mother, she had to direct her daughter's bills to the bus
company's insurer because she had no auto insurance herself. Powers said the
misunderstanding caused the delay.
</P>
<P>
	   The regulations - and the complaints against them - do not concern the most
serious or life-threatening injuries - but more nebulous problems like tissue or
disc injuries. That's because no-fault coverage covers the bigger injuries. The
changes to New York's no-fault insurance rules, known as "Regulation 68," were
made by the Insurance Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The Insurance Department said the regulation allows insurers to monitor
medical treatment and protects consumers by requiring insurers to consider why a
claim was filed late.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit was filed the Medical Society of the State of New York,
Chiropractic Federation of New York, New York Chiropractic Council, New York
County Medical Association, New York Physical Therapy Association, New York
State Podiatric Medical Association, New York State Trial Lawyers Association,
Suffolk County Bar Association. Insurance Department Superintendent Neil D.
Levin is named as the defendant.

<HEADLINE> Willingboro announces arrests in rash of school threat cases  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WILLINGBORO, N.J. (AP) - Three Willingboro High School students have
been charged in connection with a rash of bomb threats that have plagued the
school this year and disrupted classes, officials announced Tuesday.
<P>
	   The arrests are the second in the 5,400-student district, which has had 10
threats of bombs or other acts of violence since September. Last year, the
Burlington County district had no bomb threats.
</P>
<P>
	   The threats forced the evacuation of the school, leaving students and
faculty standing outside in the cold. Two school days will have to be made up
because of early dismissals.
</P>
<P>
	   "It started getting real crazy," said freshman Sharnaya Robinson, 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "The first time it was funny," said sophomore Charles Hatchett, 17. "Then
later after a while people started getting mad. It wasn't fun after that."
</P>
<P>
	   The latest arrests were made public at a news conference at the high school
by police and school officials, in part, to allay community concerns about
school safety. Nine of the threats were directed at the high school.
</P>
<P>
	   "The message we're trying to get across here is it's not cool," said Public
Safety Director Benjamin Braxton. "This is not a prank."
</P>
<P>
	   The threats were made in warning notes left on the floor inside the school
or taped to locker doors or messages scrawled on blackboards. Some threats were
made from a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
	   Three students - a female and two males - were charged last week in
connection with four bomb threats at the school between Dec. 14 and Jan. 11,
Braxton said. Each was charged with making terroristic threats and making a
false public alarm, he said. Their names were not made public because of their
ages.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, police charged four male teenagers in two other bomb threats at
the school. Braxton said authorities delayed announcing the latest arrests
because of the continuing investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Angry parents and students have complained about inadequate security at the
high school. The township offered a $5,000 reward to solve the bomb threats and
the PTA put up $1,000.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a parent, I was very frustrated," said Carolyn Savoy Williams, who has
two teen-age daughters at the high school. "It was really difficult."
</P>
<P>
	   All seven students charged are under house arrest and face up to two years
in a juvenile detention facility, Braxton said. One student has already pleaded
guilty and will be sentenced later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   "As far as we're concerned, we want it to go to the maximum," said School
Superintendent Dorothy Dallah. "We cannot afford to have terrorist threats ...
disrupt our school system."
</P>
<P>
	   Dallah blames the threats on the aftermath from the school shootings in
Columbine, Colo., where 11 students and a teacher were shot to death by two
teen-age killers who took their own lives.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are copycats and there are things students feel they are bound to
do," Dallah said. She said all seven students have been suspended and will face
expulsion hearings. The district will also seek restitution for evacuation
costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the district is stepping up security, adding two enforcement
officers and requiring students to wear ID badges and carry mesh or see-through
backpacks, Dallah said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the school board rejected a proposal by the district's security
chief to spend $400,000 to install metal detectors and a video-surveillance
system.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs bill mandating coverage for fertility treatments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Senate approved a bill Tuesday mandating
that group insurers provide coverage for fertility treatments, one day after the
state Assembly passed a similar measure.
<P>
	   The interest by both chambers heartened supporters of mandatory insurance
coverage for treatments that can allow previously infertile couples to have
children.
</P>
<P>
	   "Infertility is a disease," state Sen. Seymour Lachman, D-Brooklyn. "It is a
major disease."
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, which passed in the Senate 37-21, would cap benefits at $60,000 -
not counting prescription drugs associated with fertility treatments; require
that people won't become eligible for coverage until they have been on their
health plan for one year; and "sunset," or cease to exist, after two years, on
July 1, 2002, so lawmakers can change what they don't like about the program or
abandon it altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill also includes a "conscience clause" which states that any health
provider can opt out of the coverage mandate if its religious tenets demand it.
State Sen. Kenneth LaValle, R-Suffolk, said that clause is aimed at letting the
Roman Catholic-operated Fidelis Care of New York not provide some fertility
procedures that run counter to the teachings of the church.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate analysts think the bill would not add to the costs of health
insurance plans in the state, LaValle said.
</P>
<P>
	   But that contention was challenged by several state legislators and health
insurance providers.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. Neil Breslin, D-Albany, said estimates he has seen indicate that
fertility coverage would increase the cost of insurance by between 3 percent and
5 percent. With an estimated 60,000 people losing insurance for every 1 percent
increase in cost, Breslin said the provision could mean 300,000 fewer New
Yorkers will have health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Minority Leader Martin Connor, a Brooklyn Democrat, wondered why the
coverage available under the Senate bill would only be available to women
between ages 25 and 44. He said many younger couples know of fertility problems
well before the woman is 25, or some couples with an older man and younger woman
are eager to start their families as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   "I speak as a 54-year-old man with young children," Connor said. "You want
to be around to see them grow up."
</P>
<P>
	   Connor said the Senate bill has many such "serious, serious flaws" and he
favors the Assembly bill. In addition to no age limit for eligible women, Connor
complained that the Senate bill also doesn't mandate insurance coverage for
fertility treatments for people covered through individual policies.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bill is watered down from the Assembly bill," Connor said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, R-Rennselaer, said the Senate tried
for months unsuccessfully to negotiate one bill with the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear whether the two chambers could reconcile their differences,
perhaps through conference committees.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandating fertility coverage is popular among orthodox Jews, and it surfaced
as an issue in a special election last year for a state Senate seat in New York
City's northwestern suburbs, where there is a large enclave of Jewish residents.
The Republican who won the race, Thomas Morahan, promised to bring a fertility
bill to the floor of the Senate if elected.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Business Council, the state's most powerful corporate lobbying
group, is opposed to mandated fertility coverage as is the New York Health Plan
Association, which represented managed care plans covering nearly 6 million New
Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
	   Leslie Moran, a spokeswoman for the Health Plan Association, said it is
"ironic" that the Senate last week came out against unfunded mandates applying
to counties through a new health insurance program for the poor, but on Tuesday
passed a fertility treatment mandate on customers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are having trouble reconciling how they can be against mandates in one
instance and willing to pass them in another," she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Fights Gene Discrimination  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Christine DeMark worried about her own medical future
when her mother was diagnosed with Huntington's disease. But she never imagined
how her life would be changed by taking a test to determine whether she had
inherited the genetic abnormality.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the results were back, DeMark's fiance left her, fearing a
positive result. Soon after learning that she did have the gene that causes the
degenerative nerve disorder, DeMark was fired from her job at a Milwaukee
management consultancy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It didn't ever occur to me to think that way,'' said DeMark. ``I was more
concerned about myself -- whether I was going to have it.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton sought Tuesday to focus attention on the plight of people
like DeMark, whose experience illustrates the potential dark side to advances in
genetic research.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This extraordinary march of human understanding imposes on us a profound
responsibility to make sure that the age of discovery can continue to reflect
our most cherished values,'' he told an American Association for the Advancement
of Science audience. ``We must protect our citizens' privacy -- the bulwark of
personal liberty, the safeguard of individual creativity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton immediately barred federal agencies from discriminating against
employees on the basis of genetic tests and urged Congress to prohibit the
private sector from refusing to hire people at risk for health problems and
insurers from refusing to cover them.
</P>
<P>
	   Concerns about the use of genetic information could discourage people from
seeking crucial tests that would improve their lives, the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we do not protect the right to privacy, we may actually impede the
reach of these breakthroughs in the lives of ordinary people, which would be a
profound tragedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Advances in genetic testing soon will allow doctors to predict the medical
futures of their patients. That has raised worries that such information could
be used against those deemed more likely to suffer from cancer, diabetes, heart
disease or other ailments.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton voiced support for legislation sponsored by Sens. Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., and Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., that
would outlaw discrimination based on genetic information.
</P>
<P>
	   Some employers and insurers are reluctant to take on the extra financial
burden of people with ailments whose treatments can pile up substantial medical
fees.
</P>
<P>
	   DeMark said her employer at the small, self-insured consultancy began to
harass her as soon as she confided to him about her mother and her plan to take
the test. She was reassigned to a desk job. ``They were doing everything to get
me to quit,'' she said. After the test results came back, she was fired.
</P>
<P>
	   Five years after receiving the results, DeMark has relocated to Detroit,
where she works in retail, and she has not exhibited any symptoms of
Huntington's, which causes involuntary movements in the limbs and can lead to
dementia.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she was trying to protect others by speaking out about the disease
and the potential for abusing genetic information, saying, ``Nothing else can
happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was joined by Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Human
Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Shirley
Malcolm, head of the directorate for education and human resources programs at
the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's order prohibits federal employers from requiring or requesting
genetic tests as a condition of being hired or receiving benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Further, federal employers would not be allowed to deny employees promotions
or overseas posts because of a genetic predisposition for certain illness.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the order, obtaining or disclosing genetic information about employees
or potential employees is banned, except when necessary to provide medical
treatment to employees, ensure workplace health and safety or provide occupation
and health researchers access to data.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Examine Big Bank Failures  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   With AM-Bank Failures-Glance
By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some lawmakers warned Tuesday that tightening rules for
banks that make many risky loans to people with poor credit histories could hurt
low-income and minority neighborhoods that depend on such loans.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal regulators made the proposal because of concerns about recent bank
failures. Two big bank failures -- of First National Bank of Keystone, based in
Keystone, W.Va., and BestBank of Boulder, Colo. -- involved fraud and cost the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Seldom is a wake-up call as loud and clear as the one emanating from the
tiny town of Keystone, West Virginia,'' Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the
House Banking Committee, said at a hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators and lawmakers are concerned about the eight U.S. bank failures
last year, which occurred amid a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Large proportions of high-interest risky loans, known as subprime loans,
were made by six of the 11 banks that collapsed in the past 18 months, including
Keystone and BestBank.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDIC recently proposed doubling the minimum required funding for banks
that specialize in high-risk loans to people with inferior credit histories. The
other federal banking agencies are weighing the proposal, which applies to all
forms of consumer credit, including home mortgages, credit cards, auto loans and
personal loans.
</P>
<P>
	   But critics maintain that under the FDIC's proposed definition of subprime
borrowers -- those who have made two payments 30 or more days late or one
payment 60 or more days late -- many community banks that lend to low- and
moderate-income people would be adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
	   A ``rigid'' treatment by regulators of subprime lending ``could have a
chilling effect'' on loans in low- and moderate-income communities, said Rep.
Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Robert Weygand, D-R.I., warned that subprime borrowers who act
responsibly and repay their debts on time shouldn't be discriminated against
``because of a few bad apples.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Reserve Gov. Laurence Meyer, testifying at the hearing, said the
central bank is monitoring the activities of banks it regulates which engage in
subprime lending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the economy weakens -- as it ultimately will -- we can expect bank
losses from both previous risk-taking and bad luck,'' Meyer said. ``We can also
expect an increase in bank failures.''
</P>
<P>
	   The FDIC says it has found about 150 banks and thrifts with significantly
high levels of subprime loans. Together, those institutions hold about 5 percent
of total banking industry assets.
</P>
<P>
	   BestBank, for example, sold high-interest credit cards as part of a
travel-club membership to consumers with poor credit records. Its failure
drained some $225 million from the insurance fund, which backs each account up
to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the Banking Committee's senior Democrat,
urged people to ``keep the recent failures in perspective.'' He noted that
during the banking crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s, some 3,000 banks,
thrifts and credit unions failed in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach said ``the good news is that the American banking system has never
been stronger'' and the FDIC's insurance fund is at a record high level of some
$29 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach said some regulators may not have properly supervised the Keystone
bank, which grew by paying high interest rates to attract capital from across
the country, when it engaged in risky financial strategies.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it appears the FDIC was stymied at key points in its desire to
examine the bank's activities, and that the independent FDIC and the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency -- the Treasury Department agency that oversaw
the bank -- ``failed to cooperate closely.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Comptroller John D. Hawke Jr., told the lawmakers that his agency's
relationship with the FDIC ``has been cooperative and productive.''
</P>
<P>
	   The FDIC's estimated $800 million loss caused by Keystone's collapse would
put it among the 10 most expensive ever in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, Leach has proposed legislation that would give the head of the
FDIC more authority over troubled banks. But he told reporters after the hearing
that he had seen ``good steps toward cooperation'' by the two agencies and he
might not press his proposal.

<HEADLINE> College Protests Spread in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Administrators started returning to Mexico's largest
university Tuesday, two days after a police raid ended a 9 1/2-month occupation
by striking students.
</P>
<P>
	   But while courts freed most of the 745 people arrested in Sunday's raid, the
turmoil at the National Autonomous University spilled into national politics and
onto other campuses in the Mexican capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Students at other city universities demonstrated in favor of strikers still
imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico City's leftist mayor, Rosario Robles, appeared in television
advertisements to denounce the federal raid on the 270,000-student school known
by Spanish acronym, UNAM. She demanded freedom for all those arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To avoid making Mexico City a victim of a conflict ... it is urgent that
the Federal Preventative Police leave the university installations and that the
detained students be freed,'' said Robles, herself an UNAM graduate.
</P>
<P>
	   With a presidential election in July nearing, federal officials suggested
Robles' opposition-party city government had shirked its responsibility by
refusing to help retake the school.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal police on Tuesday turned over several parts of the campus to
university officials, who drove past barricades to tour structures emblazoned
with revolutionary slogans. Some buildings had been carefully maintained by
strikers; others had been looted and were strewn with garbage.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal attorney general's office announced that 579 of the adults
arrested Sunday had been freed, though some might face other charges. Another 77
minors were turned over to the juvenile court system.
</P>
<P>
	   Still in jail were 89 strike leaders and supporters, mostly on charges of
seizing public buildings or theft. Another 86 people have been held on various
charges since a violent clash on Jan. 26 at one of the university's high
schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike began last April to protest an increase in UNAM's minimal tuition
and other reforms. University officials quickly backed off on the tuition issue,
but radicals controlling the strike committee pressed ahead with the strike,
seeing it as part of a struggle against free-market economic policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Insisting on freedom for those arrested, faculty and students on Tuesday
staged a one-day strike of support at another school, the Metropolitan
Autonomous University's campus in northwestern Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
	   Students at the two other campuses of that university, which has about
45,000 students in all, also were voting on whether to join the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of members of the UNAM strike committee met Monday in a plaza at
the Metropolitan campus in southern Mexico City, denouncing the police raid and
pledging to continue the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   UNAM Rector Juan Ramon de la Fuente has urged officials to drop charges
against those arrested Sunday or at least to be lenient.
</P>
<P>
	   But when asked whether officials would show goodwill with an amnesty,
Interior Secretary Diodoro Carrasco told reporters Tuesday: ``This is not a
problem of goodwill; it is a problem of application of the law. It is a problem
of maintaining order, and political and social stability.''

<HEADLINE> Prince Postpones Austria Trip  </HEADLINE>
   By AUDREY WOODS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Prince Charles on Tuesday postponed a visit to Vienna,
another indication of Austria's increasing political isolation since a far-right
party became a partner in a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
	   A Foreign Office spokesman said the prince's decision, announced by
Buckingham Palace, was made in consultation with the government. It follows
postponement of a British trade fair in the Austrian capital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As soon as the new Austrian government was appointed, we submitted advice
to the palace and we have been in constant touch with them,'' the Foreign Office
spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said last week that Britain would be watching
Austria's new government closely to be sure it honors its obligations as a
member of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have made clear our deep concern and distaste at the inclusion in the
Austrian government of a far-right party which appeals to xenophobia,'' Cook
said, referring to Joerg Haider's Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
	   The British Embassy in Vienna said Charles' visit was delayed as a result of
the postponement of the British trade events that had been scheduled May 17 to
28.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has in the past opposed immigration and European integration, lauded
the Nazi's ``orderly employment policy'' and praised former members of the
Waffen SS. He has apologized for the latter comments.
</P>
<P>
	   Austria's new coalition was sworn in last week. The other 14 members of the
European Union have since frozen bilateral diplomatic relations with Austria.
Israel recalled its ambassador.
</P>
<P>
	   The Austrian parliament debated the international isolation Tuesday, but the
opposition failed to pass a vote of no-confidence in the new Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands have protested in the streets of Vienna, while Austria's arts
community expressed fears of intolerance and curbs on freedom of expression. The
artistic director of the Salzburg Festival, Gerard Mortier, said he will cancel
his contract after this year's summer program.
</P>
<P>
	   Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands created controversy at home this week by
going ahead with her annual Austrian ski vacation, which began Saturday. She was
the first head of state to visit since the new government was formed, and
critics in the Netherlands accused her of effectively endorsing Haider.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Belgians Can't Sue U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By ESTES THOMPSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Relatives of five Belgians killed when a Marine jet
sliced through a ski gondola cable in the Italian Alps cannot seek damages in
the United States, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   While sympathizing with the families, U.S. District Judge Malcolm Howard
said their only recourse is through a NATO agreement covering NATO forces in
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
	   To allow the families to sue in the United States ``could conceivably
undercut the treaty and create a cause of action for any overseas military
accident,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty people were killed in 1998 when a low-flying EA-6B Prowler severed
the cable and sent a ski gondola crashing to the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   The relatives' attorney, Torrence Armstrong, argued that while the accident
occurred overseas, several problems had roots in the United States: a faulty
altitude gauge on the jet, outdated maps and inadequate flight crew training.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong said he would seek $6 million to $6.5 million for each of the five
victims if the case went to trial.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the Italian Senate approved up to $2 million for each family,
with the U.S. government paying $1.5 million of each settlement. The money has
not yet been distributed.
</P>
<P>
	   A military jury at Camp Lejeune acquitted the jet's pilot, Capt. Richard
Ashby, of manslaughter, but he served several months in prison and was dismissed
from the Marine Corps for helping destroy a videotape of the flight. The jet's
navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, also was dismissed over the videotape.
Charges were dropped against two back-seat crewmen.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Cops Seek Payment From Govt.  </HEADLINE>
   By DERRILL HOLLY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- City officials pressed Congress on Tuesday to give local
police annual payments to help cover the costs of security at events like the
Million Man March, national abortion protests and demonstrations near foreign
embassies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've expended almost $4 million out of our budget to cover overtime
costs,'' Chief Charles H. Ramsey told a Capitol Hill news conference, citing
several activities in the past 12 months that generated significant expenses for
his department.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the New Year's Eve's American Millennium Celebration was held on
the National Mall, the city police department provided the lion's share of
security for the event, Ramsey noted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had 700 people that I devoted to assist with that,'' said Ramsey, who
also mentioned the NATO 50th Anniversary in April and demonstrations linked to a
planned Neo-Nazi rally in August as examples of events that cost district
taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars each.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the events are usually peaceful, district police are routinely
called out to augment smaller contingents deployed by the U.S. Capitol and Park
Police and the General Services Administration's Federal Protective Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The costs should be borne by American taxpayers,'' said Del. Eleanor
Holmes Norton, D-D.C. The district's nonvoting representative to Congress has
introduced a bill authorizing a federal contribution to cover the district's
public safety costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Prior to the passage of the 1997 Revitalization Act that helped the district
government escape its financial crisis, Congress made a public safety payment to
the city each year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The amounts ranged from $5 million to $30 million annually depending on
the need,'' Norton said, expressing support for reimbursements in that range.
</P>
<P>
	   Language in the act also recognizes that as the nation's capital, the
district faced certain ``unusual costs'' such as assisting with the security of
national and foreign dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the president moves outside of the White House complex, our police
line the streets,'' Norton said.

<P>
    CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A rocket blasted off Tuesday carrying four more
Globalstar communication satellites into space.
</P>
<P>
	   The new satellites join 48 already in orbit for Globalstar, all part of a
$3.8 billion network providing wireless telephone communication. Four of the 52
satellites will serve as spares.
</P>

</P>
<P>
	   The Globalstar consortium of 12 companies was founded by Loral Space and

<HEADLINE> Deutch Gives Up Pentagon Clearances  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Deutch, the former CIA director who lost his access
to agency secrets last summer for violating security rules, volunteered Tuesday
to give up his Defense Department industrial security clearances.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the clearances would be withdrawn in
line with Deutch's wish.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Defense Secretary William Cohen said the Pentagon was considering
pulling Deutch's clearances but believed it needed to weigh legal considerations
before taking any action against him.
</P>
<P>
	   The actions are highly unusual and result from the CIA's discovery last
summer that Deutch had downloaded classified documents into his unsecured home
computer, in violation of security rules, while he was head of the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch previously had been deputy secretary of defense. He spent 38 years in
public service before leaving the CIA in December 1996. He has not been accused
of compromising Pentagon or CIA secrets.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch said in a letter to Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre that he has
no need for access to Pentagon classified information and therefore prefers that
his three remaining Pentagon clearances be discontinued. His industrial security
clearances gave him access to classified information about defense technologies;
such clearances commonly are granted to people working on Defense Department
contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch's letter was transmitted to Hamre today by his attorney at the
Washington law office of Williams &AMP; Connolly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has been Mr. Deutch's practice since his CIA clearance was suspended by
Director Tenet last August to avoid access to any classified information,
including classified documents, meetings and conversations,'' the letter states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Therefore, there is no need to continue these industrial security
clearances at this time and he asks that they be discontinued.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the time CIA Director George Tenet suspended Deutch's security clearance
at the agency, the Pentagon cut off Deutch's access to Defense Intelligence
Agency information. But the Pentagon allowed Deutch to keep his industrial
security clearances, which allowed him to have access to some classified
information.
</P>
<P>
	   When he acted against Deutch, Tenet said the CIA had found no evidence that
national security information was lost due to Deutch's security lapses, but
``potential for damage to U.S. security existed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
said Tuesday it was hard for him to conceive of any other outcome than for
Deutch to lose all security clearances.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby called the fact that Deutch still had Pentagon clearances, six months
after his CIA clearances were revoked, ``mind boggling.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby's committee met behind closed doors with CIA Inspector General L.
Britt Snider and was hoping that Deutch would accept its invitation to also
appear to discuss his security violations. Shelby said committee lawyers were in
contact with Deutch and his lawyers to try to work out an arrangement for such
an appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   A Deutch associate, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he expected
Deutch to comply with the committee's wish. The associate said Deutch was
traveling Tuesday and not available for direct comment.
</P>
<P>
	   If Deutch does not come voluntarily, the committee will consider issuing a
subpoena to compel his appearance, Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it is important that he come to the committee and let him explain
his version of events and his side of the story,'' Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before becoming CIA director, Deutch served as deputy secretary of defense
from 1994 to 1995. He now is a professor at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and acts as a consultant for several organizations with defense
contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   After weekend news reports about Deutch's continued access to classified
defense information, the Pentagon's inspector general asked the CIA for its
evidence on Deutch's security breaches, Defense Secretary William Cohen told
reporters. ``I think it should have been done sooner, but it was not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The industrial clearance allows Deutch to serve as a paid consultant on
defense contracts with the MIT, SAIC Corp. and Raytheon Corp., Pentagon
officials said.

<HEADLINE> ABC's 'Millionaire' a Potent Weapon  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- With another week dominating the television ratings, ABC's
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" has turned into a potent weapon in cutthroat
network competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Four editions of the quiz craze -- three regular airings and a special --
were the four most-watched programs on prime-time TV last week, according to
Nielsen Media Research. That special edition angered one of ABC's rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC scheduled it to air Wednesday opposite NBC's game show, "Twenty One."
Regis Philbin's game crushed NBC's newcomer, 28.3 million viewers to 8.3 million
viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC Entertainment President Garth Ancier later told The New York Times that
ABC's special "Millionaire" was a "cheap shot."
</P>
<P>
	   "If they continue to do this, at some point they can do tremendous damage to
this business," Ancier said.
</P>
<P>
	   Judging by last week's ratings, "Millionaire" has much less impact on more
established shows that air in the same time slot. That's an indication that the
quiz is bringing in a lot of new viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, Fox's Sunday airing of "The X-Files" was actually up 500,000
viewers from its season average. "Missing Pieces," CBS' Sunday movie from this
week, was only 400,000 viewers off CBS' average for its weekly movie.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS' "JAG," which was also shown opposite the special "Millionaire" last
Wednesday, was down 500,000 viewers from its average. And NBC's "Frasier,"
though it has clearly been hurt by "Millionaire" this season, was last week's
eighth most-watched show in prime-time.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week, ABC led with 15.9 million average prime-time viewers (10.2
rating, 17 share). CBS (8.8 rating, 14 share) and NBC (8.7, 14) both had 12.5
million viewers. Fox had 8.5 million viewers (5.5, 9).
</P>
<P>
	   UPN led the mini-networks, and has now slipped by its rival, the WB, in
average viewership this season. Last week UPN had 4.2 million viewers (2.9
rating, 5 share), the WB had 3.6 million viewers (2.7, 4) and Pax TV had 1
million viewers (0.8, 1)
</P>
<P>
	   NBC's "Nightly News" led the evening news competition with 11.7 million
viewers (8.6 rating, 17 share), ABC's "World News Tonight" had 11 million
viewers (7.9, 1 and the "CBS Evening News" had 9.2 million viewers (6.8, 13).
</P>
<P>
	   In late night, absence may be making David Letterman's fans grow fonder, or
maybe they don't miss him at all. Monday night's special "Backstage" edition of
"Late Show" with Julia Roberts and the ubiquitous Philbin -- a stopgap while
waiting for Letterman to return from heart surgery -- had higher overnight
ratings than any new show by Letterman on Mondays this season.
</P>
<P>
	   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of the nation's
estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the percentage of in-use
televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week of Jan. 31-Feb. 6, the top 10 shows, their networks and ratings
were:
</P>
<P>
	   "ER," NBC, 19.0; "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Tuesday), ABC, 19.0; "Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Thursday), ABC, 17.9; "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" (Wednesday), ABC, 17.6; "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Sunday),
ABC, 17.1; "Friends," NBC, 15.6; "The Practice," ABC, 14.6; "Frasier," NBC,
14.0; "Touched By an Angel," CBS, 13.7; "Everybody Loves Raymond," CBS, 12.5.

<HEADLINE> Heating oil prices top $2 a gallon for first time ever  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MANCHESTER, Conn. (AP) -For the first time ever, the price of home
heating oil has topped $2 per gallon in Connecticut, according to study by a
state energy specialist.
<P>
	   Doris Bellucci, an energy planning specialist for the state Office of Policy
and Management, released the chilling news on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bellucci said she had tracked home heating oil prices through the Arab oil
embargo of the early 1970s and the curtailed production of the Persian Gulf War
in the early 1990s. But until now, she said, prices had never topped the
$2-per-gallon mark.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a first. We've broken all kinds of records," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A survey Monday of 10 northern Connecticut fuel oil distributors found the
highest prices at from $2.05 to $2.10 per gallon, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams Fuel Oil LLC of Manchester was charging $2.10 per gallon; Somers
Oil Service was charging $2.07; and West Side Oil Co. of Suffield was charging
$2.05. But Fusco Brothers of Windsor was charging just $1.80, 16 percent less
than Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though wholesale prices for future delivery dipped a bit Monday on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, state officials said there appears to be no end in
sight to high retail prices that have ballooned from an average $1.06 a gallon
in late December.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Johanson, head of the OPM declined to speculate just how high the price
may soar.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know supplies are generally tight, and dealers are scrambling to get
product," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem, Bellucci said, is that retailers are watching the New York
Mercantile futures market, which on Tuesday was taking March contracts for home
heating oil at 75.8 cents per gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   She said retailers are afraid of getting stuck with a lot of high-priced oil
that they can't sell next month, when the price drops, so they're keeping
supplies razor-thin. When supplies are low, dealers outbid each other for any
available oil supply, driving up the price at the New Haven and Bridgeport
terminals, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The entire oil-supply picture has been further complicated, she said, by
substantial cutbacks in Arab oil production. Because of this, she said, U.S.
refinery production is running at only 86 percent of capacity instead of an
optimum 95 percent, further reducing supplies to frigid New England states.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said consumers should save their home
heating oil bills in the event that the state pursues a lawsuit against their
fuel suppliers and a judge orders refunds.
</P>
<P>
	   Blumenthal, who has begun a wide-ranging investigation of consumer
complaints, said his staff is busy reviewing pricing and other data that fuel
wholesalers, dealers, and related companies have submitted to the Department of
Consumer Protection. While he hasn't reached any conclusions, he said, he
continues to contemplate some sort of legal remedy to provide consumer relief.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge Dismisses Belgian Suit  </HEADLINE>
   By ESTES THOMPSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Relatives of five Belgians killed when a Marine jet
sliced through a ski gondola cable in the Italian Alps cannot seek damages in
the United States, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   While sympathizing with the families, U.S. District Judge Malcolm Howard
said their only recourse is through a NATO agreement covering NATO forces in
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
	   To allow the families to sue in the United States ``could conceivably
undercut the treaty and create a cause of action for any overseas military
accident,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty people were killed in 1998 when a low-flying EA-6B Prowler severed
the cable and sent a ski gondola crashing to the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   The relatives' attorney, Torrence Armstrong, argued that while the accident
occurred overseas, several problems had roots in the United States: a faulty
altitude gauge on the jet, outdated maps and inadequate flight crew training.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong said he would appeal to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the real tragedy is that the United States is not accepting
responsibility for this and is hiding behind the NATO agreement,'' Armstrong
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he would seek $6 million to $6.5 million for each of the five
victims if the case went to trial.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the Italian Senate approved up to $2 million for each family,
with the U.S. government paying $1.5 million of each settlement. The money has
not yet been distributed.
</P>
<P>
	   A military jury at Camp Lejeune acquitted the jet's pilot, Capt. Richard
Ashby, of manslaughter, but he served several months in prison and was dismissed
from the Marine Corps for helping destroy a videotape of the flight. The jet's
navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, also was dismissed over the videotape.
Charges were dropped against two back-seat crewmen.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani opens possibility for crashing Conservative primary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani declared his
independence from the state Conservative Party leadership again Tuesday but held
open the possibility that his name may end up in a primary for that party's
nomination for U.S. Senate.
<P>
	   "I'm open to all kinds of possibilities," Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think I would have a good chance," he said later. "You never know. And
the polls that I see show that actually that may be where I have my strongest
support, among the more conservative thinking voters."
</P>
<P>
	   This came as the Republican mayor, who has yet to officially announce for
New York's U.S. Senate seat but has given every indication that he will run,
appeared on several upstate radio talk shows.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, who announced her
candidacy Sunday, is touring upstate this week.
</P>
<P>
	   State Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long on Monday said he would
rather Giuliani didn't run for the Senate, saying he fails on almost every issue
conservatives hold dear including a ban on the procedure called partial-birth
abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani, like Clinton, supports abortion rights. But no Republican has won
statewide office in the past 25 years without the Conservative Party's
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm comfortable with who I am, what I am, what I stand for," Giuliani told
WROW in Albany. "If a political party can support me with all of the agreements
and disagreements, fine. If they can't, I'm not going to twist myself into a
pretzel in order to get their support."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked whether he thought he needed the backing of the Conservative Party to
win, the mayor said on WBEN-AM radio in Buffalo, "I need the backing of the
people of New York, that's what I need to win, not the backing of a particular
party."
</P>
<P>
	   "If you try to go lockstep in line with all these political parties, you
really lose your effectiveness as a leader. You also lose your effectiveness as
a senator," Giuliani added.
</P>
<P>
	   He would have to mend fences with Long to get into the Conservative Party
primary. State elections rules say out-of-party candidates have to get
signatures from 15,000 party members or 5 percent of a party's enrolled voters
and permission from the party's leadership - i.e. Long - to be in the primary,
said Lee Daghlian, a spokesman for the state Board of Elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani also covered other issues in his call-in tour. On WHAM radio in
Rochester, the mayor weighed in on the Cayuga land claim trial, which will
decide how much compensation the Cayugas should receive from New York for its
lost ancestral lands in Cayuga and Seneca counties.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't understand how the Clinton administration allows this almost
divisive dispute to continue," Giuliani said. "This is all based on alleged
mistakes or wrongdoing on the part of the federal government."
</P>
<P>
	   In Buffalo, he hit Mrs. Clinton again for the Billy Joel song "Captain Jack"
being played at her Senate announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Joel's 1973 song was about drug use.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton campaign has said it didn't know the song was to be played on
Sunday. "I'm surpassed that the Clinton camp didn't attribute the selection of
it to the vast, right-wing conspiracy," Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani faced criticism of his own on Tuesday. Ten Democratic City Council
members said that he has not worked well with them, despite his recent claims to
the contrary.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani on Sunday offered as proof of his ability to work with others his
relationship with the predominately Democratic City Council.
</P>
<P>
	   "Actually, Mayor Giuliani has vetoed more legislation than any other mayor
and filed more lawsuits (against the council) than any other mayor," Councilman
Stephen DiBrienza told a City Hall news conference. "I think most of us were
shocked or surprised and reacted with some amount of laughter upon hearing
Giuliani's claims,"
</P>
<P>
	   Said Councilman Bill Perkins, "It has been a relationship of litigation, not
legislation."

<HEADLINE> SUBS grfs 14-15 to ADD comment from media attorney  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Kennedy nephew charged in a 1975 murder in
upscale Greenwich will not be arraigned until next month, while a juvenile court
judge considers whether the public should be able to attend.
<P>
	   Michael Skakel, whose father is Ethel Kennedy's brother, was scheduled to be
arraigned in juvenile court on Tuesday. But Judge Maureen Dennis postponed the
arraignment until March 14, saying she wanted to consider a request from five
newspapers to open up the proceeding to the public.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel, now 39, will have his case heard in juvenile court, at least
initially, because he was 15 at the time the victim, Martha Moxley, also 15, was
killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Both families lived in Belle Haven, an exclusive gated community in
Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
	   Juvenile court proceedings are ordinarily closed to the public to protect
the youthful defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   Five newspapers - The New York Times, The Hartford Courant, Newsday, The
Advocate of Stamford and the Greenwich Time - had asked Judge Dennis to open the
proceedings - a request endorsed by Skakel himself.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspapers argued that Skakel is now an adult and the facts of the case
are already well known - made public, in fact, by Skakel's attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   After hearing arguments from the prosecution, the defense and a lawyer for
the newspapers, Dennis postponed Skakel's arraignment and said she would issue a
written ruling on the access issue sometime before the new arraignment date of
March 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "We resent the delays," said Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman. "It's been 25
years. We're ready to get this case going."
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel, who had flown to Connecticut from his home in Hobe Sound, Fla., for
the arraignment, did not end up going to the courthouse after the judge
postponed the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman said Skakel wants the hearing open to the public because he "wants
as many people as possible to see how bad this evidence is."
</P>
<P>
	   Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict, who took no position on the
access issue, said he hopes to have the case moved quickly to adult court. He
said he understood the judge's desire to consider the access request.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a decision that could have a lot of impact on future juvenile
proceedings in Connecticut," Benedict said.
</P>
<P>
	   David Fein, a lawyer representing the five newspapers, said he told the
judge that none of the considerations that usually mandate the closing of
juvenile court proceedings are present in the Skakel case.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no accused juvenile who needs protection," Fein said. "We have a
39-year-old adult who consents to open access, and there are public policy and
constitutional considerations that dictate that the proceedings should be open."
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel was charged with murder last month, more than 24 years after Moxley
was found bludgeoned to death with a golf club on her family's estate, located
across the street from the Skakel house. Skakel's father, Rushton, is the
brother of Ethel Kennedy, widow of the late U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-iron used to kill Moxley was traced to a set owned by the Skakel
family.
</P>
<P>
	   Retired Greenwich police Detective Stephen Carroll, who was one of the first
investigators on the case after Moxley was killed, went to juvenile court
Tuesday, hoping to look Skakel in the eye before his arraignment. He never got
the chance because the hearing was postponed.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was just a senseless crime," Carroll said. "For her life to be taken the
way it was taken was really ridiculous."

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading heavily
today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   The company had an operating loss of $3.2 million in the quarter ended Dec.
31, compared to an operating profit of $146.3 million a year earlier. British
Airways said it was hurt by the proliferation of low-cost fares in the market.
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street's
expectations of $1.10 a share, but the strong results were largely due to a
falling income tax rate. Analysts expressed concern over rising costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The French company, the world's fourth-largest producer of consumer
electronics, reported a 19 percent jump in revenues for 1999. Thomson cited
strong sales of products like digital video discs and digital decoders.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will replace Safeskin Corp. in the S&AMP;P SmallCap 600 Index after
the close of trading on Tuesday. Companies added to stock indexes often get a
boost as fund managers who try to mirror an index's performance buy shares of
the newly added company.
</P>
<P>
	   The company widened its losses in the fourth quarter, to $1.38 per share
from 61 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 1998. Global TeleSystems
operates a fiber optic network across Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares rose for a second straight session after the company was added to the
Internet Stock Review "Watch List" for 2000. The review is an online newsletter
that covers Internet-related public companies. Venture Catalyst offers
management and consulting services.
</P>
<P>
	   The company received an order for more than 28,000 intelligent mobile units
from SBC Communications Inc. The units provide vehicle fleets with location
tracking, mobile voice communications and a panic-alarm device.
</P>
<P>
	   The Latin American Internet portal narrowed its losses in the fourth
quarter, exceeding analysts' expectations. Starmedia said it lost 44 cents per
share in the quarter, compared with 53-cent loss in the fourth quarter of 1998.
Analysts expected Starmedia to lose 50 cents a share.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Flee Out of Lebanon's Range  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Israelis living near the
Lebanon border huddled in underground shelters or fled south out of rocket range
Tuesday, fearing reprisals by Lebanese guerrillas for the heaviest Israeli
bombardment in eight months.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Ehud Barak ordered a military state of emergency along the
border, a sign that Israel was preparing for extended fighting. Hezbollah
guerrillas on Tuesday killed an Israeli soldier -- the sixth in two weeks --
only hours after Israeli airstrikes cut electricity across parts of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In all that is connected with the protection of our people, our
settlements and our soldiers, we will do everything required,'' Barak told
residents of Kiryat Shmona who had spent the night in shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   In its second night of attacks, Israel's air force struck a Hezbollah
offices in the coastal city of Tyre and the guerrilla stronghold of Iqlim
al-Tuffah, Lebanese security officials said. At least two people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli army confirmed the two attacks on Iqlim al-Tuffah, but
identified the other target as a Hezbollah radar station.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli leaders blamed Syria for the latest flare-up and said peace talks
will not resume with Damascus until it ends the wave of Lebanese guerrilla
attacks. Syria is the main power-broker in Lebanon, and Israel says it
encourages the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   The airstrikes ``signal that ... the continuation of Hezbollah action with
Syrian encouragement and Lebanese government praise, must be stopped,'' said
Barak's foreign minister, David Levy.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria's state media warned that the bombing could hurt the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bombs and missiles are actually striking the already stalled peace process
and destroying all prospects of peace in the region,'' the English-language
Syria Times said.
</P>
<P>
	   The airstrikes early Tuesday destroyed three power stations at Jamhour near
Beirut, in the northern mountains east of the port city of Tripoli and in the
eastern Bekaa Valley town of Baalbek, a Hezbollah guerrilla stronghold where a
base for the group also was targeted. The base remained sealed and damage could
not be assessed.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifteen civilians were wounded in Baalbek and were treated at hospitals for
various injuries from broken glass, debris and shrapnel. Parts of Lebanon were
left without electricity and severe rationing was imposed.
</P>
<P>
	   The airstrikes were the harshest since a similar strafing by the outgoing
hard-line government, just before Barak took office in July.
</P>
<P>
	   The escalation in attacks on Israeli troops staffing a buffer zone in
Lebanon's south coincided with the collapse in Syrian-Israel peace in
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria wants a prior commitment from Israel that it will withdraw from the
disputed Golan Heights before talks ensue; Israel refuses, and says the
resumption of violence is a crude effort to get Israel to cave in.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak was getting closer to playing his own card against Syria -- a
unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon that would leave Syria without its single
most effective method of pressuring Israel, and would raise uncomfortable
questions about the presence of 30,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we will not reach an agreement (with Syria) in the next two months, I
believe -- I know -- that the Israel government will meet and decide if we will
withdraw unilaterally,'' Cabinet minister Haim Ramon, a Barak confidant, told
The Associated Press. Ramon is in favor of a unilateral pullout, and says most
other ministers are as well.
</P>
<P>
	   While such talk could influence a Syria that is eager to end its
international isolation, it will have little influence on the Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   Should the violence torpedo the peace, that would sit well with a militant
group that negates the very existence of the Jewish state. Should it hasten a
withdrawal -- with or without peace talks -- Hezbollah, seeking to expand its
political influence, would claim credit as the force that drove the occupiers
south.
</P>
<P>
	   With that win-win prospectus, the guerrillas showed no sign of holding back.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, their rockets hit an Israeli military outpost at Dabshe, two
miles north of the Israeli border, killing one soldier. A pro-Israeli militiaman
was later wounded in a separate guerrilla attack on the outpost of Bir Kallab in
southern Lebanon. He died later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   The prospect of the rockets reaching Israel prompted Barak's announcement,
through broadcast media, of a 48-hour state of emergency. That meant that
residents who stayed north were required to spend the night in shelters -- some
hardly livable, equipped with mildew-soaked mattresses that had not been
replaced in years.
</P>
<P>
	   Many headed south rather than face another night in the bowels of their
apartment buildings. Rachel Ben-Sultan, surrounded by four bulging suitcases at
the Kiryat Shmona bus station, said she was fed up with repeated emergencies
after 43 years in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If these attacks go on intensively, we will leave, we will go to a place
that has peace and quiet,'' she said before boarding a bus to stay with her
daughter in a town several miles southwest. ``We cannot go on like this.''

	   Dow Ends Up 51.81; New Nasdaq High
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index sprinted to another
new high today after the government reported that workers'
productivity is rising sharply, offering a potential buffer against
inflation. Blue-chip stocks shared in the good fortune, but pared
their gains late in the session. The Nasdaq rose 104.80 to
4,426.57, cruising past its record of yesterday. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 51.81 to close at 10,957.60. The blue-chip
index rose as much as 100 points early in the session. Stocks rose
after the Labor Department said productivity -- defined as the
amount of output for each hour of work -- rose at a 5 percent annual
rate in the fourth quarter. For all of last year, productivity was
up 2.9 percent.

	   American Productivity Is Up
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A key to economic vitality that also bodes
well for continuing low inflation posted the best performance last
year since 1992, a 2.9 percent uptick in American workers'
productivity for 1999. A burst in fourth-quarter productivity --
defined as the amount of output for each hour of work -- contributed
to the strong performance. Productivity rose by a
larger-than-expected 5 percent annual rate in the final three
months of last year, the biggest growth spurt since the fourth
quarter of 1992, the Labor Department said today.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shares of Internet discount retailer Buy.com
received a warm reception from Wall Street in initial trading today
despite investors' dwindling enthusiasm for Web-based retailers.
Buy.com opened at $30.12 1/2, more than double the offering price of

Internet retailer spent heavily during the holiday season to lure
shoppers to its Web site. The New York-based company said today it
lost $38.36 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $31.35
million a year ago. On a per-share basis, the losses remained the
same at 27 cents a share. The figures were in line with the

	   Silicon Valley Craves Foreigners
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- High-tech companies, desperate for workers in
a booming economy, want to hire more foreigners and are pushing
Congress to expand an immigration program that will let them do
just that. Congress temporarily expanded the program in 1998,
increasing the number of six-year visas from 65,000 to 115,000 per
year. But that hasn't satisfied the high-tech industry's appetite
for skilled workers with college degrees. Lawmakers on both sides
of the political aisle are developing legislation that would
respond to that desire, despite criticism from labor, which
contends the foreign workers are unneeded and underpaid at the
high-tech jobs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rebukes Europe on Defense  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- European allies are freeloading on the United States both
in Kosovo peacekeeping operations and on general military defense issues,
Defense Secretary William Cohen and top members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee asserted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our European friends ... cannot continue to rely upon the United States to
carry the heavy load,'' Cohen said as he testified on behalf of President
Clinton's defense budget for fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's budget calls for $277.5 billion in outlays. The overall spending
plan represents big increases in procurement of new weapons and modernization of
U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
	   But even as Clinton and Congress are moving to increase defense spending,
``You look across the Atlantic and you look at their budgets and they're cutting
their budgets,'' Cohen said. ``They can't spend any less. They should spend
more.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the committee chairman, announced he would seek to
link future U.S. payments for Kosovo to obtaining an assurance from the
president that European allies were meeting their commitments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have to live up to those commitments,'' Warner said. ``The United
States simply cannot pull ... the sole oar in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to flying two-thirds of the air missions during the 78-day war
against Yugoslavia, ``we are carrying a very major load today,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although plans call for an international civilian police force of 6,000,
today there are only 1,900 police, including 400 American officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Even when people get arrested, they ``have to be released for lack of a
judicial system,'' Cohen complained.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 50,000 peace implementation forces in Kosovo, about 6,000 are
Americans. Another 5,600 U.S. troops are in Bosnia, where American forces have
served since 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the committee, said
peacekeeping efforts in the Balkans ``could disintegrate unless the European
Union carries out its commitment to provide $36 million in urgently needed funds
immediately, and unless the European Union adds a substantially greater number
of civilian police.''
</P>
<P>
	   Levin accused the European Union of ``failure to meet their current
commitments in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
	   With the administration requesting a big boost in defense spending,
especially for multiyear weapons programs, as well as complaining about the
level of participation of allies, there was little room for disagreement between
Cohen and the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Cohen's request for a new round of base closings didn't draw much
enthusiasm. Congress has rejected such requests the past three years and isn't
likely to support one in an election year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know this is not a subject matter that stirs the hearts of the members
of this committee or certainly in the Senate and the other body,'' Cohen
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, he said, the additional base closings envisioned by the
administration would save $20 billion initially, and $3 billion annually in
following years.
</P>
<P>
	   If Congress doesn't authorize closing unneeded bases, paying to support them
will just mean less money for weapons and ``we're going to see our men and women
in uniform reduced in terms of their quality of life,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So the choice is going to be, you have to face it sooner or later. Sooner
would be better.''

<HEADLINE> Brits Negotiate With Hijackers  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- With the welfare of more than 150 exhausted
passengers foremost in their minds, British negotiators said Tuesday they were
prepared to be patient with the hijackers holding an Afghan airliner for a third
day.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators said talks, which gained the release of a ninth hostage Tuesday,
could go on for days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The negotiations are going forward in a professional way, in a fairly calm
way,'' said John Broughton, an Essex Police assistant chief constable. ``The
principal concern here is the safety of the passengers on board that aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
	   The aims of the hijackers, believed to be Afghans, remained unclear.
Speculation ranged from an elaborate play for political asylum to a bid to win
the release of Ismail Khan, a former regional governor in Afghanistan detained
since 1997 by the country's ruling Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about a potential asylum bid, Broughton said: ``In talking around the
issues, there are a lot of things raised.'' He would not elaborate, saying only
that the hijackers, who controlled the plane at Stansted Airport 25 miles north
of London, had made no ``formal demands.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the negotiations involved what Broughton called housekeeping issues,
such as the delivery of water and food to the Ariana airlines plane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've done everything we can to keep the conditions on the aircraft
habitable,'' said Joe Edwards, another Essex Police assistant chief constable.
``We're talking all the time about what's the condition of people and how are
the children.''
</P>
<P>
	   A London representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees arrived
at Stansted as an observer, police said Tuesday evening. She would not be a
negotiator, but would bring to the crisis the strength of the U.N.'s expertise
on the situation in Afghanistan, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing 727 had been headed to the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif
from the Afghan capital, Kabul, when it was seized early Sunday. It then began a
meandering journey across the former Soviet Union, stopping in Uzbekistan,
Kazakstan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   According to some of the 22 passengers released before the plane landed at
Stansted early Monday, the hijackers are eight young men armed with pistols,
grenades and daggers. Edwards said former hostages that authorities have talked
to have said there were between six and 10 hijackers.
</P>
<P>
	   They were believed to still be holding 156 hostages, including 21 children.
All the passengers were believed to be Afghans.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight passengers were released at Stansted on Monday, including two infants
who were treated for dehydration. The man released Tuesday, an asthmatic, had
complained of feeling ill, Broughton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The freed hostages have said they were treated well, authorities said. One
told reporters the hijacking started somewhat quietly 20 minutes into the
flight, with the armed men calmly telling passengers to put their hands on their
heads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people we are talking to are remarkably calm and that's really
important,'' Edwards said. ``The atmosphere is one of control, people behaving
rationally. That's going to help an awful lot.''
</P>
<P>
	   All six Iraqi men at the center of Britain's last hijacking drama -- a 1996
case involving a Sudanese airliner -- remain in the country as asylum-seekers,
the British government confirmed Tuesday. Those men held 197 people hostage for
seven hours at Stansted.
</P>
<P>
	   They were convicted in 1997 and sentenced to between five and nine years in
prison. But they were cleared on appeal a year later after a court ruled the
trial judge was wrong to bar jurors from considering their defense -- that they
were acting under ``necessity'' as opponents of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's
regime.
</P>
<P>
	   The men had claimed they stormed the plane in a desperate bid to enter
Britain and seek asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan is one of the top sources of asylum seekers in Britain. An
average of 360 applications a month has been lodged by Afghans since October.
Refugee status is granted in about a third of cases.

<HEADLINE> Spain's Leftists Challenge Govt.  </HEADLINE>
   By CIARAN GILES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spain's leftist parties have joined forces for the
first time since the country's return to democracy in 1978, posing an election
challenge to Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are united, overcoming our differences, this alliance is enough to
win,'' declared Socialist leader Joaquin Almunia in a ceremony formalizing the
pact Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   National elections will be held March 12.
</P>
<P>
	   The alliance of the Socialists and the Communist United Left could threaten
Aznar's right-wing government: In the 1996 general elections, leftist candidates
garnered 2.5 million votes more than Aznar's Popular Party.
</P>
<P>
	   But for the moment, the pact is little more than a mutual-support deal with
no radical policies expected. It remains to be seen whether the alliance is
strong enough to attract the hundreds of thousands of voters who turned away
from the Socialists in 1996 after a series of corruption and political scandals.
</P>
<P>
	   Aznar has dismissed the alliance as a farce. But he also has issued warnings
that a leftist government would end Spain's economic boom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As easy as we entered the euro single currency, we could just as easily
fall out,'' Aznar said. ``Those (the Socialists) who were incapable of getting
us into the single currency won't be capable of keeping us in it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The accord ends decades of animosity between the leftist groups. The tension
reached a peak during the 1982-1996 Socialist administrations of Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez, who was unable to agree on any issue with former United Left
leader Julio Anguita.
</P>
<P>
	   The Popular Party ended Gonzalez's nearly 14-year hold on office in 1996 by
winning 156 seats in the 350-seat lower house of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Aznar's party is still leading opinion polls, but it is not clear that he
will win enough seats to form a majority government. Failing that, his chances
of staying in office would depend on his ability to muster enough support from
regional nationalist parties to outnumber the combined seat tally of the
Socialists and United Left.

	   MOVE OVER IBM: Microsoft is the best company for people with disabilities to
work. According to WE, the lifestyle magazine for people with disabilities, in

</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft bumped IBM, which reigned the number one spot for two years. In
its slip to third place (Johnson &AMP; Johnson won second), WE editor-in-chief
Charles Riley II said it's not that IBM is doing less, but that other companies
are waking up to tight labor market demand and trying to attract and keep good
employees. Employees with disabilities tend to be loyal, Riley said.

	   BEWARE OF CUPID: Office romances can spark all types of trouble, and with
Valentine's Day edging closer, courting love could land you in court.
</P>
<P>
	   Unwelcome sexual advances and requests, physical or verbal, can result in
fines, discharge and in some cases, jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrew Sherwood, chairman and chief executive of Goodrich and Sherwood
Associates, a human resources and management consulting firm, warns extramarital
affairs in the workplace are particularly dangerous because they offer potential
for a variety of problems.
</P>
<P>
	   He also says single employees need to be careful about office romance, which
may result in conflicts of interest. If the affair fizzles more problems are
likely to arise. Yet, if love prevails, Sherman suggests you don't let romance
interfere with performance, disrupt routines or foster special treatment
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, an office romance survey by Officeclick.com, an online service
for administrative professionals, found 41 percent of nearly 1,150 workers
believe a failed office romance can mean a career derailment, in which one or
both partners leave the organization.

</P>
<P>
	   SHARE, BUT DON'T SHARE ALIKE: You don't need to be "rich" to share with
those less fortunate. At least three-quarters of charitable donations come from
individuals. Still, the Lutheran Brotherhood, a financial services provider
based in Minneapolis, estimates that those earning the highest salaries could
triple their donations and not feel a pinch.
</P>
<P>
	   Lutheran Brotherhood suggests you choose a cause and set a budget for
donations. (The Philanthropic Advisory Service of the Better Business Bureau and
the National Charities Information Bureau are good resources). After that, you
shouldn't feel obliged to help other organizations; particularly if you're
skeptical of the establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Giving to charities is tax-deductible as long as the organization is
tax-exempt under the Internal Revenue code. But if you're still strapped for
cash you can donate your time. Many volunteers say donating time is more
rewarding than donating money.

<HEADLINE> White House Opposes Nuke Waste Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After an unsuccessful attempt to reach a compromise, the
White House said Tuesday it continues to oppose legislation the Senate is
debating on storage of nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
	   While the bill might have enough votes to pass Congress, the administration
gave notice that President Clinton would veto it as currently written.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, expected to be voted on in the Senate later in the week, calls for
the government to take title to thousands of tons of highly radioactive spent
reactor fuel now at commercial power plants in 31 states.
</P>
<P>
	   It also would require that the waste begin to be shipped to a site in the
Nevada desert beginning in 2007 if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issues a
license for a permanent waste repository in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The permanent facility being proposed for Yucca Mountain 90 miles from Las
Vegas is still under scientific review, but is scheduled to be opened in 2010 if
it is found to be technically suitable and gets an NRC license.
</P>
<P>
	   As the Senate began debate on the interim measure Tuesday, Sen. Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the federal government has a legal obligation to
dispose of the more than 40,000 tons of used reactor fuel being held at power
plants across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate voted 94-3 to move ahead with debate on the waste bill, despite
strong opposition from both Nevada senators -- Harry Reid and Richard Bryan,
both Democrats. Bryan, Reid and Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., cast the only
votes against proceeding.
</P>
<P>
	   Reid and Bryan have said they oppose any legislation putting the nuclear
waste, which will remain highly radioactive for 10,000 years, in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's no way we're gong to support the legislation no matter what they
do with it,'' Reid told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House said in a statement it opposed the bill because it would
take away from the Environmental Protection Agency the sole authority to
determine radiation exposure requirements at a future permanent waste repository
if it is built in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president has said he would veto (the bill) if it were presented to
him in its current form,'' said the statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle of South Dakota said most Democrats
agreed to proceed with the bill because ``it's time to move on.'' But he said
``I don't think there's any doubt'' there are enough votes against the measure
to sustain a veto, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he expected a final vote on the
measure this week. The House has yet to act on the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has been grappling for six years over what to do with the
radioactive fuel stored at commercial reactors. The Senate has twice passed
legislation directing it be moved it to a temporary storage site in Nevada, but
each time the measure fell short of final approval by Congress because of the
cloud of a presidential veto threat.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House has been opposed to creating a temporary storage site in
Nevada because of concern that it would remove pressure to develop the permanent
Yucca Mountain facility.
</P>
<P>
	   Murkowski last year abandoned the idea of a temporary storage site and
crafted legislation that calls on the government to take title of the waste, but
keep it at the reactor sites until the NRC issues a license for the permanent
Yucca facility.
</P>
<P>
	   But the latest version of the bill puts into question the ability of the EPA
to issue radiation exposure standards for a future Yucca site, say the bill's
opponents. It calls upon the EPA to work with the NRC and the National Academy
of Sciences in developing such standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the bill have argued the proposed EPA standards are too
stringent and would make it difficult to bring Yucca Mountain into compliance.
They argue the NRC, which has proposes less stringent standards, should at least
have a say in the matter.

<HEADLINE> Diallo's father haunted by medical examiner's testimony  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Choosing his words carefully, Saikou Diallo tried to
explain a father's reaction to graphic pictures of how his son died from a
barrage of 19 high-powered bullets.
<P>
	   "It was a difficult moment," he said late Tuesday afternoon, minutes after
testimony ended for the day in the trial of four white police officers accused
of gunning down his son, Amadou Diallo. "But as I Muslim, I had strong prayer
for him - to see how he struggled before he died."
</P>
<P>
	   Saikou Diallo spoke immediately to reporters and television crews gathered
outside the trial, before family adviser the Rev. Al Sharpton or any other
attorney or adviser could address reporters as has been the case most days.
</P>
<P>
	   The West African emphasized in sometimes halting English that his son didn't
do drugs, wasn't an alcoholic and wasn't a trouble maker. "He was a clean man."
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's testimony included pictures of the 22-year-old man minutes after
he died in the Bronx one year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton said the photos, to him, helped proved the prosecution's case
against the police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The medical examiner raised some things that are extremely troubling,"
Sharpton said. He noted specifically grisly details of the shooting and
testimony that Amadou Diallo's body was moved by the police officers before
investigators arrived, possibly to try to revive the man.

<HEADLINE> Platinum,Palladium at New Highs  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Platinum and palladium prices soared Tuesday, reaching new highs on the
Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange on news of the latest delay
involving Russia's long-awaited return to the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Another metal in the commodities spotlight, gold, slipped for a second day
but remained above $300 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, heating oil declined 4 percent and soybeans also slumped.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia, which dominates palladium production and is No. 2 in platinum behind
South Africa, has been promising to begin resupplying both metals to the market
in large volume soon after a lengthy delay blamed on bureaucratic hangups. In
its absence, world supplies have shrunk and prices have climbed steeply.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, confirming Russia's return is not imminent, a government
official in Moscow said acting President Vladimir Putin has not yet signed
platinum and palladium export quotas due to "technical reasons."
</P>
<P>
	   The official, Valery Rudakov, head of the Russian state depository of
precious metals and stones, said the quotas are still expected to be signed
before the end of the month. But with industrial demand for the metals still
soaring, the news was enough to spur speculative buying and push prices still
higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Platinum for April delivery settled up $24.20, or 5.4 percent, at $498.50
per ounce after touching $502 -- a 9 1/2-year high. March palladium rose $38.90
-- 7 percent -- to settle at $579.80 an ounce after setting an all-time record
of $580.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're talking about a very, very tight-supplied market along with
significant demand that continues to drive prices higher," said Dave Meger,
senior metals analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago. "We're going to still
have tight supply and high prices until we see this metal delivered to the
market."
</P>
<P>
	   Gold dipped lower again on the New York Merc in the wake of a powerful 1
1/2-day rally that boosted prices well over $300.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the decline resulted from profit-taking and carryover from
Monday's news that Barrick Gold Corp. was revising but not suspending its
program for hedging -- betting on lower prices -- as fellow producer Placer Dome
had done.
</P>
<P>
	   April gold fell $2.80 to $301.70 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
	   Heating oil futures fell amid forecasts for rising temperatures that are
expected to ease demand in New England, the No. 1 heating oil-consuming region.
Traders also cited talk that the supply crunch is easing.
</P>
<P>
	   March heating oil fell 2.97 cents to 72.84 cents a gallon on the New York
Merc.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude oil was under pressure from remarks by Venezuela's oil minister, Ali
Rodriguez, who said he believes oil prices of up to $25 a barrel are
satisfactory to major consumers. March crude fell 43 cents to $28.02 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, March unleaded gasoline fell 1.14 cent to 77.48 cents a gallon and
March natural gas fell 6.7 cents to $2.495 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
	   In London, March Brent crude fell 51 cents to $26.37 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans declined on the Chicago Board of Trade after rains in Argentina
improved crop prospects in that drought-affected nation. Forecasts called for
more showers.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, a U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast projected long-term
U.S. soybean acreage as climbing by 1.2 million acres in 2000-01, at a time when
world supplies already are top-heavy.
</P>
<P>
	   March soybeans fell 6 1/4 cents to $5.00 1/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Legislators: new emissions reporting statistics alarming  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Bolstered by new federally mandated reporting
categories, toxic emission statistics for 1998 showed alarming increases in the
substances released into the state's atmosphere, legislators contended Tuesday.
<P>
	   The annual Toxic Release Inventory report from the state Department of
Environmental Conservation showed releases of 63.6 million pounds of toxics in
1998 compared with 29.9 million pounds in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   That dramatic difference was due to the addition of seven new industries
which had to report their emissions for the first time, including metal mines,
coal mines and electric utilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic state Assemblyman Steven Englebright, D-Suffolk, said the newest
statistics do not mean that there was a doubling of the toxics released into the
atmosphere between 1997 and 1998. But he said the addition of polluter
statistics in previously unreported industries shows the incomplete way toxics
had been accounted for prior to the latest study.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have been taking a picture of the environment each year with a thumb
over half the lens," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Environmental Conservation had no immediate reaction to
the toxics inventory. In past years, with the amount of reported toxics going
down, the department released the report and a news release trumpeting the
improvements. But no public notice was made when the report, with higher toxic
inventory numbers, was released last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Englebright said state policies toward controlling pollution and public
health policies might have to be revised in light of the more extensive
reporting of toxic releases.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the new statistics, electric utility emissions amounted to 41
percent of the overall toxic releases in 1998. Smokestack emissions into the air
increased from 18.9 million pounds to 33.2 million pounds between 1997 and 1998,
the increase largely because of power plants.
</P>
<P>
	   Mining activity added considerably to the toxics inventory, too.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said the 10.1 million pounds of chemicals generated by the Zinc
Corp. of America's mining operation in St. Lawrence County made it the worst
single polluter in 1998 in the first year it was listed in the toxics inventory.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one was even aware of it before, it is now the No. 1 polluter in the
state," Englebright said.
</P>
<P>
	   Second-worst polluter on the latest list was also a newcomer - the Chemical
Waste Management Services operation in the town of Porter in Niagara County.
</P>
<P>
	   The company which traditionally tops the emissions list, the Eastman Kodak
Co., fell to third in the 1998 statistics followed by traditional runner-up
Finch, Pruyn &AMP; Co. of Glens Falls.
</P>
<P>
	   Those four were followed by nine other first-time reporters to the
inventory, all power plants.
</P>
<P>
	   In many cases, companies reported putting toxics in landfills. The
Democratic legislators and environmentalists Tuesday said that while that is
preferrable to spewing the chemicals out of smokestacks, it is no guarantee that
the toxics have been neutralized or disposed of in ways they won't cause
problems in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   "Just because something is put into a landfill doesn't mean it's the end of
the problem," said John Stouffer of the Sierra Club. "Down the road these
facilities are going to be producing problems for future generations."
</P>
<P>
	   There remain other sources of potentially toxic discharges which are still
not getting onto the toxic release inventory. Smaller generators of such
substances don't have to report them to the state, the legislators said.
Farm-based substances like fertilizers also don't have to be reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a snapshot of the tip of the iceberg," state Assemblyman Richard
Brodsky, D-Westchester, said of the latest report.

<HEADLINE> Report: Nurse Offered $53K Apology  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- A nurse cleared of charges of killing 22 nursing
home residents reportedly has been offered $53,000 in government compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   Dorte Gramkow, 34, was arrested in 1997 and spent 65 days in jail on charges
of murdering elderly patients at the nursing home where she worked.
</P>
<P>
	   Gramkow had demanded $200,000 in compensation, and was disappointed by the
lower amount set by the national prosecutor's office for her time in jail.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This can't be right in light of the fact that everybody believed me to be
a serial killer,'' Gramkow said in an interview with Danish radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Her attorney, Thomas Roerdam, said he will appeal the prosecutor's offer to
the Ministry of Justice, even though the amount is high by Danish standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Gramkow's arrest in October 1997 on murder charges stunned Denmark and was
subject to widespread news coverage. The nurse was fired from the home after she
admitted embezzling funds from patients. She later retracted her admission and a
court acquitted her of that charge.
</P>
<P>
	   A doctor whose name was withheld by court order remains charged with five
counts of negligent homicide as well as dereliction of duty at the home.
</P>
<P>
	   Between August 1994 and January 1997, 22 mysterious deaths were reported at
the Plejebo nursing home in downtown Copenhagen. Police said the patients,
between the ages of 65 and 97, could have died from overdoses of a
morphine-based drug.

<HEADLINE> Woodbridge tax freeze for elderly, disabled may be duplicated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WOODBRIDGE, Conn. (AP) - With property values and school enrollment
climbing in this wealthy New Haven suburb, town leaders are trying a new
approach to tax relief - they have frozen property taxes for elderly and
disabled residents.
<P>
	   The tax relief plan, which takes effect for taxes due July 1, the first of
its kind in Connecticut. It could become an attractive alternative to other
towns seeking ways to resolve age-old tax disputes that pit the elderly against
young home owners with children in public school.
</P>
<P>
	   Woodbridge leaders hope the tax cut offer will encourage more senior
citizens to stay in their homes, providing for a good mix of residents and
preventing some young families from moving in and putting their children in the
already-burdened school system.
</P>
<P>
	   The average elderly Woodbridge taxpayer may be able to save $300 or so off
their tax bill, compared with the average per-pupil cost of $8,500 to $12,000 of
public schools, said First Selectman Roger Harrison.
</P>
<P>
	   "The math is pretty simple," Harrison said. "The value is inherent in
wanting to maintain a good level of seniors in town and keeping school crowding
down."
</P>
<P>
	   Seniors had complained that they do not get a fair share of town services,
because about 60 percent of the town budget goes to education, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan is not without some controversy. It is available to all residents
who are over 65 or disabled and who have lived in their homes as a primary
residence for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   David Owens, a 15-year resident of Woodbridge, said some kind of income
limit should be put in, because the town has many affluent residents.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would think it should have graduated income levels. An income cutoff
would be somewhat arbitrary," Owens said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrison, who also favors an income limit, said the tax break can be
modified in the future, after town leaders see how many take advantage of the
break and what the costs will be.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's property tax credit for low-income elderly and disabled people
has income caps of $29,300 for married people and $23,900 for single people.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents of towns including Madison, Orange and North Branford have
inquired about implementing a similar tax break.
</P>
<P>
	   North Branford leaders are investigating what the costs of such a tax break
would be, who could benefit and how it might work.
</P>
<P>
	   "It makes sense, certainly it's a very logical thought process," said Town
Manager Frank Connolly.
</P>
<P>
	   North Branford is looking at Woodbridge's plan, and a similar program
started in West Greenwich, R.I. in 1972.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature will look this session at expanding the state's credit for
other low-income people, said Sen. Martin Looney, D-New Haven, co-chairman of
the tax-writing Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fact that towns are willing to do this points out what we've been
saying for years - that the property tax is the tax people find most
burdensome," Looney said.
</P>
<P>
	   One senior resident, Kenneth Moulden, said he plans to take advantage of the
tax break.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a terrific idea, because it'll save some people who have low incomes a
good deal of money," Moulden said.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Examine Big Bank Failures  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some lawmakers warned Tuesday that tightening rules for
banks that make many risky loans to people with poor credit histories could hurt
low-income and minority neighborhoods that depend on such loans.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal regulators made the proposal because of concerns about recent bank
failures. Two big bank failures -- of First National Bank of Keystone, based in
Keystone, W.Va., and BestBank of Boulder, Colo. -- involved fraud and cost the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Seldom is a wake-up call as loud and clear as the one emanating from the
tiny town of Keystone, West Virginia,'' Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the
House Banking Committee, said at a hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators and lawmakers are concerned about the eight U.S. bank failures
last year, which occurred amid a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Large proportions of high-interest risky loans, known as subprime loans,
were made by six of the 11 banks that collapsed in the past 18 months, including
Keystone and BestBank.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDIC recently proposed doubling the minimum required funding for banks
that specialize in high-risk loans to people with inferior credit histories. The
other federal banking agencies are weighing the proposal, which applies to all
forms of consumer credit, including home mortgages, credit cards, auto loans and
personal loans.
</P>
<P>
	   But critics maintain that under the FDIC's proposed definition of subprime
borrowers -- those who have made two payments 30 or more days late or one
payment 60 or more days late -- many community banks that lend to low- and
moderate-income people would be adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
	   A ``rigid'' treatment by regulators of subprime lending ``could have a
chilling effect'' on loans in low- and moderate-income communities, said Rep.
Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Robert Weygand, D-R.I., warned that subprime borrowers who act
responsibly and repay their debts on time shouldn't be discriminated against
``because of a few bad apples.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Reserve Gov. Laurence Meyer, testifying at the hearing, said the
central bank is monitoring the activities of banks it regulates which engage in
subprime lending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the economy weakens -- as it ultimately will -- we can expect bank
losses from both previous risk-taking and bad luck,'' Meyer said. ``We can also
expect an increase in bank failures.''
</P>
<P>
	   The FDIC says it has found about 150 banks and thrifts with significantly
high levels of subprime loans. Together, those institutions hold about 5 percent
of total banking industry assets.
</P>
<P>
	   BestBank, for example, sold high-interest credit cards as part of a
travel-club membership to consumers with poor credit records. Its failure
drained some $225 million from the insurance fund, which backs each account up
to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the Banking Committee's senior Democrat,
urged people to ``keep the recent failures in perspective.'' He noted that
during the banking crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s, some 3,000 banks,
thrifts and credit unions failed in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach said ``the good news is that the American banking system has never
been stronger'' and the FDIC's insurance fund is at a record high level of some
$29 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach said some regulators may not have properly supervised the Keystone
bank, which grew by paying high interest rates to attract capital from across
the country, when it engaged in risky financial strategies.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it appears the FDIC was stymied at key points in its desire to
examine the bank's activities, and that the independent FDIC and the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency -- the Treasury Department agency that oversaw
the bank -- ``failed to cooperate closely.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Comptroller John D. Hawke Jr., told the lawmakers that his agency's
relationship with the FDIC ``has been cooperative and productive.''
</P>
<P>
	   The FDIC's estimated $800 million loss caused by Keystone's collapse would
put it among the 10 most expensive ever in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, Leach has proposed legislation that would give the head of the
FDIC more authority over troubled banks. But he told reporters after the hearing
that he had seen ``good steps toward cooperation'' by the two agencies and he
might not press his proposal.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Earns $173M; Shares Tumble  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna posted stronger-than-expected fourth quarter profits
Tuesday, but the health insurer's stock slid nearly 18 percent after it said it
was having trouble controlling rising medical costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna, the nation's largest health insurer, said its fourth quarter
operating profit excluding one-time items rose 30 percent to $173 million or
$1.18 per share, from $144.5 million or 91 cents a share in the same period a
year ago. Results beat Wall Street estimates by eight cents, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income in the fourth quarter was $134.5 million or 92 cents a share,
down from $231.8 million or $1.50 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues rose 46 percent to $6.3 billion from $4.29 billion, largely
reflecting Aetna's purchase of Prudential Health Care in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said Aetna was only able to surpass earnings forecasts due to the
sale of an insurance subsidiary in Brazil and lower-than-expected taxes in
several countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of the Hartford-based company were pummeled because the company
reported its medical costs, especially in covering seniors, were higher than
anticipated, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna shares fell $9.87 1/2 to $45.87 1/2 as of 4:30 p.m. on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna's stock has been under pressure since last fall when the company
became subject to several class action suits filed by the same trial attorneys
who won big awards against the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has also had more difficulty than expected in turning around the
money-losing Prudential business.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna has also had to wage a public relations battle to maintain its image
against consumers groups and medical providers who argue the company skimps on
care.
</P>
<P>
	   "The earnings reflect the difficult nature of the business especially for a
company that is under attack from so many outside sources," said David Shove, an
analyst with Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   In a key indicator of financial health, Aetna spent 95.3 cents of each
dollar received in premiums on health care costs in treating seniors, up from
92.6 cents a year ago, signaling they are spending they are spending more money
on health care costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Due to its purchase of Prudential Healthcare, the number of members in Aetna
U.S. Healthcare, the company's health insurance division, rose by 5.1 million
people in 1999 to 21 million. But number of members is expected to fall
dramatically this year due to the company raising premiums to keep up with
rising medical costs.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Aetna's operating income rose 19 percent to $676.4 million
or $4.44 per share from $567 million or $3.52 per share in 1998. Net income was
$716.9 million or $4.72 per share, down from $848.1 million or $5.41 per share.

<HEADLINE> Deutch Gives Up Pentagon Clearances  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Deutch, the former CIA director who lost his access
to agency secrets last summer for violating security rules, volunteered Tuesday
to give up his Defense Department industrial security clearances.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the clearances would be withdrawn in
line with Deutch's wish.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Defense Secretary William Cohen said the Pentagon was considering
pulling Deutch's clearances but believed it needed to weigh legal considerations
before taking any action against him.
</P>
<P>
	   The actions are highly unusual and result from the CIA's discovery last
summer that Deutch had downloaded classified documents into his unsecured home
computer, in violation of security rules, while he was head of the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch previously had been deputy secretary of defense. He spent 38 years in
public service before leaving the CIA in December 1996. He has not been accused
of compromising Pentagon or CIA secrets.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch said in a letter to Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre that he has
no need for access to Pentagon classified information and therefore prefers that
his three remaining Pentagon clearances be discontinued. His industrial security
clearances gave him access to classified information about defense technologies;
such clearances commonly are granted to people working on Defense Department
contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch's letter was transmitted to Hamre today by his attorney at the
Washington law office of Williams &AMP; Connolly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has been Mr. Deutch's practice since his CIA clearance was suspended by
Director Tenet last August to avoid access to any classified information,
including classified documents, meetings and conversations,'' the letter states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Therefore, there is no need to continue these industrial security
clearances at this time and he asks that they be discontinued.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the time CIA Director George Tenet suspended Deutch's security clearance
at the agency, the Pentagon cut off Deutch's access to Defense Intelligence
Agency information. But the Pentagon allowed Deutch to keep his industrial
security clearances, which allowed him to have access to some classified
information.
</P>
<P>
	   When he acted against Deutch, Tenet said the CIA had found no evidence that
national security information was lost due to Deutch's security lapses, but
``potential for damage to U.S. security existed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
said Tuesday it was hard for him to conceive of any other outcome than for
Deutch to lose all security clearances.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby called the fact that Deutch still had Pentagon clearances, six months
after his CIA clearances were revoked, ``mind boggling.'' In volunteering to
give up the security clearances, ``I think he was just reacting to reality,''
Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby's committee met behind closed doors with CIA Inspector General L.
Britt Snider and was hoping that Deutch would accept its invitation to also
appear to discuss his security violations. Shelby said committee lawyers were in
contact with Deutch and his lawyers to try to work out an arrangement for such
an appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby and other committee members said afterwards that Snider's testimony
raised a lot of questions over Tenet's handling of the case and slowness to act.
He said Tenet had acted ``with kid's gloves'' in moving to discipline the former
CIA director and that his panel will hold more hearings to answer ``one of the
real central questions -- was there a cover-up?''
</P>
<P>
	   Snider, the inspector general, in brief comments with reporters, said his
report ``showed no intentional impeding'' of the investigation with Tenet. He
said he had presented his report to the committee on the matter ``and that
report is quite detailed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., a committee member, said the inspector general's
testimony partly rebutted Tenet's contention that Deutch was mostly creating
reports and memos on his computer and not downloading secret files. ``It was
more serious than that,'' Allard said. ``There was a transfer of material.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Deutch associate, speaking on condition/of anonymity, said he expected
Deutch to comply with the committee's wish. The associate said Deutch was
traveling Tuesday and not available for direct comment.
</P>
<P>
	   If Deutch does not come voluntarily, the committee will consider issuing a
subpoena to compel his appearance, Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it is important that he come to the committee and let him explain
his version of events and his side of the story,'' Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before becoming CIA director, Deutch served as deputy secretary of defense
from 1994 to 1995. He now is a professor at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and acts as a consultant for several organizations with defense
contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   After weekend news reports about Deutch's continued access to classified
defense information, the Pentagon's inspector general asked the CIA for its
evidence on Deutch's security breaches, Defense Secretary William Cohen told
reporters. ``I think it should have been done sooner, but it was not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The industrial clearance allows Deutch to serve as a paid consultant on
defense contracts with the MIT, SAIC Corp. and Raytheon Corp., Pentagon
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Diallo's father haunted by medical examiner's testimony  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Choosing his words carefully, Saikou Diallo tried to
explain a father's reaction to graphic pictures of how his son died from a
barrage of 19 high-powered bullets.
<P>
	   "It was a difficult moment," he said late Tuesday afternoon, minutes after
testimony ended for the day in the trial of four white police officers accused
of gunning down his son, Amadou Diallo. "But as a Muslim, I had strong prayer
for him - to see how he struggled before he died."
</P>
<P>
	   Saikou Diallo spoke immediately to reporters and television crews gathered
outside the trial, before family adviser the Rev. Al Sharpton or any other
attorney or adviser could address reporters as has been the case most days.
</P>
<P>
	   The West African emphasized in sometimes halting English that his son didn't
do drugs, wasn't an alcoholic and wasn't a trouble maker. "He was a clean man."
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's testimony included pictures of the 22-year-old man minutes after
he died in the Bronx one year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton said the photos, to him, helped proved the prosecution's case
against the police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The medical examiner raised some things that are extremely troubling,"
Sharpton said. He noted specifically grisly details of the shooting and
testimony that Amadou Diallo's body was moved by the police officers before
investigators arrived, possibly to try to revive the man.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Yen on Japan Outlook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar gained more ground against the yen on Tuesday as
new signs of a healthy U.S. economy contrasted sharply with a worsening outlook
on Japan's fragile recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was quoted at 109.35 yen in late New York trading, up from 108.78
yen at the same point on Monday. In other trading, the euro rose to 98.61 cents
compared with late Monday's quote of 98.00 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   The yen also fell sharply on Monday following discouraging remarks by
Japan's chief economic planner, Taichi Sakaiya, who cautioned in a television
interview over the weekend that the Japanese economy may have shrunk during the
October-December quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   If that's true, it would mark the second consecutive quarter of contraction,
meeting the textbook definition of an economy in recession.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar, meanwhile, was lifted by yet another report pointing to
continued growth in the U.S. economy without rising inflation and interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department reported that productivity -- defined as the amount of
output for each hour of work -- rose by a larger-than-expected 5 percent annual
rate in the final three months of last year, helping offset pricing pressures.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.6306 Swiss francs, down
from 1.6387 on Monday, and 1.4463 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4458.
</P>
<P>
	   The British pound rose to $1.6108, up from $1.5964 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Monday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9836 German marks, down from 1.9952 on
Monday; 6.6527 French francs, down from 6.6917; and 1,963.76 Italian lire, up
from 1,975.28.

<HEADLINE> Cisco Earns Up 53 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By CLIFF EDWARDS AP Technology Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Cisco Systems beat Wall Street forecasts again with
its latest quarterly results, posting a 53 percent increase in sales as
businesses and governments snapped up equipment to conduct commerce on the Web.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, which also announced another stock split, reported Tuesday that
operating income rose to $906 million, or 25 cents a share, in its second
quarter ended Jan. 29. Those numbers compare with $609 million, or 17 cents a
share, in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales, meanwhile, totaled $4.35 billion, jumping from $2.95 billion a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors had expected an operating profit of 24 cents a share in the latest
quarter, according to a survey of analysts by First Call/Thomson Financial. In
addition to beating that number, the results also matched the unofficial
"whisper" estimates that circulate on Wall Street and the Internet before a
major earnings report.
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco's shares shot higher after the report, which was released after the
close of Tuesday's regular trading. The stock, which had advanced just 6 1/4
cents to $125.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, soared above $133 in extended
trading on other markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Internet revolution momentum continues to accelerate across all
geographies," said John Chambers, the company's president and chief executive.
"Our goal continues to be to grow as fast, or faster, than the rest of the
market."
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco has emerged as one of the most consistent growers in the technology
industry because of soaring demand for its switches and routers, which are used
to direct communications traffic for both corporate computer networks and the
broader, public networks run by telecommunications companies and Internet
service providers.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say the company is poised for another strong year as corporations
boost their technology spending now that there's no worry about computer
disruptions from the Year 2000 date change.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think there is a whole lot new or different here," said Nutmeg
Securities analyst Andy Schopick. "The company's business continues to grow very
nicely."
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Cisco said the Y2K issue is largely behind and that sales have
picked up in the United States, Japan and around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco's operating earnings for the latest quarter excluded certain one-time
expenses and gains that left the company with a net profit of $825 million, or
23 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income for the first six months of the year totaled $1.25 billion, or 34
cents a share, up from $791 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. Net
sales rose 52 percent to $8.26 billion from $5.44 billion.

<HEADLINE> Woodbridge tax freeze for elderly, disabled may be duplicated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WOODBRIDGE, Conn. (AP) - With property values and school enrollment
climbing in this wealthy New Haven suburb, town leaders are trying a new
approach to tax relief - they have frozen property taxes for elderly and
disabled residents.
<P>
	   The tax relief plan, which takes effect for taxes due July 1, is the first
of its kind in Connecticut. It could become an attractive alternative to other
towns seeking ways to resolve age-old tax disputes that pit the elderly against
young home owners with children in public school.
</P>
<P>
	   Woodbridge leaders hope the tax cut offer will encourage more senior
citizens to stay in their homes, providing for a good mix of residents and
preventing some young families from moving in and putting their children in the
already-burdened school system.
</P>
<P>
	   The average elderly Woodbridge taxpayer may be able to save $300 or so off
their tax bill, compared with the average per-pupil cost of $8,500 to $12,000 of
public schools, said First Selectman Roger Harrison.
</P>
<P>
	   "The math is pretty simple," Harrison said. "The value is inherent in
wanting to maintain a good level of seniors in town and keeping school crowding
down."
</P>
<P>
	   Seniors had complained that they do not get a fair share of town services,
because about 60 percent of the town budget goes to education, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan is not without some controversy. It is available to all residents
who are over 65 or disabled and who have lived in their homes as a primary
residence for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   David Owens, a 15-year resident of Woodbridge, said some kind of income
limit should be put in, because the town has many affluent residents.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would think it should have graduated income levels. An income cutoff
would be somewhat arbitrary," Owens said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrison, who also favors an income limit, said the tax break can be
modified in the future, after town leaders see how many take advantage of the
break and what the costs will be.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's property tax credit for low-income elderly and disabled people
has income caps of $29,300 for married people and $23,900 for single people.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents of towns including Madison, Orange and North Branford have
inquired about implementing a similar tax break.
</P>
<P>
	   North Branford leaders are investigating what the costs of such a tax break
would be, who could benefit and how it might work.
</P>
<P>
	   "It makes sense, certainly it's a very logical thought process," said Town
Manager Frank Connolly.
</P>
<P>
	   North Branford is looking at Woodbridge's plan, and a similar program
started in West Greenwich, R.I. in 1972.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature will look this session at expanding the state's credit for
other low-income people, said Sen. Martin Looney, D-New Haven, co-chairman of
the tax-writing Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fact that towns are willing to do this points out what we've been
saying for years - that the property tax is the tax people find most
burdensome," Looney said.
</P>
<P>
	   One senior resident, Kenneth Moulden, said he plans to take advantage of the
tax break.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a terrific idea, because it'll save some people who have low incomes a
good deal of money," Moulden said.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton calls for letting cheaper Canadian drugs into  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Newly official Senate candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton waded back into the health care wars Tuesday, calling for legislation
allowing cheaper prescription drugs to be imported into the United States from
Canada.
<P>
	   Clinton, who led the failed effort of her husband's administration in 1993
and 1994 to overhaul the nation's health care financing system, told more than
400 medical professionals at a Rochester medical center, that "I didn't give up
then and I won't give up now."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has vowed to make health care costs a major campaign issue in the
race that is expected to pit her against New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   In Rochester, she picked up the endorsement of the American Nurses
Association for the Senate campaign she made official on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady reiterated her earlier support for a patients' bill of
rights, expanding Medicare by adding a prescription drug benefit and protecting
the privacy of medical records and outlawing genetic discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   But the cornerstone of her proposal Tuesday was her call for letting cheaper
Canadian drugs, that have Federal Drug Administration approval, be imported into
this country.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for the pharmaceutical industry said, however, that Clinton's
plan was "absolutely the wrong way to go," could leave patients vulnerable to
unsafe or ineffective drugs and was likely the product of election-year
politics.
</P>
<P>
	   For her part, Clinton said that "if we want to make health care affordable,
we must lower the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans."
</P>
<P>
	   "Prescription drugs are a necessity and yet they are priced as a luxury,"
she added. "Their costs are rising at 12 percent a year, faster than any other
part of our health care system."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said one of the reasons for the price increases was that "the
industry will spend $1.8 billion this year on advertising. We are the only
industrialized nation in the world that permits prescription drugs to be
advertised directly to consumers on TV and in print."
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, she noted that Canadians benefit from a price-control
system that means a three-month supply of tamoxifen, used to battle breast
cancer, can be purchased for $50 in that country. It sells for $390 in the
United States, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every day, thousands of our citizens cross the border to buy drugs at a
fraction of the cost," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   "These drugs are made with the same ingredients and they offer the same
benefits," Clinton said. "They are made in the exact same factories, factories
most often owned by U.S. pharmaceutical companies."
</P>
<P>
	   Taking care to note her new New York roots, Clinton said, "I was always told
that New Yorkers never bought retail. Well, that's wrong when it comes to drugs,
and it must stop."
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said the plan could
save Americans up to 15 percent in drug costs.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jackie Cottrell, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, a trade group representing about 100 companies, said
"what she is proposing would overturn landmark consumer protection legislation"
- the Prescription Drug Marketing Act approved in 1988 that banned the
reimportation of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "From the pharmaceutical industry's point of view, the answer isn't a scheme
like reimportation that could hurt patient safety or importing price controls,
it's to provide prescription drug coverage to those who use medicines the most,
and that's our senior population, through a reformed and strengthened Medicare
program," Cottrell said.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, in his new budget proposal, President Clinton has proposed
expanding Medicare to offer prescription drug coverage, a plan his wife said she
supports.
</P>
<P>
	   Cottrell said that while the industry does spend a hefty amount on
advertising, it is dwarfed by the $26.4 billion the industry spends annually on
research and development of drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "We shouldn't rush in an election year to damage consumer protection
legislation," she added.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Giuliani camp declined to comment on the Clinton proposal, it
noted that her idea wasn't new and that legislation has been introduced in
Congress by Rep. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and others to allow the importation
of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Cottrell said a difference between that legislation and the Clinton plan is
that her's would apply only to drugs coming in from Canada. She said the
pharmaceutical industry objected to even that change.
</P>
<P>
	   Cottrell said that while the idea of lower cost drugs from Canada "sounds
pretty appealing, the flip side of that is Canada has no major pharmaceutical
industry."
</P>
<P>
	   Just last month, President Clinton also took the drug companies to task for
the high cost of their products in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   "Someone should ask them how they can possibly justify the fact that
American senior citizens are now being carried across the border to Canada to
buy drugs produced in America," he said.

<HEADLINE> German Official Admits Lie on Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- A state governor who has led efforts to clear up the slush
fund scandal dogging Germany's Christian Democrats admitted Tuesday that he lied
about the source of party funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Hesse state Gov. Roland Koch's statement is the latest twist in a scandal
that has paralyzed the conservatives since former Chancellor Helmut Kohl
admitted secretly accepting $1 million in 1993-98.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl lost the national elections in 1998 to the Social Democrats, who also
faced allegations of shady campaign funding themselves for the first time
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch acknowledged he publicly maintained in recent weeks that about $750,000
came from a donor even though he knew since Dec. 21 that it was drawn on a
secret party account.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch said the money had flowed since he took office last April and that he
allowed aides to declare it as a loan from the party's former state treasurer.
He apologized for the ``blunder'' during a news conference in the state capital,
Wiesbaden.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch also revealed that a total of $12 million were funneled to Hesse
Christian Democrats through Swiss accounts dating from 1985 -- far more than the
$7.25 million traced previously.
</P>
<P>
	   Party officials say the accounts were set up to avoid tougher German
campaign finance laws that took effect in 1984, and they have admitted falsely
declaring flows from Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
	   But Koch sought to keep up the party's campaign to demonstrate openness,
saying ``more than 95 percent of the questions have now been solved'' in the
Hesse scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition parties urged Koch to step down, saying the slush funds helped
him win election.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, ZDF television reported that the Social Democrats themselves
collected $3.8 million in anonymous donations in 1982 for the election campaign
of former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
	   Parliament president Wolfgang Thierse is investigating the matter. Yet the
Social Democrats said prosecutors had cleared the party of wrongdoing because
the treasurer who solicited the money died before he could identify the donors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So the SPD did not submit a false audit'' for 1982, party treasurer Inge
Wettig-Danielmaier said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl's refusal to name anonymous donors and help clear up his party's
scandal led to growing pressure Tuesday for him to withdraw from politics. Kohl
has skipped parliament sessions and leadership meetings since the crisis started
late last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Goppel, secretary-general of the allied Christian Social Union, urged
Kohl to give up his seat at least until the scandal passes.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl has been alienated even from close former aides.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't understand Helmut Kohl any more,'' the party chief in North
Rhine-Westphalia, Juergen Ruettgers, told the Berliner Zeitung.

<HEADLINE> Study Looks At McGwire's Supplement  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDSEY TANNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Androstenedione, the supplement once used by Mark McGwire,
really does raise testosterone above normal levels and could be hazardous,
Harvard researchers say in a study financed by major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   Both baseball and its players' union said additional study is needed to
determine whether andro affects athletic performance.
</P>
<P>
	   A study last year found that the over-the-counter drug had no effect on
testosterone levels or strength and instead may promote breast enlargement,
heart disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   The new study lasted just one week and did not measure whether andro can do
what promoters have claimed -- make bigger muscles. But the researchers said
andro could have that effect because it increases levels of the male hormone.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a patient of mine came to me and asked whether he should take
androstenedione, I would caution against it simply because we don't know what
the long-term effects are," said Dr. Benjamin Z. Leder, the Harvard University
endocrinologist who led the study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Side effects of elevated testosterone levels include acne, male pattern
baldness and a decrease in "good" cholesterol, which could lead to heart
disease. In women, high testosterone can also cause increased body hair,
deepening of the voice and other male characteristics.
</P>
<P>
	   Androstenedione supplements are made of a naturally occurring steroid
hormone the body uses to make testosterone. When supplements of testosterone are
taken in high doses, they are known to have an anabolic effect -- increasing
muscle size and strength.
</P>
<P>
	   Andro sales soared after McGwire acknowledged using it in 1998, the year he
hit a record 70 home runs for the St. Louis Cardinals. He has since said he has
stopped using it.
</P>
<P>
	   Andro is considered a dietary supplement, but the federal government is
reviewing whether it should be reclassified as a steroid, which would remove it
from store shelves and make it available by prescription only for legitimate
medical uses.
</P>
<P>
	   It is banned by the Olympics, the NCAA, the NFL and the men's and women's
tennis tours, but not by major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   "That androstenedione, when taken in higher than suggested doses, elevates
testosterone levels appears to be a significant contribution to the science
surrounding its use," baseball commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement.
"While we are pleased to have played a part in the advancement of science, we
are also concerned about the effects of androstenedione use. More research is
needed."
</P>
<P>
	   The study of 42 men found increases in testosterone levels when andro was
taken for seven days in a single daily 300-milligram dose -- an amount that is
probably far smaller than what athletes and bodybuilders use.
</P>
<P>
	   The subjects, ages 20 to 40, were divided into three groups and received
either no androstenedione, 100 mg daily or 300 mg daily.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 300 mg group, testosterone levels in the blood increased by an
average of 34 percent by the seventh day, though levels had returned to normal
by the following day. The lower dose had no significant effect on testosterone
levels, though levels of the female hormone estrogen increased substantially
with both doses.
</P>
<P>
	   An eight-week Iowa State University study published last year in JAMA found
no increased testosterone levels with 300 mg, but the dosages were given in 100
mg increments three times daily. The authors of that study and the new research
said the dosage differences probably explain the new findings.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iowa study also found that andro increased levels of estrogen, which in
men can result in breast enlargement and other feminizing effects.
</P>
<P>
	   The new study results "will be factored into the federal review of the
proper classification" for andro, said Robert Housman, deputy director for
strategic planning for White House drug adviser Barry McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
	   Selig and union head Donald Fehr said they support applications by Drs.
Finkelstein and Leder for additional grant money.
</P>
<P>
	   "The study suggests as a next step research into the possible relationship
between the use of androstenedione and athletic performance," Fehr said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Gary Wadler, an associate professor at New York University's medical
school who has worked with McCaffrey, said the findings should come as no
surprise. He advocates reclassifying androstenedione as a prescription drug.
</P>
<P>
	   "We now see what we all knew, just being in the business," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cisco Earns Up 53 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By CLIFF EDWARDS AP Technology Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Cisco Systems beat Wall Street forecasts again with
its latest quarterly results, posting a 53 percent increase in sales as
businesses and governments snapped up equipment to conduct commerce on the Web.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, which also announced another stock split, reported Tuesday that
operating income rose to $906 million, or 25 cents a share, in its second
quarter ended Jan. 29. Those numbers compare with $609 million, or 17 cents a
share, in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income, which includes acquisition-related costs, goodwill writeoffs and
investment gains, rose from $825 million from $282 million in the year-ago
period. Sales, meanwhile, totaled $4.35 billion, jumping from $2.95 billion a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors had expected an operating profit of 24 cents a share in the latest
quarter, according to a survey of analysts by First Call/Thomson Financial. In
addition to beating that number, the results also matched the unofficial
"whisper" estimates that circulate on Wall Street and the Internet before a
major earnings report.
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco's shares shot higher after the report, which was released after the
close of Tuesday's regular trading. The stock, which had advanced just 6 1/4
cents to $125.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, soared above $133 in extended
trading on other markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Internet revolution momentum continues to accelerate across all
geographies," said John Chambers, the company's president and chief executive.
"Our goal continues to be to grow as fast, or faster, than the rest of the
market."
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco has emerged as one of the most consistent growers in the technology
industry because of soaring demand for its switches and routers, which are used
to direct communications traffic for both corporate computer networks and the
broader, public networks run by telecommunications companies and Internet
service providers.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say the company is poised for another strong year as corporations
boost their technology spending now that there's no worry about computer
disruptions from the Year 2000 date change.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think there is a whole lot new or different here," said Nutmeg
Securities analyst Andy Schopick. "The company's business continues to grow very
nicely."
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Cisco said the Y2K issue is largely behind and that sales have
picked up in the United States, Japan and around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco's operating earnings for the latest quarter excluded certain one-time
expenses and gains that left the company with a net profit of $825 million, or
23 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income for the first six months of the year totaled $1.25 billion, or 34
cents a share, up from $791 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. Net
sales rose 52 percent to $8.26 billion from $5.44 billion.

<HEADLINE> Health, social services for teens to get more funding  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - It has received awards, accolades and acceptance.
<P>
	   Now, it's finally getting a little more money.
</P>
<P>
	   After 11 years of being touted as a success in helping troubled teens stay
in school and out of trouble, the state's School Based Youth Services Program
would receive an additional $3.75 million in federal funds, under Gov. Christie
Whitman's proposed budget.
</P>
<P>
	   It would be the first significant expansion of the program since it was
started more than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Youth advocates say it's long overdue.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been waiting for this for a very long time," said Gail Reynolds,
administrator of school-based programs in New Brunswick and South Brunswick high
schools.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's great we'll have additional funding. But, it's not going to
cover all of the school districts and all of the districts should have access to
these kinds of services," she added.
</P>
<P>
	   The new money, which Whitman wants to include in her budget that starts in
July, would bring counseling, health and other services to about 13,000 students
at 15 additional high schools. The budget needs legislative approval before it
is finalized.
</P>
<P>
	   School-based programs are now operating in 31 New Jersey high schools,
serving about 20,000 students.
</P>
<P>
	   Started 11 years ago under former Gov. Thomas Kean, the pilot program was
touted as a "one-stop shopping" solution to the social problems that plague
troubled teens and contribute to high dropout and teen pregnancy rates.
Politicians figured if they put social and health services in the schools, the
kids would come.
</P>
<P>
	   And they were right. But funding for the program never kept pace with
demand. It started with about $6 million for programs in 29 high schools. This
year, the nationally recognized program received about $8 million for programs
in 31 high schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The additional federal funds would bring total funding to more than $11
million. The money would come from unspent welfare funds, available as the
state's welfare rolls have plummeted in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   The programs vary from district to district.
</P>
<P>
	   Some have recreation rooms where students can play Foosball or ping pong.
Most have counseling services. Others offer help with finding part-time jobs or
getting health referrals. Some provide parenting programs and child care
centers.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with these variations, the idea behind the program is pretty
consistent, state officials said. Give kids a place to go where they can hang
out, get homework help, a doctor's appointment or a lead on a job. Pretty soon,
they'll start to trust you with the sensitive stuff - the real troubles that
cause them to fail in school, drop out or get pregnant.
</P>
<P>
	   Schools typically receive a $250,000 annual grant from the state and must
donate space or other resources.
</P>
<P>
	   The state has not yet decided which new schools will be funded to open
sites, said Ed Tetelman, assistant commissioner at the state Department of Human
Services, which oversees the programs.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials plan to review proposals from districts around the state.
Tetelman said preference will be given to districts that can pull together a
wide variety of services under one roof.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll take a look at available space, staffing, how are they going to bring
the program together, so that the sum of the parts do become bigger than the
whole," he said. "We'll consider urban, rural and some suburban districts that
can really show a need."
</P>
<P>
	   A recent study showed that the school-based program really works.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting in 1996, the Academy for Education Development in New York City
followed a group of freshmen through the end of their sophomore year, said
Constancia Warren, senior program officer at the academy.
</P>
<P>
	   The study found that school-based programs helped students pass more of
their classes, feel better about school and themselves and feel less angry and
violent, said Warren. Students who attended these programs were also less likely
to smoke and more likely to use contraception if they had sex, she added.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a program that delivers on what it says it's going to do," said
Tetelman.

<HEADLINE> Barnes &AMP; Noble.com Losses Grow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnes &AMP; Noble.com's sales in the fourth quarter more than
tripled from a year ago, but its losses widened as the Internet retailer spent
heavily during the holiday season to lure shoppers to its Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York-based company said Tuesday it lost $38.36 million in the
quarter, compared with a loss of $31.35 million a year ago. On a per-share
basis, the losses remained the same at 27 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   That was in line with the estimates of Wall Street analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial. Barnes &AMP; Noble.com stock fell 56 1/4 cents to
$11.12 1/2, nearly 5 percent, in trading at 4 p.m. Tuesday on the Nasdaq Stock
Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter sales rose to $82.13 million from $25.88 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   In a strategy similar to other online merchants, Barnes &AMP; Noble.com poured
$43.5 million into advertising and marketing during the quarter to get its site
noticed in the crowded and competitive e-commerce marketplace.
</P>
<P>
	   Its efforts helped woo new shopper and got former customers to come back for
more.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnes &AMP; Noble.com said its customer base rose to 4 million during the
quarter, up from 1.3 million at the end of 1998. Repeat customer orders
increased to 66 percent, from 63 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The site was the fifth most visited Web shopping site during the month of
December, the heart of the holiday shopping season, according to Media Metrix, a
New York-based company which tracks how many different people visit sites.
</P>
<P>
	   But Barnes &AMP; Noble still trails its closest rival Amazon.com, which began as
an online bookseller in 1995 and has built itself into an Internet superstore
selling thousands of different items. Amazon reported last week its sales were
$676 million in the quarter and its customer based grew to more than 17 million
people.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last year, Barnes &AMP; Noble.com also has expanded its product offerings
beyond just books. It now also sells music, software, magazines, prints and
posters. The company said it will begin selling videos, DVDs and other related
products in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnes &AMP; Noble.com said it sees its losses narrowing in 2001, and it plans
to start making money in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The big traditional bookseller Barnes &AMP; Noble and German media conglomerate
Bertelsmann each own about 41 percent of Barnes &AMP; Noble.com. The rest was sold
to the public last May.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnes &AMP; Noble.com's chief executive Jonathan Bulkeley resigned from the
company in January. Steve Riggio, who created Barnes &AMP; Noble's original Internet
strategy and eventually founded barnesandnoble.com in 1997, is now acting CEO.
</P>
<P>
	   The company recently changed the style of its name to Barnes &AMP; Noble.com
from barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Barnes &AMP; Noble.com lost $102.4 million, or 77 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $83.15 million, or 72 cents a share, a year ago. Sales
for the year were $202.57 million, up from $61.83 million last year.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers call for gun ban in public buildings; tout success of  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Gun owners would have to check their weapons at
the door of all public buildings under legislation proposed Tuesday by key
Democratic lawmakers.
<P>
	   The proposal builds on an executive order issued last year by Gov. John G.
Rowland that banned state employees from bringing guns to work. There is
currently a prohibition against guns at the Capitol and the Legislative Office
Building.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Matthew Beck killed four of his bosses at the Connecticut Lottery
headquarters before committing suicide in March 1998, lawmakers have been
pushing for tougher workplace safety and gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will give the municipalities the clear direction they've been looking
for in terms of protecting people at the local level," said Senate President Pro
Tempore Kevin Sullivan, D-West Hartford.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the bill, possession of a gun in any publicly owned or operated
building would be punishable by up to five years and prison and a $5,000 fine.
Law enforcement officers would be exempt from the ban.
</P>
<P>
	   "It sounds like what they're proposing is to put the governor's executive
order into state law," said Dean Pagani, a Rowland spokesman. "I don't think the
governor would have a problem with that."
</P>
<P>
	   But gun activists say the proposal should be shot down.
</P>
<P>
	   "The state issues permits to carry for a reason," said Robert Crook,
executive director of the Coalition of Connecticut Sportsmen. "People who have
them are checked out and allowed to carry a gun anywhere. There shouldn't be
exceptions."
</P>
<P>
	   In October, a law went into effect allowing police to confiscate weapons
from people determined to be a danger to themselves or others.
</P>
<P>
	   Under that law, warrants could be issued only after a police investigation
concludes there is no other way to keep the suspect from doing harm. In deciding
whether to issue the warrant, a judge must have evidence that the person
recently tortured animals, threatened to kill himself or others, or acted
violently. If guns are seized, a hearing must be held within 14 days to
determine whether they should be returned.
</P>
<P>
	   "The minor inconvenience to a gun owner of waiting two weeks for a day in
court is insignificant compared to the potential harm to the public by a person
with a gun who is not in possession of his or her sanity," said West Hartford
police Chief James Stillacci.
</P>
<P>
	   In the four months since the law has been on the books, it has been used 10
times, said Rep. Michael Lawlor, D-East Haven.
</P>
<P>
	   The gun seizures have netted 31 handguns, 50 rifles - including
military-style assault weapons, 7,633 rounds of ammunition, nigh vision
equipment, bayonets and laser sights, lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
	   A judge overturned one of the arrests made under the law, ruling that police
did not follow proper procedure, Lawlor said.
</P>
<P>
	   The law has attracted national attention - both by lawmakers who have said
they will use the Connecticut statute as a model for their own gun control laws,
as well as gun activists who have branded it a "turn in your neighbor" law.
</P>
<P>
	   But the law's supporters say it has saved lives.
</P>
<P>
	   "This isn't an overzealous state government invading the homes of
law-abiding citizens and seizing guns for the fun of it," said Senate Majority
Leader George Jepsen, D-Stamford. "This law is a protection of individual
rights, as well as the protection of innocent citizens who may otherwise be put
in harm's way."

<HEADLINE> Hasbro Earnings Up 18 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL ZOLL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Hasbro Inc.'s fourth-quarter earnings rose 18
percent from a year ago, beating expectations thanks to strong sales of Pokemon
toys, Furby dolls and hand-held electronic games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pawtucket, R.I.-based company said Tuesday that it earned $155.4
million, or 79 cents per share, compared with $131.8 million, or 65 cents per
share, in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the nation's
second-largest toymaker to earn 75 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter increased 22 percent to $1.6 billion, compared with
$1.3 billion one year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Fueling the gains were strong sales of Furby, the interactive furry doll
that was introduced in 1998 but still sold a stunning 12 million units last
year. Also lifting sales and profits were its hand-held electronic games, most
of which are made by its Tiger Electronics division, and its toys based on the
popular Japanese cartoon Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also credited strong sales of core brands such as Monopoly,
Yahtzee and Trivial Pursuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Wizards of the Coast, which Hasbro bought in September, accounted for about
$237 million in sales. Wizards sells Pokemon trading cards as well as the
popular game Dungeons &AMP; Dragons.
</P>
<P>
	   Strength in those divisions helps offset troubles in other areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasbro met its sales forecast for toys based on the new "Star Wars" movie
"Episode I: The Phantom Menace," but some analysts said the performance was
disappointing. The company hopes for a boost from the movie's spring video
release.
</P>
<P>
	   "They started off the year giving this a lowball estimate of $650 million
(in sales), which is what they hit," said Joseph Kinnison, a Minneapolis-based
analyst at American Express Financial Advisors. "I think we all knew that that
was the worst-case scenario."
</P>
<P>
	   Jill Krutick, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, blamed "waning enthusiasm"
for some Star Wars products. She said that they had about $100 million to $150
million in excess inventory of the line.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasbro's interactive software unit fared poorly in the fourth quarter and
for the year, with a $53 million after-tax loss for all of 1999. The company
blamed the shortfall partly on an industry-wide slump in video and CD-ROM sales.
</P>
<P>
	   "The company said its original (interactive software) plan going into the
year was $300 million revenue. They missed by 25 percent," Kinnison said. "I
don't think this was a Hasbro-specific indication. The rampant price discounting
we've seen in the education segment may have spilled over."
</P>
<P>
	   The fourth-quarter results excluded a $141.6 million pre-tax charge to cover
costs from a reorganization that included cutting 2,200 jobs or 19 percent of
its work force, closing two plants and shifting much of its manufacturing to
Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking into account consolidation costs, Hasbro's net income for the quarter
ended Dec. 26 was $57.7 million or 29 cents a share, compared to $131.8 million,
or 65 cents per share, the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   Net earnings for the year increased 30 percent to $286.6 million, or $1.42
per share, compared to $220 million, or $1.07 per share, the year before. Sales
for the year increased 28 percent to $4.2 billion, compared to $3.3 billion the
year before.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasbro remains second to toymaker Mattel, which saw $5.5 billion in sales
last year. Mattel's chief executive officer Jill Barad stepped down last week
after the El Segundo, Calif.-based company reported a steep loss in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasbro owns the Playskool, Kenner, Tonka, Milton Bradley, Parker Brothers
and Galoob toy and game brands. This summer, Hasbro plans to launch Games.com,
an online games portal.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasbro shares fell 18 3/4 cents to $16.25 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Ambassador Condemns Attacks  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lebanon's ambassador to the U.S. accused Israel on
Tuesday of deliberately targeting civilians in southern Lebanon and urged the
Clinton administration to stop the attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Ambassador Farid Abboud said ``the resistance'' --
Hezbollah fighters -- is determined to force Israel to withdraw from its enclave
on the Lebanese side of the border.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The resistance's motivation is to attack Israel until they leave
Lebanon,'' Abboud said after calling on White House and State Department
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   With Israel carrying out its heaviest bombardment of southern Lebanon in
eight months, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said in Kiryat Shemona, a city in
northern Israel, he would do whatever was necessary to protect Israeli citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Regev, spokesman for the Israeli embassy here, said northern Israel has
been in crisis over the last two days and that hundreds of people had been
evacuated. Those who remained spent nights in bomb shelters, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one should expect Israeli civilians, alone, to pay the price for
Hezbollah terrorism,'' Regev said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Israel had made ``a deliberate and conscious attempt to avoid
hitting targets that will cause civilian casualties.''
</P>
<P>
	   By request, Abboud met at the White House with Bruce Riedel and Rob Malley,
senior advisers to President Clinton on the Middle East, and at the State
Department with Assistant Secretary Edward Walker.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I expressed my government's concern -- grave concern -- for the Israeli
attacks on civilian targets and explained that these were deliberate attacks in
contradiction of law and the April 1996 agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think the Israelis have violated very gravely this agreement
unilaterally, while the Lebanese resistance has limited its attacks to Israeli
and militia targets'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1996 agreement, worked out by then-Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, was designed to shield civilians on both sides of the border from
attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Abboud said five or six Israeli soldiers have been killed in the last 10
days, and that 18 Lebanese civilians were wounded on Monday, about 40 in the
period, overall.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that ``the attacks of the resistance were conducted under the
rules,'' which do not exclude targeting soldiers.

<P>
	   By contrast, Abboud said, Israel is attacking electrical power stations and
transformers that have nothing to do with Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Mike Hammer said the United States was deeply
concerned about the escalation of violence, regretted loss of life and injury on
all sides as well as damage to civilian infrastructure and disruption of
civilian life.
</P>
<P>
	   But he blamed Hezbollah for the deteriorating situation, saying the
Iranian-backed fighters were trying to create tensions and prevent progress
toward an agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Hammer said the way to defuse the crisis is to work with the Israel-Lebanon
monitoring group, which was established in the 1996 agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 51.81; New Nasdaq High  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index sprinted to another new record
Tuesday after the government reported workers' productivity is rising sharply,
offering a potential buffer against inflation. Blue-chip stocks also rallied but
pared their gains late in the session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rose 105.73 to 4,427.50, cruising past its previous record of
4,321.77, set Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.81 to close at 10,957.60. The Dow
rose as much as 100 points early in the session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 17.51 to 1,441.75 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies rose 5.10 to 537.49, a new record.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose after the Labor Department said productivity -- defined as the
amount of output for each hour of work -- rose at a 5 percent annual rate in the
fourth quarter, the strongest showing since the fourth quarter of 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The report surpassed analysts' expectations and reassured many investors
that inflation remains under control. Stocks have been pressured so far this
year by worries that the Federal Reserve will sharply raise interest rates to
keep inflation from accelerating.
</P>
<P>
	   While most economists see little evidence of actual inflation, four rate
increases since last June have done little to slow the growth of the U.S.
economy. Analysts said Tuesday's report indicated that while the Fed may raise
rates again at its next meeting, an increase sharp enough to derail stocks isn't
likely.
</P>
<P>
	   "This report will probably not prevent the Fed from tightening on March 21,
but it will keep them on the course of gradualism and caution," said David Orr,
chief economist at First Union Securities Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue-chip stocks, which have been under heavy pressure from investors who
fear higher interest rates will cut into corporate profits, rebounded on the
report. Financial service issues, which are highly sensitive to inflation,
advanced. J.P. Morgan rose 1 15/16 to 119 1/2 and Merrill Lynch rose 3 1/16 to
97 1/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart rose 3 3/4 to 59 3/4 after a Lehman Brothers analyst said the stock
should reach 100 within 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow also gathered strength as investors who favor value stocks over the
high-growth technology sector returned to some battered stocks, said Larry
Lawler, manager of equity trading at Dreyfus Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some value players are coming in and picking their spots, but I would need
a couple more days to be convinced that value is back in vogue," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks showed no sign of flagging. Widely held tech leaders like
IBM, up 4 13/16 to 118 13/16, and Microsoft, up 3 5/16 to 109 15/16, rose in
active trading.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Amazon.com rose 8 1/8 to 83 1/8. A potential rival, online
retailer Buy.com Inc., rose in its initial public offering of stock, although
its gains were a mere shadow of the stunning performances of most technology
IPOs last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares were priced at 13 and rose as high as 35 7/16 before falling back in
afternoon trading as some customers reported difficulty accessing the Buy.com
Web site. Buy.com closed at 25 1/8.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S.-traded shares of news organization Reuters rose 26 1/8 to 125 1/2. The
company announced plans to spend $802 million to transform itself into an
Internet company that delivers instant financial data to consumers as well as
financial institutions worldwide. Reuters also said its 1999 earnings rose 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Reuters' advance underscored the high premium investors are placing on
technological advances, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The theme is still technology," Lawler said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks gained support Tuesday from the rising U.S. dollar, which soared to a
five-month high against the Japanese yen. A strong dollar makes imports cheaper,
providing an additional hedge against inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-7 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange. NYSE volume totaled 1.30 billion shares, compared with 1.13
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.4 percent. European indexes
were sharply higher, lending strength to Wall Street. Germany's Xetra DAX index
rose 3.5 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 2.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
up 1.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton rakes in cash for Democratic fund  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton has helped raise some $2.6
million in donations for a special Democratic fund set up for the New York
Senate race, federal records showed.
<P>
	   In what is largely a testament to the first lady's star power, that total
dwarfed the amount taken in by similar accounts the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee has set up in six other states. California came the closest
to New York, raising $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton helped raise the cash at about a dozen joint fund raisers last year
with the DSCC. At those events, proceeds were divided up between Clinton's
campaign account and the DSCC. The DSCC keeps track of how much is raised at
Clinton events but is prohibited by law from specifically earmarking the money
to go the New York race.
</P>
<P>
	   But DSCC officials freely admit they expect to spend heavily in New York and
have already spent some $250,000 on a television advertisement touting the first
lady.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say the funding mechanism allows candidates to bypass campaign
donation limits.
</P>
<P>
	   DSCC Political Director Jim Jordan said Clinton recognized the importance of
a "financially robust committee."
</P>
<P>
	   "The first lady has been extremely generous with her time in helping the
DSCC raise money," Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the $2.6 million Clinton helped raise for "New York Senate 2000," federal
records show just over $1 million was transferred to her campaign account - her
share of the joint fund raisers.
</P>
<P>
	   The rest is held by the DSCC. Of that, $1 million is in hard money donations
that can be used to run ads supporting Clinton. The other $550,000 is largely
unregulated soft money, which can pay for issue-oriented ads and activities that
do not specifically advocate voting for a candidate. Corporations that cannot
donate directly to candidates may also give soft money.
</P>
<P>
	   The filings make clear that many of the same well-heeled donors who chipped
in the maximum $2,000 to Clinton's campaign also contributed thousands more
dollars to the DSCC's New York account, where contribution limits are far
higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The top tier of donors who gave cash to Clinton and the DSCC was made up
largely of entertainment heavyweights and business leaders, many from outside
New York state.
</P>
<P>
	   William and Sally Hambrecht, of San Francisco, together donated $37,000 to
Clinton and the DSCC. William Hambrecht is the founder of the venerable
investment firm Hambrecht and Quist.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles television producer Norman Lear and his wife Lyn contributed a
combined $20,000 to the first lady and the DSCC.
</P>
<P>
	   Irwin Chafetz, a Boston-area investor with the Interface Group, donated
$22,200 to Clinton and the DSCC.
</P>
<P>
	   Aris Industries, a Secaucus, N.J.-based company which recently purchased the
hot junior sportswear label XOXO, donated $10,000 to the DSCC. Its New York
City-based CEO Arnold Simon donated $2,000 to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Margaret Schink, the Palo Alto, Calif., resident who administers the Shaler
Adams Foundation gave a total of $17,000 to Clinton and the DSCC.
</P>
<P>
	   The DSCC also received $10,000 from Continental Wingate. The Needham, Mass.,
company's owner Gerald Schuster and his wife Elaine, who hosted a Boston fund
raiser for the first lady, also each donated $1,000 to her campaign. Continental
Wingate has been under scrutiny from the Department of Housing and Urban
Development for its management of the Beekman Houses in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   All total Clinton has raised $8 million, while Republican candidate and New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has raised $11.5 million. The National
Republican Senatorial Committee has similar joint fund raising agreements with
some candidates, but not with Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has not formally announced his candidacy but has made his
intentions of running clear.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Medic Given Medal of Honor  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- His Army uniform aglow with ribbons and his eyes trained
on the floor, Alfred Rascon seemed embarrassed to be at the White House on
Tuesday receiving lavish praise -- much less America's highest military honor.
</P>
<P>
	   Only after President Clinton draped the Medal of Honor around his neck did a
smile play across Rascon's face. He had glanced at the men he covered with his
body in a Vietnamese jungle 34 years ago to absorb grenade blasts and shrapnel
that would have killed them and almost killed him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The honor is not really mine,'' Rascon said. ``It ends up being those who
were with me that day.'' He asked the guys from his platoon to stand up, and
they did, tears welling in their eyes. The former Army medic accepted his medal
and saluted the commander in chief who presented it.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a glorious moment long denied to Rascon, 54, the son of Mexican
immigrants, who joined the Army out of love for his adopted homeland. He was not
yet a U.S. citizen when he went to Vietnam. But when, recovered from his wounds,
he returned to Vietnam later in the war, it was as an American.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This man gave everything he had, utterly and selflessly, to protect his
platoon mates and the nation he was still not yet a citizen of,'' Clinton said.
``You have honored us by your choice to become an American. ... Thank you for
reminding us that being an American has nothing to do with the place of your
birth, the color of your skin, the language of your parents or the way you
worship God.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rascon is not the first immigrant to receive the Medal of Honor. Immigrants
received one in five of the 3,427 medals authorized since the honor was created
in 1861. There are 166 living Medal of Honor recipients.
</P>
<P>
	   Within days of his battlefield bravery, Rascon was recommended for the Medal
of Honor by the men he saved. The paperwork was lost, as Clinton said, ``in a
thicket of red tape,'' and Rascon received the Silver Star instead.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But it wasn't what we had written up,'' one of the men, Ray Compton, told
reporters Tuesday. ``Neither one of us would be here today if it hadn't been for
Al. Maybe not in his own eyes, but in our eyes, he's a hero. No doubt about
it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Compton said he wasn't aware that Rascon never received the honor until, in
1993, he asked Rascon what it was like to have the Medal of Honor. Rascon
replied that he didn't know.
</P>
<P>
	   Compton, fellow platoon members Neil Haffey and Larry Gibson and other
veterans sought to correct the oversight.
</P>
<P>
	   They received a pivotal assist from Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., an advocate for
Vietnam veterans. The Pentagon would not reconsider Rascon's case because so
much time had elapsed, so Evans gave a packet of information about it to
President Clinton in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon relented last May, and Defense Secretary William Cohen approved
the honor in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton praised Rascon for his ``long, patient wait for recognition'' and
the continual commitment to serving his country that he has displayed since
March 16, 1966.
</P>
<P>
	   That day, Rascon's platoon came under attack in a Vietnamese jungle. The
young medic ignored orders to stay down and ran past flying bullets to get to
Haffey, who was wounded. Rascon was shot in the hip and suffered several
shrapnel wounds. A grenade exploded in his face.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Rascon dragged Haffey to safety. Despite his wounds, he went out
again to deliver ammunition to a machine gunner. He then covered Compton and
Gibson with his body to protect them from harm as he treated their wounds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Through this extraordinary succession of courageous acts, he never gave a
single thought to himself,'' Clinton said. ``Except, he admits, for the instant
when the grenade exploded near his face, and he thought, `Oh God, my good looks
are gone.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Rascon was so badly wounded that last rites were administered. He
nevertheless recuperated at an Army hospital in Japan and was discharged in May
1966.
</P>
<P>
	   Rascon went on to be graduated from college and the Army's Infantry Officer
Candidate School. A native of Chihuahua, Mexico, Rascon was naturalized an
American in 1967 and returned to Vietnam for a second tour in the 1970s, this
time as a military adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   Rascon, a civil servant since 1983, is inspector general of the Selective
Service System in Arlington, Va. He lives in Laurel, Md., with his wife and two
children.

<HEADLINE> Hasbro Earnings Up 18 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL ZOLL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Hasbro Inc.'s fourth-quarter earnings rose 18
percent from a year ago, beating expectations thanks to strong sales of Pokemon
toys, Furby dolls and hand-held electronic games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pawtucket, R.I.-based company said Tuesday that it earned $155.4
million, or 79 cents per share, compared with $131.8 million, or 65 cents per
share, in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the nation's
second-largest toymaker to earn 75 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter increased 22 percent to $1.6 billion, compared with
$1.3 billion one year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Fueling the gains were strong sales of Furby, the interactive furry doll
that was introduced in 1998 but still sold a stunning 12 million units last
year. Also lifting sales and profits were its hand-held electronic games, most
of which are made by its Tiger Electronics division, and its toys based on the
popular Japanese cartoon Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also credited strong sales of core brands such as Monopoly,
Yahtzee and Trivial Pursuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Wizards of the Coast, which Hasbro bought in September, accounted for about
$237 million in sales. Wizards sells Pokemon trading cards as well as the
popular game Dungeons &AMP; Dragons.
</P>
<P>
	   Strength in those divisions helps offset troubles in other areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasbro met its sales forecast for toys based on the new "Star Wars" movie
"Episode I: The Phantom Menace," but some analysts said the performance was
disappointing. The company hopes for a boost from the movie's spring video
release.
</P>
<P>
	   "They started off the year giving this a lowball estimate of $650 million
(in sales), which is what they hit," said Joseph Kinnison, a Minneapolis-based
analyst at American Express Financial Advisors. "I think we all knew that that
was the worst-case scenario."
</P>
<P>
	   Jill Krutick, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, blamed "waning enthusiasm"
for some Star Wars products. She said that they had about $100 million to $150
million in excess inventory of the line.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasbro's interactive software unit fared poorly in the fourth quarter and
for the year, with a $53 million after-tax loss for all of 1999. The company
blamed the shortfall partly on an industry-wide slump in video and CD-ROM sales.
</P>
<P>
	   "The company said its original (interactive software) plan going into the
year was $300 million revenue. They missed by 25 percent," Kinnison said. "I
don't think this was a Hasbro-specific indication. The rampant price discounting
we've seen in the education segment may have spilled over."
</P>
<P>
	   The fourth-quarter results excluded a $141.6 million pre-tax charge to cover
costs from a reorganization that included cutting 2,200 jobs or 19 percent of
its work force, closing two plants and shifting much of its manufacturing to
Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking into account consolidation costs, Hasbro's net income for the quarter
ended Dec. 26 was $57.7 million or 29 cents a share, compared to $131.8 million,
or 65 cents per share, the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   Net earnings for the year increased 30 percent to $286.6 million, or $1.42
per share, compared to $220 million, or $1.07 per share, the year before. Sales
for the year increased 28 percent to $4.2 billion, compared to $3.3 billion the
year before.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasbro remains second to toymaker Mattel, which saw $5.5 billion in sales
last year. Mattel's chief executive officer Jill Barad stepped down last week
after the El Segundo, Calif.-based company reported a steep loss in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasbro owns the Playskool, Kenner, Tonka, Milton Bradley, Parker Brothers
and Galoob toy and game brands. This summer, Hasbro plans to launch Games.com,
an online games portal.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasbro shares rose 18 3/4 cents to $16.25 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Inflation-Impeding Productivity Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A key to economic vitality that also bodes well for
continuing low inflation posted the best performance since 1992, a 2.9 percent
uptick in American workers' productivity for 1999. Wall Street rallied.
</P>
<P>
	   A burst in fourth-quarter productivity -- defined as the amount of output
for each hour of work -- contributed to the strong performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Productivity rose by a larger-than-expected 5 percent annual rate in the
final three months of last year, the biggest growth spurt since the fourth
quarter of 1992, the Labor Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street was buoyed by the report, which suggested the economy can
continue to grow briskly without triggering inflation as long as healthy
productivity gains are recorded.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq blazed a new high, closing up 105.73 to 4,427.50 to beat its
record, set Monday, of 4,321.77. The Dow Jones stock average, which rose as much
as 100 points early in the session, finished 51.81 points higher to close at
10,957.60. Bonds prices rose as the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury
bonds fell to 6.24 percent from 6.34 percent late Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The productivity miracle has provided another astounding picture of the
U.S. economy," said First Union economist David Orr.
</P>
<P>
	   The improvement in last year's productivity marked the strongest gain since
a 4.1 percent increase in 1992. In 1998, productivity rose 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's called using every worker just about as efficiently as possible,"
said Joel Naroff, economist with Naroff Economic Advisors.
</P>
<P>
	   Healthy productivity gains are the keys to prosperity and rising living
standards, economists said. Sizable gains means companies can pay employees
more, hold the line on prices and still deliver increased profits to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   Generally, productivity goes up when the unemployment rate -- now at a
30-year low of 4 percent -- goes down, particularly when the economy is growing
rapidly, economists said. Companies look to increase worker output to help keep
up with robust demand.
</P>
<P>
	   There's a possibility that productivity gains can be threatened when labor
markets are as tight as they are now, however, because employers can have
trouble finding scarce workers to fill openings.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists said that didn't happen last year as employers managed to squeeze
more productivity out of workers, which the economists credited to faster
computers and other technological advances.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're continuing to enjoy the thrust of computers and other information
technologies. That is really the primary driver of productivity gains," said
Wells Fargo economist Sung Won Sohn.
</P>
<P>
	   But if productivity falters, pressures for higher wages can result in a
sharp run-up in prices. That possibility worries Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan and other economists.
</P>
<P>
	   But in 1999, growth slowed in unit labor costs, a major barometer of
underlying inflation pressures. Those costs rose just 1.8 percent last year,
compared with a 2.4 percent increase in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   And during the fourth quarter, unit labor costs fell at a 1 percent rate,
the biggest drop since the first quarter of 1996. In the third quarter, unit
labor costs declined by a 0.3 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve bumped up interest rates by a quarter of a percentage
point last week, the fourth increase since June, to slow the sizzling economy
and keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the good news on productivity, many economists continue to believe
Fed policy-makers probably will raise rates again at their next meeting on March
21. But analysts said Tuesday's the report reduces the odds of aggressive rate
action by the Fed.
</P>
<P>
	   "While the latest productivity report should relieve inflation anxieties, it
will not keep the Fed from tightening," said Merrill Lynch economist Stan
Shipley.
</P>
<P>
	   The gains in productivity also suggests that "the economic expansion will
continue through 2000," said Richard Yamarone, economist with Argus Research
Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   The economy entered a historic 107 months of uninterrupted growth last week,
surpassing the record 106 months set in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with robust economic growth, inflation has been tame. The "core" rate
of inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, rose just 1.9
percent last year, the best performance since 1969.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Tuesday
on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   The company had an operating loss of $3.2 million in the quarter ended Dec.
31, compared to an operating profit of $146.3 million a year earlier. British
Airways said it was hurt by the proliferation of low-cost fares in the market.
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street's
expectations of $1.10 a share, but the strong results were largely due to a
falling income tax rate. Analysts expressed concern over rising costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The French company, the world's fourth-largest producer of consumer
electronics, reported a 19 percent jump in revenues for 1999. Thomson cited
strong sales of products like digital video discs and digital decoders.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will replace Safeskin Corp. in the S&AMP;P SmallCap 600 Index after
the close of trading on Tuesday. Companies added to stock indexes often get a
boost as fund managers who try to mirror an index's performance buy shares of
the newly added company.
</P>
<P>
	   The company widened its losses in the fourth quarter, to $1.38 per share
from 61 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 1998. Global TeleSystems
operates a fiber optic network across Europe.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Medical examiner says Diallo hit while on the ground  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - When the shooting started, one bullet caused Amadou
Diallo to "crumple." At the end, another entered the bottom of Diallo's right
shoe and exited the top of a toe.
<P>
	   "You couldn't be upright to sustain (the toe wound), unless someone was
underneath the floor shooting upward," a medical examiner, Dr. Joseph Cohen,
testified Tuesday at the murder trial of four police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The witness told jurors that of the 19 bullets that struck Diallo, two
tunneled up his legs. Another 15, he added, entered his left side while he was
falling or already down - further proof, prosecutors say, that the four officers
intended to kill the unarmed West African immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen, a former New York City medical examiner now working in Riverside
County, Calif., was the last of 12 witnesses for the prosecution. The defense
was to begin its case Wednesday morning; the officers have said they will
testify.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys made routine motions asking Supreme Court Justice Joseph
Teresi to dismiss the case. The judge made no immediate ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28, Sean Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy,
27 - all white - have pleaded innocent to charges they murdered the unarmed
black man by firing 41 bullets into the vestibule of his Bronx apartment
building at 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999, at close range and without warning. If
convicted, they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense claims the officers thought Diallo was a threat because he
ignored orders to halt, then pulled out a black wallet that appeared to be a
gun. It also argues that the bullets from the officers' high-powered
semiautomatic weapons were fired fast enough for Diallo to stay on his feet,
possibly up against a wall, throughout the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Testifying in sometimes gruesome detail for more than five hours, Cohen used
morgue photos and anatomical diagrams to show the jurors how the full metal
jacket bullets took deadly, crisscrossing paths from Diallo's chest to toes. He
also showed jurors the black sneaker worn by Diallo when the bullet pierced his
foot.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's mother, Kadiatou, who has attended the trial each day since it
began last week, was not in the courtroom. At one point, Teresi barred a crime
scene photo of the body from being shown on television; the trial is being
broadcast live.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very difficult," the victim's father, Saikou Diallo, said outside of
court. "Very difficult."
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 19 bullets that hit Diallo, only three remained in his body, Cohen
said. A ballistics report shows at least two of the three were fired by Carroll.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen focused on a bullet that hit Diallo square in the chest before tearing
through his aorta - the main vessel carrying blood to the heart - damaging his
spine and exiting his back.
</P>
<P>
	   The fact that there was little or no bleeding from other wounds indicated
the aortic wound came "early on," quickly draining nearly half the blood in his
body, Cohen said. He estimated that the same bullet caused the victim to
"crumple" to the ground, probably within two seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said that another wound - in which the bullet hit the lower part of
his right leg and lodged behind the knee - "was inflicted when he was
necessarily down." About a third wound to Diallo's left leg, Cohen noted the
"strikingly upward trajectory of the bullet."
</P>
<P>
	   The pathologist also said that he found whole bullets and bullet fragments
in Diallo's body and clothes and that toxicological tests found no traces of
drugs or alcohol in the body.
</P>
<P>
	   On cross-examination, defense attorney Stephen Worth charged that Cohen was
"grasping at straws" with some of his conclusions. Cohen admitted he could not
be certain which bullet hit Diallo first. He also conceded he made up to 20
revisions in his autopsy report.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying of Diallo by the four officers produced a wave of pretrial
publicity and protests alleging widespread abuse of minorities by police. In
response, an appeals court moved the trial to Albany.

<HEADLINE> Some People Leave Afghan Plane  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- With the welfare of more than 150 exhausted
passengers foremost in their minds, British negotiators said Tuesday they were
prepared to be patient with the hijackers holding an Afghan airliner for a third
day.
</P>
<P>
	   Some people have left the plane late Tuesday night, but police could not
give an exact number or say whether they were hostages or hijackers. SKY TV News
reported that three figures had been seen emerging from the window of the
cockpit and dropping to the ground and fleeing.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, negotiators said talks could go on for days. ``The negotiations
are going forward in a professional way, in a fairly calm way,'' said John
Broughton, an Essex Police assistant chief constable. ``The principal concern
here is the safety of the passengers on board that aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
	   The aims of the hijackers, believed to be Afghans, remained unclear.
Speculation ranged from an elaborate play for political asylum to a bid to win
the release of Ismail Khan, a former regional governor in Afghanistan detained
since 1997 by the country's ruling Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about a potential asylum bid, Broughton said: ``In talking around the
issues, there are a lot of things raised.'' He would not elaborate, saying only
that the hijackers, who controlled the plane at Stansted Airport 25 miles north
of London, had made no ``formal demands.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the negotiations involved what Broughton called housekeeping issues,
such as the delivery of water and food to the Ariana airlines plane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've done everything we can to keep the conditions on the aircraft
habitable,'' said Joe Edwards, another Essex Police assistant chief constable.
``We're talking all the time about what's the condition of people and how are
the children.''
</P>
<P>
	   A London representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees arrived
at Stansted as an observer, police said Tuesday evening. She would not be a
negotiator, but would bring to the crisis the strength of the U.N.'s expertise
on the situation in Afghanistan, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing 727 had been headed to the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif
from the Afghan capital, Kabul, when it was seized early Sunday. It then began a
meandering journey across the former Soviet Union, stopping in Uzbekistan,
Kazakstan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   According to some of the 22 passengers released before the plane landed at
Stansted early Monday, the hijackers are eight young men armed with pistols,
grenades and daggers. Edwards said former hostages that authorities have talked
to have said there were between six and 10 hijackers.
</P>
<P>
	   They were believed to still be holding 156 hostages, including 21 children.
All the passengers were believed to be Afghans.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight passengers were released at Stansted on Monday, including two infants
who were treated for dehydration. The man released Tuesday, an asthmatic, had
complained of feeling ill, Broughton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The freed hostages have said they were treated well, authorities said. One
told reporters the hijacking started somewhat quietly 20 minutes into the
flight, with the armed men calmly telling passengers to put their hands on their
heads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people we are talking to are remarkably calm and that's really
important,'' Edwards said. ``The atmosphere is one of control, people behaving
rationally. That's going to help an awful lot.''
</P>
<P>
	   All six Iraqi men at the center of Britain's last hijacking drama -- a 1996
case involving a Sudanese airliner -- remain in the country as asylum-seekers,
the British government confirmed Tuesday. Those men held 197 people hostage for
seven hours at Stansted.
</P>
<P>
	   They were convicted in 1997 and sentenced to between five and nine years in
prison. But they were cleared on appeal a year later after a court ruled the
trial judge was wrong to bar jurors from considering their defense -- that they
were acting under ``necessity'' as opponents of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's
regime.
</P>
<P>
	   The men had claimed they stormed the plane in a desperate bid to enter
Britain and seek asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan is one of the top sources of asylum seekers in Britain. An
average of 360 applications a month has been lodged by Afghans since October.
Refugee status is granted in about a third of cases.

<HEADLINE> Deutch Gives Up Pentagon Clearances  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Deutch, the former CIA director who lost his access
to agency secrets last summer for violating security rules, volunteered Tuesday
to give up his Defense Department industrial security clearances.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the clearances would be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the CIA announced late Tuesday that it had asked a
presidentially-appointed commission which oversees intelligence issues to look
into Deutch's CIA behavior, including reviewing an internal inspector general's
report that criticizes the current agency director, George Tenet, for acting too
slowly in moving to revoke Deutch's credentials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an unprecedented case involving a former director of Central
Intelligence and a number of former and current senior agency officials,'' Air
Force Gen. John A. Gordon, deputy director of the CIA, said in a letter to
former Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., the commission chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter thanked Rudman for agreeing to look into the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Defense Secretary William Cohen said the Pentagon was considering
pulling Deutch's clearances but believed it needed to weigh legal considerations
before taking any action against him.
</P>
<P>
	   The actions are highly unusual and result from the CIA's discovery last
summer that Deutch had downloaded classified documents into his unsecured home
computer, in violation of security rules, while he was head of the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, a former deputy secretary of defense, has not been accused of
compromising Pentagon or CIA secrets.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch said in a letter to Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre that he has
no need for access to Pentagon classified information and therefore prefers that
his three remaining Pentagon clearances be discontinued. His industrial security
clearances gave him access to classified information about defense technologies;
such clearances commonly are granted to people working on Defense Department
contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch's letter was transmitted to Hamre by his attorney at the Washington
law office of Williams &AMP; Connolly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has been Mr. Deutch's practice since his CIA clearance was suspended by
Director Tenet last August to avoid access to any classified information,
including classified documents, meetings and conversations,'' the letter states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Therefore, there is no need to continue these industrial security
clearances at this time and he asks that they be discontinued.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the time CIA Director George Tenet suspended Deutch's security clearance
at the agency, the Pentagon cut off Deutch's access to Defense Intelligence
Agency information. But the Pentagon allowed Deutch to keep his industrial
security clearances.
</P>
<P>
	   In volunteering to give up the security clearances, ``I think he was just
reacting to reality,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee wants Deutch to testify about the matter, and Shelby said
committee lawyers were in contact with Deutch and his lawyers to try to work out
such an appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   A Deutch associate, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he expected
Deutch to comply with the committee's wish. The associate said Deutch was
traveling Tuesday and not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   If Deutch does not come voluntarily, the committee will consider issuing a
subpoena to compel his appearance, Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
	   He and other committee members said questions about Tenet's handling of the
case and slowness to act were raised during a closed door meeting Tuesday with
CIA Inspector General L. Britt Snider.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel plans more hearings to answer ``one of the real central questions
-- was there a cover-up?'' Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
	   Snider, in brief comments with reporters, said his report ``showed no
intentional impeding'' of the investigation with Tenet.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., a committee member, said the inspector general's
testimony partly rebutted Tenet's contention that Deutch was mostly creating
reports and memos on his computer and not downloading secret files. ``It was
more serious than that,'' Allard said. ``There was a transfer of material.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before becoming CIA director, Deutch served as deputy secretary of defense
from 1994 to 1995. He now is a professor at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and acts as a consultant for several organizations with defense
contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   The industrial clearance has allowed Deutch to serve as a paid consultant on
defense contracts with the MIT, SAIC Corp. and Raytheon Corp., Pentagon
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rebuked Over Trade Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of Congress sharply criticized the Clinton
administration's handling of global trade negotiations that collapsed last year
amid violent protests in Seattle. One Democratic senator contended that U.S.
trade policy is currently in ``crisis.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers faced tough questioning Tuesday from lawmakers on two separate
Congressional committees demanding to know what approach the administration was
taking to rescue efforts to launch a new round of trade negotiations. The talks
were designed to open markets for American farmers and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   An effort by the World Trade Organization to start such talks failed in
early December when 135 nations attending the Seattle conference could not agree
on a negotiating agenda. The conference was marked by street protests against
globalization which turned violent, forcing authorities to declare a state of
emergency and call out the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the stumbling blocks to launching a new negotiating round was the
administration's insistence that new discussions include a working group to
study the link between trade and labor issues. The Clinton administration has
also been pushing for future trade agreements to take environmental standards
into account.
</P>
<P>
	   Both of those issues are deeply opposed by the more than 100 developing
countries who make up the bulk of the WTO's membership. They argue that linking
trade agreements with labor and environmental standards represents a threat to
the competitive advantages they enjoy over industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Finance Committee William Roth told Summers that while such issues
could be addressed ``we feel there are other forums for doing so'' other than
the WTO. He said the administration's intransigence on this point was causing a
harmful delay in starting new trade discussions to open markets for U.S.
products.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., told Summers the administration was
trying to have it both ways, arguing that it supported a more open trading
system while pursuing efforts to impose trade barriers against countries with
deficient labor and environmental rules.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't say we want a more open trade system and we want arrangements
that will prevent trade,'' Moynihan said. ``American trade policy is in a
crisis. It is the only crisis on the horizon that could spoil the economic good
times.''
</P>
<P>
	   Summers told the Senate committee that the administration was simply trying
to get approval for a study group to look at the link between trade and labor
issues. However, that issue was muddled during the negotiations when President
Clinton said in a newspaper interview that the ultimate U.S. goal was to impose
sanctions against countries with poor labor standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Summers and Barshefsky, who appeared separately before a House Ways and
Means trade subcommittee, insisted that the administration was continuing to
work with other countries to find ways to find compromises that allow for a new
round of trade discussions. Barshefsky noted the WTO had agreed to start
preliminary discussions in the area of agriculture and services while trying to
work out ways to launch a broader trade round.
</P>
<P>
	   The House panel received a General Accounting Office report that said no one
factor could be blamed for the failure of the Seattle talks but it did suggest
too little advance work had been done to narrow differences before the trade
ministers reached Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   Barshefsky insisted that the world trading system would survive the Seattle
breakdown, noting that there have been many such negotiating failures in the
past with the WTO's predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. William Thomas, R-Calif., challenged that assertion, saying the
collapse of the Seattle meetings was ``far more disastrous'' because of the
extensive television coverage of the street protests.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration received support for its insistence on linking future
trade deals with labor and environmental protections from environmental groups
and labor organizations who testified before the House panel.
</P>
<P>
	   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said the current rules of the global economy
``have freed up corporations to move production around the globe in search of
the most vulnerable and disenfranchised workers and the most lax regulation.''

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton calls for letting cheaper Canadian drugs into  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Newly official Senate candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton waded back into the health care wars Tuesday, calling for legislation
allowing cheaper prescription drugs to be imported into the United States from
Canada.
<P>
	   Clinton, who led the failed effort of her husband's administration in 1993
and 1994 to overhaul the nation's health care financing system, told more than
400 medical professionals at a Rochester medical center, that "I didn't give up
then and I won't give up now."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has vowed to make health care costs a major campaign issue in the
race that is expected to pit her against New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   In Rochester, she picked up the endorsement of the American Nurses
Association for the Senate campaign she made official on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady reiterated her earlier support for a patients' bill of
rights, expanding Medicare by adding a prescription drug benefit and protecting
the privacy of medical records and outlawing genetic discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   But the cornerstone of her proposal Tuesday was her call for letting cheaper
Canadian drugs, that have Federal Drug Administration approval, be imported into
this country.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for the pharmaceutical industry said, however, that Clinton's
plan was "absolutely the wrong way to go," could leave patients vulnerable to
unsafe or ineffective drugs and was likely the product of election-year
politics.
</P>
<P>
	   For her part, Clinton said that "if we want to make health care affordable,
we must lower the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans."
</P>
<P>
	   "Prescription drugs are a necessity and yet they are priced as a luxury,"
she added. "Their costs are rising at 12 percent a year, faster than any other
part of our health care system."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said one of the reasons for the price increases was that "the
industry will spend $1.8 billion this year on advertising. We are the only
industrialized nation in the world that permits prescription drugs to be
advertised directly to consumers on TV and in print."
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, she noted that Canadians benefit from a price-control
system that means a three-month supply of tamoxifen, used to battle breast
cancer, can be purchased for $50 in that country. It sells for $390 in the
United States, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every day, thousands of our citizens cross the border to buy drugs at a
fraction of the cost," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   "These drugs are made with the same ingredients and they offer the same
benefits," Clinton said. "They are made in the exact same factories, factories
most often owned by U.S. pharmaceutical companies."
</P>
<P>
	   Taking care to note her new New York roots, Clinton said, "I was always told
that New Yorkers never bought retail. Well, that's wrong when it comes to drugs,
and it must stop."
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said the plan could
save Americans up to 15 percent in drug costs.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jackie Cottrell, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, a trade group representing about 100 companies, said
"what she is proposing would overturn landmark consumer protection legislation"
- the Prescription Drug Marketing Act approved in 1988 that banned the
reimportation of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "From the pharmaceutical industry's point of view, the answer isn't a scheme
like reimportation that could hurt patient safety or importing price controls,
it's to provide prescription drug coverage to those who use medicines the most,
and that's our senior population, through a reformed and strengthened Medicare
program," Cottrell said.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, in his new budget proposal, President Clinton has proposed
expanding Medicare to offer prescription drug coverage, a plan his wife said she
supports.
</P>
<P>
	   Cottrell said that while the industry does spend a hefty amount on
advertising, it is dwarfed by the $26.4 billion the industry spends annually on
research and development of drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "We shouldn't rush in an election year to damage consumer protection
legislation," she added.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Giuliani camp declined to comment on the Clinton proposal, it
noted that her idea wasn't new and that legislation has been introduced in
Congress by Rep. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and others to allow the importation
of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Cottrell said a difference between that legislation and the Clinton plan is
that her's would apply only to drugs coming in from Canada. She said the
pharmaceutical industry objected to even that change.
</P>
<P>
	   Cottrell said that while the idea of lower cost drugs from Canada "sounds
pretty appealing, the flip side of that is Canada has no major pharmaceutical
industry."
</P>
<P>
	   Just last month, President Clinton also took the drug companies to task for
the high cost of their products in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   "Someone should ask them how they can possibly justify the fact that
American senior citizens are now being carried across the border to Canada to
buy drugs produced in America," he said.

<HEADLINE> Rep Shuster Questions Gas Tax Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Bud Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation
Committee, said Tuesday he will ``vigorously oppose'' provisions in President
Clinton's 2001 budget proposal on how to spend federal gas tax money.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton budget sets aside some $1.3 billion out of an estimated $3
billion in gas tax surplus this year for use in mass transit, safety and natural
disaster programs. Shuster, R-Pa., says that under a massive transportation bill
passed in 1998, all that money should go to the states.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, Shuster said, ``clearly states that all gas tax revenues will be
preserved for transportation improvements, and that should tax revenues be
higher than anticipated, each state would receive a proportional share of the
surplus.''
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues from the federal gas tax were originally estimated at $28 billion
for this year, but are turning out to be $31 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, responding to Shuster, said all but
$100 million of the $1.3 billion will go directly to the states or Indian lands.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The states will be the prime beneficiaries of the president's proposal to
invest in those programs that are critical to improving transportation safety,
mobility and access to opportunity across the nation,'' Slater said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the programs named in the budget are $468 million going to the states
or Amtrak to expand passenger rail service, $398 million to the states as
reimbursement for natural disaster work, $140 million for safety and mobility on
important trade corridors and at the nation's borders and $75 million to improve
Indian reservation roads.
</P>
<P>
	   An additional $48 million would go to states along the Mississippi Delta and
$50 million to the states for new transportation programs to access jobs. The
IRS would also receive $20 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration in last year's budget also tried unsuccessfully to use
some of the gas tax surplus for environmental and mass transit programs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Uganda and Bolivia became the first beneficiaries Tuesday
of enhanced debt relief under a new $27 billion poor country initiative agreed
last summer by the United States and other major industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
	   The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which began the program
in 1996 and jointly administer it, said Uganda and Bolivia pledged to put money
saved on debt payments into human development projects such as schools and
health care facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new program, Uganda is to receive debt relief of more than $1.3
billion, in addition to $650 million the East African nation received in April
1998 under a precursor program.
</P>
<P>
	   Bolivia's new debt relief is expected to total close to $1.3 billion in
addition to $760 million the Latin American nation received in 1999 under the
earlier program.
</P>
<P>
	   Mozambique and Mauritania are expected to be next among countries to have
new debt relief approved.
</P>
<P>
	   Widespread criticism of the original debt relief program among development
and religious groups led the Group of Seven industrialized nations at their
summit last June to expand the program to provide deeper and faster relief to
more countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Up to 33 countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, are potentially eligible
for debt relief.

<HEADLINE> Citigroup Gives Same-Sex Benefits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Citigroup Inc., the financial services company that owns
the nation's largest bank, notified employees Tuesday that it would begin
offering benefits to the partners of gay workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Benefits also will be extended to the live-in partners of heterosexual
workers, under the policy that takes effect in May.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our competitive goal of becoming the employer of choice in the financial
services industry requires that we continually evaluate the range of benefits,"
said a memo to employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Citigroup has nearly 200,000 employees. In addition to its Citibank unit, it
also owns the Salomon Smith Barney investment house and Travelers Group
insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokeswoman Leah Johnson said Citigroup had no estimate of the extra cost of
extending the benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   About 3,000 employers, including 87 Fortune 500 companies, now offer
benefits to same-sex couples, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a gay
rights group in Washington. Tight labor markets have prompted companies to offer
the benefits to retain skilled employees, it said.

<HEADLINE> Dallas Group Sues CompUSA Retailer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DALLAS (AP) -- A Dallas-based partnership has sued the CompUSA retailer and
its prospective Mexican owner, accusing them of unfairly shutting it out of
plans to build CompUSA stores in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   COC Services Ltd. is seeking up to $600 million in damages from Dallas-based
CompUSA and two related Mexican companies, Grupo Carso and Grupo Sanborns. Also
named is Carlos Slim Helu, a billionaire who controls Grupo Carso, and CompUSA
chief executive CompUSA.
</P>
<P>
	   Grupo Sanborns, the retail unit of Grupo Carso, announced its purchase of
CompUSA last month in a deal then valued at about $1 billion in stock. CompUSA
has been struggling with losses and shrinking sales in the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
	   COC Services claimed in a lawsuit amended last week that it held exclusive
rights to build CompUSA stores in Mexico but that CompUSA and Slim broke the
contract with their purchase agreement and now plans to open CompUSA stores in
Mexico. The suit was filed in Dallas County court at law.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for CompUSA said the company doesn't comment on pending
litigation. A Grupo Sanborns spokesman in Mexico City could not immediately be
reached.

<HEADLINE> Nike Shares Fall 19 Precent  </HEADLINE>
    By WILLIAM McCALL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Shares of Nike fell nearly 19 percent Tuesday after
the athletic shoe maker said it will not meet earnings expectations for fiscal
2000.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Nike said it still expects its earnings per share to grow 20
percent despite a shakeout in the U.S. retail industry. Nevertheless, Nike
president Tom Clarke said that annual earnings per share could fall below the
current estimates of $2.08 by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding a restructuring charge, Beaverton-based Nike earned $1.66 per
share in fiscal 1999, which ended May 31. A 20 percent increase would mean
earnings of about $1.99 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   On the news, investors sent the stock down $8.37 1/2 to $36.87 1/2 -- a
52-week low -- at 4:30 p.m. EST on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarke said many of Nike's retail partners in the U.S. have experienced a
slump in footwear sales, causing them to close many of their stores.
</P>
<P>
	   A number of analysts had already expressed concern about domestic sales for
Nike with some of its principal outlets, including Venator, cutting back orders
and other companies such as Just for Feet closing stores.
</P>
<P>
	   When Nike announced its second-quarter earnings in December, it said that
orders in the United States were down 8 percent, noted John Shanley of First
Security Van Kasper.
</P>
<P>
	   "What you seeing in the weakness of Nike futures orders in the U.S. is a
clear reflection of retail shrinkage," Shanley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nike chairman Phil Knight had warned in December that the consolidation of
the U.S. retail market "may have an adverse effect on our revenues in the short
run," but that in the long term it would strengthen business for Nike and
retailers.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarke remained optimistic Tuesday about overall growth for Nike, with
strong sales expected in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennifer Black of Black &AMP; Co. in Portland said the consolidation of smaller
sports shoe retailers would be painful in the short term for Nike -- but she
agreed with Knight that will improve the health of the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this is a pretty conservative outlook," she said. "It has really
dampened their enthusiasm. But in the long term, they are the dominant player."

<HEADLINE> State says it's cleared up problems with electronic, telephone tax  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - State officials say computer gremlins that gummed
up the works for some taxpayers trying to file via home computer or telephone
are gone.
<P>
	   State Treasury spokeswoman Mary Lou Murphy on Tuesday said the state is
geared up to receive an estimated 3.75 million tax returns through April 15.
</P>
<P>
	   Taxpayers late last week were frustrated when computer glitches stopped some
from filing their returns by personal computer - after they had filled out all
the information on their computers. Then some taxpayers who were trying to file
their returns by touch-tone telephone were cut off.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, 3,500 people filed their returns with home computers, and 176,000
by telephone. Another 285,000 filed electronically through tax preparers last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy said "computer hardware problems" were the culprit. She said the
troubles affected some taxpayers, but not as much as if they had hit during a
peak demand time.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've cleared up the problems," Murphy said. "It hit during a light
period. Once we get into February, there will be more returns coming in."
</P>
<P>
	   State officials certainly don't want problems with this alternative method
of filing returns. They say such returns are less costly for state government to
process, and more convenient for residents to file. Electronic filing is also
becoming more popular because it speeds up the turnaround time for a refund by
about two weeks. Nationally, the number of people filing their federal taxes on
computers rose more than 150 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to tax returns, residents will also have to apply for their
property tax rebates, a system that tied up phone lines for a while last year.
Murphy said the state has not finished working on this year's version of the
application process, but said it will be easier for one big reason: Most of the
information on property taxpayers was already gathered last year. Thus,
taxpayers who haven't moved will simply have to confirm information, rather than
enter it all over again.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the NJ Saver program doled out $136.7 million to 1.19 million
property taxpayers. The average check was $120. This year's average check will
be $240, and Murphy said officials expect more people to apply. Gov. Christie
Whitman's proposed state budget calls for $336.7 million to be doled out in
property tax rebates under this program.

<HEADLINE> Four Escape From Afghan Airline  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Four men dropped from the cockpit window of a
hijacked plane and ran to safety Tuesday night, fleeing the Afghan aircraft that
has been parked for two days at a British airport while negotiators sought the
safe release of more than 150 passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   In the darkness shortly before midnight, the men fell about 20 feet to the
ground and ran toward positions manned by police.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are four men and they are now with us,'' said police spokeswoman Kim
White.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear if the four were hostages or hijackers. Police
said they were trying to gauge what effect the escape was having on the people
aboard the plane. It appeared all was calm on the aircraft, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, negotiators warned that the talks, which gained the release of a
ninth hostage during the day Tuesday, could go on for days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The negotiations are going forward in a professional way, in a fairly calm
way,'' said John Broughton, an Essex Police assistant chief constable. ``The
principal concern here is the safety of the passengers on board that aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
	   The aims of the hijackers, believed to be Afghans, remained unclear.
Speculation ranged from an elaborate play for political asylum to a bid to win
the release of Ismail Khan, a former regional governor in Afghanistan detained
since 1997 by the country's ruling Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about a potential asylum bid, Broughton said: ``In talking around the
issues, there are a lot of things raised.'' He would not elaborate, saying only
that the hijackers, who controlled the plane at Stansted Airport 25 miles north
of London, had made no ``formal demands.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the negotiations involved what Broughton called housekeeping issues,
such as the delivery of water and food to the Ariana airlines plane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've done everything we can to keep the conditions on the aircraft
habitable,'' said Joe Edwards, another Essex Police assistant chief constable.
``We're talking all the time about what's the condition of people and how are
the children.''
</P>
<P>
	   A London representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees arrived
at Stansted as an observer, police said Tuesday evening. She would not be a
negotiator, but would bring to the crisis the strength of the U.N.'s expertise
on the situation in Afghanistan, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing 727 had been headed to the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif
from the Afghan capital, Kabul, when it was seized early Sunday. It then began a
meandering journey across the former Soviet Union, stopping in Uzbekistan,
Kazakstan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   According to some of the 22 passengers released before the plane landed at
Stansted early Monday, the hijackers are eight young men armed with pistols,
grenades and daggers. Edwards said former hostages that authorities have talked
to have said there were between six and 10 hijackers.
</P>
<P>
	   They were believed to still be holding more than 150 hostages, including 21
children. All the passengers were believed to be Afghans.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight passengers were released at Stansted on Monday, including two infants
who were treated for dehydration. The man released earlier Tuesday, an
asthmatic, had complained of feeling ill, Broughton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The freed hostages have said they were treated well, authorities said. One
told reporters the hijacking started somewhat quietly 20 minutes into the
flight, with the armed men calmly telling passengers to put their hands on their
heads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people we are talking to are remarkably calm and that's really
important,'' Edwards said. ``The atmosphere is one of control, people behaving
rationally. That's going to help an awful lot.''
</P>
<P>
	   All six Iraqi men at the center of Britain's last hijacking drama -- a 1996
case involving a Sudanese airliner -- remain in the country as asylum-seekers,
the British government confirmed Tuesday. Those men held 197 people hostage for
seven hours at Stansted.
</P>
<P>
	   They were convicted in 1997 and sentenced to between five and nine years in
prison. But they were cleared on appeal a year later after a court ruled the
trial judge was wrong to bar jurors from considering their defense -- that they
were acting under ``necessity'' as opponents of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's
regime.
</P>
<P>
	   The men had claimed they stormed the plane in a desperate bid to enter
Britain and seek asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan is one of the top sources of asylum seekers in Britain. An
average of 360 applications a month has been lodged by Afghans since October.
Refugee status is granted in about a third of cases.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Up Sharply After Losses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices soared higher Tuesday, regaining much of the
ground lost during the two previous trading sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond prices have been extremely volatile since the federal government
announced last week plans to pay down the national debt by reducing circulation
of long-term bonds.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year bond, which had plunged a total of 2 3/4 points
over the previous two sessions, rose 1 13/32 point, or $14.06 per $1,000 in face
value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price, fell to 6.23
percent from 6.34 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said demand for the 30-year bond remains high amid expectations
that supply in the benchmark issue will tighten in the years ahead as the
Treasury Department reduces new issuance and buys back long-term Treasury notes.
</P>
<P>
	   The buyback program means the 30-year government backed bonds, one of the
most popular and highly tradeable securities available to investors, could be
phased out altogether over time.
</P>
<P>
	   Demand was weak Tuesday during an auction for $12 billion in new five-year
notes.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices of short-term Treasury securities were unchanged Tuesday, while
intermediate maturities were unchanged or rose 7/32 to 5/32 point, according to
the Bridge Telerate news service.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading Tuesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.70
percent, with the discount remaining rising 0.02 percentage point from Monday's
auction price. Six-month yields were 5.99 percent as the discount fell 0.03
percentage point to 5.73 percent from Monday's auction price. One-year yields
finished at 6.19 percent, with the discount falling 0.01 percentage point to
5.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, fell
to 5.63 percent from 5.75 percent late Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds rose 7/32 point to 92 1/32. The
yield was 6.25 percent, down from 6.27 percent.

   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A man who mailed pipebombs to President Clinton, a Texas
evangelist and a federal agent in March was sentenced to life in prison Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The pipebomb addressed to ``W.J.C., 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue'' exploded in a
postal truck in Washington. The one destined for John Hagee at the Cornerstone
Ministries in San Antonio, Texas, exploded in a Dallas mail facility. No one was
injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The third pipebomb, intended for a Las Vegas-based agent for the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, was found in a bus station and did not explode.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge David Haugen sentenced Frank Darwin Alexander, 53, to
life in prison plus 39 years, without the possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Given what this guy has done, that sentence seems entirely appropriate,''
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas O'Connell.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander did not comment during his sentencing. At his plea hearing in
September, he said he wanted to spend the rest of his life in prison. He said he
could not see serving 40 years, then ``coming out and living on the streets''
when he would be 93.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander pleaded guilty to attempted murder, mailing injurious articles and
use of a firearm in a crime of violence.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Merrill Lynch VP Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- A former vice president and senior financial consultant for
Merrill Lynch in Boston pleaded guilty Tuesday to federal fraud charges in a
scheme that bilked clients of nearly $6.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Donald J. Martineau, 56, of Tewksbury, was charged in January with five
counts of wire fraud and one count of mail fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   From November 1989 to August 1998, federal prosecutors said, Martineau
defrauded clients, including two brothers-in-law.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Martineau convinced clients to invest funds through him,
diverted the money, then lost nearly all the money through risky trading of
stocks and options. Martineau was terminated by Merrill Lynch in August 1998 and
has already agreed to be barred for life from working as a stockbroker.
</P>
<P>
	   Martineau entered his guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Douglas P.
Woodlock. Sentencing was scheduled for May 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Martineau faces maximum penalties of five years in prison and a $250,000
fine for each conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Securities and Exchange Commission last month announced the filing of
civil fraud charges against Martineau.
</P>

<HEADLINE> No dice: Casino industry set-aside program stricken by federal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A federal judge Tuesday struck down as
unconstitutional a set-aside program that calls for New Jersey casinos to award
at least 15 percent of their contracts to companies headed by women and
minorities.
<P>
	   In another blow to affirmative action policies governing casinos, U.S.
District Judge Stephen Orlofsky granted a preliminary injunction barring the
state Casino Control Commission from enforcing the program.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is clear that the set-aside program establishes an unequal playing field
in the awarding of contracts by the casino industry," he said in a 29-page
opinion. "While the regulations governing the set-aside program do not mandate
specific contracting decisions, they undoubtedly have a 'concrete effect' on
whether non-minority business enterprises receive contracts from casino
licensees."
</P>
<P>
	   The injunction was sought by the Association for Fairness in Business, a
group of contractors that sued Dec. 9 challenging the program. The group said
New Jersey instituted the program in the 1980s without proving there had been
discrimination in the awarding of contracts by casinos in the first place.
</P>
<P>
	   Association attorney Salvatore Perillo welcomed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's certainly going to have a major impact on the casino industry. It
remains to be seen what the state's response will be. That'll be the interesting
thing to watch," Perillo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Allen Zappone, president of Fabi Construction Inc. of Absecon, the only one
of 20 association members named as a plaintiff, claims that his companies have
been denied contracts, despite being the lowest qualified bidder, because of the
set-aside program.
</P>
<P>
	   He did not return telephone calls seeking comment Tuesday on the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the commission, 25.7 percent of the $976 million spent by the
casinos in 1998 was done so with minority-owned or women-owned companies. That
figure does not include utility costs or mortgage interest.
</P>
<P>
	   The 15 percent goal is a cumulative one; that is, a casino can use
women-owned businesses for 10 percent of its business and minority-owned ones
for 5 percent and still pass muster.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know about the constitutionality of the program, but certainly it's
morally correct," said Bill Cradle, president of Atlantic Color Ltd., a
minority-owned Pleasantville printing company that prints letterhead,
invitations and other materials for Harrah's Casino Hotel and other casinos.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're getting less than 15 percent and that's a small amount. If you were
to break out minority business from women-owned business, it's a lot less than
that," Cradle said.
</P>
<P>
	   Casino commission spokesman Daniel Heneghan said the ruling breaks one of
the main promises made to New Jersey voters when they voted to legalize casinos
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   "When casinos were legalized, folks were promised there would be new jobs
and new business opportunities. Nobody promised those benefits just to a limited
group of people. The benefits were to be shared with as many groups as possible.
And that can't happen if women or minorities don't have an equal opportunity to
do business with the casinos."
</P>
<P>
	   Commission lawyers were still reviewing the decision and have not decided
what steps to take next, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling marks the latest in a series of court decisions against
affirmative action here:
</P>
<P>
	   -In November, a state Superior Court judge said the state Casino
Reinvestment Development Authority's minority business set-aside policies were
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   -Later that month, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the
affirmative action plan of Resorts Atlantic City was discriminatory. The ruling
came in a lawsuit filed by a white former stage technician who lost out to a
black man for a job in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   -Last month, a former pit manager sued Tropicana Casino and Resort for what
he said is discrimination against white men. John D. Rudolph, an 18-year
employee fired a year ago, filed a class-action lawsuit in U.S. District Court
saying the casino's affirmative action plan was not established to remedy
discrimination and was therefore legally insufficient.

<HEADLINE> Legislators: new emissions reporting statistics alarming  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Bolstered by new federally mandated reporting
categories, toxic emission statistics for 1998 showed alarming increases in the
substances released into the state's atmosphere, legislators contended Tuesday.
<P>
	   The annual Toxic Release Inventory report from the state Department of
Environmental Conservation showed releases of 63.6 million pounds of toxics in
1998 compared with 29.9 million pounds in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   That dramatic difference was due to the addition of seven new industries
which had to report their emissions for the first time, including metal mines,
coal mines and electric utilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic state Assemblyman Steven Englebright, D-Suffolk, said the newest
statistics do not mean that there was a doubling of the toxics released into the
atmosphere between 1997 and 1998. But he said the addition of polluter
statistics in previously unreported industries shows the incomplete way toxics
had been accounted for prior to the latest study.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have been taking a picture of the environment each year with a thumb
over half the lens," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the state Department of Environmental Conservation countered that had
categories of pollution which had been previously reported prior to 1998 been
considered, the state achieved an 11 percent decline in those emissions in the
most recent report.
</P>
<P>
	   The amount of pollutants released into the environment is useful as a way of
tracking those substances and little more, DEC spokeswoman Jennifer Post said
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not a measure of the environment," she said of the toxics
inventory. "This information does nothing to look at the public health, at the
air or water quality."
</P>
<P>
	   In past years, the DEC has released the report and a news release trumpeting
the declining emissions of chemicals. Post said no new release has yet been done
this year because there were statistical flaws in the report, though she said
they will not substantially change the findings.
</P>
<P>
	   Englebright said state policies toward controlling pollution and public
health policies might have to be revised in light of the more extensive
reporting of toxic releases.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the new statistics, electric utility emissions amounted to 41
percent of the overall toxic releases in 1998. Smokestack emissions into the air
increased from 18.9 million pounds to 33.2 million pounds between 1997 and 1998,
the increase largely because of power plants.
</P>
<P>
	   Mining activity added considerably to the toxics inventory, too.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said the 10.1 million pounds of chemicals generated by the Zinc
Corp. of America's mining operation in St. Lawrence County made it the worst
single polluter in 1998 in the first year it was listed in the toxics inventory.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one was even aware of it before, it is now the No. 1 polluter in the
state," Englebright said.
</P>
<P>
	   Second-worst polluter on the latest list was also a newcomer - the Chemical
Waste Management Services operation in the town of Porter in Niagara County.
</P>
<P>
	   The company which traditionally tops the emissions list, the Eastman Kodak
Co., fell to third in the 1998 statistics followed by traditional runner-up
Finch, Pruyn &AMP; Co. of Glens Falls.
</P>
<P>
	   Those four were followed by nine other first-time reporters to the
inventory, all power plants.
</P>
<P>
	   In many cases, companies reported putting toxics in landfills. The
Democratic legislators and environmentalists Tuesday said that while that is
preferrable to spewing the chemicals out of smokestacks, it is no guarantee that
the toxics have been neutralized or disposed of in ways they won't cause
problems in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   "Just because something is put into a landfill doesn't mean it's the end of
the problem," said John Stouffer of the Sierra Club. "Down the road these
facilities are going to be producing problems for future generations."
</P>
<P>
	   Post said most of the toxics produced by the mining process remain on the
site of those mines and will eventually be buried when the life of the
productive mine is completed. She added that the state has long monitored the
emissions into the atmosphere of power plants - though not in the toxics
inventory - and that the Pataki administration has ordered significant cuts in
those releases.
</P>
<P>
	   There remain other sources of potentially toxic discharges which are still
not getting onto the toxic release inventory. Smaller generators of such
substances don't have to report them to the state, the legislators said.
Farm-based substances like fertilizers also don't have to be reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a snapshot of the tip of the iceberg," state Assemblyman Richard
Brodsky, D-Westchester, said of the latest report.

<HEADLINE> Prison Riot in Andes Ends  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BY RICK VECCHIO Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- A prison riot by 50 convicted Maoist Shining Path rebels
in a frigid Andean prison has ended, President Alberto Fujimori said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Fujimori gave few details about the deal struck with prisoners to end the
insurrection at the Yanamayo prison, but said 24 guards who were held as
hostages had been freed.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials declined to comment on news reports that a guard was killed during
the riot. One Shining Path inmate was killed, but officials said he died at the
hands of other rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Minutes before Fujimori's announcement, television broadcast live images of
the prison's exterior with rebel banners draped from the barred, glassless
windows. Prisoners could be heard shouting slogans inside. Military officials
exiting the compound refused to provide any details about events behind the
prison walls.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostage crisis began Sunday night, when Maoist inmates armed with
homemade knives and demanding better conditions took the guards hostage.
Authorities had refused inmates' demands to treat them as prisoners of war and
to close the high security naval base in Lima where Shining Path leaders Abimael
Guzman and Oscar Ramirez Durand are serving life sentences.
</P>
<P>
	   The high-security prison holds some 450 rebel prisoners. Most belong to the
Shining Path, but members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement -- a much
smaller rebel band -- are also serving sentences there.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Fujimori's announcement, Jaime Castillo Patruzzi, a Chilean member of
the Tupac Amaru group, used a smuggled cell phone to tell Radio Bio Bio in his
home country that the siege had ended. He said the hostages were released after
authorities signed an agreement promising no reprisals against the inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yanamayo prison is in Puno, 525 miles southeast of the capital, Lima,
and near the Bolivian border. Prisoners live two to a cell in spartan
6-foot-by-10-foot quarters with no running water and are only allowed one
half-hour stint per day in the prison courtyard.
</P>
<P>
	   New York native Lori Berenson was held there until being transferred in 1998
for health reasons. A military judge convicted Berenson of treason in 1996 for
helping lead a thwarted Tupac Amaru assault on Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Peru's war against leftist rebels has left 30,000 people dead since 1980.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton calls for letting cheaper Canadian drugs into  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Newly official Senate candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton waded back into the health care wars Tuesday, calling for legislation
allowing cheaper prescription drugs to be imported into the United States from
Canada.
<P>
	   Clinton, who led the failed effort of her husband's administration in 1993
and 1994 to overhaul the nation's health care financing system, told more than
400 medical professionals at a Rochester medical center, that "I didn't give up
then and I won't give up now."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has vowed to make health care costs a major campaign issue in the
race that is expected to pit her against New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   In Rochester, she picked up the endorsement of the American Nurses
Association for the Senate campaign she made official on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady reiterated her earlier support for a patients' bill of
rights, expanding Medicare by adding a prescription drug benefit and protecting
the privacy of medical records and outlawing genetic discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   But the cornerstone of her proposal Tuesday was her call for letting cheaper
Canadian drugs, that have Federal Drug Administration approval, be imported into
this country.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for the pharmaceutical industry said, however, that Clinton's
plan was "absolutely the wrong way to go," could leave patients vulnerable to
unsafe or ineffective drugs and was likely the product of election-year
politics.
</P>
<P>
	   For her part, Clinton said that "if we want to make health care affordable,
we must lower the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans."
</P>
<P>
	   "Prescription drugs are a necessity and yet they are priced as a luxury,"
she added. "Their costs are rising at 12 percent a year, faster than any other
part of our health care system."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said one of the reasons for the price increases was that "the
industry will spend $1.8 billion this year on advertising. We are the only
industrialized nation in the world that permits prescription drugs to be
advertised directly to consumers on TV and in print."
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, she noted that Canadians benefit from a price-control
system that means a three-month supply of tamoxifen, used to battle breast
cancer, can be purchased for $50 in that country. It sells for $390 in the
United States, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every day, thousands of our citizens cross the border to buy drugs at a
fraction of the cost," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   "These drugs are made with the same ingredients and they offer the same
benefits," Clinton said. "They are made in the exact same factories, factories
most often owned by U.S. pharmaceutical companies."
</P>
<P>
	   Taking care to note her new New York roots, Clinton said, "I was always told
that New Yorkers never bought retail. Well, that's wrong when it comes to drugs,
and it must stop."
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said the plan could
save Americans up to 15 percent in drug costs.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jackie Cottrell, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, a trade group representing about 100 companies, said
"what she is proposing would overturn landmark consumer protection legislation"
- the Prescription Drug Marketing Act approved in 1988 that banned the
reimportation of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "From the pharmaceutical industry's point of view, the answer isn't a scheme
like reimportation that could hurt patient safety or importing price controls,
it's to provide prescription drug coverage to those who use medicines the most,
and that's our senior population, through a reformed and strengthened Medicare
program," Cottrell said.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, in his new budget proposal, President Clinton has proposed
expanding Medicare to offer prescription drug coverage, a plan his wife said she
supports.
</P>
<P>
	   Cottrell said that while the industry does spend a hefty amount on
advertising, it is dwarfed by the $26.4 billion the industry spends annually on
research and development of drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "We shouldn't rush in an election year to damage consumer protection
legislation," she added.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Giuliani camp declined to comment on the Clinton proposal, it
noted that her idea wasn't new and that legislation has been introduced in
Congress by Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont and others to allow the importation
of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Cottrell said a difference between that legislation and the Clinton plan is
that her's would apply only to drugs coming in from Canada. She said the
pharmaceutical industry objected to even that change.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanders called the Clinton proposal "very exciting. I think she picked
exactly the right issue because I think she's going to find that in New York
state, Vermont and every other state in this country, people are outraged by the
high cost of prescription drugs and the absurdity that the same exact product
sold in the United States, made in the United States, is sold in Canada for
significantly lower prices."
</P>
<P>
	   Cottrell said that while the idea of lower cost drugs from Canada "sounds
pretty appealing, the flip side of that is Canada has no major pharmaceutical
industry."
</P>
<P>
	   Just last month, President Clinton also took the drug companies to task for
the high cost of their products in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   "Someone should ask them how they can possibly justify the fact that
American senior citizens are now being carried across the border to Canada to
buy drugs produced in America," he said.

<HEADLINE> Barak Issues North Israel Warning  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Israelis living near the
Lebanon border huddled in underground shelters or fled south out of rocket range
Tuesday, fearing reprisals by Lebanese guerrillas for the heaviest Israeli
bombardment in eight months.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Ehud Barak ordered a military state of emergency along the
northern border, a sign that Israel was preparing for extended fighting.
Hezbollah guerrillas on Tuesday killed an Israeli soldier -- the sixth in two
weeks -- only hours after Israeli airstrikes cut electricity across parts of
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In all that is connected with the protection of our people, our
settlements and our soldiers, we will do everything required,'' Barak told
residents of Kiryat Shmona who had spent the night in shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   In its second straight night of attacks, Israel's air force struck a
Hezbollah offices late Tuesday in the coastal city of Tyre and the guerrilla
stronghold of Iqlim al-Tuffah, 40 miles southeast of Beirut, Lebanese security
officials said. At least two people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli army confirmed the two attacks on Iqlim al-Tuffah, but
identified the other target as a Hezbollah radar station.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli leaders blamed Syria for the latest flare-up and said peace talks
will not resume with Damascus until it ends the wave of Lebanese guerrilla
attacks. Syria is the main power-broker in Lebanon, and Israel says it
encourages the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Lebanon's ambassador accused Israel of deliberately targeting
civilians in southern Lebanon and urged the Clinton administration to stop the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I expressed my government's concern -- grave concern -- for the Israeli
attacks on civilian targets and explained that these were deliberate attacks in
contradiction of law and the April 1996 agreement,'' said Ambassador Farid
Abboud on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   He was referring to a U.S.-brokered understanding that forbids attacks on or
from civilian areas in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria's state media, meanwhile, warned that the bombing could hurt the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bombs and missiles are actually striking the already stalled peace process
and destroying all prospects of peace in the region,'' the English-language
Syria Times said.
</P>
<P>
	   The airstrikes late Monday and early Tuesday destroyed three power stations
at Jamhour near Beirut, in the northern mountains east of the port city of
Tripoli and in the eastern Bekaa Valley town of Baalbek, a Hezbollah guerrilla
stronghold where a base for the group also was targeted. The base remained
sealed and damage could not be assessed.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifteen civilians were wounded in Baalbek and were treated at hospitals for
various injuries from broken glass, debris and shrapnel. Parts of Lebanon were
left without electricity and severe rationing was imposed.
</P>
<P>
	   The airstrikes were the harshest since a similar strafing by the outgoing
hard-line government, just before Barak took office in July.
</P>
<P>
	   The escalation in attacks on Israeli troops staffing a buffer zone in
Lebanon's south coincided with the collapse in Syrian-Israel peace in
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria wants a prior commitment from Israel that it will withdraw from the
disputed Golan Heights before talks ensue; Israel refuses, and says the
resumption of violence is a crude effort to get Israel to cave in.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak was getting closer to playing his own card against Syria -- a
unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon that would leave Syria without its single
most effective method of pressuring Israel, and would raise uncomfortable
questions about the presence of 30,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we will not reach an agreement (with Syria) in the next two months, I
believe -- I know -- that the Israel government will meet and decide if we will
withdraw unilaterally,'' Cabinet minister Haim Ramon, a Barak confidant, told
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   While such talk could influence a Syria that is eager to end its
international isolation, it will have little influence on the Hezbollah, a
militant group that negates the very existence of the Jewish state. Should a
withdrawal occur -- with or without peace talks -- Hezbollah, seeking to expand
its political influence, would claim credit as the force that drove the
occupiers south.
</P>
<P>
	   With such win-win prospects, the guerrillas showed no sign of holding back.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, their rockets hit an Israeli military outpost at Dabshe, two
miles north of the Israeli border, killing one soldier. A pro-Israeli militiaman
was later wounded in a separate guerrilla attack on the outpost of Bir Kallab in
southern Lebanon. He died later.
</P>
<P>
	   The prospect of the rockets reaching Israel prompted Barak's announcement,
through broadcast media, of a 48-hour state of emergency. Residents who stayed
north were required to spend the night in shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   Many headed south rather than face another night in the bowels of their
apartment buildings. Rachel Ben-Sultan, surrounded by four bulging suitcases at
the Kiryat Shmona bus station, said she was fed up with repeated emergencies
after 43 years in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If these attacks go on intensively, we will leave, we will go to a place
that has peace and quiet,'' she said before boarding a bus to stay with her
daughter in a town several miles southwest. ``We cannot go on like this.''

<HEADLINE> Wharton School Names New Dean  </HEADLINE>
    By JOANN LOVIGLIO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Patrick T. Harker, an award-winning professor at the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, has been named dean of the nation's
first collegiate business school, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Harker becomes the 12th dean of the prestigious business school, which was
founded in 1881. He has been serving as deputy and interim dean since Thomas P.
Gerrity stepped down from the post last July.
</P>
<P>
	   The appointment will become effective upon confirmation by the university's
trustees Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are pleased that our search, which has been one of the most exhaustive
and thorough ever conducted at Penn, has led us back to yet another
distinguished member of the Penn family," university president Judith Rodin
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harker, 41, has held several leadership positions at Penn over the past 15
years. In addition to his work as a professor, he served as chairman of the
school's Operations and Information Management Department from 1997 to 1999 and
currently holds a secondary appointment in the Department of Systems Engineering
in Penn's School of Engineering and Applied Science.
</P>
<P>
	   A resident of Haddon Heights, N.J., Harker received bachelor's and master's
degrees in civil and urban engineering from Penn in 1981 and a master's in
economics and a Ph.D. in civil engineering from Penn in 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   Harker was a White House fellow under President George Bush from 1991 to
1992, and served as a special assistant to the FBI regarding technology issues.
In 1986, he received the National Science Foundation's Young Investigator Award
and in 1998, he won two teaching awards.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, Gerrity was named director of The Wharton School's Forum on
Electronic Commerce, which was established in 1996 to bring together faculty and
corporate leaders to research the impact of e-commerce on the economy.

<HEADLINE> Ellen Tracy Unveils Fall Fashions  </HEADLINE>
    By FRANCINE PARNES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Midway through Oscar de la Renta's fall preview Tuesday, an
outfit described inconspicuously as "Black feather dress" came down the runway.
In no way was the audience prepared for the imposing pouf of ostrich that fairly
smothered the model's middle with yards of fanciful fluff.
</P>
<P>
	   Likewise, for the grand finale, de la Renta flirted with ostentation via
ornamentation. A black cashmere sweater took on new dimensions by dangling with
long sequins and pom poms.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Renta, who dresses the women with the boldfaced names in social
columns, knows their closets hold only so many basic clothes. The remainder must
include special beading and embroidery, plus the painstakingly crafted crewel
work that adorns so much of his fall eveningwear. In other words, outfits had
better be entrance-making.
</P>
<P>
	   So, how about a de la Renta silk skirt with five tiers of multicolored
striped ruffles? De la Renta was not kidding when he uses "ornamentation" to
describe skirts, jackets and gowns in the collection. The clothes did not skimp
on lavish embroidery, a theme he also used in the Balmain collection he recently
designed in Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's kind of the embroidery you could probably see in 19th-century peasant
clothes in Europe, but done in a sophisticated manner with a lot of color," he
said. "It's not a minimalistic season, and I have never been very minimal-minded
to start with."
</P>
<P>
	   The daytime collection looked lush and plush, with autumnal shades of
burgundy, brown and caramel, all done up in luxe finery with cashmere coats and
velvet dresses. Loden green boiled wool jackets took their cue from the Tyrol
Mountains in Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   If more was more at de la Renta, then less was more at Ellen Tracy. The
$250-million company caters to women who want a touch of the trends, in clothes
that are still classic, realistic, easy to digest.
</P>
<P>
	   For fall the Ellen Tracy message was simple separates, subdued styles.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a sure bet you're in for the classics, when Ellen Tracy opens its show
with an above-the-knee tweed skirt with matching jacket. And it's a sure bet
you're in for simplicity, when the stylists behind the scenes at the showing opt
to skip all the gold jewelry they had laid out for the models.
</P>
<P>
	   "We started out with a lot of jewelry -- we thought we liked the idea of
bangles - and then we decided it just looked better clean and simple," said
Linda Allard, head designer for Ellen Tracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Many looks contrasted bright color with the boldness of black, such as a
black leather miniskirt with a chartreuse felt coat, or a black sleeveless top
with a turquoise felt suit. A simple, hot pink tunic dress was paired with black
opaque tights.
</P>
<P>
	   At her renovated showroom, where Allard staged the informal presentation,
she said "the clothes are minimal, since there is so much color and the shapes
are pretty simple. So they don't need a lot of embellishment."
</P>
<P>
	   The look won admirers.

<HEADLINE> Union leaders meet with senators to discuss Pratt jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - After years of fighting to keep Pratt &AMP; Whitney
contracts in the defense budget, Connecticut's congressional delegation says
it's payback time.
<P>
	   That debt can be squared if the company backs off a plan to cut thousands of
Connecticut jobs, lawmakers said Tuesday after meeting with leaders of Pratt's
machinists' union.
</P>
<P>
	   After all, "these are not failing companies," said U.S. Sen. Joseph
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
	   "I suppose you can always figure something out to squeeze a little more
profit from the company. But at some point don't you turn around and say, 'we
owe something to the state in which we've grown,' " the Democrat asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt &AMP; Whitney, a division of United Technologies Corp., designs,
manufactures and services jet engines, space propulsion systems and industrial
gas turbines.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has been in the process of eliminating 3,500 jobs since it
started a major restructuring and consolidation effort in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In late January Pratt officials announced they'll add 1,700 more jobs to
that list by the end of the year, mostly from the company's Connecticut
manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
	   About 1,500 cuts will come from the hourly work force, mostly line workers
in the company's East Hartford, North Haven and Middletown plants. The remaining
200 cuts will come from salaried workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the cuts are the result of the company's desire to move operations
to other states.
</P>
<P>
	   Others are due to contracts with foreign governments that agree to buy Pratt
products in return for some of the manufacturing being done in their countries.
</P>
<P>
	   When those contracts where made Pratt believed there was enough work to go
around but since then orders have dropped precipitously, said spokesman Scott
Seligman.
</P>
<P>
	   "These layoffs are a response to a decline in the aerospace industries as a
whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the Machinists Union question whether the contracts really exist
or whether the company is looking for an excuse to move production to places
where labor costs are cheaper.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you really have a contract with Korea, show me," said Jim Parent, a
spokesman for the union.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Chris Dodd also sounded skeptical about the contracts known as offsets.
</P>
<P>
	   "Don't tell me they had to buckle under the heavy weight of Taiwanese
government," he scoffed.
</P>
<P>
	   Others at the meeting, including Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-New Haven, Rep. Jim
Maloney, D-Danbury, Rep. Sam Gedjenson, D-Bozrah, and Rep. John Larson, D-East
Hartford, called for a conference with United Technologies officials and other
state legislators.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are delighted to sit down with members of the delegation," Seligman
said."We think a face-to-face meeting is going to go a long way toward allasying
some of their concerns."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon-Israel Fighting History  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Key events in fighting in south Lebanon since Israel established a
440-square-mile security zone there in 1985 to protect its northern communities
from cross-border attacks:
</P>
<P>
	   -- July, 1993: Israel launches a one-week blitz against Hezbollah fighters
in south Lebanon in the largest attack since efforts to drive Palestinian
fighters out of the area in 1982. About 150 Lebanese are killed in the
``Operation Accountability'' strikes and thousands of civilians flee northward.
Retaliatory Katyusha attacks by Hezbollah kill several Israelis.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Forbes Meet in Delaware  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush sought to regain his political
footing with a much-needed victory in Delaware's presidential primary Tuesday.
His chief rival, John McCain of Arizona, refused to campaign in the state but
hoped for a surprise showing to increase his threat to Bush and the GOP
establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor and conservative millionaire Steve Forbes badly needed a
victory after McCain trounced them in last week's New Hampshire primary and
opted to focus on the critical Feb. 19 contest in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls showed Bush did best among voters who are middle class, elderly,
conservative and believe he is likely to win the presidency. McCain voters
tended to be affluent, well-educated and self-identified independents and
moderates who said they were looking for a candidate who stands up for what he
believes.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, who has pushed for a flat tax since his failed 1996 run, did well
among voters who listed taxes as their top concern. Voters were surveyed as they
left the polling precincts by Voter News Service, a consortium of The Associated
Press and television networks.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victory in New Hampshire erased Bush's lead in South Carolina and
dramatically shrunk his advantage in California, Michigan, New York and national
polls, as he sought to draw new and independent voters into the GOP fold.
</P>
<P>
	   Tremors were even felt in Delaware, where exit polls showed that one-fourth
of McCain supporters did not vote in the 1996 GOP primary. One-third of them
decided to back him in the week since his New Hampshire victory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We never even went there. We didn't spend a penny there,'' McCain said
from South Carolina, calling it ``remarkable'' that Delaware primary voters were
backing him anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the top three candidates, conservative Alan Keyes was on the
ballot, though he did not campaign here. Gary Bauer, who dropped out of the race
last week, also was listed.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to South Carolina, where Forbes is not a factor, Bush and
McCain intensified their rivalry with an exchange of bitterly personal ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor's spot accuses McCain of hypocrisy over his signature
issue of campaign finance reform. McCain says in his new ad that Bush ``twists
the truth like Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The overheated rhetoric underscored what is at stake in upcoming contests.
Despite his financial and organizational advantages, Bush faces a serious threat
from the Arizona senator. And McCain, with just one victory under his belt,
can't afford losses to his party's front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina will test whether McCain is a one-state wonder or a contender
who can foil Bush and his backers in the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won Delaware's primary in 1996 and spent tens of thousands of dollars
to build an organization this time around. Anything short of a strong second
place finish would force him to take stock of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, campaigning to the last at a nursing home, pledged to end
inheritance taxes as part of his flat tax plan. ``You should be allowed to leave
this world unmolested by the IRS,'' he told about 60 senior citizens in a
reception room down the hall from a polling place.
</P>
<P>
	   With little hope in South Carolina, he was flying to Michigan, which has its
Republican primary on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   The Delaware primary yielded the winner only 12 convention delegates, and
perhaps a spurt of momentum heading into South Carolina. Voters had just 28
precinct locations to visit, a fraction of the usual 400 -- a dynamic that
analysts said favored Bush, who is backed by the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   After Delaware and South Carolina, the GOP campaign moves to Feb. 22
primaries in Arizona and Michigan. Bush has campaigned hard in McCain's home
state, and is supported by Arizona Gov. Jane Hull. McCain hasn't ceded any
ground in Michigan, where Bush is backed by Gov. John Engler.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia conducts its primary Feb. 29, and Bush is backed there by Gov.
James Gilmore. More than a dozen states hold primaries or caucuses on March 7,
when the nominee could be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won in Delaware four years ago, gaining 33 percent of the vote to
beat Bob Dole, the eventual nominee. But Forbes was the only GOP candidate to
campaign in Delaware that year, with the others staying away in deference to New
Hampshire's insistence on being the first and only contest in the opening week
of primary competition.
</P>
<P>
	   To avoid a replay in 2000, Delaware Republicans opted out of the state
primary last Saturday to hold a party-run election Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Report: Haider Defends Waffen-SS  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE BOEHMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Austrian far-right leader Joerg Haider rejects
the idea of collective guilt for troops of the Waffen-SS, a Nazi legion involved
in notorious atrocities of World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, ``individual guilt is what matters,'' he said in a Die Welt
newspaper interview Tuesday. ``It can never be the Waffen SS as such but only
individuals ... who bear the responsibility'' for crimes committed by the
organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider's father was a member of the SA, the Nazi brownshirt storm troopers
who also served as Adolf Hitler's body guards. The SS -- short for
Schutzstaffel, or Protection Squad -- was an offshoot of the SA and became a
special formation in 1929 when Heinrich Himmler took command.
</P>
<P>
	   SA chief Ernst Roehm eventually fell out of favor with Hitler, and he was
arrested and shot in 1934, the year after the Nazis took power. That left the SS
unchallenged as the elite unit, and it became the most powerful instrument of
Nazi control.
</P>
<P>
	   SS units were responsible for operating and guarding Nazi concentration
camps, including death camps, during World War II. Fiercely loyal to Hitler, the
SS followed an extreme racist ideology and members were touted as examples of
the German master race.
</P>
<P>
	   The Waffen-SS, or armed SS, was formed in 1939 as the fighting branch of the
SS. Some divisions were involved in killing sprees such as the slaughter of more
than 70 unarmed U.S. prisoners at Malmedy, Belgium, and the massacre of 642
French villagers at Oradour-sur-Glane in 1944.
</P>
<P>
	   Better equipped than regular Wehrmacht soldiers, the Waffen-SS was used
notably to secure Nazi-occupied areas and to combat partisans or other
opposition forces. They also fought on the front lines next to the Wehrmacht.
</P>
<P>
	   Former U.S. President Ronald Reagan caused an uproar in 1985 when he visited
a German military cemetery at Bitburg, Germany, where 49 Waffen-SS members were
buried. Jewish groups, U.S. congressmen and veterans' groups assailed Reagan for
the cemetery visit, which German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had included on the
presidential itinerary in an effort to mark U.S.-German reconciliation 40 years
after the end of the war.

<HEADLINE> Radio Liberty Reporter Feared Dead  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNA DOLGOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- A Radio Liberty reporter is missing -- and his colleagues
fear he may be dead, another casualty of the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian military officials claim to have turned over Andrei Babitsky to
Chechen rebels nearly a week ago, but he has not been heard from since. Chechen
commanders say they don't have him and never did.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Andrei was with Chechen field commanders, he would have certainly found
a telephone,'' Radio Liberty's Moscow bureau chief, Savic Shuster, said Tuesday.
``If he is alive and keeping silent, there is a reason for that. Or he is not
alive.'' The private Radio Liberty is funded by U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said Tuesday that Babitsky was
alive and well, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. It said he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian authorities have tried to tightly control information about the
Chechnya offensive that began in September, mindful of the public outrage that
marked the 1994-96 Chechnya war.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky had angered the government by questioning its reports, and some
Russian officials even accused him of fighting with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky, 35, last called home on Jan. 15. Ten days later, the Russian
government said he had been arrested but would be released soon. Then, the
government announced that Babitsky was turned over last Thursday to the rebels,
at his request, in exchange for three Russian prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
	   The swap raised fears for his safety, as the Russians said they no longer
bore any responsibility for Babitsky's life.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It could not even be characterized as barbarity, but as savagery,'' Genri
Reznik, a lawyer for U.S.-sponsored Radio Liberty, told a news conference
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Suspicion is also mounting about whether the swap ever took place at all.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do not believe my husband is alive and well,'' Babitsky's wife,
Lyudmila, said after the Russians announced the exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Presidential aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky showed reporters what he said was
Babitsky's written statement agreeing to the exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky's colleagues called the document an ``unprofessional fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it had been done professionally, Babitsky would have read on camera the
statement that he has supposedly written,'' Shuster said.
</P>
<P>
	   The official reason for Babitsky's arrest was that he did not have a
government permit to report in Chechnya. Other Western reporters have been
detained for the same reason, but quickly released. Accreditation is only issued
to Russia's pro-government media, which back the official view of the war.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky has worked for Radio Liberty since the early 1990s and reported on
the earlier Chechnya war. He is not the only reporter to question the
government, but he has reported primarily from rebel-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The government heavily criticized him after he reported Russian losses in a
rebel attack in December on Minutka Square in Grozny. The Russian military
initially denied its troops entered the square, although several journalists,
including an Associated Press reporter, counted the bodies of more than 100
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky also gave the rebels a lot of coverage at a time when the
government was urging reporters not to put ``terrorists'' on the air.
</P>
<P>
	   At Radio Liberty's request, leaders in Chechnya's separatist government have
been checking with field commanders about Babitsky -- but to no avail, Shuster
said. The station also has been unable to reach the Russian soldiers supposedly
exchanged for Babitsky.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is now clear that the rather mystical exchange ... is a sleight of hand
meant to conceal an obviously unlawful action -- or, more likely, a heinous
crime,'' Boris Pustintsev, head of the civil rights group Citizens' Watch, wrote
in an article published Tuesday in the Moscow Times daily.
</P>
<P>
	   Pustintsev also suggested the case illustrated the heavy-handed methods of
acting President Vladimir Putin, a former KGB officer. Putin is seen as a
shoo-in in Russia's March 26 presidential election, although he remains a
largely enigmatic figure.
</P>
<P>
	   If Putin ``was from the start aware of this operation -- and we can smell
his KGB methods from miles away -- then there's no doubt what life under this
guarantor of rights will be like,'' Pustintsev wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, meanwhile, insisted Tuesday he would protect press freedoms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am deeply convinced that there will be no development, no future at all
in the country if we suppress civil rights and freedom of press,'' Putin said in
an interview on ORT television.

<HEADLINE> American at Italy Border Had $1.9B  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMO, Italy (AP) -- Italian border guards found an undeclared stash of $1.9
billion in old government bonds on a U.S. citizen stopped at the Swiss border,
customs officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Carrying that much wealth across the border isn't illegal, but failing to
declare it is, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 63-year-old was an Italian-born American living in Texas, Italy's
customs police said. They did not release his name.
</P>
<P>
	   The man was stopped Monday at the Ponte Chiasso border crossing nearly 40
miles north of Milan as he tried to come from Switzerland into Italy.
Authorities found with him $1.9 billion in U.S. federal bonds -- all dated to
1934. He was released the same day
</P>
<P>
	   Italian Treasury authorities are investigating whether the bonds were
genuine and still good. Customs guards said they had no explanation as to why
the man was carrying the bonds across the border.
</P>
<P>
	   Customs officials confiscated 40 percent of the bonds. If they prove valid,
authorities will keep 20 percent of the total value -- the set penalty for his
alleged failure to declare them.

<HEADLINE> House Remembers Carl Albert  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Remembering former House Speaker Carl Albert as a ``giant
of a man,'' the House of Representatives passed a resolution Tuesday to honor
the longtime lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Albert died last week in Oklahoma after being in frail health for many
years. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
	   A bipartisan congressional delegation, including Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., and Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., is expected to attend
funeral services Wednesday in McAlester, Okla. The House resolution passed
390-0.
</P>
<P>
	   Albert ``served as captain of the congressional ship during some of our
nation's most difficult times,'' said Rep. Wes Watkins, R-Okla., citing Albert's
tenure during the end of the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights Movement. ``He
sought to unite our country instead of divide it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Watkins took over the congressional seat Albert vacated in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In many ways his style of leadership in the speaker's chair left with me
an indelible mark,'' said Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Albert spent 30 years representing Oklahoma's 3rd District. He became
Democratic majority leader in 1962 and speaker in 1971 before retiring five
years later.
</P>
<P>
	   The 5-foot-4 1/2 Albert became known as the ``Little Giant from Little
Dixie,'' a reference to the Democratic stronghold in southeastern Oklahoma that
he served.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Carl Albert was small in height but he was a giant of a man,'' Watkins
said.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Funds for Poison Control  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Much-needed funds would be pumped into the nation's 73
poison control centers under a bill passed by the House Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure, which passed 378-16, would authorize $140 million over the next
five years to fund local poison control centers, pay for a national media
campaign and create a nationwide toll-free telephone number for the sick or
injured to access services.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal comes after a lack of reliable funding during the past two
decades has forced many poison centers to cut services or shut down altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The financial squeeze has forced many centers to curtail their
services.,'' said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich. ``This bill is going to save lives
and at the end of the day it can save money, too.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to a report issued by a government advisory group, every dollar
spent on poison control services saves $7 in medical costs.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 2 million poisonings are reported to control centers throughout
the United States each year. Ninety percent of the incidents occur at home, and
more than half of the victims are children under age 6.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This kind of effort is critical if centers are to provide the maximum
level of service to our most vulnerable -- children,'' said Rep. Edolphus Towns,
D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of existing centers today is a drastic change from just 22 years
ago when there were 661 centers across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate passed the measure in August. It now goes to the White House for
approval.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Squabble Over Trust  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush and John McCain questioned each
other's trustworthiness Tuesday in new disputes that threatened to overshadow
any other topic in the Republican presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain released a new ad that says one of Bush's commercials ``twists the
truth like Clinton.'' Bush responded with a commercial taking aim at McCain's
core message -- campaign finance reform -- and saying the senator ``solicits
money from lobbyists with interests before his committee and pressures agencies
on behalf of contributors.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor said he had a record of reform and McCain was not the
political maverick he claimed, repeatedly referring to the senator as ``the
chairman'' and saying that as head of the Senate's Commerce Committee and as a
campaigner he ``tends to say one thing and do another.''
</P>
<P>
	   The latest example, Bush said, was McCain's statement a day earlier that he
had always opposed public funding of elections. The Bush campaign offered a list
of five McCain votes from 1990 to 1993 in favor of a bill that proposed partial
public funding of Senate campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain voted not once, not twice, but five times to support
publicly funded congressional campaigns,'' Bush told reporters after speaking to
a cheering student crowd at North Greenville College.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, campaigning in South Carolina, said he couldn't recall whether he
had ever voted for public funding of federal campaigns, but that he was
philosophically opposed to the idea ``because of my view that my tax dollars
should not be used to subsidize the campaigns of another candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   His spokesman, Howard Opinsky, said: ``This is the same old Washington
Clintonian politics that voters have become so cynical about, trying to twist
John McCain's 17-year record of reform and consistent opposition to public
financing to Governor Bush's advantage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Opinsky said all of the votes were against cloture motions -- that is,
voting to continue debate -- to keep opponents from stifling campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
	   In Columbia, meanwhile, McCain announced a plan to fight crime and drugs,
but the event was all but buried by questions from reporters about his disputes
with Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, the former Vietnam prisoner of war, said he was offended by a Bush
ally who questioned his commitment to veterans -- a comment McCain said was
``beyond the pale'' -- as well as by aggressive new Bush ads. He noted that he
and Bush had shaken hands just weeks ago and agreed not to air negative ads
against each other.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe it is not trustworthy when someone shakes your hand and says
they're not going to run a negative ad, and then runs a negative ad,'' he said
aboard his bus.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've already got somebody in the Oval Office who is not trustworthy,'' he
said. He went even further in a new TV ad that says one of Bush's ads ``twists
the truth like Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
	   The charges and countercharges come as Bush and McCain court veterans, who
along with active-duty military make up a substantial portion of the GOP
electorate here. The state primary is Feb. 19, and Bush views the state as his
political ``firewall'' to stop McCain's momentum after the New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain insisted he was not labeling Bush himself untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
	   He was referring, he said, to the Texas governor's advertisements and to the
Bush backer who questioned McCain's commitment to veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   That supporter, J. Thomas Burch Jr., said last week that McCain had not
backed efforts on Agent Orange, Gulf War Syndrome and support for families of
soldiers missing in action.
</P>
<P>
	   Even one of Bush's foreign policy advisers, Richard Armitage, was critical
of those remarks, which he noted Bush didn't speak himself.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No surrogate should question John McCain on veterans or POW-MIA issues,''
Armitage said Tuesday in a telephone interview. He said he remained a strong
Bush supporter.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of McCain supporters who are veterans, including Medal of Honor
winner Mike Thornton of Texas, stood outside North Greenville College and held
picket signs as the Bush entourage arrived. One said, ``Bush, Tell the Real
Truth for Vets.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Evidently there's a difference of opinion in the veterans' community,''
Bush said. ``Mr. Burch can speak for himself. I didn't write Mr. Burch's
script.''
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Bush complained about McCain's new ad, saying it ``demeans the
process.'' However, he rejected the senator's offer to have both of them pull
their disputed ads from the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's an old game of switch and bait,'' the governor said. ``It's a game of
say one thing, do another. If he really believes in the ad, let it stay up.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush himself released two new TV commercials for South Carolina, Michigan
and Virginia. One is a positive recitation of his accomplishments as Texas
governor; the other, a slam against McCain on campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain appeared to displease some people in his morning audience in North
Augusta by stating his support for the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on
homosexuals in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a lifestyle I don't approve of,'' McCain added.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain placed veterans at the center of his plan to combat crime and drugs
when he addressed about 400 law enforcement students and officers at the South
Carolina Criminal Justice Academy.
</P>
<P>
	   He promised to establish a panel of retired military leaders and ex-soldiers
to develop a nationwide plan pairing veterans with ``needy youths.'' Parents,
juvenile justice authorities and child development experts would also sit on the
panel, he said.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Barred for Hitler Comment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEABODY, Mass. (AP) -- A substitute teacher has been barred from the city's
schools for telling students, ``Hitler is cool.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have no idea how the conversation got started or where it was going, but
his statement was inappropriate in front of children,'' Jane Wilson, principal
of J. Henry Higgins Middle School, told The Boston Globe. ``We don't want
anything that would be controversial with students.''
</P>
<P>
	   School officials would not identify the teacher, but said he had extensive
experience substituting in Peabody, which is north of Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson said the teacher was supervising a group of seventh-graders two weeks
ago when he made the comment. She said several students were offended, and they
reported him to school officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The teacher told administrators that he meant that Adolf Hitler was dead so
his body is cold, according to Superintendent Louis Perullo.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Wilson nor Perullo found the explanation credible. Perullo barred
him from working in Peabody schools.

<HEADLINE> Planes Crash in Ill., Three Dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZION, Ill. (AP) -- Two small planes collided over a hospital parking lot
Tuesday, killing three people and sending one plane into the roof of a hospital,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Windows blew out of the top floor of Midwestern Regional Medical Center as
one plane crashed onto the roof and crumpled. The two people on the plane, a
Zlin, were killed, said Fire Chief David LaBelle.
</P>
<P>
	   Two hospital workers were slightly burned and the hospital was evacuated,
said hospital president Roger Cary.
</P>
<P>
	   The Zlin was co-owned by Bob Collins, a popular morning radio personality
for WGN-AM. He was feared dead, the station said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know Bob Collins was flying today and we believe that was the plane he
was on,'' said WGN general manager Steve Carver.
</P>
<P>
	   The other plane, a four-seat Cessna 172, crashed into a nearby street,
killing the one person on board, LaBelle said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cessna was registered to ATE of New York, a flying school. A message to
the company's office in Chicago was not returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Les Mussared said he was standing in a parking lot near the hospital when
the planes crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I looked up because I heard a gurgling noise. I saw two small planes
collide in the air -- they pulled away from each other,'' Mussared said.
</P>
<P>
	   Preliminary reports indicated both planes were approaching the Waukegan
Airport, near the site of the collision.
</P>
<P>
	   Zion is about 45 miles north of downtown Chicago, near the
Illinois-Wisconsin line.

<HEADLINE> Preliminary Delaware Exit Poll Data  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Preliminary data from exit polls of voters in Tuesday's Delaware
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ----------
</P>
<P>
	   How and why Delaware Republicans voted:
</P>
<P>
	   BUSH SUPPORTERS: Bush received much of his support from the middle class,
conservatives, those who thought he can win and those who thought moral values
were the top issue.
</P>
<P>
	   MCCAIN SUPPORTERS: McCain did better among the affluent, the better
educated, independent-minded Republicans, moderates, abortion rights supporters
and those who want a candidate who stands up for what he believes.
</P>
<P>
	   FORBES SUPPORTERS: Forbes supporters were more interested in issues than
personal qualities, and they thought taxes were the top issue. They thought it
was important that a candidate stands up for what he believes and they said
moral values was the top issue.
</P>
<P>
	   DECIDED TO VOTE: About four in 10 voters said they decided to vote in the
last week. About half of Forbes voters and half of McCain's voters made their
decision in that period, while three-fourths of Bush supporters decided earlier
than that.
</P>
<P>
	   VIEWS ON ECONOMY: As in the Delaware Democratic primary Saturday, voters
overwhelmingly had a positive view of Delaware's economy and how their own
family's financial situation compares to four years ago. And about three in four
Republican voters said they believe the average American's standard of living
will rise in the next 10 years; two-thirds of Democratic voters said that.
</P>
<P>
	   TOP ISSUES: Delaware voters said moral values and taxes were the two top
issues in the primary.
</P>
<P>
	   TOP QUALITIES: The top candidate quality for Forbes and McCain supporters
was that their candidate stands up for what he believes. Top candidate qualities
for Bush voters were that he can win in November and that he best represents
conservative values.
</P>
<P>
	   The exit poll results were from interviews of 697 Delaware Republican
primary voters by Voter News Service, a consortium of The Associated Press and
major television networks. The poll had an error margin of plus or minus 5
percentage points, larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Ambassador Condemns Attacks  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lebanon's ambassador to Washington accused Israel on
Tuesday of deliberately targeting civilians in southern Lebanon and appealed to
the Clinton administration to halt the attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said, however, that Israeli airstrikes
were a response to deadly attacks on Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah guerrillas
from Lebanese villages, in violation of a 1996 agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the Israelis have done is to send a very clear signal about the fact
they don't want this to escalate,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   With tensions building, nonetheless, Ambassador Farid Abboud told The
Associated Press ``the resistance'' -- Hezbollah fighters -- is determined to
force Israel to withdraw from its enclave on the Lebanese side of the border.
Hours after the Israeli strikes, Hezbollah militants killed a soldier, the sixth
in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The resistance's motivation is to attack Israel until they leave
Lebanon,'' Abboud said after calling on White House and State Department
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   With Israel carrying out its heaviest bombardment of southern Lebanon in
eight months, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said in Kiryat Shemona, a city in
northern Israel, he would do whatever was necessary to protect Israeli citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Regev, spokesman for the Israeli embassy here, said northern Israel has
been in crisis over the last two days and that hundreds of people had been
evacuated. Those who remained spent nights in bomb shelters, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one should expect Israeli civilians, alone, to pay the price for
Hezbollah terrorism,'' Regev said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Israel had made ``a deliberate and conscious attempt to avoid
hitting targets that will cause civilian casualties.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said she telephoned the Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa,
to try to end the violence. Syria has 30,000 troops in Lebanon and plays a
dominant role there.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are basically saying they are doing what they can,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   While Israel had shelled electric power facilities in Lebanon, Albright
said, ``They want to make sure their message is received.''
</P>
<P>
	   The fighting has dampened already flickering hopes for progress on the
peacemaking front. But Albright said American mediator Dennis Ross would return
to the region next month to try to get Israeli negotiations with Syria and the
Palestinians going again.
</P>
<P>
	   By request, Abboud met at the White House with Bruce Riedel and Rob Malley,
senior advisers to President Clinton on the Middle East, and at the State
Department with Assistant Secretary Edward Walker.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I expressed my government's concern -- grave concern -- for the Israeli
attacks on civilian targets and explained that these were deliberate attacks in
contradiction of law and the April 1996 agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think the Israelis have violated very gravely this agreement
unilaterally, while the Lebanese resistance has limited its attacks to Israeli
and militia targets'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1996 agreement, worked out by then-Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, was designed to shield civilians on both sides of the border from
attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Abboud said five or six Israeli soldiers have been killed in the last 10
days, and that 18 Lebanese civilians were wounded on Monday, about 40 in the
period, overall.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that ``the attacks of the resistance were conducted under the
rules,'' which do not exclude targeting soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, Abboud said, Israel is attacking electrical power stations and
transformers that have nothing to do with Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Mike Hammer said the United States was deeply
concerned about the escalation of violence, regretted loss of life and injury on
all sides as well as damage to civilian infrastructure and disruption of
civilian life.
</P>
<P>
	   But he blamed Hezbollah for the deteriorating situation, saying the
Iranian-backed fighters were trying to create tensions and prevent progress
toward an agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Hammer said the way to defuse the crisis is to work with the Israel-Lebanon
monitoring group, which was established in the 1996 agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cubans: Elian's Mom Was Bullied  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Chipping away at arguments that Elian Gonzalez's dead mother
was seeking freedom for her son in the United States, Cuba on Tuesday described
her as a timid woman bullied by a brutal boyfriend into making the tragic sea
journey.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Driven By Threats and Violence to Tragedy,'' read the headline of a
lengthy article in the Communist Party daily Granma. It offered the government's
version of the relationship between Elian's mother, Elizabeth Brotons, and her
boyfriend, Lazaro Munero.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the latest salvo in a continuing ideological war between Cuba's
communist government, which is fighting to return 6-year-old Elian to Cuba, and
anti-communist Cuban-Americans in Miami, who want the boy to stay in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25 after a boating
accident that took the life of his mother, Munero and nine others. Elian's
father and four grandparents live in Cuba and want him back. But Elian's
relatives in Miami say the boy should stay with them out of respect to his
mother, who died to give her child freedom in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban government and even Brotons' mother, Raquel Rodriguez, have said
Brotons was forced to make the dangerous trip by her boyfriend. U.S. immigration
authorities earlier said that they believed that Munero was an illegal alien
smuggler and had charged most of the passengers for the trip.
</P>
<P>
	   Munero was ``the organizer and the principal person responsible for the
tragedy,'' the Granma article said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The article offered what it said were new details about the lives of Brotons
and Munero. It quoted friends and relatives of the pair, who described Munero as
a man who abused women physically and verbally and whom they believed regularly
beat Brotons. It even cited Munero's uncle, Dagoberto Munero Molina, who said
his nephew ``always treated his own family badly'' and spoke roughly with
Brotons.
</P>
<P>
	   The article said Munero had a criminal history and was convicted in 1993 for
breaking into a hotel room in the resort town of Varadero and stealing $236
worth of belongings from a German tourist.
</P>
<P>
	   Ex-girlfriends, former teachers, the mother of a son Munero had out of
wedlock, fellow students going back to middle school and residents of Munero's
hometown all remembered a person who was constantly in trouble with authorities
and whose past work consisted primarily of selling illegally obtained cigarettes
and liquor. By contrast, they described Brotons as a member of the Young
Communists Union and later the Communist Party of Cuba -- a young woman whose
first boyfriend was Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, whom she met when she
was 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Brotons and Gonzalez divorced in May 1991 after she suffered seven
miscarriages. They remained a couple after the divorce, however. When Brotons
became pregnant an eighth time in 1993, she was able to give birth to Elian. The
baby's name was a combination of both parents' first names.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez and Brotons separated for good three years later. Shortly
thereafter, Brotons began seeing Munero and he moved into the home she shared
with her son and parents.
</P>
<P>
	   In June 1998, Munero left Cuba in a boat for the United States and tried to
make Brotons and her son go with him but she refused, the article said.
</P>
<P>
	   Four months later, Munero returned to Cuba clandestinely and was jailed for
about eight weeks for the illegal trip, the article said. After his release,
Munero returned to Brotons' home but the couple soon moved out because her
parents complained that he was beating their daughter, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, the Washington-based advocacy group Children's Rights Council
said it had filed a brief with the court in Miami in support of the view that
Elian should be sent home because his mother took him out of Cuba without his
father's permission.
</P>
<P>
	   Allowing Elian to stay in the United States would undermine enforcement of
two U.S. laws and an international convention the United States has signed on
child abduction, said the group's president, David L. Levy.

<HEADLINE> Willingboro announces arrests in rash of school threat cases  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WILLINGBORO, N.J. (AP) - Three Willingboro High School students have
been charged in connection with a rash of bomb threats that have plagued the
school this year and disrupted classes, officials announced Tuesday.
<P>
	   The arrests are the second in the 5,400-student district, which has had 10
threats of bombs or other acts of violence since September. Last year, the
Burlington County district had no bomb threats.
</P>
<P>
	   The threats forced the evacuation of the school, leaving students and
faculty standing outside in the cold. Two school days will have to be made up
because of early dismissals.
</P>
<P>
	   "It started getting real crazy," said freshman Sharnaya Robinson, 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "The first time it was funny," said sophomore Charles Hatchett, 17. "Then
later after a while people started getting mad. It wasn't fun after that."
</P>
<P>
	   The latest arrests were made public at a news conference at the high school
by police and school officials, in part, to allay community concerns about
school safety. Nine of the threats were directed at the high school.
</P>
<P>
	   "The message we're trying to get across here is it's not cool," said Public
Safety Director Benjamin Braxton. "This is not a prank."
</P>
<P>
	   The threats were made in warning notes left on the floor inside the school
or taped to locker doors or messages scrawled on blackboards. Some threats were
made from a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
	   Three students - a female and two males - were charged last week in
connection with four bomb threats at the school between Dec. 14 and Jan. 11,
Braxton said. Each was charged with making terroristic threats and making a
false public alarm, he said. Their names were not made public because of their
ages.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, police charged four male teenagers in two other bomb threats at
the school. Braxton said authorities delayed announcing the latest arrests
because of the continuing investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Angry parents and students have complained about inadequate security at the
high school. The township offered a $5,000 reward to solve the bomb threats and
the PTA put up $1,000.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a parent, I was very frustrated," said Carolyn Savoy Williams, who has
two teen-age daughters at the high school. "It was really difficult."
</P>
<P>
	   All seven students charged are under house arrest and face up to two years
in a juvenile detention facility if convicted, Braxton said. One student has
already pleaded guilty and will be sentenced later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   "As far as we're concerned, we want it to go to the maximum," said School
Superintendent Dorothy Dallah. "We cannot afford to have terrorist threats ...
disrupt our school system."
</P>
<P>
	   Dallah blames the threats on the aftermath of the shootings at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo., where 11 students and a teacher were shot to
death by two teen-age killers who took their own lives.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are copycats and there are things students feel they are bound to
do," Dallah said. She said all seven students have been suspended and will face
expulsion hearings. The district will also seek restitution for evacuation
costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the district is stepping up security, adding two enforcement
officers and requiring students to wear ID badges and carry mesh or see-through
backpacks, Dallah said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the school board rejected a proposal by the district's security
chief to spend $400,000 to install metal detectors and a video-surveillance
system.

   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- A South Carolina political consultant and adviser to
Sen. John McCain's Republican presidential campaign denies suggestions he is
racist because of the magazine he edits.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Quinn edits Southern Partisan, a conservative quarterly about the
South.
</P>
<P>
	   It recently interviewed author Clyde Wilson, who said the ``only hope'' for
the United States is ``devolution of power so that the healthier parts of
American society can defend and preserve themselves. Defend themselves from the
federal government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Quinn said he was not involved in the magazine's daily operations, did not
read articles before they are printed and disagreed with ``many of the opinions
expressed by others'' on its pages.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Republic, however, called Quinn a ``neo-Confederate'' and said his
magazine prints the work of ``race-baiters.'' McCain was questioned about Quinn
on network television Sunday and said he would not have hired Quinn to run his
South Carolina campaign if he considered Quinn a racist.
</P>
<P>
	   Quinn accused rival George W. Bush's campaign of spreading The New Republic
article.
</P>
<P>
	   But Tucker Eskew, the Bush campaign's South Carolina spokesman, denied
Quinn's allegation. ``We refuse to drag this race into a discussion about
campaign staffs,'' Eskew said.

	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Riding high from their New Hampshire victories,
Republican Sen. John McCain and Democratic Vice President Al Gore saw huge jumps
Tuesday in their numbers in a New York presidential primary poll.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain more than doubled his numbers after defeating Texas Gov. George W.
Bush in New Hampshire, becoming the choice of 39 percent of likely Republican
voters in the New York primary March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush still led with 48 percent in the Marist College's Institute for Public
Opinion poll. Publisher Steve Forbes came in at 3 percent and 14 percent were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, McCain was preferred by only 15 percent of Republican voters,
compared to Bush's 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Democrats, Vice President Al Gore has opened a substantial lead over
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, the poll said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was favored by 54 percent of likely Democratic voters while Bradley was
favored by 35 percent. Both were in a statistical dead heat in December.
</P>

	   The telephone poll of 944 registered voters was conducted Feb. 2-3 and on
Sunday. The margin of error for the sample of 223 likely Republican voters was

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton has helped raise $2.6 million for
a special Democratic fund created for the New York Senate race, federal records
showed.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton helped raise the funds at about a dozen joint fund-raisers last year
with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, with the proceeds shared
between her Senate campaign account and the DSCC. The Democratic campaign
committee tracks the amounts raised at Clinton's events but is prohibited by law
from specifically earmarking the money to go to the New York race.
</P>
<P>
	   But DSCC officials freely admit they expect to spend heavily in New York and
already have spent about $250,000 on a television advertisement touting the
first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say the funding mechanism, which is legal, lets candidates bypass
campaign donation limits.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the $2.6 million Clinton helped raise for ``New York Senate 2000,''
records show just over $1 million was transferred to her campaign account -- her
share of the joint fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
	   The rest is held by the DSCC, of which only about $1 million can be used to
run ads supporting Clinton's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Republican Senatorial Committee has similar joint fund-raising
agreements with some candidates, but not with New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
Clinton's likely opponent.
</P>
<P>
	   In sum, Clinton has raised $8 million, and Giuliani $11.5 million.

<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush scored a solid victory in
Delaware's presidential primary Tuesday, giving him a much-needed lift into the
next round of contests against chief rival John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think this is a piece of good news that will buoy our supporters,'' the

<HEADLINE> Big Tobacco Fears Fla. Suit Award  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE WILSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- The tobacco industry fears a jury ``award of unprecedented
magnitude'' and plummeting stock values in a landmark smokers' trial now drawing
to a close.
</P>
<P>
	   In an attempt to head off some of the financial consequences of a
multibillion-dollar verdict, the industry asked a state appeals court Monday to
erase a gag order keeping it from commenting on the case.
</P>
<P>
	   With the industry saying a verdict is possible by the end of the month, the
3rd District Court of Appeal agreed to a quick appeal and set arguments on the
gag order for Feb. 23.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry attorneys, who began their defense Monday in the damage phase of
the case, have talked in court about a potential $300 billion award covering as
many as 850,000 Florida smokers.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest jury award in U.S. history was a $4.9 billion verdict last year
against General Motors Corp. for six people burned in a rear-end collision.
</P>
<P>
	   The tobacco appeal warns in strong language about the verdict's impact ``on
the ability of the tobacco manufacturers to continue to conduct business,''
buttressing the view that the verdict could bankrupt some cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
	   The motion noted the same appeals court's decision in October allowing the
jury to even consider a lump-sum punitive damage award cost the defendants,
publicly traded companies, tens of billions of dollars in stock losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to the verdict, the industry motion said, ``As this court is
aware, the stakes in this case are immense.''
</P>
<P>
	   With attorneys, the companies and smokers barred from talking, reporting has
been ``misleading and in critical respects flat-out wrong. ... Errors and
misinformation have spread,'' the motion said.
</P>
<P>
	   The gag order was imposed unilaterally by Circuit Judge Robert Kaye before
opening statements in October 1998, and he has rebuffed repeated industry
attempts to lift the order. The industry attacked the gag order as
unconstitutional and overbroad.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants in the smoking case are: R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Philip
Morris Inc., Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett
Group Inc., the Council for Tobacco Research and the Tobacco Institute.

primary that was closed to all but registered Republicans, exit polls showed.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative Steve Forbes, who spent more than $60 million on two successive
presidential campaigns, appeared headed for a disappointing finish and was sure
to be taking stock of his lagging effort.
</P>
<P>
	   At stake were just 12 of the 2,066 delegates nominating delegates, but Bush
and McCain were seeking a taller reward: Momentum headed into the Feb. 19
primary in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the top three candidates, conservative Alan Keyes was on the
ballot, though he did not campaign here. Gary Bauer, who dropped out of the race
last week, also was listed.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls showed Bush did best among voters who are middle class, elderly,
conservative and believe he is likely to win the presidency. McCain voters
tended to be affluent, well-educated and self-identified independents and
moderates who said they were looking for a candidate who stands up for what he
believes.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, who has pushed for a flat tax since his failed 1996 run, did well
among voters who listed taxes as their top concern. Voters were surveyed as they
left the polling precincts by Voter News Service, a consortium of The Associated
Press and television networks.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victory in New Hampshire erased Bush's lead in South Carolina and
dramatically shrunk his advantage in California, Michigan, New York and national
polls, as he sought to draw new and independent voters into the GOP fold.
</P>
<P>
	   Tremors were even felt in Delaware, where exit polls showed that one-fourth
of McCain supporters did not vote in the 1996 GOP primary. One-third of them
decided to back him in the week since his New Hampshire victory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We never even went there. We didn't spend a penny there,'' McCain said
from South Carolina, calling it ``remarkable'' that Delaware primary voters were
backing him anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the top three candidates, conservative Alan Keyes was on the
ballot, though he did not campaign here. Gary Bauer, who dropped out of the race
last week, also was listed.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to South Carolina, where Forbes is not a factor, Bush and
McCain intensified their rivalry with an exchange of bitterly personal ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor's spot accuses McCain of hypocrisy over his signature
issue of campaign finance reform. McCain says in his new ad that Bush ``twists
the truth like Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The overheated rhetoric underscored what is at stake in upcoming contests.
Despite his financial and organizational advantages, Bush faces a serious threat
from the Arizona senator. And McCain, with just one victory under his belt,
can't afford losses to his party's front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina will test whether McCain is a one-state wonder or a contender
who can foil Bush and his backers in the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won Delaware's primary in 1996 and spent tens of thousands of dollars
to build an organization this time around. Anything short of a strong second
place finish would force him to take stock of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, campaigning to the last at a nursing home, pledged to end
inheritance taxes as part of his flat tax plan. ``You should be allowed to leave
this world unmolested by the IRS,'' he told about 60 senior citizens in a
reception room down the hall from a polling place.
</P>
<P>
	   With little hope in South Carolina, he was flying to Michigan, which has its
Republican primary on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   The Delaware primary yielded the winner only 12 convention delegates, and
perhaps a spurt of momentum heading into South Carolina. Voters had just 28
precinct locations to visit, a fraction of the usual 400 -- a dynamic that
analysts said favored Bush, who is backed by the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   After Delaware and South Carolina, the GOP campaign moves to Feb. 22
primaries in Arizona and Michigan. Bush has campaigned hard in McCain's home
state, and is supported by Arizona Gov. Jane Hull. McCain hasn't ceded any
ground in Michigan, where Bush is backed by Gov. John Engler.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia conducts its primary Feb. 29, and Bush is backed there by Gov.
James Gilmore. More than a dozen states hold primaries or caucuses on March 7,
when the nominee could be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won in Delaware four years ago, gaining 33 percent of the vote to
beat Bob Dole, the eventual nominee. But Forbes was the only GOP candidate to
campaign in Delaware that year, with the others staying away in deference to New
Hampshire's insistence on being the first and only contest in the opening week
of primary competition.
</P>
<P>
	   To avoid a replay in 2000, Delaware Republicans opted out of the state
primary last Saturday to hold a party-run election Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Bill To Strip Belfast's Powers OK'd  </HEADLINE>
   By KRISTIN GAZLAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Lawmakers overwhelmingly passed a bill Tuesday that would
allow the British government to strip Northern Ireland's fledgling
administration of its powers this week -- an emergency measure meant to prevent
its total collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   The 352-11 House of Commons vote came after Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson warned that legislators had no choice following the
Irish Republican Army's refusal to disarm in support of the province's 1998
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   In a last formal step before the bill passed to the upper House of Lords, a
ceremonial final ``reading'' was easily passed. the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
	   The major Protestant party within the power-sharing Cabinet, the Ulster
Unionists, agreed to form the four-party coalition -- which includes the
IRA-linked Sinn Fein -- only on condition that IRA would begin to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   A disarmament commission's report last week said the IRA had made no
concrete commitments, triggering the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson, who transferred considerable responsibilities to the Belfast
administration only two months ago, said in these circumstances it was ``clearly
foreseeable'' that the body ``will simply fall apart'' if powers weren't
immediately taken back.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Tuesday, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams directly appealed to Prime
Minister Tony Blair not to suspend the administration's powers, warning it would
render any start to IRA disarmament impossible.
</P>
<P>
	   As Martin McGuinness, a former IRA commander who is now Sinn Fein's minister
for education in the Cabinet, looked on from the visitors' gallery, Mandelson
said those arguing for the power-sharing Cabinet to continue were offering ``a
false choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   The reality, he said, was ``between pause and bust.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``A pause in the operation of the institutions, far from seeing them lying
in collapse, will preserve the institutions and allow them to be revived at a
later date,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson said he intended to use the bill's powers to resume ``direct
rule'' from London -- the quasi-colonial form of government originally imposed
in Northern Ireland in 1972 -- on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Adams also used a Commons room for a news conference. He, like McGuinness,
is an elected member of British Parliament, but can't take part in debates
because he refuses to take the oath of office, which would require him to pledge
support to Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Good Friday agreement is under the greatest threat so far since it
came into existence,'' Adams said, accusing the British government of backing
``a unilateral deadline'' sought by the Ulster Unionists.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., in Belfast,
Adams sounded exasperated, claiming to have done all he could to win an IRA
commitment to disarm. He wondered ``what role I have to play as a messenger who
continuously gets shot.''
</P>
<P>
	   But others blamed Sinn Fein for not delivering on its end of a bargain
struck in November under the mediation of American diplomat George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
	   In exchange for the Ulster Unionists' accepting Sinn Fein as Cabinet
colleagues, Sinn Fein declared for the first time that disarmament was
``essential,'' and the IRA opened negotiations with the province's 3-year-old
disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The Good Friday accord proposed that the IRA should completely disarm by
May, but specified no starting point. The IRA has never accepted that goal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ulster Unionists plan to ballot grassroots members Saturday on whether
to remain in the Cabinet. If they call for withdrawal, forming a new Cabinet
would prove extremely difficult because it would require a new election in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   Given the rising Protestant hostility to cooperating with Sinn Fein, the
Ulster Unionists -- previously able to command support from only half the
province's Protestants -- would probably suffer further losses.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Cabinet's senior Catholic minister, Seamus Mallon, warned that the
looming suspension could prove permanent.
</P>
<P>
	   He cited his personal experience in Northern Ireland's only previous attempt
to share power between Protestants and Catholics, a Cabinet that collapsed in
1974.
</P>
<P>
	   Politicians back then had hoped that the Cabinet would soon resume
operations, he recalled. ``It was resumed,'' he said. ``It took one quarter of a
century to resume it.''

<HEADLINE> Barak Issues North Israel Warning  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Israelis living near the
Lebanon border huddled in underground shelters or fled south out of rocket range
Tuesday, fearing reprisals by Lebanese guerrillas for the heaviest Israeli
bombardment in eight months.
</P>
<P>
	   In its second straight night of attacks, Israel's air force struck a
Hezbollah offices in the coastal city of Tyre and the guerrilla stronghold of
Iqlim al-Tuffah, 40 miles southeast of Beirut, Lebanese security officials said.
At least two people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli army confirmed the attack late Tuesday and early Wednesday on
Iqlim al-Tuffah, but identified the other target as a Hezbollah radar station.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Ehud Barak ordered a military state of emergency along the
northern border, a sign that Israel was preparing for extended fighting.
Hezbollah guerrillas on Tuesday killed an Israeli soldier -- the sixth in two
weeks -- only hours after Israeli airstrikes cut electricity across parts of
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In all that is connected with the protection of our people, our
settlements and our soldiers, we will do everything required,'' Barak told
residents of Kiryat Shmona who had spent the night in shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli leaders blamed Syria for the latest flare-up and said peace talks
will not resume with Damascus until it ends the wave of Lebanese guerrilla
attacks. Syria is the main power-broker in Lebanon, and Israel says it
encourages the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Lebanon's ambassador accused Israel of deliberately targeting
civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I expressed my government's concern -- grave concern -- for the Israeli
attacks on civilian targets and explained that these were deliberate attacks in
contradiction of law and the April 1996 agreement,'' said Ambassador Farid
Abboud on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   He was referring to a U.S.-brokered understanding that forbids attacks on or
from civilian areas in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said, however, that Israeli airstrikes
were a response to deadly attacks on Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah from Lebanese
villages, in violation of the 1996 agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the Israelis have done is to send a very clear signal about the fact
they don't want this to escalate,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   The airstrikes late Monday and early Tuesday destroyed three power stations
at Jamhour near Beirut, in the northern mountains east of the port city of
Tripoli and in the eastern Bekaa Valley town of Baalbek, a Hezbollah guerrilla
stronghold where a base for the group also was targeted. The base remained
sealed and damage could not be assessed.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifteen civilians were wounded in Baalbek and were treated at hospitals for
various injuries from broken glass, debris and shrapnel. Parts of Lebanon were
left without electricity and severe rationing was imposed.
</P>
<P>
	   The airstrikes were the harshest since a similar strafing by the outgoing
hard-line government, just before Barak took office in July.
</P>
<P>
	   The escalation in attacks on Israeli troops staffing a buffer zone in
Lebanon's south coincided with the collapse in Syrian-Israel peace in
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria wants a prior commitment from Israel that it will withdraw from the
disputed Golan Heights before talks ensue; Israel refuses, and says the
resumption of violence is a crude effort to get Israel to cave in.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak was getting closer to playing his own card against Syria -- a
unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon that would leave Syria without its single
most effective method of pressuring Israel, and would raise uncomfortable
questions about the presence of 30,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we will not reach an agreement (with Syria) in the next two months, I
believe -- I know -- that the Israel government will meet and decide if we will
withdraw unilaterally,'' Cabinet minister Haim Ramon, a Barak confidant, told
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   While such talk could influence a Syria that is eager to end its
international isolation, it will have little influence on the Hezbollah, a
militant group that negates the very existence of the Jewish state. Should a
withdrawal occur -- with or without peace talks -- Hezbollah, seeking to expand
its political influence, would claim credit as the force that drove the
occupiers south.
</P>
<P>
	   With such win-win prospects, the guerrillas showed no sign of holding back.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, their rockets hit an Israeli military outpost at Dabshe, two
miles north of the Israeli border, killing one soldier. A pro-Israeli militiaman
was later wounded in a separate guerrilla attack on the outpost of Bir Kallab in
southern Lebanon. He died later.
</P>
<P>
	   The prospect of the rockets reaching Israel prompted Barak's announcement,
through broadcast media, of a 48-hour state of emergency. Residents who stayed
north were required to spend the night in shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   Many headed south rather than face another night in the bowels of their
apartment buildings. Rachel Ben-Sultan, surrounded by four bulging suitcases at
the Kiryat Shmona bus station, said she was fed up with repeated emergencies
after 43 years in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If these attacks go on intensively, we will leave, we will go to a place
that has peace and quiet,'' she said before boarding a bus to stay with her
daughter in a town several miles southwest. ``We cannot go on like this.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Wins Delaware Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush won Delaware's
presidential primary Tuesday and earned a badly needed lift into the next stage
of contests, even as chief rival John McCain burnished his insurgent campaign
with a solid finish in a state he ignored.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think this is a piece of good news that will buoy our supporters,'' the
Texas governor told The Associated Press after securing the state's 12
delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain gloated over exit polls indicating a strong showing despite his
decision to focus on the critical Feb. 19 primary in South Carolina at the
expense of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's really got to be remarkable to get these kinds of numbers in a
primary in which you didn't even appear in the state,'' the Arizona senator told
reporters. ``We never even went there. We didn't spend a penny there.''
</P>
<P>
	   The results were based on surveys of voters as they left polling precincts
by Voter News Service, a consortium of The Associated Press and television
networks.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain attributed his totals to the momentum generated by his shellacking of
Bush in New Hampshire's leadoff primary last week. Exit polls in Delaware
supported his theory: Almost half of his supporters decided to vote for him in
the week since New Hampshire. Scores of new voters backed McCain in a primary
that was closed to all but registered Republicans, exit polls showed.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative Steve Forbes, who spent more than $60 million on two successive
presidential campaigns, appeared headed for a disappointing finish and was sure
to be taking stock of his lagging effort.
</P>
<P>
	   At stake were just a dozen of the 2,066 delegates nominating delegates, but
Bush and McCain were seeking a taller reward: A lift headed into South Carolina.
Bush couldn't afford another loss, and McCain hoped to add to his momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the top three candidates, conservative Alan Keyes was on the
ballot, though he did not campaign here. Gary Bauer, who dropped out of the race
last week, also was listed.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls showed Bush did best among voters who are middle class, elderly,
conservative and believe he is likely to win the presidency. McCain voters
tended to be affluent, well-educated and self-identified independents and
moderates who said they were looking for a candidate who stands up for what he
believes.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, who has pushed for a flat tax since his failed 1996 run, did well
among voters who listed taxes as their top concern.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victory in New Hampshire erased Bush's lead in South Carolina and
dramatically shrunk his advantage in California, Michigan, New York and national
polls, as he sought to draw new and independent voters into the GOP fold.
</P>
<P>
	   Tremors were even felt in Delaware, where exit polls showed that one-fourth
of McCain supporters did not vote in the 1996 GOP primary. One-third of them
decided to back him in the week since his New Hampshire victory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We never even went there. We didn't spend a penny there,'' McCain said
from South Carolina, calling it ``remarkable'' that Delaware primary voters were
backing him anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the top three candidates, conservative Alan Keyes was on the
ballot, though he did not campaign here. Gary Bauer, who dropped out of the race
last week, also was listed.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to South Carolina, where Forbes is not a factor, Bush and
McCain intensified their rivalry with an exchange of bitterly personal ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor's spot accuses McCain of hypocrisy over his signature
issue of campaign finance reform. McCain says in his new ad that Bush ``twists
the truth like Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The overheated rhetoric underscored what is at stake in upcoming contests.
Despite his financial and organizational advantages, Bush faces a serious threat
from the Arizona senator. And McCain, with just one victory under his belt,
can't afford losses to his party's front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina will test whether McCain is a one-state wonder or a contender
who can foil Bush and his backers in the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won Delaware's primary in 1996 and spent tens of thousands of dollars
to build an organization this time around. Anything short of a strong second
place finish would force him to take stock of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, campaigning to the last at a nursing home, pledged to end
inheritance taxes as part of his flat tax plan. ``You should be allowed to leave
this world unmolested by the IRS,'' he told about 60 senior citizens in a
reception room down the hall from a polling place.
</P>
<P>
	   With little hope in South Carolina, he was flying to Michigan, which has its
Republican primary on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   The Delaware primary yielded the winner only 12 convention delegates, and
perhaps a spurt of momentum heading into South Carolina. Voters had just 28
precinct locations to visit, a fraction of the usual 400 -- a dynamic that
analysts said favored Bush, who is backed by the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   After Delaware and South Carolina, the GOP campaign moves to Feb. 22
primaries in Arizona and Michigan. Bush has campaigned hard in McCain's home
state, and is supported by Arizona Gov. Jane Hull. McCain hasn't ceded any
ground in Michigan, where Bush is backed by Gov. John Engler.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia conducts its primary Feb. 29, and Bush is backed there by Gov.
James Gilmore. More than a dozen states hold primaries or caucuses on March 7,
when the nominee could be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won in Delaware four years ago, gaining 33 percent of the vote to
beat Bob Dole, the eventual nominee. But Forbes was the only GOP candidate to
campaign in Delaware that year, with the others staying away in deference to New
Hampshire's insistence on being the first and only contest in the opening week
of primary competition.
</P>
<P>
	   To avoid a replay in 2000, Delaware Republicans opted out of the state
primary last Saturday to hold a party-run election Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Planes Collide in Ill., 3 Dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZION, Ill. (AP) -- Two small planes collided over a hospital parking lot
Tuesday, killing three people, including a popular radio show host.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Collins, the host of Chicago's top-rated morning program for the past
decade, was in a plane that crashed onto the hospital's roof, said WGN-AM
spokeswoman Debbie Linch. The other person on the plane, who was not identified,
was also killed.
</P>
<P>
	   The other plane, a four-seat Cessna 172, crashed into a nearby street,
killing the one person on board, said Zion Fire Chief David LaBelle.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins had been at WGN-AM since 1974. He co-owned the plane that crashed on
the hopsital roof.
</P>
<P>
	   The impact blew the windows out of the top floor of Midwestern Regional
Medical Center. Two hospital workers were slightly burned and the hospital was
evacuated, said hospital president Roger Cary.
</P>
<P>
	   Les Mussared said he was standing in a parking lot near the hospital when
the planes crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I looked up because I heard a gurgling noise. I saw two small planes
collide in the air -- they pulled away from each other,'' Mussared said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cessna was registered to ATE of New York, a flying school. A message to
the company's office in Chicago was not returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Preliminary reports indicated both planes were approaching the Waukegan
Airport, near the site of the collision.
</P>
<P>
	   Zion is about 45 miles north of downtown Chicago, near the
Illinois-Wisconsin line.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The Secret Service on Tuesday denied having advised the
University of Texas to cancel a visit by former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger this month because of threats to public safety.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We make recommendations directly to the protectee. It would not be our
place to make a recommendation to the general public not to attend a particular
function,'' said R.L. Smith, head of the Secret Service in Austin.
</P>
<P>
	   The University of Texas canceled Kissinger's visit, scheduled for Feb. 1,
citing ``analysis and advice of security agencies, including the U.S. Secret
Service and the UT Austin Police.''
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said university officials likely misinterpreted the cancellation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was no grave national emergency,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
	   Students and faculty members who belong to groups that had planned a series
of protests around Kissinger's visit said the university overeacted to their
plans and attributed the cancellation to the Secret Service.

<HEADLINE> Electability Helps Bush in Del.  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE MOKRZYCKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Perceived electability in November vaulted George W. Bush to victory Tuesday
in Delaware's Republican presidential primary, but voters admiring John McCain
for his prisoner-of-war ordeal helped him run strongly, an exit poll found.
</P>
<P>
	   Six in 10 voters said Bush would be most likely to beat the Democratic
nominee, and nearly three-quarters of them favored the Texas governor. McCain --
with momentum from his 18-point victory over Bush in the Feb. 1 New Hampshire
primary -- did at least as well among the 1 in 4 who said he was more electable.
</P>
<P>
	   Only about 5 percent said Steve Forbes would be most likely to win in
November, according to preliminary results from a Voter News Service exit poll
for The Associated Press and television networks.
</P>
<P>
	   Roughly 10 percent of voters said the most important candidate quality was
that he can win in November, and nearly all of them voted for Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert French, 68, of Lewes, said he backed Bush because ``I think he's the
candidate that can get elected, and he has all the right philosophies as far as
I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won the 1996 GOP primary in Delaware with 33 percent of the vote, but
nobody else campaigned there that year.
</P>
<P>
	   Among GOP primary voters who said they supported Forbes four years ago, half
chose other candidates, the exit poll found.
</P>
<P>
	   Half of voters said McCain's military record -- he spent 5 1/2 years as a
prisoner of war in Vietnam -- was important to their vote. McCain won two-thirds
of those who said it was very important and a third of those who said it was
somewhat important.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also did well among voters who said it was important that a candidate
stands up for what he believes.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia Parson, 65, of Lewes, supported McCain because of his military
background and personal qualities, adding: ``We've had so many criminals in
Washington and I don't want any more.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes gained his strongest support among voters concerned about taxes.
About a quarter called taxes the most important issue in their vote, and half of
them backed Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm all in favor of eliminating the IRS with a flat tax,'' said Forbes
voter Edward Jackson, 69, of Millsboro, citing a key promise of the Forbes
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush got a majority of the voters who said the next president should
make cutting taxes a higher priority, 4 in 10 preferred greater emphasis on
strengthening Social Security, and McCain ran even with Bush among them. McCain
has focused more on the retirement system than tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush lost some support among the 1 in 4 who said he doesn't have the
knowledge to serve effectively as president. More than half of those voters
chose McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike the New Hampshire primaries, in which voters not registered as either
Democrats or Republicans could choose which contest to vote in, Delaware's
contests were open only to party members. Bush got a majority of the 4 in 5
voters who called themselves Republicans, better than in New Hampshire. McCain
gained nearly half of the self-described independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Self-described independents made up 41 percent of New Hampshire GOP primary
voters, and McCain won 63 percent of them there. Independents also are likely to
be an important factor in South Carolina, where the GOP primary Feb. 19 also is
open to Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Voter News Service conducted the exit poll among 697 Delaware Republican
primary voters for The Associated Press and television networks. Margin of error
due to sampling is plus or minus 5 percentage points, larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Squabble Over Trust  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush and John McCain questioned each
other's trustworthiness Tuesday in new disputes that threatened to overshadow
any other topic in the Republican presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain released a new ad that says one of Bush's commercials ``twists the
truth like Clinton.'' Bush responded with a commercial taking aim at McCain's
core message -- campaign finance reform -- and saying the senator ``solicits
money from lobbyists with interests before his committee and pressures agencies
on behalf of contributors.''
</P>
<P>
	   The hot words flew as Bush got a much-needed lift over McCain's insurgent
candidacy with an easy victory in Delaware's Republican primary. McCain did not
campaign in Delaware, bypassing it to campaign in South Carolina and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor said he had a record of reform and McCain was not the
political maverick he claimed, repeatedly referring to the senator as ``the
chairman'' and saying that as head of the Senate's Commerce Committee and as a
campaigner he ``tends to say one thing and do another.''
</P>
<P>
	   The latest example, Bush said, was McCain's statement a day earlier that he
had always opposed public funding of elections. The Bush campaign offered a list
of five McCain votes from 1990 to 1993 in favor of a bill that proposed partial
public funding of Senate campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain voted not once, not twice, but five times to support
publicly funded congressional campaigns,'' Bush told reporters after speaking to
a cheering student crowd at North Greenville College.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, campaigning in South Carolina, said he couldn't recall whether he
had ever voted for public funding of federal campaigns, but that he was
philosophically opposed to the idea ``because of my view that my tax dollars
should not be used to subsidize the campaigns of another candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   His spokesman, Howard Opinsky, said: ``This is the same old Washington
Clintonian politics that voters have become so cynical about, trying to twist
John McCain's 17-year record of reform and consistent opposition to public
financing to Governor Bush's advantage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Opinsky said all of the votes were against cloture motions -- that is,
voting to continue debate -- to keep opponents from stifling campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
	   In Columbia, meanwhile, McCain announced a plan to fight crime and drugs,
but the event was all but buried by questions from reporters about his disputes
with Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, the former Vietnam prisoner of war, said he was offended by a Bush
ally who questioned his commitment to veterans -- a comment McCain said was
``beyond the pale'' -- as well as by aggressive new Bush ads. He noted that he
and Bush had shaken hands just weeks ago and agreed not to air negative ads
against each other.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe it is not trustworthy when someone shakes your hand and says
they're not going to run a negative ad, and then runs a negative ad,'' he said
aboard his bus.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've already got somebody in the Oval Office who is not trustworthy,'' he
said. He went even further in a new TV ad that says one of Bush's ads ``twists
the truth like Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
	   The charges and countercharges come as Bush and McCain court veterans, who
along with active-duty military make up a substantial portion of the GOP
electorate here. The state primary is Feb. 19, and Bush views the state as his
political ``firewall'' to stop McCain's momentum after the New Hampshire
primary.

<HEADLINE> Victim families say movie glorifies "cold-blooded murderer"  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PATERSON, N.J. (AP) - "The Hurricane," the film that dramatizes the
wrongful murder convictions of boxer Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, deliberately
distorts the truth to make a "hero out of a cold-blooded murderer," relatives of
the 1966 victims said Tuesday.
<P>
	   The award-winning film created a racist detective out to get Carter who
didn't exist and ignored eyewitness statements that placed Carter's car with two
bullets at the crime scene, the victims' family members said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They fabricated the facts to make money and made a hero out of a
cold-blooded murderer," said Barbara Burns, the daughter of Hazel Tanis, one of
three people gunned down inside the Lafayette Bar &AMP; Grill here.
</P>
<P>
	   The remarks by the relatives of victims and of police officers who
investigated the crimes are the latest in a storm of criticism over the film,
which was released in January and won a Golden Globe for Denzel Washington's
portrayal of Carter.
</P>
<P>
	   New York Times reporter Selwyn Raab, who reported on the overturning of
Carter's first conviction, wrote an article criticizing the film's creation of
the fictional Vincent Della Pesca, who fabricated evidence in the movie to
convict Carter.
</P>
<P>
	   The film's producers, who have admitted changing some details of the story
to save time, recently took out ads in Hollywood trade publications to refute
charges that the movie is a gross distortion.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Tuesday, the producers said, "An educated review of the facts
clearly indicate that an innocent man spent 19 years in jail for murders he did
not commit."
</P>
<P>
	   "We are disappointed that Rubin Carter, and the wonderful people who worked
so hard to free him, have to once again be exposed to the misinformation that
convicted him in the first place."
</P>
<P>
	   Carter's lawyers planned a news conference on Wednesday to address the
family members' charges. Carter, who lives in Toronto, was on a speaking tour
and unavailable for comment, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter, a former middleweight contender, and John Artis were convicted in
1967 of the 1966 killings of bartender Jim Oliver and patrons Tanis and Fred
Nauyoks.
</P>
<P>
	   Their convictions were overturned in 1975 after two eyewitnesses recanted
their testimony. Carter and Artis were convicted a second time in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge freed Carter in 1985, ruling that the prosecutors improperly
presented an argument that Carter was out for racial revenge in the killings.
Prosecutors decided not to retry him after the decision was upheld by the U.S.
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Victims' relatives pointed out that no court ruled that Carter was innocent
of the killings and said the film changed details of the killings to glorify
Carter.
</P>
<P>
	   The film ignored statements by eyewitnesses that Carter's car was at the
scene and contained bullets from the murder weapon, said James DeSimone, whose
father, Detective Lt. Vincent DeSimone, was a chief investigator in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   DeSimone read a statement Tuesday written by eyewitness Patty Valentine that
said she was positive she saw Carter's car outside the bar.
</P>
<P>
	   "I got a good, clear look at it," Valentine's statement said. "There is
absolutely no doubt in my mind that it was Rubin Carter's car."
</P>
<P>
	   DeSimone also said he believed the Della Pesca character was loosely based
on his father, a portrayal he called offensive and false.
</P>
<P>
	   Executive producer Rudy Langlais said Tuesday the Della Pesca character was
a composite meant to represent a number of law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Wice, a Drew University professor who has written a book about the
Carter case, said the identifications of Carter's car and bullets from the
murder weapon have never been conclusive. He also said the film contained a lot
of discrepancies, particularly the omission of Carter's second trial and the
implication that he was sent to jail as an adult for juvenile crimes, when in
fact he was convicted of several muggings.
</P>
<P>
	   "They just screwed up so many things," Wice said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, relatives say the movie has reopened wounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter "has continued to mask the truth and elicit sympathy as well as a
profitable living off the blood of our loved ones," said Tom Vicedomini, Fred
Nauyoks' grandson.
</P>
<P>
	   Relatives were particularly offended by Washington's praise of Carter at his
Golden Globe win and a recent interview Carter did with a Toronto television
station in which he states that he can't be sure the three murders ever
occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   The worst part for me is the influence it has on the young people ... who
look at him as a hero," said Barbara Burns, 55, of Flanders. "I think the real
truth would be much more interesting."

<HEADLINE> Cops Nab Robber at Boeing Factory  </HEADLINE>
   By LUIS CABRERA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EVERETT, Wash. (AP) -- A bank robbery suspect fleeing police hid out inside
an enormous Boeing Co. jet factory for 10 hours Tuesday before officers who
searched the maze of catwalks and tunnels found him in a crawl space, disguised
as an employee in hard hat and coveralls.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspect crashed a stolen car on a freeway near the factory around 2 a.m.
and ran inside the plant, which is considered the world's largest building in
terms of volume. Boeing 747, 767 and 777 jets are assembled there.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing evacuated much of the factory and told some workers to stay home,
shutting down nearly all production.
</P>
<P>
	   Police found the man in blue coveralls and a white hard hat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He came off an elevator, made eye contact with an officer, then the
suspect went back up in the elevator'' and hid in a second-floor attic crawl
space, police Sgt. Boyd Bryant said. A police dog found him.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspect, a 21-year-old with six felony convictions, was jailed on
charges of robbing a Wells Fargo Bank of an unspecified amount of cash and
eluding police, county sheriff's spokeswoman Jan Jorgensen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspect's name was not released. He also faces charges of burglary in
entering the Boeing plant and theft in connection with the vehicle, Jorgensen
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The factory 25 miles north of Seattle covers 98 acres. It contains overhead
cranes and nine work stations where aircraft are assembled. It is so big that
workers use bicycles to get around.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are a billion places to hide in there,'' said Gary Arnold, an
assembly inspector for 747s. ``Whatever you can think of is there -- an
underground tunnel system, a catwalk system, all of the utility access, inside
airplanes, airplane parts.''
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing said 2,000 to 3,000 workers are typically in the plant during the
graveyard shift and about 10,000 on weekday shifts. Total employment at the
complex is about 20,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The plant resumed production after the arrest.

<HEADLINE> First Synod Held in Holy Land  </HEADLINE>
   By JACK KATZENELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) -- The first synod ever held by the Catholic
churches in the Holy Land opened Tuesday amid uncertainty about the future of
the Christian minority in a predominantly Muslim region.
</P>
<P>
	   Over 300 bishops, priests, nuns and laymen gathered in Bethlehem, the
birthplace of Jesus, to discuss spiritual issues and how to prevent the decline
in the numbers of Christians due to emigration and concern about their future in
a changing Middle East.
</P>
<P>
	   The participants were from Israel, the Palestinian areas, Jordan and Cyprus
and represented the Greek, Maronite, Syrian, Armenian and Chaldean Catholic
churches, as well as the Roman Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
	   Ibrahim Deabis, a Palestinian and principle of St. Dimitri's School in
Jerusalem, said the Christian population of the city has dropped from over
40,000 in 1948 to a mere 5-7,000, due to emigration and a low birthrate.
</P>
<P>
	   This he attributed to a feeling of insecurity. ``To the Jews, the Israelis,
we are Arabs, but for the Muslims we are Christians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Relations with the Muslim majority under the Palestinian Authority have so
far been good, Deabis said, but only laws guaranteeing the rights of the
Christians could remove apprehensions about the future.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need laws, not just speeches, so that we will not be at the mercy of
changing moods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican representative, Monsignor Claudio Guggerotti, praised the ethnic
diversity of the Catholic churches in the Middle East as ``a great richness,''
but he warned them that their only hope of stemming the decline in the numbers
of their flock lay in combining their resources.

<HEADLINE> White Ex-Cop Cleared of Charges  </HEADLINE>
   By KRISTEN HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A white former police officer suspected of writing a Web
page hostile toward to blacks was cleared Tuesday in the shooting death of a
black motorist during a chase in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeffrey Cooperstein, 44, was acquitted of homicide and aggravated assault
after a jury deliberated for eight hours over two days in Allegheny County
Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Cooperstein had said he feared the motorist, Deron Grimmitt, 32, would run
him over.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Grimmitt was shot through the driver's side window, not
head-on as might be expected if he were driving toward the officer. However, an
FBI firearms instructor testified that the bullet's path doesn't implicate
Cooperstein because he had to fire until he was sure the threat was gone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a victory in the legal sense of the word, but there's no victory
when a man has lost his life,'' Cooperstein said. There's not a day in my life I
don't wonder what would have happened if I could have talked five minutes to
him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Ed Borkowski had contended that Cooperstein was the Blue Knight,
the pen name of whoever posted writings on an Internet site that was critical of
police management and hostile toward blacks. Cooperstein has declined to say
whether he is the Blue Knight, and in closing arguments, defense attorney Samuel
Reich said ``so what'' about testimony that Cooperstein admitted being the Blue
Knight.
</P>
<P>
	   Grimmitt's relatives were silent in court after the verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Grimmitt's mother, Bettye, said it was ``open season on young black
men.'' She said Cooperstein, whom she has sued, ``will answer to God on that
Judgment Day, and I am glad there is a higher power.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cooperstein said he did not know Grimmitt was black when he encountered the
car at 3:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   An officer had followed Grimmitt to see why he had slowed down to watch
police question suspects on a nearby street. Grimmitt, who was wanted on a
parole violation, fled because he did not want to be jailed at Christmas, said
Curtis Grimmitt, his brother.
</P>
<P>
	   Police officers testified that during the chase, Grimmitt's car crossed the
center line of a street and was bearing down on Cooperstein. Curtis Grimmitt
said his brother stayed in the right lane, opposite from Cooperstein and his
parked cruiser.
</P>
<P>
	   Cooperstein also was acquitted of assault against Curtis Grimmitt.
</P>
<P>
	   Cooperstein was fired after the shooting. Marshall Hynes, president of the
Pittsburgh lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, said the union will continue
fighting to have him reinstated.

<HEADLINE> Couple Offers $100K to Egg Donor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A pair of would-be parents has placed an ad offering
$100,000 for the eggs of a bright, young, white athlete -- possibly the highest
offer yet made for such a service.
</P>
<P>
	   Their asking price has raised ethical questions even for advocates of
high-tech reproductive medicine, who say giving eggs should be about helping
others, not making a big cash payoff.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple's half-page advertisement, which ran this week in Stanford
University's student newspaper, specified that the woman be under 30 and an
athlete "of proven college-level ability."
</P>
<P>
	   The highest known price before was $50,000, offered through an ad last year
in a number of Ivy League college papers.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad was placed by Families 2000, a donor-recruiting service based in
Southern California. The service did not return phone calls seeking comment
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Fertility doctors and medical ethicists say the high-priced offer --
designed to attract a premium candidate -- may actually backfire and attract a
dishonest and risky donor. Most donors are paid around $4,000 for the process,
which entails six weeks on hormone drugs, followed by invasive surgery to
harvest 12 to 15 eggs.

<HEADLINE> Bush Wins Delaware Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush won Delaware's
presidential primary Tuesday and earned a badly needed lift into a Southern
showdown, even as chief rival John McCain burnished his insurgent candidacy with
a solid finish in a state where he did not campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think this is a piece of good news that will buoy our supporters,'' the
Texas governor told The Associated Press after securing the state's 12
delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who skipped Delaware to focus on the critical Feb. 19 primary in
South Carolina, attributed his totals to the momentum generated by his
shellacking of Bush in New Hampshire's leadoff primary last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's bound to give us a boost,'' McCain told The AP. ``I think there are
some good signs for us, but I think we still have a long, long way to go. I'm
still the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
	   With 18 of 28 precincts reporting, the Texas governor had 50 percent of the
votes and McCain 25 percent. Conservative Steve Forbes had a disappointing 20
percent after winning the state's primary in 1996 and campaigning heavily in the
state this year. He will be under pressure to pull out of the race.
</P>
<P>
	   Former ambassador Alan Keyes had just 4 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in Delaware suggested McCain benefited from a wave of post-New
Hampshire publicity: Almost half of his supporters decided to vote for him in
the week since that primary. And a quarter of his backers were new voters who
didn't vote in the 1996 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   At stake were just a dozen of the 2,066 delegates nominating delegates, but
Bush and McCain were seeking a taller reward: A lift headed into South Carolina.
Bush couldn't afford another loss, and McCain hoped to add to his momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls showed Bush did best among voters who are middle class, elderly,
conservative and believe he is likely to win the presidency. McCain voters
tended to be affluent, well-educated and self-identified independents and
moderates who said they were looking for a candidate who stands up for what he
believes.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, who has pushed for a flat tax since his failed 1996 run, did well
among voters who listed taxes as their top concern.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victory in New Hampshire erased Bush's lead in South Carolina and
dramatically shrunk his advantage in California, Michigan, New York and national
polls, as he sought to draw new and independent voters into the GOP fold.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to South Carolina, where Forbes is not a factor, Bush and
McCain intensified their rivalry with an exchange of bitterly personal ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor's spot accuses McCain of hypocrisy over his signature
issue of campaign finance reform. McCain says in his new ad that Bush ``twists
the truth like Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The overheated rhetoric underscored what is at stake in upcoming contests.
Despite his financial and organizational advantages, Bush faces a serious threat
from the Arizona senator. And McCain, with just one victory under his belt,
can't afford losses to his party's front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina will test whether McCain is a one-state wonder or a contender
who can foil Bush and his backers in the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won Delaware's primary in 1996 and spent tens of thousands of dollars
to build an organization this time around. Anything short of a strong second
place finish would force him to take stock of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, campaigning to the last at a nursing home, pledged to end
inheritance taxes as part of his flat tax plan. ``You should be allowed to leave
this world unmolested by the IRS,'' he told about 60 senior citizens in a
reception room down the hall from a polling place.
</P>
<P>
	   With little hope in South Carolina, he was flying to Michigan, which has its
Republican primary on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   The Delaware primary yielded the winner only 12 convention delegates, and
perhaps a spurt of momentum heading into South Carolina. Voters had just 28
precinct locations to visit, a fraction of the usual 400 -- a dynamic that
analysts said favored Bush, who is backed by the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   After Delaware and South Carolina, the GOP campaign moves to Feb. 22
primaries in Arizona and Michigan. Bush has campaigned hard in McCain's home
state, and is supported by Arizona Gov. Jane Hull. McCain hasn't ceded any
ground in Michigan, where Bush is backed by Gov. John Engler.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia conducts its primary Feb. 29, and Bush is backed there by Gov.
James Gilmore. More than a dozen states hold primaries or caucuses on March 7,
when the nominee could be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won in Delaware four years ago, gaining 33 percent of the vote to
beat Bob Dole, the eventual nominee. But Forbes was the only GOP candidate to
campaign in Delaware that year, with the others staying away in deference to New
Hampshire's insistence on being the first and only contest in the opening week
of primary competition.
</P>
<P>
	   To avoid a replay in 2000, Delaware Republicans opted out of the state
primary last Saturday to hold a party-run election Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Hazardous Pull Toys Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 3,400 children's pull toys are being recalled
because some of their smaller parts could pose a choking hazard to young
children.
</P>
<P>
	   Manhattan Group LLC of Minneapolis and the Consumer Product Safety
Commission are recalling the toys, which were sold nationwide between July and
December 1999 for around $20 each.
</P>
<P>
	   Enchanted Garden Inchworm, item No. EG150, has two red, two blue and two
yellow round fabric sections sewn together. Merry Meadows Cow, item No. FS150,
is made of white plush fabric, with black spots sewn on. Sunny Safari Blue
Elephant, item No. SS150, is light blue with royal blue fabric on the tail, feet
and ears.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue are the wooden pegs and wheels attached to the toys, which may come
off and cause younger children to choke if they swallow them. There have been no
reports of injuries linked to the product.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers should immediately take the toys away from young children and
return them to the stores where they were purchased for refund or exchange for
another soft toy.
</P>
<P>
	   For more information about the recall, consumers can contact Manhattan Group
at 1-800-541-1345 between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. EST Monday through Friday.

<HEADLINE> Doctor who admitted drug use says he was a tour doctor for Michael  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A doctor who admitted he was high on drugs during
surgeries early in his career said Tuesday he has a flourishing second act,
earning $900,000 the last two years and working a few weeks as Michael Jackson's
tour doctor.
<P>
	   Dr. Neil Ratner told a jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan that he
served as the doctor in South Africa for a few weeks of the entertainer's
HIStory World Tour in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   He was testifying as a government witness against Dr. Niels Lauersen, a
prominent fertility doctor accused of cheating insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "Would you give Michael Jackson drugs?" asked Theodore D. Wells, lawyer for
the Park Avenue obstetrician and gynecologist.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am not going to discuss a patient's personal medical condition," Ratner
answered.
</P>
<P>
	   Wells sought to make a larger issue of Ratner's role as tour doctor,
pleading with Judge William H. Pauley at a conference out of the jury's presence
to let him question Ratner about any treatment of Jackson.
</P>
<P>
	   Wells noted that Ratner used drugs from 1967 until 1989 and treated patients
while under the influence of narcotics, yet has managed to make $900,000 as a
doctor since admitting his role in the insurance fraud in May 1998 in a plea
bargain.
</P>
<P>
	   "His income continues to be extraordinarily high, he continues to travel all
around the world, including administering drugs - which I know to be the truth -
to Michael Jackson," Wells said.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said he did not see the value of adding a celebrity's name to the
trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "Because, your honor, this man is an anesthesiologist," Wells said. "This
man is in Europe and he will say, 'Yes, administering drugs to Michael
Jackson."'
</P>
<P>
	   Wells added: "I want to explore the implication. I think what he is doing is
illegal."
</P>
<P>
	   The judge did allow Wells to ask a few general questions related to Jackson
but not any which would reveal Jackson's medical history.
</P>
<P>
	   Wells then asked Ratner in front of the jury if he ever administered
narcotics to anyone on the Jackson tour.
</P>
<P>
	   "No," Ratner said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Drugs?" Wells asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "What is your definition of drugs?" Ratner asked Wells.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're the anesthesiologist. You give me one," Wells shot back, drawing an
objection that was sustained.
</P>
<P>
	   Wells attempted once more to ask if Ratner administered drugs on the tour
and was told by the doctor that he occasionally administered medical treatment
to people on the tour.
</P>
<P>
	   When Wells was finished, a prosecutor asked Ratner if he had ever
administered drugs to anyone illegally or taken them himself since completing
drug rehabilitation in 1989. He said he had not.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Wolf, Jackson's Los Angeles-based litigation counsel, said Well's
claims regarding Jackson were "outrageous."
</P>
<P>
	   "We would deny that Dr. Ratner ever prescribed any inappropriate medication
or treatment to our client," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ratner's medical career appeared in jeopardy since he began testifying in
the case last week.
</P>
<P>
	   He acknowledged that he might face punishment for his admissions on the
witness stand.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know if I'll be allowed to continue practicing medicine," he
testified.
</P>
<P>
	   John Signor, a New York State Board of Health spokesman, said a full
investigation into Ratner's conduct was underway and "swift and aggressive
action" was likely if any wrongdoing was found.
</P>
<P>
	   "The comissioner has made it clear this department is not going to tolerate
medical misconduct. We've contacted the U.S. attorney's office and the FBI to
get information regarding his admissions while on the stand," Signor said.
</P>
<P>
	   He criticized federal authorities for not alerting the state about Ratner
before the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "We would have hoped that if the feds believed him to be a public health
threat that they would have notified us so we could take appropriate action. In
this case, that wasn't done," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors in New York State are licensed by the State Education Department,
but the health department regulates hospitals and nursing homes and investigates
complaints of medical misconduct, punishing when necessary.

<HEADLINE> Doller Rises; Japanese Stocks Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen early Wednesday amid
new signs of strength in the U.S. economy. Japanese stocks rose moderately.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 109.42 yen, up 0.08 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and
also above its late New York level of 109.35 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 96.21 points, or 0.48
percent, to 19,965.09 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Tuesday, the
average closed down 76.55 points, or 0.38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar met some profit-taking in early Asian
trading, but many players were still expecting the greenback's strength against
the yen to continue.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar had gained ground in New York, where the currency was lifted by
new signs of a vigorous U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Labor Department said Tuesday that productivity -- defined as the
amount of output for each hour of work -- rose by a larger-than-expected 5
percent annual rate in the final three months of last year, helping offset
pricing pressures.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar fell to 109.33 yen at one point Wednesday on selling spurred by a
market rumor that Japan's Economic Planning Agency would revise upward gross
domestic product for the July-September quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   But the agency announced later that revised real GDP contracted 1.0 percent
in the period, unchanged from the preliminary figure.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 108.28 yen, up from 107.22 yen
late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices rebounded moderately following gains in New
York, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.81 to 10,957.60 at
Tuesday's close. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 105.73 to 4,427.50, finishing
at a record high for the third straight session.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo investors were also encouraged by a series of recent launches of
investment trust funds, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 11.42 points, or 0.66 percent, to 1,748.97. The TOPIX closed down
17.23 points, or 0.98 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.8850
percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.9000 percent. Its price rose 0.13 point to
98.43.

<HEADLINE> Planes Collide in Ill., 3 Dead  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAUN TANDON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZION, Ill. (AP) -- Two small planes collided over a hospital parking lot
Tuesday, killing three people, including a popular radio show host.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Collins, the host of Chicago's top-rated morning program for the past
decade, was in a plane that crashed onto the hospital's roof, said WGN-AM
spokeswoman Debbie Linch. The other person on the plane, who was not identified,
was also killed.
</P>
<P>
	   The other plane, a four-seat Cessna 172, crashed into a nearby street,
killing the one person on board, said Zion Fire Chief David LaBelle.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins, 57, had been at WGN-AM since 1974. He co-owned the plane that
crashed on the hospital roof, a two seat aerobatic craft flown for sport.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were just talking this morning about how safe flying is,'' said Tom
Peterson, WGN-AM's news director and the news anchor on Collins' show.
</P>
<P>
	   Spike O'Dell, an afternoon personality on WGN, who was on the air when
Collins' death was confirmed, said: ``Uncle Bobby's gone.''
</P>
<P>
	   The impact of the crash blew the windows out of the top floor of Midwestern
Regional Medical Center. Two hospital workers were slightly burned and the
hospital was evacuated, said hospital president Roger Cary.
</P>
<P>
	   Les Mussared said he was standing in a parking lot near the hospital when
the planes crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I looked up because I heard a gurgling noise. I saw two small planes
collide in the air -- they pulled away from each other,'' Mussared said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cessna was registered to ATE of New York, a flying school. A message to
the company's office in Chicago was not returned.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Arizona company is recalling 1,600 collectible items --
lighted glass panels etched with images of race cars -- because their florescent
lights pose a fire hazard.
</P>
<P>
	   Action Performance Companies Inc. of Phoenix described the items as
illuminated race car panels set into black plastic bases. Race cars are etched
into glass panels about 11 inches long, 6 inches wide and one-quarter of an inch
thick.
</P>
<P>
	   The fluorescent light at the base of each unit becomes extremely hot and can
melt the bases, the Consumer Products Safety Commission said Tuesday.
``Consumers should stop using the florescent light bases immediately and contact
the company to receive a free replacement base,'' the agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   No injuries have been reported, however, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
	   Specialty stores sold the panels during December for about $75.
</P>
<P>
	   The names of the recalled items include the Tony Steward Home Depot Car, the
Jeff Gordon Dupont Car, the Dale Earnhardt GM Goodwrench Car and the Dale
Earnhardt Jr. Budweiser Car.
</P>
<P>
	   Their model numbers are W9927077, W9927308, W9927019 and W9927215. The model
number is found on a sticker affixed to the products' boxes, which say ``Action
Racing Collectibles, Inc.''
</P>
<P>
	   For more information, consumers can call the company at 1-888-810-4057 from
9 a.m. to 7 p.m. EST Monday through Friday.

<HEADLINE> Four Escape From Afghan Airline  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Four men dropped from the cockpit window of a
hijacked plane and ran to safety Tuesday night, fleeing the Afghan aircraft that
has been parked for two days while negotiators seek the release of more than 150
passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   In the darkness shortly before midnight, the men used a rope help lower
themselves about 20 feet to the tarmac of Stansted airport. Authorities said the
four appeared to be hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   They were being questioned after receiving medical attention, and appeared
to have suffered no serious injuries, said Joe Edwards, an Essex Police
assistant chief constable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The negotiations with people on board the plane continue,'' said Edwards.
``The mood on board remains calm.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, negotiators warned that the talks, which gained the release of a
ninth hostage during the day Tuesday, could go on for days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The negotiations are going forward in a professional way, in a fairly calm
way,'' said John Broughton, an Essex Police assistant chief constable. ``The
principal concern here is the safety of the passengers on board that aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
	   The aims of the hijackers, believed to be Afghans, remained unclear.
Speculation ranged from an elaborate play for political asylum to a bid to win
the release of Ismail Khan, a former regional governor in Afghanistan detained
since 1997 by the country's ruling Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about a potential asylum bid, Broughton said: ``In talking around the
issues, there are a lot of things raised.'' He would not elaborate, saying only
that the hijackers, who controlled the plane at Stansted Airport 25 miles north
of London, had made no ``formal demands.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the negotiations involved what Broughton called housekeeping issues,
such as the delivery of water and food to the Ariana airlines plane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've done everything we can to keep the conditions on the aircraft
habitable,'' said Edwards. ``We're talking all the time about what's the
condition of people and how are the children.''
</P>
<P>
	   A London representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees arrived
at Stansted as an observer, police said Tuesday evening. She would not be a
negotiator, but would bring to the crisis the strength of the U.N.'s expertise
on the situation in Afghanistan, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing 727 had been headed to the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif
from the Afghan capital, Kabul, when it was seized early Sunday. It then began a
meandering journey across the former Soviet Union, stopping in Uzbekistan,
Kazakstan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   According to some of the 22 passengers released before the plane landed at
Stansted early Monday, the hijackers are eight young men armed with pistols,
grenades and daggers. Edwards said former hostages that authorities have talked
to have said there were between six and 10 hijackers.
</P>
<P>
	   They were believed to still be holding more than 150 hostages, including 21
children. All the passengers were believed to be Afghans.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight passengers were released at Stansted on Monday, including two infants
who were treated for dehydration. The man released earlier Tuesday, an
asthmatic, had complained of feeling ill, Broughton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The freed hostages have said they were treated well, authorities said. One
told reporters the hijacking started somewhat quietly 20 minutes into the
flight, with the armed men calmly telling passengers to put their hands on their
heads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people we are talking to are remarkably calm and that's really
important,'' Edwards said. ``The atmosphere is one of control, people behaving
rationally. That's going to help an awful lot.''
</P>
<P>
	   All six Iraqi men at the center of Britain's last hijacking drama -- a 1996
case involving a Sudanese airliner -- remain in the country as asylum-seekers,
the British government confirmed Tuesday. Those men held 197 people hostage for
seven hours at Stansted.
</P>
<P>
	   They were convicted in 1997 and sentenced to between five and nine years in
prison. But they were cleared on appeal a year later after a court ruled the
trial judge was wrong to bar jurors from considering their defense -- that they
were acting under ``necessity'' as opponents of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's
regime.
</P>
<P>
	   The men had claimed they stormed the plane in a desperate bid to enter
Britain and seek asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan is one of the top sources of asylum seekers in Britain. An
average of 360 applications a month has been lodged by Afghans since October.
Refugee status is granted in about a third of cases.

<HEADLINE> Students Protest Affirmative Action  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID MARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- One thousand students protested in the Capitol
rotunda Tuesday against Gov. Jeb Bush's plan to end affirmative action in
college admissions and state contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush refused to back off his executive order, but the students came away
largely satisfied after the governor agreed to establish a three-year plan to
make sure universities admit enough minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   While the protesters swayed to hymns such as ``Amazing Grace,'' four
students from predominantly black Florida A&AMP;M University walked into the
executive office and asked to see the governor about his plan, which is called
One Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan said he was impressed the students came with a
point-by-point analysis of One Florida and offered concrete suggestions to
improve it. The students will meet soon with the governor's staff and the state
university chancellor, Brogan said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They've done their homework,'' he said. ``I wish we could say that for
everybody who has knocked the One Florida plan.''
</P>
<P>
	   The students also thanked Bush for meeting with them and listening to their
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was definitely a good first step,'' said Andrew Gillium, one of the
students who met with the Republican governor. ``The meeting was constructive.''
</P>
<P>
	   The relatively amicable ending was in marked contrast to a 25-hour sit-in
inside Brogan's office three weeks ago by a pair of black lawmakers, who
demanded Bush rescind his executive order. Bush agreed to hold three public
meetings on One Florida.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen early Wednesday amid
new signs of strength in the U.S. economy. Japanese stocks rose moderately.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 109.42 yen, up 0.08 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and
also above its late New York level of 109.35 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 96.21 points, or 0.48
percent, to 19,965.09 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Tuesday, the
average closed down 76.55 points, or 0.38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar met some profit-taking in early Asian
trading, but many players were still expecting the greenback's strength against
the yen to continue.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar had gained ground in New York, where the currency was lifted by
new signs of a vigorous U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Labor Department said Tuesday that productivity -- defined as the
amount of output for each hour of work -- rose by a larger-than-expected 5
percent annual rate in the final three months of last year, helping offset
pricing pressures.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar fell to 109.33 yen at one point Wednesday on selling spurred by a
market rumor that Japan's Economic Planning Agency would revise upward gross
domestic product for the July-September quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   But the agency announced later that revised real GDP contracted 1.0 percent
in the period, unchanged from the preliminary figure.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 108.28 yen, up from 107.22 yen
late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices rebounded moderately following gains in New
York, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.81 to 10,957.60 at
Tuesday's close. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 105.73 to 4,427.50, finishing
at a record high for the third straight session.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo investors were also encouraged by a series of recent launches of
investment trust funds, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 11.42 points, or 0.66 percent, to 1,748.97. The TOPIX closed down
17.23 points, or 0.98 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.8850
percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.9000 percent. Its price rose 0.13 point to
98.43.

<HEADLINE> Tape: Ala. Gov.'s Denials False  </HEADLINE>
   By JAY REEVES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- A secretly made tape recording shows that contrary
to Gov. Don Siegelman's denials, he instructed state judges to lobby newspaper
editors to back a big judicial pay raise.
</P>
<P>
	   The recording was made by Etowah County Circuit Judge Roy Moore, whose
supporters released part of it Monday to prove Siegelman was lying.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference Tuesday in Montgomery, Siegelman said he was
``forthright and honest'' in describing his call to the judges, which he said
was proper and not unusual. He said he did not remember the details of what he
said in the call, which was made last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview last week with The Associated Press, Siegelman had denied
accusations by Moore that the governor instructed judges to take editors out to
eat in hopes of winning their support for the raise.
</P>
<P>
	   The tape -- of a telephone conference call involving the governor, Moore and
dozens of other judges -- showed otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   Recording a telephone conversation is legal in Alabama as long as one party
taking part in the call knows it is being taped.
</P>
<P>
	   During the call, which was initiated by the governor's office, Siegelman
twice told judges to lobby editors to support the raise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Go to your newspaper, talk to your editor, take him to lunch today, try to
prepare them to write the right stories should this become law,'' he said.
Siegelman told judges to ``try to help temper the editorial page editors'
approach on this thing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Siegelman allowed the pay raise to become law without his signature in June.
The bill made many Alabama judges the highest paid in the nation, setting their
salary at as much as $140,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
	   Siegelman is a Democrat. Moore, best known for refusing to remove the Ten
Commandments from his court, is a Republican candidate for state Supreme Court
chief justice.
</P>
<P>
	   Siegelman, at Tuesday's news conference, said he did not remember voicing
the denial to the AP.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But if it's reported I said it. Maybe I did. But, so what? So what? Is
that front page news that I encouraged judges to go to lunch with their editors?
It must be,'' Siegelman said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think what we should do is see if the judges took them to lunch because
if they did they wasted their money because almost every editorial board said
this bill should be killed.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Wins Delaware Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush won Delaware's
presidential primary Tuesday and earned a badly needed boost into a Southern
showdown, even as antagonist John McCain burnished his insurgent candidacy by
finishing second in a state where he did not campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think this is a piece of good news that will buoy our supporters,'' the
Texas governor told The Associated Press after securing the state's 12
delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who skipped Delaware to focus on the critical Feb. 19 primary in
South Carolina, attributed his totals to the momentum generated by his
shellacking of Bush in New Hampshire's leadoff primary last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's bound to give us a boost,'' the Arizona senator told The AP. ``I
think there are some good signs for us, but I think we still have a long, long
way to go. I'm still the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
	   With 26 of 28 precincts reporting, the Texas governor had 51 percent of the
votes and McCain 25 percent, a solid victory for the national front-runner.
Though far behind Bush, the Arizonan did surprisingly well for a candidate who
didn't visit or spend money in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, conservative Steve Forbes had a disappointing 20 percent after
winning the state's primary in 1996 and campaigning heavily in the state this
year. He will be under pressure to pull out of the race.
</P>
<P>
	   Former ambassador Alan Keyes had just 4 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats voted Saturday in Delaware, giving Vice President Al Gore an easy
victory over Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in Delaware suggested McCain benefited from a wave of post-New
Hampshire publicity: Almost half of his supporters decided to vote for him in
the week since that primary. And a quarter of his backers were new voters who
didn't vote in the 1996 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The surveys showed Bush did best among voters who are middle class, elderly,
conservative and believe he is likely to win the presidency. McCain voters
tended to be affluent, well-educated and self-identified independents and
moderates who said they were looking for a candidate who stands up for what he
believes.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, who has pushed for a flat tax since his failed 1996 run, did well
among voters who listed taxes as their top concern.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victory in New Hampshire erased Bush's lead in South Carolina and
dramatically shrunk his advantage in California, Michigan, New York and national
polls, as he sought to draw new and independent voters into the GOP fold.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to South Carolina, where Forbes is not a factor, Bush and
McCain intensified their rivalry with an exchange of bitterly personal ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor's spot accuses McCain of hypocrisy over his signature
issue of campaign finance reform. McCain says in his new ad that Bush ``twists
the truth like Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The overheated rhetoric underscored what is at stake in upcoming contests.
Despite his financial and organizational advantages, Bush faces a serious threat
from the Arizona senator. And McCain, with just one victory under his belt,
can't afford losses to his party's front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina will test whether McCain is a one-state wonder or a contender
who can foil Bush and his backers in the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, campaigning to the last at a nursing home, pledged to end
inheritance taxes as part of his flat tax plan. ``You should be allowed to leave
this world unmolested by the IRS,'' he told about 60 senior citizens in a
reception room down the hall from a polling place.
</P>
<P>
	   With little hope in South Carolina, he was flying to Michigan, which has its
Republican primary on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona also holds its primary on Feb. 22 and Bush has campaigned hard in
McCain's home state, and is supported by Gov. Jane Hull. McCain hasn't ceded any
ground in Michigan, where Bush is backed by Gov. John Engler.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia conducts its primary Feb. 29, and Bush is backed there by Gov.
James Gilmore. More than a dozen states hold primaries or caucuses on March 7,
when the nominee could be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won in Delaware four years ago, gaining 33 percent of the vote to
beat Bob Dole, the eventual nominee. But Forbes was the only GOP candidate to
campaign in Delaware that year, with the others staying away in deference to New
Hampshire's insistence on being the first and only contest in the opening week
of primary competition.
</P>
<P>
	   To avoid a replay in 2000, Delaware Republicans opted out of the state
primary last Saturday to hold a party-run election Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Siege of Andes Prison Ends  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BY RICK VECCHIO Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Maoist Shining Path rebels released their 24 hostages and
surrendered to prison officials, ending an uprising in a frigid Andean prison
that left at least one inmate dead, President Alberto Fujimori said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Peruvian leader gave few other details about the agreement with rebel
prisoners that ended the insurrection at the Yanamayo prison.
</P>
<P>
	   One Shining Path inmate was killed, but officials said he died at the hands
of other rebels. Officials declined to comment on news reports that a guard was
killed during the riot.
</P>
<P>
	   Minutes before Fujimori's announcement, television broadcast live images of
the prison's exterior with rebel banners draped from the barred windows.
Prisoners could be heard shouting slogans inside. Military officials exiting the
compound refused to provide any details about events behind the prison walls.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostage crisis began Sunday night, when Maoist inmates armed with
homemade knives and demanding better conditions took the guards hostage.
</P>
<P>
	   During negotiations, the inmates demanded to be treated as prisoners of war
and called for the closure of the high security naval base in Lima where Shining
Path leaders Abimael Guzman and Oscar Ramirez Durand are serving life sentences.
Fujimori said both demands were rejected.
</P>
<P>
	   The high-security prison holds some 450 rebel prisoners. Most belong to the
Shining Path, but members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement -- a much
smaller rebel band -- are also serving sentences there.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Fujimori's announcement, Jaime Castillo Patruzzi, a Chilean member of
the Tupac Amaru group, used a smuggled cell phone to tell Radio Bio Bio in his
home country that the siege had ended. He said the hostages were released after
authorities signed an agreement promising no reprisals against the inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yanamayo prison is in Puno, 525 miles southeast of the capital, Lima,
and near the Bolivian border. Prisoners live two to a cell in spartan
6-foot-by-10-foot quarters with no running water and are only allowed one
half-hour stint per day in the prison courtyard.
</P>
<P>
	   New York native Lori Berenson was held there until being transferred in 1998
for health reasons. A military judge convicted Berenson of treason in 1996 for
helping lead a thwarted Tupac Amaru assault on Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Peru's war against leftist rebels has left 30,000 people dead since 1980.

<HEADLINE> Planes Collide in Ill., 3 Dead  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAUN TANDON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZION, Ill. (AP) -- Two small planes collided over a hospital parking lot
Tuesday, killing three people, including a popular radio show host.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Collins, the host of Chicago's top-rated morning program for the past
decade, was in a plane that crashed onto the hospital's roof, said WGN-AM
spokeswoman Debbie Linch. The other person on the plane, who was not identified,
was also killed.
</P>
<P>
	   The other plane, a four-seat Cessna 172, crashed into a nearby street,
killing the one person on board, said Zion Fire Chief David LaBelle.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins, 57, had been at the talk and sports station since 1974.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were just talking this morning about how safe flying is,'' said Tom
Peterson, WGN-AM's news director and the news anchor on Collins' show.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins' show blended news and talk, including calls from listeners and
frequent interviews with public officials such as Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley
and Gov. George Ryan and former Gov. Jim Edgar.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He sort of presided over a daily town meeting of Chicago,'' said Robert
Feder, television and radio columnist at the Chicago Sun-Times. ``His show could
run the gamut from what was in the news to what was on listeners' minds --
whatever struck his fancy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Collins co-owned the two seat aerobatic plane that crashed on the hospital
roof.
</P>
<P>
	   The impact of the crash blew the windows out of the top floor of Midwestern
Regional Medical Center. Two hospital workers were slightly burned and the
hospital was evacuated, said hospital president Roger Cary.
</P>
<P>
	   Les Mussared said he was standing in a parking lot near the hospital when
the planes crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I looked up because I heard a gurgling noise. I saw two small planes
collide in the air -- they pulled away from each other,'' Mussared said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cessna was registered to ATE of New York, a flying school. A message to
the company's office in Chicago was not returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Preliminary reports indicated both planes were approaching the Waukegan
Airport, near the site of the collision.
</P>
<P>
	   Zion is about 45 miles north of downtown Chicago, near the
Illinois-Wisconsin line.

Croats have elected opponents of late President Franjo Tudjman to lead the

who was chosen to be the country's new president in Monday's voting.
</P>
<P>
	   Mesic met Tuesday with the country's new prime minister, Ivica Racan, to
discuss how to end the economic corruption and political isolation that is a
legacy of Tudjman's nearly decade-long grip on power.
</P>
<P>
	   The new leadership will have to grapple with 20 percent unemployment, low
wages and an economic policy that critics say was tainted by corruption that
allegedly enriched Tudjman's supporters. They also will have to live with their
election promises to cooperate fully with the U.N.-sponsored war crimes tribunal
and reduce support for Croats in neighboring Bosnia -- conditions for Croatia's
accession to Western bodies like the European Union and NATO.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Major work is ahead of us,'' Mesic said in his first official statement
following Monday's election to succeed Tudjman, who died Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Racan, whose Cabinet is to present its new political and economic program to
the parliament on Wednesday, said the situation ``is worse than we predicted.''
</P>
<P>
	   For now, however, most Croats seem happy with the mere fact that the Tudjman
era -- marked by authoritarianism and nationalism -- is over.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's important that we got rid of a system which, in nutshell, exploited
us,'' said Vera Simic, a saleswoman. ``Now, there probably will be a lot of
work, sweat and blood. But it seems that there won't be tears.''
</P>
<P>
	   Western governments and most of Croatia's neighbors welcomed the political
change in parliament as well as the presidency. On Jan. 3, Tudjman's Croatian
Democratic Union lost its nine-year majority in parliament to a center-left
coalition of Social Democrats and Social Liberals.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, President Clinton congratulated Mesic, and called his
election a turning point.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It brings with it the promise of genuine democracy and a normal life for
Croatia's people, stronger ties between our two nations, and greater stability
throughout southeast Europe,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the
elections were a major step toward bringing Croatia into the Western European
community.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Commission decided Tuesday to upgrade its Zagreb office to the
level of permanent mission, indicating a boost in relations with Croatia.
</P>
<P>
	   Mesic said his major task was to ``do all'' to help integrate Croatia into
Western institutions. Asked about the rate by which that could happen, he
replied: ``Swiftly.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Unveils New Education Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, Ohio (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley said Tuesday he will
propose doubling an $8 billion federal program for distressed schools and giving
parents the opportunity to choose what public school their children attend.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Bradley said he would institute a new ``report card'' to grade
schools on issues like graduation rates and performance.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest single piece of the package, which Bradley was outlining
Wednesday in a speech at a St. Louis school, would be the doubling of the basic
federal education program that offers funding to low-income and distressed
schools.
</P>
<P>
	   That pot of money, which would grow to $16 billion, could be used for a
variety of efforts, including bonuses to lure qualified teachers into classrooms
and rewards for schools that improve student achievement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they do succeed they get a little more, part of that could be used for
bonuses,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   At a town meeting in a suburb of Cleveland, Bradley responded to a question
on his views on education by sketching out much of the package he intends to
unveil on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The school choice plan is among the most controversial areas, and Bradley is
routinely criticized by Democratic rival Al Gore for having voted as a U.S.
senator for school voucher experiments. Those programs allow parents to use
public funds to send their children to the school of their choice, whether they
are public or private.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley carefully noted that his proposal would give parents a choice only
among public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, he called for new teacher testing, saying it would assure
quality teachers are in every classroom.
</P>
<P>
	   At the heart of the package, Bradley said, was an incentive system for
schools to improve student performance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they do succeed they get a reward,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the report cards would allow parents to better assess the quality of
the school their children attend and would help them choose a new school if they
decide to switch. ``Parents would get a report card to help them.'' They then
``can make a choice on where they attend,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report cards would cover ``five, six, or 10 different areas,'' including
graduation rates, performance on standardized tests and other issues to be
decided later, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides said the proposals would compliment earlier Bradley initiatives to
double the number of Head Start slots and to give scholarships to college
students who agree to teach in distressed urban schools. Those scholarships
would be worth $7,500 a year and could bring up to 600,000 new teachers into the
profession.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides said they were confident Bradley's education package would be viewed
as more aggressive than Gore's. The vice president has proposed a $115 billion,
10-year plan to improve education that includes making preschool universally
available and would give salary increases of up to $5,000 for public school
teachers who meet certain standards in poor and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It confirms Bill Bradley as the education candidate,'' said one aide who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We are proposing more money, more innovation
and more results than the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
	   The education issue is a hard fought one between Gore and Bradley because
polls have shown that Democratic primary voters put education high atop their
list of policy concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to expanding aid to local schools, Bradley called for $500
million for charter schools, to expand teacher testing and to tighten monitoring
of student performance.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Miss. Killer Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY R. BROWN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRANDON, Miss. (AP) -- The alleged leader of a satanic group accused of
masterminding the deadly shootings at Pearl High School pleaded guilty Tuesday
to a lesser charge of conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Grant Boyette, 21, had been charged with three counts of accessory to murder
in the Oct. 1, 1997, shooting deaths of two students and the fatal stabbing of
Mary Woodham, the mother of one of his co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   Luke Woodham is serving three life sentences for carrying out the attacks:
fatally stabbing his mother, then carrying a gun to school and killing two
students and wounding seven others.
</P>
<P>
	   During his trial in 1998, Woodham said he killed under direct orders from
Boyette, a friend he described as both a mentor and tormentor who had introduced
him to the occult.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Boyette told him he would be ``spineless and gutless'' if he failed
to act.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors have called Boyette the mastermind behind the shooting, but
prosecutor Richard Mitchell said winning a conviction would have been difficult
because Woodham would have been the primary witness.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were having to rely on the word of a three-time convicted murderer for
our case,'' Mitchell said. ``Sometimes a case isn't as strong as we would
like.''
</P>
<P>
	   Boyette's lawyers refused to comment on the plea.
</P>
<P>
	   He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to interfere with a government office for
carrying out the attack at a school. His sentencing is scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators said Boyette's group called itself the ``Kroth'' and talked
about killing fellow students and worshipping the devil.

<HEADLINE> Bush Wins Delaware Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush won Delaware's
presidential primary Tuesday and earned a badly needed boost into a Southern
showdown, even as antagonist John McCain burnished his insurgent candidacy by
finishing second in a state where he did not campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think this is a piece of good news that will buoy our supporters,'' the
Texas governor told The Associated Press after securing the state's 12
delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who skipped Delaware to focus on the critical Feb. 19 primary in
South Carolina, attributed his showing to the momentum generated by his
shellacking of Bush in New Hampshire's leadoff primary last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's bound to give us a boost,'' the Arizona senator told The AP. ``I
think there are some good signs for us, but I think we still have a long, long
way to go. I'm still the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative Steve Forbes finished a disappointing third after spending $60
million on two successive presidential bids, and was taking stock of his
campaign. ``Clearly, we would have liked to have done better. We will go on to
Michigan and South Carolina and assess the situation as things move forward,''
campaign manager Bill Dal Col told The AP.
</P>
<P>
	   With all 28 precincts reporting, the Texas governor had 51 percent of the
vote and McCain 25 percent, a solid victory for the national front-runner.
Though far behind Bush, the Arizonan did surprisingly well for a candidate who
didn't visit or spend money in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, Forbes had 20 percent after winning the state's primary in 1996
and campaigning heavily in the state this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Former ambassador Alan Keyes had just 4 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats voted Saturday in Delaware, giving Vice President Al Gore an easy
victory over Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in Delaware suggested McCain benefited from a wave of post-New
Hampshire publicity: Almost half of his supporters decided to vote for him in
the week since that primary. And a quarter of his backers were new voters who
didn't vote in the 1996 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The surveys showed Bush did best among voters who are middle class, elderly,
conservative and believe he is likely to win the presidency. McCain voters
tended to be affluent, well-educated and self-identified independents and
moderates who said they were looking for a candidate who stands up for what he
believes.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, who has pushed for a flat tax since his failed 1996 run, did well
among voters who listed taxes as their top concern.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victory in New Hampshire erased Bush's lead in South Carolina and
dramatically shrunk his advantage in California, Michigan, New York and national
polls, as he sought to draw new and independent voters into the GOP fold.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to South Carolina, where Forbes is not a factor, Bush and
McCain intensified their rivalry with an exchange of bitterly personal ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor's spot accuses McCain of hypocrisy over his signature
issue of campaign finance reform. McCain says in his new ad that Bush ``twists
the truth like Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The overheated rhetoric underscored what is at stake in upcoming contests.
Despite his financial and organizational advantages, Bush faces a serious threat
from the Arizona senator. And McCain, with just one victory under his belt,
can't afford losses to his party's front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina will test whether McCain is a one-state wonder or a contender
who can foil Bush and his backers in the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, campaigning to the last at a nursing home, pledged to end
inheritance taxes as part of his flat tax plan. ``You should be allowed to leave
this world unmolested by the IRS,'' he told about 60 senior citizens in a
reception room down the hall from a polling place.
</P>
<P>
	   With little hope in South Carolina, he was flying to Michigan, which has its
Republican primary on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona also holds its primary on Feb. 22 and Bush has campaigned hard in
McCain's home state, and is supported by Gov. Jane Hull. McCain hasn't ceded any
ground in Michigan, where Bush is backed by Gov. John Engler.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia conducts its primary Feb. 29, and Bush is backed there by Gov.
James Gilmore. More than a dozen states hold primaries or caucuses on March 7,
when the nominee could be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won in Delaware four years ago, gaining 33 percent of the vote to
beat Bob Dole, the eventual nominee. But Forbes was the only GOP candidate to
campaign in Delaware that year, with the others staying away in deference to New
Hampshire's insistence on being the first and only contest in the opening week
of primary competition.
</P>
<P>
	   To avoid a replay in 2000, Delaware Republicans opted out of the state
primary last Saturday to hold a party-run election Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Send U.N. Monitors to Congo  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States on Tuesday suggested that the
United Nations send cease-fire monitors to Congo, a move aimed at helping bring
an end to a civil war that has drawn in several African nations.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke was to travel to Washington on Wednesday
to brief lawmakers who must sign off on the proposal and authorize funds for it
before the United States can vote for it.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed resolution would require Congo's warring sides to ensure the
safety of the monitors and represents the first major step in the proposed
deployment of a full-fledged peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   The resolution envisages an initial force of up to 5,537 personnel, with a
core of 500 military observers who would monitor a cease-fire signed last summer
by the main players fighting in the Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   Rwanda and Uganda are supporting rebels who launched an insurrection in
August 1998 to oust President Laurent Kabila from power. Kabila is backed by
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite continued violence and violations of the accord, Kabila and other
presidents came to New York last month to recommit themselves to the agreement
and urge the United Nations to do its part by sending in observers and
eventually peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   The core role of the observer mission would be to work with a joint military
committee to monitor the accord, move aid through the country and monitor human
rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
	   The phased deployment of the U.N. force would be carried out only when U.N.
chief Kofi Annan receives ``firm and credible assurances'' from all sides that
they will be able to get to their assigned locations and do their jobs with
security and full cooperation.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. battalions would be allowed to use force to protect themselves and
civilians under imminent threat of violence.
</P>
<P>
	   But the resolution stresses that the observer mission would not enforce any
peace, only monitor it, and says the U.N. troops will not forcibly disarm any
fighters.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Bradley Would Hurt Medicare  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PEMBROKE PINES, Fla. (AP) -- Reprising what once was dubbed ``Medi-scare,''
Vice President Al Gore claimed an unlikely ally in Republican presidential
candidate John McCain Tuesday and told Florida senior citizens that Bill Bradley
would endanger Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``McCain and I have in common putting money from the surplus into Medicare
and keeping it from being drawn down when the baby boomers retire,'' Gore told
reporters as he flew to Florida, which holds its primary on March 14.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bradley would not put a penny into this,'' Gore said, trying to create a
political predicament for his Democratic primary opponent. It is akin to the
situation that led Republican Bob Dole to charge President Clinton and Gore with
``Medi-scare'' in the 1996 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a state like Florida, with its larger-than-average Medicare population,
this is going to be an even more difficult issue for (Bradley) to deal with,''
Gore predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Commenting later, Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said, ``Bill Bradley's
record on Medicare is beyond reproach. The vice president knows that. Further,
Bradley has a more ambitious prescription drug plan and a way to help seniors
stay out of nursing homes.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he is not distorting the truth, the vice president is scaring the
seniors,'' Hauser said. ``The vice president is developing a reckless disregard
for the truth and that is becoming somewhat alarming.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was asked if he was running the same plays against Bradley that worked
against Dole. He grinned slightly, shrugged, returned to his forward cabin
aboard Air Force Two to finish boning up on the statistics his staff had
compiled for his afternoon speech at the Century Village residential community:
</P>
<P>
	   -- 2.8 million Floridians depend on Medicare, most of them senior citizens
who are reliably active voters.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Over the next 25 years, the number of senior citizens here is expected to
more than double.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's budget proposal reserves $256 billion of the projected 10-year
surplus to shore up Medicare for the aging baby boomer generation. Bradley,
noting that the Medicare Trust Fund is already in good shape through at least
2015, argues that universal health insurance is a more urgent priority for
surplus funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's proposal also would replace Medicaid with health insurance
subsidies for low-income Americans and give everyone a tax break on the money
they spend on premiums.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Democrats would expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Mixing folksy charm with his political barbs, Gore asked military veterans
in his audience Tuesday, ``After you all came home from World War II, fairly
soon after that, all these babies started being born. Why was that?''
</P>
<P>
	   That baby boom's impending retirement dictates, Gore argued, that ``we have
to put money from the budget surplus into the Medicare Trust Fund to prepare for
that day, otherwise Medicare is at risk.''
</P>
<P>
	   John Clarkson, dean of the University of Miami Medical School and a Bradley
ally, acknowledged that Gore ``is striking a chord'' in the Sunshine State,
where Gore already leads Bradley in polls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I think there's some scare tactic in it that's unwarranted -- that is,
that Bradley is taking away Medicaid and not caring about Medicare,'' Clarkson
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who had been campaigning in Florida on Monday, was in South
Carolina Tuesday criticizing the Republican candidates for not taking a stance
against flying the Confederate flag above the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   In an unwelcome good-bye gesture, he was handed a letter by state party
chairman Dick Harpootlian at the airport as he was leaving saying it was time
for him to drop out of the race and support Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley camp rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in nearly 3 hours of fielding questions from Ybor City residents
outside Tampa, Gore said he favors building a limited anti-ballistic missile
defense system -- under an amended ABM Treaty -- to guard against threats by
rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   He also hinted at progress towards peace talks between Israel and Syria.
``We're close to getting a very meaningful new phase of those negotiations,''
Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Travel Cos. To Issue Refunds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Four Florida-based travel companies, including two
that employ celebrity spokesman Robin Leach, have been ordered to pay full or
partial refunds to settle claims they duped consumers into buying vacation
packages.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth said Tuesday the companies will
make the refunds under separate agreements with Florida, 16 other states and the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach is a spokesman for Fort Lauderdale-based National Travel Services Inc.
and Plaza Resorts Inc., both owned by James Verrillo and Daniel Lambert. An
investigation into Leach's involvement in the deceptive practices is continuing,
the attorney general's office said.
</P>
<P>
	   The other two companies are Florida Travel Network Inc., owned by James
Herron Sr. and Vance Vogel, and Crown Plaza Resorts, owned by Vogel. Both are in
Treasure Island.
</P>
<P>
	   "All of the companies led consumers to believe they had won free vacations,"
Butterworth said. "What they got instead was a high-pressure sales pitch to pay
as much as $1,000 for a seven-day Florida vacation and a 'Bahamas cruise.' In
some instances, the Bahamas cruise amounted to a one-day ferry ride and a game
of bingo."
</P>
<P>
	   In some cases, Butterworth said, customers who paid for vacation packages
were provided substandard accommodations and subjected to lengthy sales
presentations for time shares.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers can seek a refund by filing a complaint within 30 days with the
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar agreements were reached in Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia,
Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

	   Ottawa Wants To Set Quebec Referendum Rules
</P>
<P>
	   QUEBEC (AP) -- Ottawa wants to set the rules for the next sovereignty
referendum so it can veto any decisions about Quebec's future it doesn`t like, a
top provincial minister said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government`s so-called clarity bill, which sets the rules for
secession, goes too far, said Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Joseph Facal.
</P>
<P>
	   It must be countered with legislation in Quebec that asserts the province's
right to determine its own future, added Facal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a duty to react strongly,'' he said during his opening statement
on the first day of public hearings into Bill 99, the province`s response to
Ottawa`s proposed law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's at issue today is not deciding a specific kind of future, but the
fundamental right of all Quebecers to choose their future.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Parti Quebecois government hopes the public hearings will succeed in
rallying Quebecers against Ottawa`s tough stand where splashy ad campaigns and a
televised address by Premier Lucien Bouchard last December largely failed.
</P>
<P>
	   A recent poll said support for separation was at 38 per cent.

	   Rock Rejects Medical Services Speculation
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Health Minister Allan Rock has rejected suggestions that
medical services will have to be reduced to resolve the crunch in medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   Rock was responding to speculation that services available under medicare
may have to be trimmed to stop a steady escalation of costs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not there, I don't agree with that,'' Rock said Tuesday after meeting
British Columbia Health Minister Penny Priddy.
</P>
<P>
	   Rock has invited provincial ministers to a meeting in May to discuss the
health care crisis, but offered only vague hints about what he will propose.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, provinces have ``delisted'' various medical services not
deemed essential, which means those services are no longer free. Typical
examples would be tattoo removals or vasectomy reversals.

</P>
<P>
	   The agency, which manages most of the country's blood supply, said Tuesday
that its ``If you knew . . . would you?'' ads, as well as other recruitment
programs, were responsible for an 11 per cent increase in donations over a
four-month period ended Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   It said 252,188 units were collected between September and December 1999,
compared with 230,596 units over the same period in 1998. (One unit equals

	   Camera Ban on Ice Floes Sought During Seal Hunt
</P>
<P>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) -- Photographers should be banned from
recording the annual seal hunt because the pictures are used to twist the truth,
Newfoundland's fisheries minister said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   John Efford, widely known for his hot temper and abrasive style, dismissed
the notion he is advocating censorship.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've got a problem with public reaction on this issue,'' he said during a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I had my way, (they) wouldn't be taking pictures of the seal hunt. ...
There should be no pictures taken of any hunt.''
</P>
<P>
	   Efford's provocative comments signal the beginning of what promises to be
another volatile public relations war between the provincial government and the
International Fund for Animal Welfare.
</P>
<P>
	   The commercial harvest, which usually starts in late March or early April,
has been on the rebound since 1995. That's when the federal government started
offering subsidies while increasing the total allowable catch for harp seals to
250,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The IFAW, which led the campaign to ban the killing of young, whitecoat
harps in 1987, has responded by stepping up its campaign to portray the hunt as
a barbaric slaughter with no economic value.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge Dismisses Belgian Suit  </HEADLINE>
   By ESTES THOMPSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Relatives of five Belgians killed when a Marine jet
sliced through a ski gondola cable in the Italian Alps cannot seek damages in
the United States, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   While sympathizing with the families, U.S. District Judge Malcolm Howard
said their only recourse is through a NATO agreement covering NATO forces in
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
	   To allow the families to sue in the United States ``could conceivably
undercut the treaty and create a cause of action for any overseas military
accident,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty people were killed in 1998 when a low-flying EA-6B Prowler severed
the cable and sent a ski gondola crashing to the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   The relatives' attorney, Torrence Armstrong, argued that while the accident
occurred overseas, several problems had roots in the United States: a faulty
altitude gauge on the jet, outdated maps and inadequate flight crew training.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong said he would appeal to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the real tragedy is that the United States is not accepting
responsibility for this and is hiding behind the NATO agreement,'' Armstrong
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he would seek $6 million to $6.5 million for each of the five
victims if the case went to trial.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema approved the maximum $1.9
million in damages per victim in the crash, with the United States paying 75
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
	   The payments are governed by the accord covering civil and criminal legal
activities of NATO troops in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
	   A military jury at Camp Lejeune acquitted the jet's pilot, Capt. Richard
Ashby, of manslaughter, but he served several months in prison and was dismissed
from the Marine Corps for helping destroy a videotape of the flight. The jet's
navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, also was dismissed over the videotape.
Charges were dropped against two back-seat crewmen.

<HEADLINE> Cubans: Elian's Mom Was Bullied  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Chipping away at arguments that Elian Gonzalez's dead mother
was seeking freedom for her son in the United States, Cuba on Tuesday described
her as a timid woman bullied by a brutal boyfriend into making the tragic sea
journey.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Driven By Threats and Violence to Tragedy,'' read the headline of a
lengthy article in the Communist Party daily Granma. It offered the government's
version of the relationship between Elian's mother, Elizabeth Brotons, and her
boyfriend, Lazaro Munero.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the latest salvo in a continuing ideological war between Cuba's
communist government, which is fighting to return 6-year-old Elian to Cuba, and
anti-communist Cuban-Americans in Miami, who want the boy to stay in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25 after a boating
accident that took the life of his mother, Munero and nine others. Elian's
father and four grandparents live in Cuba and want him back. But Elian's
relatives in Miami say the boy should stay with them out of respect to his
mother, who died to give her child freedom in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Tuesday, Elian's father and grandparents were honored guests, along
with President Fidel Castro, at one of the increasingly emotional rallies the
government holds almost daily to press for Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's maternal grandmother Mariela Quintana wept as a stream of poets and
actors delivered dramatic appeals for the boy's repatriation. ``I just can't!''
8-year-old Claudia Macias blurted out as she broke into tears during a homage to
the child the communist government calls its ``boy hero.''
</P>
<P>
	   Castro, who sat in the front row of a packed hall, embraced the girl after
she later left the stage.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban government and even Brotons' mother, Raquel Rodriguez, have said
Brotons was forced to make the dangerous trip by her boyfriend. U.S. immigration
authorities earlier said that they believed that Munero was an illegal alien
smuggler and had charged most of the passengers for the trip.
</P>
<P>
	   Munero was ``the organizer and the principal person responsible for the
tragedy,'' the Granma article said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The article offered what it said were new details about the lives of Brotons
and Munero. It quoted friends and relatives of the pair, who described Munero as
a man who abused women physically and verbally and whom they believed regularly
beat Brotons. It even cited Munero's uncle, Dagoberto Munero Molina, who said
his nephew ``always treated his own family badly'' and spoke roughly with
Brotons.
</P>
<P>
	   The article said Munero had a criminal history and was convicted in 1993 for
breaking into a hotel room in the resort town of Varadero and stealing $236
worth of belongings from a German tourist.
</P>
<P>
	   Ex-girlfriends, former teachers, the mother of a son Munero had out of
wedlock, fellow students going back to middle school and residents of Munero's
hometown all remembered a person who was constantly in trouble with authorities
and whose past work consisted primarily of selling illegally obtained cigarettes
and liquor. By contrast, they described Brotons as a member of the Young
Communists Union and later the Communist Party of Cuba -- a young woman whose
first boyfriend was Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, whom she met when she
was 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Brotons and Gonzalez divorced in May 1991 after she suffered seven
miscarriages. They remained a couple after the divorce, however. When Brotons
became pregnant an eighth time in 1993, she was able to give birth to Elian. The
baby's name was a combination of both parents' first names.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez and Brotons separated for good three years later. Shortly
thereafter, Brotons began seeing Munero and he moved into the home she shared
with her son and parents.
</P>
<P>
	   In June 1998, Munero left Cuba in a boat for the United States and tried to
make Brotons and her son go with him but she refused, the article said.
</P>
<P>
	   Four months later, Munero returned to Cuba clandestinely and was jailed for
about eight weeks for the illegal trip, the article said. After his release,
Munero returned to Brotons' home but the couple soon moved out because her
parents complained that he was beating their daughter, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, the Washington-based advocacy group Children's Rights Council
said it had filed a brief with the court in Miami in support of the view that
Elian should be sent home because his mother took him out of Cuba without his
father's permission.
</P>
<P>
	   Allowing Elian to stay in the United States would undermine enforcement of
two U.S. laws and an international convention the United States has signed on
child abduction, said the group's president, David L. Levy.

<HEADLINE> Results of Del. GOP Exit Polling  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Results from exit polling of voters in Tuesday's Delaware GOP presidential
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ----------
</P>
<P>
	   How and why Delaware Republicans voted:
</P>
<P>
	   BUSH SUPPORTERS: Bush received much of his support from the middle class,
self-described Republicans, conservatives, those who thought he can win and
those who thought moral values were the top issue.
</P>
<P>
	   MCCAIN SUPPORTERS: McCain did better among the affluent, the better
educated, independent-minded Republicans, moderates, abortion rights supporters
and those who want a candidate who stands up for what he believes.
</P>
<P>
	   FORBES SUPPORTERS: Forbes supporters were more interested in issues than
personal qualities, and thought taxes were the top issue. They thought it was
important that a candidate stands up for what he believes and they said moral
values was the top issue.
</P>
<P>
	   MOST LIKELY TO WIN IN NOVEMBER: About six in 10 voters said Bush was most
likely to beat the Democratic candidate in November and about three-quarters of
that group voted for Bush. About one-fourth said McCain was most likely to beat
the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   IDEOLOGY: About six in 10 described themselves as politically conservative
and about half of that group voted for Bush. About one-quarter of that group
voted for Forbes and about two in 10 voted for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   RELIGIOUS RIGHT: A fifth of the electorate said they were part of the
religious right, and Bush got about half the support of that group and half of
the three-fourths who said they were not. About a third of those who were not
part of the religious right voted for McCain and about two in 10 voted for
Forbes. Of those describing themselves as members of the religious right, about
one-third voted for Forbes, and about one in 10 voted for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   PARTY IDENTIFICATION: About eight in 10 described themselves as Republicans
and about half of that group voted for Bush. McCain and Forbes each got the
support of about two in 10 self-described Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   ATTACKS: About one-quarter of voters said McCain made unfair attacks on
other candidates and about the same number said that of Forbes. About
three-quarters of those groups voted for Bush. About one in six said Bush has
unfairly attacked other candidates. Of the two-thirds who said he has not, about
six in 10 of that group voted for Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ISSUES OR QUALITIES: Voters split almost equally on whether their
candidate's position on the issues or leadership and personal qualities mattered
most. Bush led among both groups. Forbes got a third of the vote from those who
thought issues mattered most in their choice, while McCain got a third from
those who thought personal qualities mattered most.
</P>
<P>
	   ABORTION: Bush led among abortion opponents, a group courted by Forbes, and
those who thought it should be legal.
</P>
<P>
	   DECIDED TO VOTE: About four in 10 voters said they decided to vote in the
last week. About half of Forbes voters and half of McCain's voters made their
decision in that period. Almost three fourths of Bush supporters made a decision
before that.
</P>
<P>
	   TAXES VS. SOCIAL SECURITY: While Bush got a majority of the voters who said
the next president should make cutting taxes a higher priority, 4 in 10
preferred greater emphasis on strengthening Social Security, and McCain ran even
with Bush among them. McCain has focused more on the retirement system than tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   AGE: More than four in 10 of all voters were over age 60; Bush got a
majority of their support.
</P>
<P>
	   BUSH KNOWLEDGE: Bush lost some support among the one in 4 who said he
doesn't have the knowledge to serve effectively as president. More than half of
those voters chose McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   VIEWS ON ECONOMY: As in the Delaware Democratic primary Saturday, voters
overwhelmingly had a positive view of Delaware's economy and how their own
family's financial situation compares to four years ago. And about three in four
Republican voters said they believe the average American's standard of living
will rise in the next 10 years; two-thirds of Democratic voters said that.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The exit poll results were from interviews of 1,417 Delaware Republican
primary voters by Voter News Service, a consortium of The Associated Press and
major television networks. The poll had an error margin of plus or minus 3.5
percentage points, larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Bill To Strip Belfast's Powers OK'd  </HEADLINE>
   By KRISTIN GAZLAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Lawmakers overwhelmingly passed a bill Tuesday that would
allow the British government to strip Northern Ireland's fledgling
administration of its powers this week -- an emergency measure meant to prevent
its total collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   The 352-11 House of Commons vote came after Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson warned that legislators had no choice following the
Irish Republican Army's refusal to disarm in support of the province's 1998
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   In a last formal step before the bill passed to the upper House of Lords, a
ceremonial final ``reading'' was easily approved.
</P>
<P>
	   The major Protestant party within the power-sharing Cabinet, the Ulster
Unionists, agreed to form the four-party coalition -- which includes the
IRA-linked Sinn Fein -- only on condition that IRA would begin to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   A disarmament commission's report last week said the IRA had made no
concrete commitments, triggering the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson, who transferred considerable responsibilities to the Belfast
administration only two months ago, said in these circumstances it was ``clearly
foreseeable'' that the body ``will simply fall apart'' if powers weren't
immediately taken back.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Tuesday, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams directly appealed to Prime
Minister Tony Blair not to suspend the administration's powers, warning it would
render any start to IRA disarmament impossible.
</P>
<P>
	   As Martin McGuinness, a former IRA commander who is now Sinn Fein's minister
for education in the Cabinet, looked on from the visitors' gallery, Mandelson
said those arguing for the power-sharing Cabinet to continue were offering ``a
false choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   The reality, he said, was ``between pause and bust.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``A pause in the operation of the institutions, far from seeing them lying
in collapse, will preserve the institutions and allow them to be revived at a
later date,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson said he intended to use the bill's powers to resume ``direct
rule'' from London -- the quasi-colonial form of government originally imposed
in Northern Ireland in 1972 -- on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Adams also used a Commons room for a news conference. He, like McGuinness,
is an elected member of British Parliament, but can't take part in debates
because he refuses to take the oath of office, which would require him to pledge
support to Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Good Friday agreement is under the greatest threat so far since it
came into existence,'' Adams said, accusing the British government of backing
``a unilateral deadline'' sought by the Ulster Unionists.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., in Belfast,
Adams sounded exasperated, claiming to have done all he could to win an IRA
commitment to disarm. He wondered ``what role I have to play as a messenger who
continuously gets shot.''
</P>
<P>
	   But others blamed Sinn Fein for not delivering on its end of a bargain
struck in November under the mediation of American diplomat George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
	   In exchange for the Ulster Unionists' accepting Sinn Fein as Cabinet
colleagues, Sinn Fein declared for the first time that disarmament was
``essential,'' and the IRA opened negotiations with the province's 3-year-old
disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The Good Friday accord proposed that the IRA should completely disarm by
May, but specified no starting point. The IRA has never accepted that goal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ulster Unionists plan to ballot grassroots members Saturday on whether
to remain in the Cabinet. If they call for withdrawal, forming a new Cabinet
would prove extremely difficult because it would require a new election in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   Given the rising Protestant hostility to cooperating with Sinn Fein, the
Ulster Unionists -- previously able to command support from only half the
province's Protestants -- would probably suffer further losses.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Cabinet's senior Catholic minister, Seamus Mallon, warned that the
looming suspension could prove permanent.
</P>
<P>
	   He cited his personal experience in Northern Ireland's only previous attempt
to share power between Protestants and Catholics, a Cabinet that collapsed in
1974.
</P>
<P>
	   Politicians back then had hoped that the Cabinet would soon resume
operations, he recalled. ``It was resumed,'' he said. ``It took one quarter of a
century to resume it.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Wins Del.; McCain Still Alive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis By DAVID ESPO AP Political Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain's campaign momentum bounced him into second
place Tuesday night in Delaware, close enough to George W. Bush to sustain his
remarkable rise heading into next week's South Carolina primary and the contests
beyond.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's surge, following last week's landslide win in the New Hampshire
primary, was captured in the exit polls in a state where he neither campaigned
nor advertised.
</P>
<P>
	   About six in 10 GOP presidential voters in Delaware said they had decided
who to support more than a week ago. Of them, roughly 58 percent went for Bush,
14 percent for Forbes and 23 percent for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   The rest, about four in 10 voters, said they had decided who to vote for in
the last week -- the days since New Hampshire voted. Among them, the race was
far closer -- roughly 37 percent voted for Bush, 30 percent for McCain and 28
percent for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   When the vote was tallied, Bush won with a comfortable 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The outcome, in McCain's view, was ``a clear indication of the traction
we're getting,'' but quickly added he remains the underdog and has a ``long long
way to go.''
</P>
<P>
	   A few hours earlier, one of McCain's small band of supporters in the Senate
predicted that a victory in South Carolina on Feb. 19 would begin to unravel
Bush's support among the senators, governors and congressmen who flocked to the
Texan's side last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There will be some switches,'' predicted Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, the establishment is staying with its man.
</P>
<P>
	   A few feet away from where Hagel spoke, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
told reporters that Bush is ``the best man for the job'' of president.
</P>
<P>
	   The polls now point to a toss-up in South Carolina, and, ominously for Bush,
fresh McCain strength in Michigan, which votes on Feb. 22, and California and
New York, the biggest of several states that hold primaries two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's challenge is to stop McCain's momentum in South Carolina, the first
of several ``firewalls'' he claims around the country.
</P>
<P>
	   In victory in Delaware, Bush said, ``I think the people of South Carolina
are ultimately going to make up their minds on issues, but I think it's a good
piece of news that will buoy our supporters.''
</P>
<P>
	   The evidence in Delaware was equivocal.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's victory -- his second of the campaign after the Iowa caucuses -- came
in a contest in which only Republicans were permitted to vote. Independents
helped fuel McCain's huge victory in New Hampshire last week -- he won 60
percent of their votes -- and are permitted to cast ballots in South Carolina
next week.
</P>
<P>
	   On a different issue, about one quarter of the voters polled said McCain had
made unfair attacks on his rivals, and another one quarter said the same of
Forbes. Of them, three-quarters voted for Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Only about one in six voters said Bush had made such attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The question of attacks may take on added importance in the coming days.
Voters routinely tell pollsters they don't like them, but experience shows they
have an impact, as Bill Bradley found out in the Democratic race when he let Al
Gore's criticism go unanswered and watched a lead in the polls evaporate in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has been advised by several Republicans to criticize Gore more
frequently, in an effort to rally core Republican voters to his side.
</P>
<P>
	   But the embattled front-runner needs to slow McCain's momentum, fast. To do
that, the Texas governor's high command has chosen to describe him as a
Washington insider who says one thing on the issue of special interests, but
does another. Bush has made that charge already on campaign finance and
education, and may add legal reform to the list soon. McCain's long-scheduled
Washington fund-raiser later this week -- he now says he will appear by
satellite but not in person -- gives Bush another target.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad war is becoming intense, too.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator's latest ad says one of Bush's commercials ``twists the
truth like Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign responded in kind, with an ad scoffing at McCain's core
message of campaign finance reform as he solicits money from lobbyists.

<HEADLINE> 'Electability' Helps Bush in Del.  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE MOKRZYCKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Perceived electability in November vaulted George W. Bush to victory Tuesday
in Delaware's Republican presidential primary, but voters admiring John McCain
for his prisoner-of-war ordeal helped him finish a surprising second, an exit
poll found.
</P>
<P>
	   Although McCain didn't campaign in Delaware, he gained 44 percent of his
support there in the week since his 18-point victory over Bush in New
Hampshire's GOP primary. Steve Forbes gained more than half his support in the
past week but that still got him only a disappointing third-place finish. Nearly
three-quarters of Bush backers said they decided earlier this year or before.
</P>
<P>
	   While those results suggest McCain is riding momentum out of New Hampshire,
six in 10 voters said Bush would be most likely to beat the Democratic nominee,
and nearly three-quarters of them voted for the Texas governor. McCain did at
least as well among the 1 in 4 who said he was more electable.
</P>
<P>
	   Just 7 percent said Forbes would be most likely to win in November,
according to results from a Voter News Service exit poll for The Associated
Press and television networks. Only a third of Forbes voters considered him
electable in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Twelve percent of voters said the most important candidate quality was that
he can win in November, and nearly all of them voted for Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert French, 68, of Lewes, said he backed Bush because ``I think he's the
candidate that can get elected, and he has all the right philosophies as far as
I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won the 1996 GOP primary in Delaware with 33 percent of the vote, but
nobody else campaigned there that year. Among GOP primary voters who said they
supported Forbes four years ago, half chose other candidates Tuesday, the exit
poll found.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly half of voters said McCain's military record -- he spent 5 1/2 years
as a prisoner of war in Vietnam -- was important to their vote. McCain won 60
percent of those who said it was very important and a third of those who said it
was somewhat important.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also did well among voters who said it was important that a candidate
stands up for what he believes, and he appeared to gain some backing for his
push for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia Parson, 65, of Lewes, supported McCain because of his military
background and personal qualities, adding: ``We've had so many criminals in
Washington and I don't want any more.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes gained his strongest support among voters concerned about taxes.
About a quarter called taxes the most important issue in their vote, and half of
them backed Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm all in favor of eliminating the IRS with a flat tax,'' said Forbes
voter Edward Jackson, 69, of Millsboro, citing a key promise of the Forbes
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush lost some support among the 22 percent who said he doesn't have the
knowledge to serve effectively as president; 57 percent of those voters chose
McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike the New Hampshire primaries, in which voters not registered as either
Democrats or Republicans could choose which contest to vote in, Delaware's
contests were open only to party members. Bush got a majority of the 4 in 5
voters who called themselves Republicans, better than in New Hampshire. McCain
gained 42 percent of the self-described independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Self-described independents made up 41 percent of New Hampshire GOP primary
voters, and McCain won 63 percent of them there. Independents also are likely to
be an important factor in South Carolina, where the GOP primary Feb. 19 also is
open to Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservatives made up 62 percent of the Delaware GOP electorate, and more
than half voted for Bush; Forbes edged McCain among the rest. Half of moderates
went for Bush and a third for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Voter News Service conducted the exit poll among 1,417 Delaware Republican
primary voters for The Associated Press and television networks. Margin of error
due to sampling is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> College Protests Spread in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Administrators started returning to Mexico's largest
university Tuesday, two days after a police raid ended a 9 1/2-month occupation
by striking students.
</P>
<P>
	   But while courts freed most of the 745 people arrested in Sunday's raid, the
turmoil at the National Autonomous University spilled into national politics and
onto other campuses in the Mexican capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Students at other city universities demonstrated in favor of strikers still
imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico City's leftist mayor, Rosario Robles, appeared in television
advertisements to denounce the federal raid on the 270,000-student school known
by Spanish acronym, UNAM. She demanded freedom for all those arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To avoid making Mexico City a victim of a conflict ... it is urgent that
the Federal Preventative Police leave the university installations and that the
detained students be freed,'' said Robles, herself a UNAM graduate.
</P>
<P>
	   With a presidential election in July nearing, federal officials suggested
Robles' opposition-party city government had shirked its responsibility by
refusing to help retake the school.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal police on Tuesday turned over several parts of the campus to
university officials, who drove past barricades to tour structures emblazoned
with revolutionary slogans. Some buildings had been carefully maintained by
strikers; others had been looted and were strewn with garbage.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal attorney general's office announced that 579 of the adults
arrested Sunday had been freed, though some might face other charges. Another 77
minors were turned over to the juvenile court system.
</P>
<P>
	   Still in jail were 89 strike leaders and supporters, mostly on charges of
seizing public buildings or theft. Another 86 people have been held on various
charges since a violent clash on Jan. 26 at one of the university's high
schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike began last April to protest an increase in UNAM's minimal tuition
and other reforms. University officials quickly backed off on the tuition issue,
but radicals controlling the strike committee pressed ahead with the strike,
seeing it as part of a struggle against free-market economic policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Insisting on freedom for those arrested, faculty and students on Tuesday
staged a one-day strike of support at another school, the Metropolitan
Autonomous University's campus in northwestern Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
	   Students at the two other campuses of that university, which has about
45,000 students in all, also were voting on whether to join the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of members of the UNAM strike committee met Monday in a plaza at
the Metropolitan campus in southern Mexico City, denouncing the police raid and
pledging to continue the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have confidence in our comrades, knowing that no one with a minimum of
dignity and conscience would set foot in a classroom taken violently by military
police in violation of the university's autonomy,'' the strike council said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   UNAM Rector Juan Ramon de la Fuente has urged officials to drop charges
against those arrested Sunday or at least to be lenient.
</P>
<P>
	   But when asked whether officials would show goodwill with an amnesty,
Interior Secretary Diodoro Carrasco told reporters Tuesday: ``This is not a
problem of goodwill; it is a problem of application of the law. It is a problem
of maintaining order, and political and social stability.''

<P>
	   ZION, Ill. (AP) -- Two small planes collided over a hospital parking lot
Tuesday, killing three people, including a popular radio show host.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Collins, the host of Chicago's top-rated morning program for the past
decade, was in a plane that crashed onto the hospital's roof, said WGN-AM
spokeswoman Debbie Linch. The other person on the plane, 58-year-old Herman
Luscher, was not identified, was also killed.
</P>
<P>
	   The other plane, a four-seat Cessna 172, crashed into a nearby street,
killing the one person on board, said Zion Fire Chief David LaBelle.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins, 57, had been at the talk and sports station since 1974.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were just talking this morning about how safe flying is,'' said Tom
Peterson, WGN-AM's news director and the news anchor on Collins' show.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins' show blended news and talk, including calls from listeners and
frequent interviews with public officials such as Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley
and Gov. George Ryan and former Gov. Jim Edgar.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He sort of presided over a daily town meeting of Chicago,'' said Robert

<P>
	   Collins co-owned the two seat aerobatic plane that crashed on the hospital
roof.
</P>
<P>
	   The impact of the crash blew the windows out of the top floor of Midwestern
Regional Medical Center. Two hospital workers were slightly burned and the
hospital was evacuated, said hospital president Roger Cary.

Bush Wins Delaware Primary
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush won Delaware's
presidential primary today and earned a badly needed boost, even as antagonist
John McCain burnished his insurgent candidacy by finishing second in a state
where he did not campaign. With all 28 precincts reporting, Bush had 51 percent
of the vote, McCain had 25 percent, Steve Forbes had 20 percent and Alan Keyes
had 4 percent. McCain, who skipped Delaware to focus on the Feb. 19 primary in
South Carolina, attributed his showing to the momentum generated by his
shellacking of Bush in New Hampshire's leadoff primary last week. Conservative
Forbes finished a disappointing third after spending $60 million on two
successive presidential bids, and he was taking stock of his campaign.

Four Hostages Flee Afghan Plane
</SUBHEAD>

	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Four men who appear to have been hostages on the
hijacked Afghan airline dropped from the cockpit window and ran to safety
Tuesday night. They were being questioned after receiving medical attention, and
appeared to have suffered no serious injuries, said Joe Edwards, an Essex Police
assistant chief constable. The plane has been parked in a British airport for
the past two days as negotiators try to safely release the more than 150
passengers still on board. The aims of the hijackers, believed to be Afghans,
remained unclear. Speculation ranged from an elaborate play for political asylum
to a bid to win the release of Ismail Khan, a former regional governor in
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Woodbridge tax freeze for elderly, disabled may be duplicated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WOODBRIDGE, Conn. (AP) - With property values and school enrollment
climbing in this wealthy New Haven suburb, town leaders are trying a new
approach to tax relief - they have frozen property taxes for elderly and
disabled residents.
<P>
	   The tax relief plan, which takes effect for taxes due July 1, is the first
of its kind in Connecticut. It could become an attractive alternative to other
towns seeking ways to resolve age-old tax disputes that pit the elderly against
young home owners with children in public school.
</P>
<P>
	   Woodbridge leaders hope the tax freeze will encourage more senior citizens
to stay in their homes, providing for a good mix of residents and preventing
some young families from moving in and putting their children in the
already-burdened school system.
</P>
<P>
	   The average elderly Woodbridge taxpayer may be able to save $300 or so off
their tax bill, compared with the average per-pupil cost of $8,500 to $12,000
for public schools, said First Selectman Roger Harrison.
</P>
<P>
	   "The math is pretty simple," Harrison said. "The value is inherent in
wanting to maintain a good level of seniors in town and keeping school crowding
down."
</P>
<P>
	   Seniors had complained that they do not get a fair share of town services,
because about 60 percent of the town budget goes to education, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan is not without some controversy. It is available to all residents
who are over 65 or disabled and who have lived in their homes as a primary
residence for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   David Owens, a 15-year resident of Woodbridge, said some kind of income
limit should be put in, because the town has many affluent residents.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would think it should have graduated income levels. An income cutoff
would be somewhat arbitrary," Owens said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrison, who also favors an income limit, said the tax break can be
modified in the future, after town leaders see how many take advantage of the
break and what the costs will be.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's property tax credit for low-income elderly and disabled people
has income caps of $29,300 for married people and $23,900 for single people.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents of towns including Madison, Orange and North Branford have
inquired about implementing a similar tax break.
</P>
<P>
	   North Branford leaders are investigating what the costs of such a tax break
would be, who could benefit and how it might work.
</P>
<P>
	   "It makes sense, certainly it's a very logical thought process," said Town
Manager Frank Connolly.
</P>
<P>
	   North Branford is looking at Woodbridge's plan, and a similar program
started in West Greenwich, R.I. in 1972.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature will look this session at expanding the state's credit for
other low-income people, said Sen. Martin Looney, D-New Haven, co-chairman of
the tax-writing Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fact that towns are willing to do this points out what we've been
saying for years - that the property tax is the tax people find most
burdensome," Looney said.
</P>
<P>
	   One senior resident, Kenneth Moulden, said he plans to take advantage of the
tax break.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a terrific idea, because it'll save some people who have low incomes a
good deal of money," Moulden said.

<HEADLINE> Bush wins Delaware, McCain steals second over Forbes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) - Republican George W. Bush won Delaware's
presidential primary Tuesday and earned a badly needed boost into a Southern
showdown, even as antagonist John McCain burnished his insurgent candidacy by
finishing second in a state where he did not campaign.
<P>
	   "I think this is a piece of good news that will buoy our supporters," the
Texas governor told The Associated Press after securing the state's 12
delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who skipped Delaware to focus on the critical Feb. 19 primary in
South Carolina, attributed his showing to the momentum generated by his
shellacking of Bush in New Hampshire's leadoff primary last week.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's bound to give us a boost," the Arizona senator told The AP. "I think
there are some good signs for us, but I think we still have a long, long way to
go. I'm still the underdog."
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative Steve Forbes finished a disappointing third after spending $60
million on two successive presidential bids, and was taking stock of his
campaign. "Clearly, we would have liked to have done better. We will go on to
Michigan and South Carolina and assess the situation as things move forward,"
campaign manager Bill Dal Col told The AP.
</P>
<P>
	   With all 28 precincts reporting, the Texas governor had 51 percent of the
vote and McCain 25 percent, a solid victory for the national front-runner.
Though far behind Bush, the Arizonan did surprisingly well for a candidate who
didn't visit or spend money in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, Forbes had 20 percent after winning the state's primary in 1996
and campaigning heavily in the state this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Former ambassador Alan Keyes had just 4 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats voted Saturday in Delaware, giving Vice President Al Gore an easy
victory over Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in Delaware suggested McCain benefited from a wave of post-New
Hampshire publicity: Almost half of his supporters decided to vote for him in
the week since that primary. And a quarter of his backers were new voters who
didn't vote in the 1996 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The surveys showed Bush did best among voters who are middle class, elderly,
conservative and believe he is likely to win the presidency. McCain voters
tended to be affluent, well-educated and self-identified independents and
moderates who said they were looking for a candidate who stands up for what he
believes.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, who has pushed for a flat tax since his failed 1996 run, did well
among voters who listed taxes as their top concern.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victory in New Hampshire erased Bush's lead in South Carolina and
dramatically shrunk his advantage in California, Michigan, New York and national
polls, as he sought to draw new and independent voters into the GOP fold.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to South Carolina, where Forbes is not a factor, Bush and
McCain intensified their rivalry with an exchange of bitterly personal ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor's spot accuses McCain of hypocrisy over his signature
issue of campaign finance reform. McCain says in his new ad that Bush "twists
the truth like Clinton."
</P>
<P>
	   The overheated rhetoric underscored what is at stake in upcoming contests.
Despite his financial and organizational advantages, Bush faces a serious threat
from the Arizona senator. And McCain, with just one victory under his belt,
can't afford losses to his party's front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina will test whether McCain is a one-state wonder or a contender
who can foil Bush and his backers in the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, campaigning to the last at a nursing home, pledged to end
inheritance taxes as part of his flat tax plan. "You should be allowed to leave
this world unmolested by the IRS," he told about 60 senior citizens in a
reception room down the hall from a polling place.
</P>
<P>
	   With little hope in South Carolina, he was flying to Michigan, which has its
Republican primary on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona also holds its primary on Feb. 22 and Bush has campaigned hard in
McCain's home state, and is supported by Gov. Jane Hull. McCain hasn't ceded any
ground in Michigan, where Bush is backed by Gov. John Engler.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia conducts its primary Feb. 29, and Bush is backed there by Gov.
James Gilmore. More than a dozen states hold primaries or caucuses on March 7,
when the nominee could be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won in Delaware four years ago, gaining 33 percent of the vote to
beat Bob Dole, the eventual nominee. But Forbes was the only GOP candidate to
campaign in Delaware that year, with the others staying away in deference to New
Hampshire's insistence on being the first and only contest in the opening week
of primary competition.
</P>
<P>
	   To avoid a replay in 2000, Delaware Republicans opted out of the state
primary last Saturday to hold a party-run election Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Indiana Town OKs Fluoridated Water  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONNERSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- Like it or not, residents of this eastern Indiana
city soon will be getting a dose of fluoride every time they turn on their
faucets for a drink of water.
</P>
<P>
	   Months of bitter debate ended Monday when the City Council chose fighting
tooth decay over conspiracy fears and agreed to add fluoride to the city's water
supply.
</P>
<P>
	   The 5-2 vote erased Connersville's distinction as the largest city in
Indiana without fluoridated water.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue had split the city's 15,550 residents, with supporters of
fluoridation pointing to statewide studies showing the area has about a 20
percent higher rate of cavities than fluoridated communities, and opponents
alleging a conspiracy to poison the water supply.
</P>
<P>
	   About 60 people packed the council chambers in City Hall and spilled into
the lobby, where they watched the debate on television. Police officers stood
guard, and Mayor Mauri Connell warned audience members to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fluoride ship is sinking and the lifeboats have been manned,'' said
Mary Hendershott, of the opposition group Citizens for Safe Water.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other side was Tamra Boucher, who stood holding her infant son and
asked council members to approve fluoridation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bring Connersville into the 21st century,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Squabble Over Trust  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush and John McCain questioned each
other's trustworthiness Tuesday in new disputes that threatened to overshadow
any other topic in the Republican presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain released a new ad that says one of Bush's commercials ``twists the
truth like Clinton.'' Bush responded with a commercial taking aim at McCain's
core message -- campaign finance reform -- and saying the senator ``solicits
money from lobbyists with interests before his committee and pressures agencies
on behalf of contributors.''
</P>
<P>
	   The hot words flew as Bush got a much-needed lift over McCain's insurgent
candidacy with an easy victory in Delaware's Republican primary. McCain did not
campaign in Delaware, bypassing it to campaign in South Carolina and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor said he had a record of reform and McCain was not the
political maverick he claimed, repeatedly referring to the senator as ``the
chairman'' and saying that as head of the Senate's Commerce Committee and as a
campaigner he ``tends to say one thing and do another.''
</P>
<P>
	   The latest example, Bush said, was McCain's statement a day earlier that he
had always opposed public funding of elections. The Bush campaign offered a list
of five McCain votes from 1990 to 1993 in favor of a bill that proposed partial
public funding of Senate campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain voted not once, not twice, but five times to support
publicly funded congressional campaigns,'' Bush told reporters after speaking to
a cheering student crowd at North Greenville College.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, campaigning in South Carolina, said he couldn't recall whether he
had ever voted for public funding of federal campaigns, but that he was
philosophically opposed to the idea ``because of my view that my tax dollars
should not be used to subsidize the campaigns of another candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   His spokesman, Howard Opinsky, said: ``This is the same old Washington
Clintonian politics that voters have become so cynical about, trying to twist
John McCain's 17-year record of reform and consistent opposition to public
financing to Governor Bush's advantage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Opinsky said all of the votes were against cloture motions -- that is,
voting to continue debate -- to keep opponents from stifling campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush later characterized the contest against McCain as a fight he looks
forward to.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's important for me to show you that not only I can take a punch, but I
can come back and win and that's exactly what I intend to do here in the state
of South Carolina,'' Bush said in a speech to the South Carolina Association of
Home Builders in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican hopeful Alan Keyes blamed an ``oppressive government'' for what
he said was the nation's moral crisis. Pacing the Sumter Opera House's stage
bordered by red, white and blue campaign posters, Keyes urged ``people willing,
through the goodness of their heart,to take on the responsibilities of freedom''
and self-government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in Columbia, McCain announced a plan to fight crime and drugs, but
the event was all but buried by questions from reporters about his disputes with
Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, the former Vietnam prisoner of war, said he was offended by a Bush
ally who questioned his commitment to veterans -- a comment McCain said was
``beyond the pale'' -- as well as by aggressive new Bush ads. He noted that he
and Bush had shaken hands just weeks ago and agreed not to air negative ads
against each other.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe it is not trustworthy when someone shakes your hand and says
they're not going to run a negative ad, and then runs a negative ad,'' he said
aboard his bus.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've already got somebody in the Oval Office who is not trustworthy,'' he
said. He went even further in a new TV ad that says one of Bush's ads ``twists
the truth like Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
	   The charges and countercharges come as Bush and McCain court veterans, who
along with active-duty military make up a substantial portion of the GOP
electorate here. The state primary is Feb. 19, and Bush views the state as his
political ``firewall'' to stop McCain's momentum after the New Hampshire
primary.

<HEADLINE> 3 Found Guilty in Airport Drug Ring  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Three more men were found guilty of drug charges Tuesday
stemming from federal sting operations that accused 58 people of using worker
security clearances to smuggle drugs through Miami International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The yearlong investigation used undercover agents and fake cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those arrested were ramp workers for American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   The three convicted Tuesday -- Broward County corrections officer Tony
Guillen, American Airlines employee Carlos Munoz, and Roman Lugo -- are to be
sentenced in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Guillen was found guilty of attempted drug possession with intent to
distribute. He was acquitted of conspiracy to possess drugs with intent to
distribute and attempted drug possession with intent to distribute.
</P>
<P>
	   Munoz was found guilty of conspiracy to posses drugs with intent to
distribute, conspiracy to import drugs, two counts of attempted drug possession
with intent to distribute, and attempted importation.
</P>
<P>
	   Lugo, was found guilty of conspiracy to posses drugs with intent to
distribute and conspiracy to import drugs. He was acquitted of attempted drug
importation and attempted drug possession with intent to distribute.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the first arrests in September, one other person has been convicted
and at least 29 have pleaded or agreed to plead guilty. Three cases were
dismissed, and one man was acquitted last month after his attorney argued his
arrest constituted entrapment.

<HEADLINE> Bush Wins Del.; McCain Still Alive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis By DAVID ESPO AP Political Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain's campaign momentum bounced him into second
place Tuesday night in Delaware, close enough to George W. Bush to sustain his
remarkable rise heading into next week's South Carolina primary and the contests
beyond.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's surge, following last week's landslide win in the New Hampshire
primary, was captured in the exit polls in a state where he neither campaigned
nor advertised.
</P>
<P>
	   About six in 10 GOP presidential voters in Delaware said they had decided
who to support more than a week ago. Of them, roughly 58 percent went for Bush,
14 percent for Steve Forbes and 23 percent for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   The rest, about four in 10 voters, said they had decided who to vote for in
the last week -- the days since New Hampshire voted. Among them, the race was
far closer -- roughly 37 percent voted for Bush, 30 percent for McCain and 28
percent for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   When the vote was tallied, Bush won with a comfortable 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The outcome, in McCain's view, was ``a clear indication of the traction
we're getting,'' but quickly added he remains the underdog and has a ``long long
way to go.''
</P>
<P>
	   A few hours earlier, one of McCain's small band of supporters in the Senate
predicted that a victory in South Carolina on Feb. 19 would begin to unravel
Bush's support among the senators, governors and congressmen who flocked to the
Texan's side last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There will be some switches,'' predicted Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, the establishment is staying with its man.
</P>
<P>
	   A few feet away from where Hagel spoke, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
told reporters that Bush is ``the best man for the job'' of president.
</P>
<P>
	   The polls now point to a toss-up in South Carolina, and, ominously for Bush,
fresh McCain strength in Michigan, which votes on Feb. 22, and California and
New York, the biggest of several states that hold primaries two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's challenge is to stop McCain's momentum in South Carolina, the first
of several ``firewalls'' he claims around the country.
</P>
<P>
	   In victory in Delaware, Bush said, ``I think the people of South Carolina
are ultimately going to make up their minds on issues, but I think it's a good
piece of news that will buoy our supporters.''
</P>
<P>
	   The evidence in Delaware was equivocal.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's victory -- his second of the campaign after the Iowa caucuses -- came
in a contest in which only Republicans were permitted to vote. Independents
helped fuel McCain's huge victory in New Hampshire last week -- he won 60
percent of their votes -- and are permitted to cast ballots in South Carolina
next week.
</P>
<P>
	   On a different issue, about one quarter of the voters polled said McCain had
made unfair attacks on his rivals, and another one quarter said the same of
Forbes. Of them, three-quarters voted for Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Only about one in six voters said Bush had made such attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The question of attacks may take on added importance in the coming days.
Voters routinely tell pollsters they don't like them, but experience shows they
have an impact, as Bill Bradley found out in the Democratic race when he let Al
Gore's criticism go unanswered and watched a lead in the polls evaporate in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has been advised by several Republicans to criticize Gore more
frequently, in an effort to rally core Republican voters to his side.
</P>
<P>
	   But the embattled front-runner needs to slow McCain's momentum, fast. To do
that, the Texas governor's high command has chosen to describe him as a
Washington insider who says one thing on the issue of special interests, but
does another. Bush has made that charge already on campaign finance and
education, and may add legal reform to the list soon. McCain's long-scheduled
Washington fund-raiser later this week -- he now says he will appear by
satellite but not in person -- gives Bush another target.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad war is becoming intense, too.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator's latest ad says one of Bush's commercials ``twists the
truth like Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign responded in kind, with an ad scoffing at McCain's core
message of campaign finance reform as he solicits money from lobbyists.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain has narrowed George W. Bush's lead in New York
and erased it in Michigan in new GOP presidential primary polls out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain more than doubled his numbers after defeating Texas Gov. George W.
Bush in New Hampshire, becoming the choice of 39 percent of likely Republican
voters in the New York primary March 7. Bush still led with 48 percent in the
Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion poll. Publisher Steve Forbes came
in at 3 percent and 14 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, McCain was preferred by only 15 percent of likely Republican
primary voters in New York, compared to Bush's 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In a poll taken for the Detroit Free Press/WXYZ-TV, McCain had 45 percent to
43 percent for Bush. Alan Keyes and Steve Forbes had 4 percent apiece. The poll
of 300 likely Republican primary voters was taken Friday through Monday and has
an error margin of plus or minus 5.5 percentage points. The sample included a
third Democrats and independents, who helped keep the poll margin close for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Among New York Democrats, Vice President Al Gore has opened a substantial
lead over former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, the poll said. Gore was favored
by 54 percent of likely Democratic voters while Bradley was favored by 35
percent. Both were in a statistical dead heat in December.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York telephone poll of 944 registered voters was conducted Feb. 2-3
and on Sunday. The margin of error for the sample of 223 likely Republican
voters was plus or minus 6.5 percentage points. It was 5.5 percentage points for
the sample of 297 likely Democratic voters.

<P>
	   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- A South Carolina political consultant and adviser
to Sen. John McCain's Republican presidential campaign denies suggestions he is
racist because of the magazine he edits.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Quinn edits Southern Partisan, a conservative quarterly about the
South.
</P>
<P>
	   It recently interviewed author Clyde Wilson, who said the ``only hope'' for
the United States is ``devolution of power so that the healthier parts of
American society can defend and preserve themselves. Defend themselves from the
federal government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Quinn said he was not involved in the magazine's daily operations, did not
read articles before they are printed and disagreed with ``many of the opinions
expressed by others'' on its pages.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Republic, however, called Quinn a ``neo-Confederate'' and said his
magazine prints the work of ``race-baiters.'' McCain was questioned about Quinn
on network television Sunday and said he would not have hired Quinn to run his
South Carolina campaign if he considered Quinn a racist.
</P>
<P>
	   Quinn accused rival George W. Bush's campaign of spreading The New Republic
article.
</P>
<P>
	   But Tucker Eskew, the Bush campaign's South Carolina spokesman, denied
Quinn's allegation. ``We refuse to drag this race into a discussion about
campaign staffs,'' Eskew said.

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton has helped raise $2.6 million for
a special Democratic fund created for the New York Senate race, federal records
showed.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton helped raise the funds at about a dozen joint fund-raisers last year
with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, with the proceeds shared
between her Senate campaign account and the DSCC. The Democratic campaign
committee tracks the amounts raised at Clinton's events but is prohibited by law
from specifically earmarking the money to go to the New York race.
</P>
<P>
	   But DSCC officials freely admit they expect to spend heavily in New York and
already have spent about $250,000 on a television advertisement touting the
first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say the funding mechanism, which is legal, lets candidates bypass
campaign donation limits.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the $2.6 million Clinton helped raise for ``New York Senate 2000,''
records show just over $1 million was transferred to her campaign account -- her
share of the joint fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
	   The rest is held by the DSCC, of which only about $1 million can be used to
run ads supporting Clinton's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Republican Senatorial Committee has similar joint fund-raising
agreements with some candidates, but not with New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
Clinton's likely opponent.
</P>
<P>
	   In sum, Clinton has raised $8 million, and Giuliani $11.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise Moderately  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen on mild profit-taking
Wednesday morning. Tokyo share prices rose moderately.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 109.22 yen, down 0.12 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and
also below its late New York level of 109.35 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 110.86 points, or 0.56
percent, to 19,979.74 at the end of the morning session. On Tuesday, the average
closed down 76.55 points, or 0.38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar met profit-taking in early Asian trading,
but many players were still expecting the greenback's strength against the yen
to continue.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar had gained ground in New York, where the currency was lifted by
new signs of a vigorous U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Labor Department said Tuesday that productivity -- defined as the
amount of output for each hour of work -- rose by a larger-than-expected 5
percent annual rate in the final three months of last year, helping offset
pricing pressures.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar came under some selling pressure Wednesday morning by market talk
that Japan's Economic Planning Agency would revise upward gross domestic product
for the July-September quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   But the agency announced later that revised real GDP contracted 1.0 percent
in the period, unchanged from the preliminary figure.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 107.96 yen, up from 107.22 yen
late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices advanced moderately following gains in New York,
where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.81 to 10,957.60 at Tuesday's
close. The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 105.73 points to 4,427.50 to another
new record.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo investors also were encouraged by a series of recent launches of
investment trust funds, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among morning gainers were bank shares, which were sold Tuesday on news that
the Tokyo metropolitan government is considering a bill to tax 3 percent of
banks' gross profits starting in April.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 14.15 points, or 0.81 percent, to 1,751.70. The TOPIX closed down
17.23 points, or 0.98 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.8900
percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.9000 percent. Its price rose 0.09 point to
98.39.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Helps Democrats Raise Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton helped the Democratic Party raise
$850,000 Tuesday night, musing that he has been replaced by his wife, Hillary,
on the campaign trail this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For me, it's actually rather interesting,'' the president told donors at a
$15,000-a-couple reception, the first of two fund-raisers he attended.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to an audience of about 40 people, Clinton said he was struck ``for
the first time in probably 24 years to see an election season come and go when
I'm not on anybody's ballot anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, the president pointed out that the first lady announced her
candidacy Sunday for a U.S. Senate seat from New York. ``I got to hear my wife
make a great speech,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
	   The reception was expected to bring in $350,000 for the Democratic National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, the president spoke at a dinner in Georgetown where guests were asked
to give $25,000 a couple. Many of the guests were from Maryland, and the group
included Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend. The DNC expected to raise
$500,000 from that event.
</P>
<P>
	   The president will fly to Texas on Wednesday for more fund-raising events.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan: Don't Fear Austria Gov't.  </HEADLINE>
   By BOB LEWIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Neither the United States nor Europe has reason to
fear the far-right leader of Austria's new government, Reform Party presidential
candidate Pat Buchanan told supporters Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   During a campaign stop here, Buchanan accused members of the European Union
of hypocrisy and arrogance for freezing diplomatic relations with Austria after
Jeorg Haider's nationalist Freedom Party was sworn in last week. He said the EU
had ``willingly climbed into bed with genuine fascists and people who are
Stalinists and Communists.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the European Union would have been better off to accept the
decision of the people of Austria and move on,'' Buchanan told about 45 people
at a fund-raising reception.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do not see any threat to Europe or the world or anywhere from Mr. Haider
or that coalition government sitting in Vienna,'' Buchanan said. ``But it is an
indication, I think, that any candidate of the right can expect universal
hostilities.''
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has been an opponent of immigration into Austria and European
integration. He has also lauded the Nazi's ``orderly employment policy'' and
praised former members of Hitler's Waffen SS. He has apologized for the latter
comments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is an opponent of their whole global new world order,'' Buchanan said
of Haider.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan caused a national stir last fall with his latest book, ``A
Republic, Not an Empire,'' in which he argued that Hitler's Third Reich was no
threat to the United States after 1940.

Bush Wins Delaware Presidential Primary
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Texas governor George W. Bush won Delaware's
presidential primary today while competitor John McCain finished in second
place, even though he didn't campaign in that state. With all 28 precincts
reporting, the Texas governor had 51 percent of the vote and McCain 25 percent,
a solid victory for the national front-runner. McCain, who skipped Delaware to
focus on the critical Feb. 19 primary in South Carolina, attributed his showing
to the momentum generated by his shellacking of Bush in New Hampshire's leadoff
primary last week.

Four Flee Hijacked Afghan Plane

	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Four men who seem to have been hostages of the
Afghan airline dropped from a cockpit window Tuesday and fled the aircraft that
has been parked in a British airport for two days. Negotiators are still talking
with the hijackers and trying to assure the safe release of the 150 passengers
trapped inside. The aims of the hijackers, believed to be Afghans, remained
unclear. Speculation ranged from an elaborate play for political asylum to a bid
to win the release of Ismail Khan, a former regional governor in Afghanistan
detained since 1997 by the country's ruling Taliban movement.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a dramatic demonstration of the Internet's
vulnerabilities, electronic vandals today disrupted the Web sites of eBay and
Amazon, two of the Internet's most successful companies, in assaults similar to
one that overwhelmed Yahoo! a day earlier. A fourth prominent Internet company,
Buy.Com, also was crippled for hours earlier today in a similar attack against
its Web site. All the companies said hackers did not gain access inside their
computers or retrieve information about their customers.

<P>
	   ZION, Ill. (AP) -- Two small planes collided over a hospital parking lot
today, killing three people, including a popular radio show host. Bob Collins,
the host of Chicago's top-rated morning program for the past decade, was in a
plane that crashed onto the hospital's roof, said WGN-AM spokeswoman Debbie
Linch. The other person on the plane, who was not identified, was also killed.
The other plane, a four-seat Cessna 172, crashed into a nearby street, killing
the one person on board, said Zion Fire Chief David LaBelle. The impact of the
crash blew the windows out of the top floor of Midwestern Regional Medical
Center. Two hospital workers were slightly burned. Zion is about 45 miles north
of Chicago.

Earth Dodges Asteroid 'Threat'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An asteroid initially thought to be on a possible
collision course with Earth in 2022 will miss the planet by millions of miles,
astronomers said today after reviewing new data. For the fifth time in two
years, reports of Earth-threatening asteroids were proven wrong within days of
being announced. Some scientists fear the public may become desensitized to the
warnings. The object also was being followed at the Near Earth Object Program at
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
but it quickly became apparent that the half-mile-wide rock posed no real
threat. The laboratory has never issued an asteroid collision warning.

<P>
	   BRANDON, Miss. (AP) -- The alleged leader of a satanic group accused of
masterminding the deadly shootings at Pearl High School pleaded guilty today to
a lesser charge of conspiracy. Grant Boyette, 21, had been charged with three
counts of accessory to murder in the Oct. 1, 1997, shooting deaths of two
students and the fatal stabbing of Mary Woodham, the mother of one of his

<P>
    UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Ron Francis scored his 15th goal with 2:31 left to
give the Carolina Hurricanes a 4-3 victory over the New York Islanders on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis wristed the puck over goalie Roberto Luongo's glove to give the
Hurricanes their first road victory in six games (1-5-0).
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Daniels, Martin Gelinas and Andrei Kovalenko also scored for Carolina,
and Arturs Irbe made 17 saves.
</P>
<P>
	   Islanders goalie Kevin Weekes made 33 saves before leaving early in the
third period because of muscle cramps. Luongo made 12 saves.
</P>
<P>
	   New York lost its fourth straight game after a three-game winning streak.
Josh Green, Mariusz Czerkawski and Claude Lapointe scored for the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
	   Daniels gave the Hurricanes a 1-0 lead at 4:10 of the first period at the
end of his own four-shot flurry at Weekes, who stopped the first three chances
before accidentally knocking the puck over the goal line with his arm.
</P>
<P>
	   Gelinas capped a 3-on-2 break by tapping in Paul Coffey's perfect cross-ice
pass at 8:38 to give Carolina a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Czerkawski scored on a power-play goal at 13:00, flipping in a close-range
shot while falling. The Islanders, who have the league's second-worst power play
(23-for-201, 11.0 percent), have scored at least one man-advantage goal in a
season-high five straight games.
</P>
<P>
	   Green tied it 35 seconds into the second period when he tipped in Ray
Giroux's shot
</P>
<P>
	   Kovalenko restored Carolina's lead at 5:05 when he finished off a 2-on-none

point.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Hocker Hall of Famer Sid Abel, who centered Detroit's
high-scoring line between Gordie Howe and Ted Lindsay, and later coached the Red
Wings to the Stanley Cup Finals four times, died Tuesday of heart failure. He
was 81.
</P>
<P>
	   Abel also had cancer and emphysema and had undergone hip surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``Production Line'' was the National Hockey League's premier offensive
juggernaut that made Detroit the first of the league's great dynasties. With
Abel centering Howe and Lindsay, the Red Wings won the first four of their
league-record seven consecutive regular-season titles and three Stanley Cups.
</P>
<P>
	   Abel was a player, general manager, coach and broadcaster in his 32 years in
the Red Wings organization.
</P>
<P>
	   He accumulated 472 points (189 goals, 283 assists) in 613 career games and
ranks No. 11 in all-time team scoring for the Red Wings.
Pablo Elvira Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) -- Pablo Elvira Jr., widely known baritone, died
Saturday of natural causes. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
	   The turning point in Elvira's singing career was his introduction to Pablo
Casals and a successful audition that led to him touring and recording with
Casals' Oratorio for world peace.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1966, he participated in the Metropolitan Opera Auditions in New York and
was selected by the Dean of the Indiana University School of Music to join their
voice faculty. He remained there for eight years and performed leading baritone
roles in the opera school's productions.
</P>
<P>
	   After a year spent performing in Europe, he returned briefly to Indiana
before moving to New York and debuting with New York City's Metropolitan Opera
in 1978, becoming one of the leading baritones.
</P>
<P>
	   While in New York, he performed with such opera greats as Joan Sutherland,
Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo.
Don Gallinger
</P>
<P>
	   PORT COLBORNE, Ontario (AP) -- Don Gallinger, the former Boston center
banned for life by the National Hockey League for betting on the Bruins, died
Monday. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
	   Gallinger and teammate Billy Taylor were suspended on March 9, 1948, for
``conduct detrimental to hockey and for associating with a known gambler.'' Both
were reinstated in 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   Gallinger joined the Bruins in 1942 at the age of 17, and had 65 goals and
88 assists in 222 games.
Kenneth Gormin
</P>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Kenneth Gormin, a journalist credited with helping to
keep tempers cool when New Orleans' public schools desegregated four decades
ago, died Monday of a heart attack. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   Gormin's journalism career started when he was in high school in Minnesota,
where he was a reporter for The St. Paul Pioneer Press. Later he worked for The
New Orleans Item and The Times-Picayune, before moving to Bauerlein Advertising
and Public Relations Agency, which he headed for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1960, Gormin worked with a committee of black and white civic leaders to
ensure everything went smoothly with desegregation.
</P>
<P>
	   When Pope John Paul II visited New Orleans in 1987, he gave Gormin the
Benemerenti Award for his archdiocesan work.
</P>
<P>
	   Survivors include his wife, two daughters, two brothers, and a sister.
Fred M. Hattersley Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Fred M. Hattersley Jr., a photographer who taught
creativity and self expression and often sparked controversy with his images,
died Saturday. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
	   Hattersley started teaching at Rochester Institute of Photography in the
1950s before his career took him to Columbia University, the Smithsonian and
Oxford University.
</P>
<P>
	   His photos were often considered ground-breaking for their creativity. His
1962 photo essay ``Black and White in Color'' sparked a furor because it
depicted an image of a nude interracial couple in a time of segregation.
</P>
<P>
	   Hattersley also was a longtime columnist for Popular Photography magazine
and wrote nine books, including ``Discover Yourself Through Photography.''
Doug Henning
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Doug Henning, the mustachioed hippie magician who helped
repopularize the craft in the 1970s with TV specials and Broadway shows, died
Monday in Los Angeles from liver cancer. He was 52.
</P>
<P>
	   Henning's shaggy hair, bushy mustache and tie-dyed shirts -- replaced later
by more flamboyant shimmery costumes -- became well-known in the United States
in the 1970s and '80s. His rock musical ``The Magic Show'' ran on Broadway for
more than four years in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   The attention Henning won on Broadway helped Henning land an NBC special
called ``The World of Magic.''
</P>
<P>
	   He recreated Harry Houdini's ``Water Torture Escape'' before a live
audience, and ratings were so good that NBC made the show an annual event. The
shows won an Emmy award and seven Emmy nominations and made Henning one of the
world's best-known magicians.
</P>
<P>
	   He toured the country several times and returned to Broadway in the 1980s
with ``Merlin'' -- nominated for five Tony awards -- and ``Doug Henning's World
of Magic.''
</P>
<P>
	   He sold many of his illusions to competitor David Copperfield and ran
unsuccessfully in elections in England in 1992 and Canada in the mid-1990s as a
member of the Natural Law party.
Terry Leedom
</P>
<P>
	   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Terry Leedom, The Citadel's voice during its
struggle to keep women out of the school, died Saturday. He was 61.
</P>
<P>
	   Leedom had been hospitalized since a heart attack Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
	   He was public relations director and the school's spokesman in the mid-1990s
as it tried to block women from the all-male Corps of Cadets. He was also there
as the school took its first steps into co-education.
</P>
<P>
	   Leedom arrived at The Citadel in 1995 and quickly became well known as
national media focused attention on the state-supported military college during
Shannon Faulkner's fight to become the school's first female cadet.
</P>
<P>
	   Before going to The Citadel, Leedom was a public affairs consultant and
radio talk show host in Albuquerque, N.M.
Anatoliy Lupynis
</P>
<P>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Anatoliy Lupynis, a Ukrainian nationalist leader who
spent 27 years in Soviet labor camps and prisons, died Saturday. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
	   Details on the cause of death were not available.
</P>
<P>
	   He was first arrested in 1956 on charges of anti-Soviet propaganda. He
nearly lost his sight and used crutches after being released from his final
prison term in 1983, but that did not stop him from continuing his dissident
activities.
Dave Peverett
</P>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- ``Lonesome'' Dave Peverett, who as lead singer of the
British blues-rock quartet Foghat produced rock staples such as ``Slow Ride''
and ``Honey Hush,'' died Monday of complications from kidney cancer. He was 56.
</P>
<P>
	   Heavily influenced by blues and early rock 'n' roll, Foghat built a large
base of fans through frequent touring and produced such hits at ``Slow Ride,''
``Third-Time Lucky'' and ``Driving Wheel'' in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   Foghat's albums included ``Fool for the City,'' ``Foghat,'' ``Rock and Roll
Outlaws,'' ``Night Shift,'' and ``Stone Blue.'' It was their seventh album,
``Foghat Live,'' in 1977 that brought them their biggest success, going double
platinum.
</P>
<P>
	   The band, which broke up for a time in the 1980s, reunited in 1993 and found
new fans that year when ``Slow Ride'' and the band's version of ``I Just Want to
Make Love to You'' were on the soundtrack of the movie ``Dazed and Confused.''
Jack Scott
</P>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES -- Jack Scott, who gained fame by helping Patty Hearst flee from
the FBI, died Sunday of throat cancer. He was 57.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott became a guru to basketball star Bill Walton and more recently was a
physical therapist to such track stars as Carl Lewis and Tommie Smith. He was
dedicated to treating athletic injuries without resorting to drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   A graduate of Stanford University and the University of California at
Berkeley, Scott became sports editor of the radical Ramparts Magazine and later
took a job as physical education director of Oberlin College in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1974, he heard about the SLA and came back to Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyers last week had tried to get an emergency order for Scott's
testimony for the trial of Sara Jane Olson, a former Symbionese Liberation Army
fugitive.
Derrick Thomas
</P>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Derrick Thomas, one of the most feared defenders in the
National Football League and a nine-time Pro Bowl player, died Tuesday less than
a month after being paralyzed in a car crash on an icy road. He was 33.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors have not determined an exact cause of death and might perform an
autopsy. One of Thomas' doctors, Dr. Barth Green, said a massive blood clot
probably killed Thomas.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas was driving a car during a snowstorm on Jan. 23 as he and two friends
headed to the Kansas City airport to fly to St. Louis for the NFC Championship
game. He lost control of the car and it overturned at least three times.
</P>
<P>
	   An All-American at Alabama, the 6-foot-3, 255-pound Thomas became an
immediate star as a pass-rushing specialist after being taken in the first round
of the 1989 draft. He was an All-Pro in his first nine seasons and ranked ninth
on the career list with 126.5 career sacks.
</P>
<P>
	   With one of the quickest first moves of any defender in the league, Thomas
became known for his ``sack and strip'' move, where he closed fast on a
quarterback's blind side and hacked at his arm to knock the ball out of his
hand.
</P>
<P>
	   He set the single-game sack record in 1990 in a game against Seattle.
Robert M. Wolpers
</P>
<P>
	   POPLAR BLUFF, Mo. (AP) -- Robert M. Wolpers, editor and publisher of the
Poplar Bluff Daily American Republic for nearly half a century, died Friday. He
was 84.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolpers' parents, John H. and Hattie Kinder Wolpers, founded the newspaper
in 1916. Wolpers took over at his father's request in 1942. He retired in 1988
when the family-owned newspaper was sold to Woodward Communications of Dubuque,
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   As publisher, he led the newspaper in support of several civic causes,
including reestablishment of a public swimming pool in the 1950s, enhancement of
parks, flouridation of water, bond issues for better schools, and establishment
of a community college.
</P>
<P>
	   Survivors include his wife, two daughters and one son.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Travel Cos. To Issue Refunds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Four Florida-based travel companies, including two
that employ celebrity spokesman Robin Leach, have been ordered to pay full or
partial refunds to settle claims they duped consumers into buying vacation
packages.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth said Tuesday the companies will
make the refunds under separate agreements with Florida, 16 other states and the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies admitted no wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach is a spokesman for Fort Lauderdale-based National Travel Services Inc.
and Plaza Resorts Inc., both owned by James Verrillo and Daniel Lambert. An
investigation into Leach's involvement in the deceptive practices is continuing,
the attorney general's office said.
</P>
<P>
	   The other two companies are Florida Travel Network Inc., owned by James
Herron Sr. and Vance Vogel, and Crown Plaza Resorts, owned by Vogel. Both are in
Treasure Island.
</P>
<P>
	   "All of the companies led consumers to believe they had won free vacations,"
Butterworth said. "What they got instead was a high-pressure sales pitch to pay
as much as $1,000 for a seven-day Florida vacation and a 'Bahamas cruise.' In
some instances, the Bahamas cruise amounted to a one-day ferry ride and a game
of bingo."
</P>
<P>
	   In some cases, Butterworth said, customers who paid for vacation packages
were provided substandard accommodations and subjected to lengthy sales
presentations for time shares.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers can seek a refund by filing a complaint within 30 days with the
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar agreements were reached in Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia,
Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a judge in Santa Fe, N.M. on Tuesday ordered Leach to pay a
$30,000 fine and to stop marketing the vacation packages in that state. Leach,
best known for the TV series "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous," was sued by
New Mexico's attorney general last July.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach's Florida attorney, Richard Epstein, said he was "surprised and
extremely dismayed" by the ruling. Epstein said he had not been notified of the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Epstein said he would consult with Leach's New Mexico counsel before
deciding what to do next.

<HEADLINE> Trump Unveils Health Care Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By CONNIE FARROW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Real estate tycoon Donald Trump sounded Tuesday like a man
running for president although he insisted he hadn't decided whether to seek the
Reform Party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump outlined a health care plan during a 20-minute huddle with reporters
at a private terminal near Lambert Airport. Trump was in town to speak at an
Anthony Robbins motivational seminar but also was expected to talk with members
of Missouri's Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In so many ways I'm so in favor of running because I think I could really
do a good job,'' the New York developer said when asked whether he would run for
president. ``I think I could reduce taxes. I'd stop the Americans -- us -- from
being ripped off by all the foreign companies that are ripping us big league. In
so many ways I think I'd do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
	   Chief on the list of things holding Trump back from announcing his candidacy
is factional infighting within the party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's no question about this, that you're going to have to get unity in
this party if a candidate is going to have a chance to win, not a chance to do
just OK or well, but to win,'' he said. ``I would only be interested in running
if I could win.''
</P>
<P>
	   Trump has asked Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, the Reform Party's highest
election official, and party founder Ross Perot to use their leadership to
negotiate a truce. Ventura, who is close to Trump, supports national party
chairman Jack Gargan, while Perot allies view him as a problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump said economists were still working on the financial details of his
health care plan, which includes giving vouchers to the unemployed so they can
buy some of the basic coverage that workers get. Trump also would expand
Medicare to cover prescription drugs for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 40 million Americans have no health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked why he would roll out a health care plan before deciding whether
to run, Trump replied: ``I like to be different, I guess.''

<HEADLINE> Suns 94, Grizzlies 76  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Luc Longley, criticized last week by team owner Jerry
Colangelo, scored a season-high 20 points Tuesday night as the Phoenix Suns beat
the Vancouver Grizzlies for the ninth consecutive time 94-76.
</P>
<P>
	   Penny Hardaway added 13 points on 6-for-7 shooting and grabbed eight
rebounds as the Suns improved to 20-5 at home.
</P>
<P>
	   After missing 31 games while recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery,
rookie Shawn Marion had 10 points and seven rebounds in 19 minutes for Phoenix,
which had six players in double figures.
</P>
<P>
	   The Suns led from the opening basket, were up by 11 in the first quarter,
led 10 in the second and had a 14-point edge entering the fourth.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver's all-Arizona backcourt of Michael Dickerson and Mike Bibby
provided much of the Grizzlies' offense. Dickerson scored 19 and Bibby 12.
Shareef Abdur-Rahim, coming off a 36-point, 22-rebound game at Dallas Sunday,
had 13 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Longley, accused last week by Colangelo of not playing up to the big
contract he signed with the Suns before last season, scored 14 in the first
half. He finished 9-for-14 from the field with six rebounds, coming within four
points of his career high.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Gugliotta added 12 points and Jason Kidd had 11 points, nine assists and
seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The Suns put the game away with an 11-0 run that began with Hardaway's
three-point play with 1:26 left in the third quarter. Cliff Robinson's two free
throws capped the surge and put Phoenix up 82-62 with 9:08 to play.

<HEADLINE> Bush Wins Delaware Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush won Delaware's
presidential primary Tuesday and earned a badly needed boost into a Southern
showdown, even as antagonist John McCain burnished his insurgent candidacy by
finishing second in a state where he did not campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   A weak third-place finish by Steve Forbes doomed his candidacy. A senior
adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said aides were recommending that
the candidate depart the race -- and he was likely to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think this is a piece of good news that will buoy our supporters,''
Bush, the Texas governor, told The Associated Press after securing the state's
12 delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. McCain, who skipped Delaware to focus on the critical Feb. 19 primary
in South Carolina, attributed his showing to the momentum generated by his
shellacking of Bush in New Hampshire's leadoff primary last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's bound to give us a boost,'' the Arizona senator told The AP. ``I
think there are some good signs for us, but I think we still have a long, long
way to go. I'm still the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes finished a disappointing third after spending $60 million on two
successive presidential bids, and was taking stock of his campaign. ``Clearly,
we would have liked to have done better. We will go on to Michigan and South
Carolina and assess the situation as things move forward,'' campaign manager
Bill Dal Col told The AP.
</P>
<P>
	   With all 28 precincts reporting, the Texas governor had 51 percent of the
vote and McCain 25 percent, a solid victory for the national front-runner.
Though far behind Bush, the Arizonan did surprisingly well for a candidate who
didn't visit or spend money in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, Forbes had 20 percent after winning the state's primary in 1996
and campaigning heavily in the state this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Former ambassador Alan Keyes had just 4 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats voted Saturday in Delaware, giving Vice President Al Gore an easy
victory over Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in Delaware suggested McCain benefited from a wave of post-New
Hampshire publicity: Almost half of his supporters decided to vote for him in
the week since that primary. And a quarter of his backers were new voters who
didn't vote in the 1996 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The surveys showed Bush did best among voters who are middle class, elderly,
conservative and believe he is likely to win the presidency. McCain voters
tended to be affluent, well-educated and self-identified independents and
moderates who said they were looking for a candidate who stands up for what he
believes.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, who has pushed for a flat tax since his failed 1996 run, did well
among voters who listed taxes as their top concern.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victory in New Hampshire erased Bush's lead in South Carolina and
dramatically shrunk his advantage in California, Michigan, New York and national
polls, as he sought to draw new and independent voters into the GOP fold.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to South Carolina, where Forbes is not a factor, Bush and
McCain intensified their rivalry with an exchange of bitterly personal ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor's spot accuses McCain of hypocrisy over his signature
issue of campaign finance reform. McCain says in his new ad that Bush ``twists
the truth like Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The overheated rhetoric underscored what is at stake in upcoming contests.
Despite his financial and organizational advantages, Bush faces a serious threat
from the Arizona senator. And McCain, with just one victory under his belt,
can't afford losses to his party's front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina will test whether McCain is a one-state wonder or a contender
who can foil Bush and his backers in the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, campaigning to the last at a nursing home, pledged to end
inheritance taxes as part of his flat tax plan. ``You should be allowed to leave
this world unmolested by the IRS,'' he told about 60 senior citizens in a
reception room down the hall from a polling place.
</P>
<P>
	   With little hope in South Carolina, he was flying to Michigan, which has its
Republican primary on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona also holds its primary on Feb. 22 and Bush has campaigned hard in
McCain's home state, and is supported by Gov. Jane Hull. McCain hasn't ceded any
ground in Michigan, where Bush is backed by Gov. John Engler.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia conducts its primary Feb. 29, and Bush is backed there by Gov.
James Gilmore. More than a dozen states hold primaries or caucuses on March 7,
when the nominee could be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won in Delaware four years ago, gaining 33 percent of the vote to
beat Bob Dole, the eventual nominee. But Forbes was the only GOP candidate to
campaign in Delaware that year, with the others staying away in deference to New
Hampshire's insistence on being the first and only contest in the opening week
of primary competition.
</P>
<P>
	   To avoid a replay in 2000, Delaware Republicans opted out of the state
primary last Saturday to hold a party-run election Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Puerto Rico Vote  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- President Clinton has asked Congress for $2.5
million to hold another vote on whether Puerto Rico should become a U.S. state,
the White House said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The referendum could be held as early as October if Congress approves the
request, said Jeffrey Farrow, Clinton's main adviser on the Caribbean U.S.
territory. It was included in the White House's fiscal 2001 budget, which was
presented Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Puerto Rico became a U.S. territory when the United States wrested it from
Spain during the Spanish-American War of 1898. Its 3.8 million residents are
U.S. citizens but cannot vote for president and do not have a vote in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   After a U.S. bill ordering a referendum died in the Senate, pro-statehood
Gov. Pedro Rossello called a December 1998 vote asking islanders to choose
between U.S. statehood, commonwealth, or independence. Supporters of the status
quo won the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the current status also won a 1993 vote.

a game-ending 8-point run Tuesday night that led the San Antonio Spurs over the
Seattle SuperSonics 79-77.
</P>
<P>
	   After Robinson missed two free throws with 9.7 seconds left, Seattle had a
chance to send the game into overtime, but Gary Payton missed an off-balance
jumper as time expired.

take a 73-71 lead with 4:38 to play on consecutive 3-pointers by Brent Barry.

<P>
	   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- No. 12 Florida validated its spot among the
nation's elite Tuesday night, getting 11 points and 18 rebounds from Mike Miller
in a wire-to-wire 90-73 victory over No. 11 Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the fourth straight win for Florida (18-4, 7-2 Southeastern
Conference), which pulled into a three-way tie for first in the SEC East with
Kentucky (17-6, 7-2) and No. 8 Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wildcats came in as arguably the hottest team in the nation, having gone
13-1 since splitting their first eight games and brought up questions as to
whether the dynasty was in decline.
</P>
<P>
	   Certainly it isn't, although the Gators made it look that way at times
before a frenzied crowd of 11,818, many of whom waited outside overnight to get
seats at the O'Connell Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Full-court trapping the Wildcats into a state of frustration, the Gators
took a 34-17 lead with seven minutes left in the first half and spent the rest
of the game holding off Kentucky rallies.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida got the lead up to 19 points early in the second half. Kentucky got
the deficit down to 76-66 with three minutes remaining but committed a turnover
when it had the ball with a chance to trim it to eight.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida scored the next seven points and the Gators began celebrating their
second straight victory in the series after dropping 11 of the previous 13.
</P>
<P>
	   When it was over, the Wildcats could target foul trouble and their own
trouble at the foul line as culprits for the loss. They finished 18-of-29 from
the line, but endured a 3-for-9 stretch late in the first half that kept them
from capitalizing on a 4-minute scoring drought by Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Kentucky center Jamaal Magloire drew his second foul four minutes
into the game and his third three minutes into the second half. He played a
total of 17 minutes and finished with four points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   It spoiled a 24-point effort by freshman Keith Bogans and a 17-point game
from Desmond Allison.
</P>
<P>
	   Teddy Dupay led Florida's balanced scoring with 14 points. Major Parker had
13 and six Gators finished in double figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller's 18 rebounds was seven more than the sophomore forward's previous
career-high and gave Florida a 49-36 edge in rebounding.

</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor's spot accuses McCain of hypocrisy over his signature
issue of campaign finance reform. McCain says in his new ad that Bush ``twists
the truth like Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The overheated rhetoric underscored what is at stake in upcoming contests.
Despite his financial and organizational advantages, Bush faces a serious threat
from the Arizona senator. And McCain, with just one victory under his belt,
can't afford losses to his party's front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina will test whether McCain is a one-state wonder or a contender
who can foil Bush and his backers in the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, campaigning to the last at a nursing home, pledged to end
inheritance taxes as part of his flat tax plan. ``You should be allowed to leave
this world unmolested by the IRS,'' he told about 60 senior citizens in a
reception room down the hall from a polling place.
</P>
<P>
	   With little hope in South Carolina, he was flying to Michigan, which has its
Republican primary on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona also holds its primary on Feb. 22 and Bush has campaigned hard in
McCain's home state, and is supported by Gov. Jane Hull. McCain hasn't ceded any
ground in Michigan, where Bush is backed by Gov. John Engler.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia conducts its primary Feb. 29, and Bush is backed there by Gov.
James Gilmore. More than a dozen states hold primaries or caucuses on March 7,
when the nominee could be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won in Delaware four years ago, gaining 33 percent of the vote to
beat Bob Dole, the eventual nominee. But Forbes was the only GOP candidate to
campaign in Delaware that year, with the others staying away in deference to New
Hampshire's insistence on being the first and only contest in the opening week
of primary competition.
</P>
<P>
	   To avoid a replay in 2000, Delaware Republicans opted out of the state
primary last Saturday to hold a party-run election Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Pitt Coach Won't Dismiss Hawkins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh basketball coach Ben Howland said Tuesday he
was disappointed by Isaac Hawkins' arrest for marijuana possession, but would
not dismiss him from the team.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not something that I look at as being a situation that necessarily
deems dismissal from the program," Howland said. "We want to give him some help,
and give him some direction as well as some discipline."
</P>
<P>
	   Hawkins, 25, was arrested Monday at his apartment, where Pittsburgh police
officers found marijuana cigarettes on the dining room table. Police had been
called by Hawkins' neighbors, who complained of a strong odor of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-foot-8 senior forward is sitting out this season after breaking his
leg in November. He will not lose a year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm one that believes strongly you have to have discipline," Howland said.
"That's something that I'm instituting in this program -- that's something that
we're doing. Your discipline off the floor relates to how you play on the
floor."
</P>
<P>
	   Hawkins' arrest is the latest off-court incident to plague the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Seabrooks was arrested last fall for fighting, pleaded guilty to
harassment and disorderly conduct and received a 90-day suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Fred Primus, a freshman guard, was accused of theft during a trip
to Villanova, an incident cited as a reason for then-coach Ralph Willard's
resignation. Primus was dismissed from the team.

<HEADLINE> Sabres 2, Avalanche 0  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN MOSSMAN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Dominik Hasek made 24 saves for his 43rd career shutout, and
Miroslav Satan scored an unassisted, short-handed goal as the Buffalo Sabres
beat Colorado 2-0 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasek, who returned to action a week ago after missing 40 games because of a
groin injury, recorded only his second victory of the season. Colorado's Patrick
Roy had 25 saves.
</P>
<P>
	   Dixon Ward added a goal with 3:58 left in the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory snapped Buffalo's four-game road losing streak and ended
Colorado's 12-game unbeaten streak at home.
</P>
<P>
	   The Avalanche played without star forward Peter Forsberg, who missed his
second straight game because of a concussion.
</P>
<P>
	   In the opening period, Buffalo, which has the worst power play in the NHL,
failed to capitalize on a four-minute high-sticking penalty against Colorado's
Aaron Miller that included a 5-on-3 advantage for 45 seconds after an additional
cross-checking penalty against Alexei Gusarov.
</P>
<P>
	   But at 13:41 of the period, Satan corralled a loose puck at mid-ice and
scored from the slot -- his third short-handed goal of the season and 27th
overall.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado had an 8-2 advantage in shots in the second period, but again
Hasek, protected by his teammates' neutral-zone pressure, was perfect in a
scoreless period. Colorado had only three total shots on its three power plays
in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Ward made it 2-0, taking a pass from Satan in the right circle, crossing in
front of the goal and backhanding a shot past Roy.

Bush Wins Delaware Primary
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush won Delaware's
presidential primary Tuesday and earned a badly needed boost into a Southern
showdown, even as antagonist John McCain burnished his insurgent candidacy by
finishing second in a state where he did not campaign. A weak third-place finish
by Steve Forbes doomed his candidacy. A senior adviser, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said aides were recommending that the candidate depart the race --
and he was likely to do so. "I think this is a piece of good news that will buoy
our supporters," Bush, the Texas governor, told The Associated Press after
securing the state's 12 delegates.

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a dramatic demonstration of the Internet's
vulnerabilities, electronic vandals disrupted some of the Web's most popular
sites Tuesday by using dozens of powerful computers to spew out a crippling
flood of false data. Internet sites under unprecedented attack included those of
eBay, Amazon and CNN, all in assaults similar to one that overwhelmed Yahoo! a
day earlier. A fifth prominent Internet company, Buy.Com, also was crippled for
hours earlier Tuesday in a similar attack against its Web site. All the
companies said hackers did not gain access inside their computers or retrieve
information about their customers.

Four Escape From Afghan Airliner

	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Four men dropped from the cockpit window of a
hijacked plane and ran to safety Tuesday night, fleeing the Afghan aircraft that
has been parked for two days while negotiators seek the release of more than 150
passengers. They were being questioned after receiving medical attention, and
appeared to have suffered no serious injuries, said Joe Edwards, an Essex Police
assistant chief constable. The aims of the hijackers, believed to be Afghans,
remained unclear. Speculation ranged from an elaborate play for political asylum
to a bid to win the release of Ismail Khan, a former regional governor in
Afghanistan.

Ill. Plane Crash Kills Three
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ZION, Ill. (AP) -- Two small planes collided over a hospital parking lot
Tuesday, killing three people, including a popular radio show host. Bob Collins,
the host of Chicago's top-rated morning program for the past decade, was in a
plane that crashed onto the hospital's roof, said WGN-AM spokeswoman Debbie
Linch. The other person on the plane, who was not identified, was also killed.
The other plane, a four-seat Cessna 172, crashed into a nearby street, killing
the one person on board. The impact of the crash blew the windows out of the top
floor of Midwestern Regional Medical Center. Two hospital workers were slightly
burned.

Trump Unveils Health Care Plan
</SUBHEAD>

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Real estate tycoon Donald Trump sounded Tuesday like a man
running for president although he insisted he hadn't decided whether to seek the
Reform Party's nomination. Trump outlined a health care plan during a 20-minute
huddle with reporters at a private terminal near Lambert Airport. Trump said
economists were still working on the financial details of his health care plan,
which includes giving vouchers to the unemployed so they can buy some of the
basic coverage that workers get. Trump also would expand Medicare to cover
prescription drugs for the elderly.

Earth Dodges Asteroid 'Threat'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An asteroid initially thought to be on a possible
collision course with Earth in 2022 will miss the planet by millions of miles,
astronomers said Tuesday after reviewing new data. For the fifth time in two
years, reports of Earth-threatening asteroids were proven wrong within days of
being announced. Some scientists fear the public may become desensitized to the
warnings. The object also was being followed at the Near Earth Object Program at
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
but it quickly became apparent that the half-mile-wide rock posed no real
threat. The laboratory has never issued an asteroid collision warning.

give the Carolina Hurricanes a 4-3 victory over the New York Islanders on

give the Hurricanes their first road victory in six games (1-5-0). Jeff Daniels,
Martin Gelinas and Andrei Kovalenko also scored for Carolina, and Arturs Irbe
made 17 saves. Islanders goalie Kevin Weekes made 33 saves before leaving early
in the third period because of muscle cramps. Luongo made 12 saves.
