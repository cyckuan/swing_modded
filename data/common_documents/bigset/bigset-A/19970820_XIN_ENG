<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian Prime Minister
Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan and visiting Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that the two
countries will further develop their friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China and Mongolia, which share a border of more than 4,000
kilometers, have made great progress in their relationships in
various fields through common efforts, said Qian during the
meeting with Enkhsaikhan.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are economically complementary and have the
potential and conditions for further expanding economic and trade
cooperation, said Qian, who arrived here today for a four-day
official visit.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to trade and economic relations
with Mongolia and will make efforts to expand inter-governmental
cooperation between the two countries in trade and economy and to
encourage mutual investment and the cooperation between the
businesses of the two countries, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
Enkhsaikhan told Qian that the Mongolian government will boost
the long-term friendship and cooperation with China in the spirit
of the treaty of friendship and cooperation between China and
Mongolia signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Enkhsaikhan hoped that the Sino-Mongolian relationship will be
brought to a new height during the five-year term of his
government, which was formed in June, 1996.

<HEADLINE> UPS and Teamsters Agree to End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Parcel Service
(UPS) and the Teamster's union announced today a tentative
agreement to end the 15-day strike after five days of talks.
</P>
<P>
"We realize that our customers have suffered many
inconveniences, and I want to assure them that our great service
is going to be available to them very soon," UPS chief negotiator
David Murray said at an early morning news conference.
</P>
<P>
The settlement ended a strike that idled 185,000 workers and
most operations of the nation's largest package carrier.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed Monday to a five-year deal that includes
the creation of 10,000 new full-time jobs from existing part-time
positions. UPS also will raise pay for full-time workers by 3.10
dollars an hour over the life of the contract and keep a
multi-employer pension plan.
</P>
<P>
An average full-time driver for UPS was previously paid 19.95
U.S. dollars an hour.
</P>
<P>
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said the agreement was
significant for the whole country because it takes historic steps
toward providing health and retirement benefits for part-time
workers.
</P>
<P>
About 58 percent of UPS jobs are filled by part-time workers,
and their 8 dollar an hour base salary has not increased since
1982. Under the agreement, their starting wage would increase by
50 cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, who is vacationing outside Washington,
praised the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Teamsters, who account for nearly two-thirds of the 302,000
UPS employees in the United States, went on strike August 4,
causing UPS an estimated 300 million dollars in losses each week.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Southern African weather experts
will meet next month in Zimbabwe to discuss prospects for the
next rainy season in the region, Zimbabwe's Meteorological Office
Director Marufu Zinyowera said today.
</P>
<P>
The director said, ''we in southern Africa have decided that
we need to look at the prospects of a drought in the region and
see what we can come up with as a prediction of the coming
season.''
</P>
<P>
He said, ''met officers from southern africa will meet from
September 8 to 12 in Kadoma where we will look at all the
scientific data available and come up with our own predictions
for the next season.''
</P>
<P>
''When we leave we will have a reasoned position on the coming
rainy season which we will review from time to time on a 10-day
basis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Development Community (SADC) regional
Early Warning Unit said in its July report that global climatic
trends pointed to a possibility of poor rains in the region
during the 1997/98 crop season.
</P>
<P>
The unit said events were following a trend frequently
associated with dry years.
</P>
<P>
''Although it is still early to make any definite predictions
concerning the next rainy season... observations of global
climatic data and results of climate forecasting models point to
the possibility of another warm El Nino-Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) occurring during the 1997/98 crop growing season,'' the
unit said.

<HEADLINE> 200 More Tajik Rebels Surrender to Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 19 (Xinhua) -- About 200 troops loyal to
Tajikistan's renegade Colonel Makhmud Khudoiberdyev have
surrendered to the government, the Interfax news agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The rebels surrendered their weapons in the Kabodien and
Shaartuz regions in southern Tajikistan. The rebels have not been
punished and they have the choice of either demobilising or
continuing military service in government units, the report quoted
Tajik Deputy Defense Minister Abdullo Khabibov as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report said the surrender followed an earlier one of 500
troops from Khudoiberdyev's force, which originally was reported
to be numbered at 1,500.
</P>
<P>
According to information, about 50 rebels were killed during
the last two days of fighting with government troops in southern
Tajikistan, while the number of wounded remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
Khabibov said the government troop's major task at present is
to seek out Khudoiberdyev, who is reportedly trying to escape to
the Uzbek border with 60-70 supporters.
</P>
<P>
An armed confrontation between Khudoiberdyev's supporters and
Uzbek border guards took place on Monday night near the Uzbek
village of Sangou.
</P>
<P>
The deputy defense minister ruled out the possibility of
Khudoiberdyev's having escaped to Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
"The Uzbek and Tajik governments have reached a firm agreement
on not allowing rebels to be in the territory of a neighboring
country. In an extreme case, they will be disarmed and handed
over to the Tajik government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tajikistan's current military conflict first occurred on August
9 between the supporters of Sukhrob Kasymov, commander of a
special-purpose brigade of the Tajik Interior Ministry, and those
of Customs Committee Chairman Yakub Salimov.
</P>
<P>
The situation deteriorated when Khudoiberdyev, commander of a
presidential rapid reaction brigade was involved in the conflict
in an effort to support the units of Salimov.
</P>
<P>
Khudoiberdyev reached a peace agreement with the government
earlier last week but fighting was soon renewed.

<HEADLINE> Record VAT Revenue Cuts Government Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The British government's spending
swung into surplus last month, after an unexpectedly large payment
of VAT receipts.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury reported that July's total of just over 8 billion
US dollars in VAT revenue was the largest monthly cash figure on
record. In the same period last year, VAT receipts were 6.08
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The surge was helped by changes to the timing of VAT payments,
which have enabled large companies to pay VAT in the first month
of each quarter. Previously, payment were more spread out.
</P>
<P>
Michael Saunders, a UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said:
"VAT receipts in April were 42% up year-on-year, down in May and
June, and 33% higher in July.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise in revenue also points to stronger economic
activity, in line with the projections in July's Budget. In the
financial year to date VAT revenue was up 7.2% on 1996.
</P>
<P>
The news appeared to give support to the government's forecast,
put forward at the general election, that it will need to borrow
just 17.44 billion US dollars, or less, this year to satisfy
spending plans.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of the financial year, the net public
sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) is just 7.04 billion US
dollars down from 12.96 billion US dollars in the third quarter of
1996-97. The June PSBR has been revised down by 320 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Simon Briscoe, a UK economist at Nikko Europe, said: "These are
fundamentally good numbers and the improvement we are seeing as
the months go by confirm that this Budget forecast is easily
achievable."
</P>
<P>
The Office of National Statistics yesterday reported that the
PSBR in June had been revised from 7.68 billion US dollars to 7.36
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The PSBR for the whole of the last financial year was 36.16
billion US dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. airman has been missing on
the Greek island of Crete since August 12, a press official of the
U.S. embassy here said today.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Larry Gonzales, a satellite
communications expert, disappeared after returning from work at
the Souda base on the island to his hotel in Akrotiri.
</P>
<P>
The embassy refused to comment on the nature of Gonzales' duty
at the U.S. base of Souda. The local press said Gonzales'
responsibility is to analyze satellite messages.
</P>
<P>
Greek police and U.S. secret services launched a 24-hour search
after the missing report but found nothing.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, police found Gonzales' car, a mini Cooper,
abandoned a few yards from his hotel.
</P>
<P>
FBI agents were reportedly due in Crete in the next few days to
join the search and investigations.

<HEADLINE> SFOR: Situation Remains Tense in Banja Luka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Stablization Force (SFOR)
led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) said today it
has increased troop presence in Banja Luka due to the tense
situation in the Serb city.
</P>
<P>
The action was taken after 100 civilians gathered outside the
Banja Luka police headquarters last night before police had a
chance to set up checkpoints, said SFOR spokesman Major John
Blakeley.
</P>
<P>
The crowd later dispersed and the checkpoints were either
dismantled by SFOR troops or by the police themselves, according
to SFOR.
</P>
<P>
Describing the situation this morning in Banja Luka as "tense,"
Blakeley said "we have an increased presence of troops and we are
taking precautions we deem necessary to ensure the situation
remain stable."
</P>
<P>
The police headquarters in Banja Luka saw a potential clash
between policemen loyal to Republika Srpska President Biljana
Plavsic and those controlled by her political opponents in Pale.
</P>
<P>
In a pre-dawn raid on Sunday, elements of the sixth battalion
of the Serb special police loyal to Plavsic took over the building
to search for bugging devices they claimed had been used by
civilian police to spy on Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
SFOR later turned down a request from Pale to use other special
police to take back the police station. They intervened by
escorting the special police back to their barracks and returned
the building to the civilian police.
</P>
<P>
Blakeley said that because the action by the sixth battalion of
Serb police violated Dayton accords on military movement, SFOR
confiscated some of its weapons and banned its activities, except
for providing protection to VIPs.

<HEADLINE> More Cultural Exchanges Urged in Southern Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Mozambican government
official today said unity and economic ties between southern
African countries can be enhanced through the promotion of
cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Culture Director Carlos Jorge Silia said during the ongoing
Linkfest arts festival in Bulawayo, the country's second largest
city that such exchanges provided an opportunity for the
countries to relate to each other's needs along cultural
barometers.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''the SADC (Southern African Development Community)
music festival held in Harare in 1995 enabled people in the
region to see their cultural differences and similarities for the
first time.''
</P>
<P>
''This consolidated our African identity, cooperation among
the states, as well as acknowledgement of each other's
differences in ways of living,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed it is not true that African culture is facing
extinction under massive influence from the western culture being
promoted among youths.
</P>
<P>
The threat, he said, could only come if the older generation
fails to educate the youths about the African heritage which has to
be passed on to future generations.
</P>
<P>
He described the recent SADC theater festival held in his
country's capital city, Maputo, as a huge success.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Ruling Party Stresses Law on Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Kenyan African
National Union (KANU)'s 122 parliamental members reiterated today
that all constitutional reform talks between KANU and the
Opposition must be kept within the existing legislative frame.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully committed to dialogue and consultation within
the existing constitutional and legal framework," said KANU chief
J. Kamotho in a statement on behalf of KANU lawmakers who enjoy a
big majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
"All dialogue and consultations must always be cognizant of
the existing constitutional structures and procedures" with
religious leaders as "impartial" mediators, he said after a
meeting of the KANU parliamental group.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was chaired by President Daniel arap Moi, one day
before the expected reform talks reportedly to be held tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
However, KANU Secretary General Kamotho refused to confirm the
talks, saying it still depends on concerned consultations this
afternoon. But a report from the Kenyan News Agency said today
that KANU has decided on a 37-member negotiation team.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kamotho said the KANU government will not succumb
to pressure to postpone the general elections set for 1997 until
the constitution reforms are undertaken.
</P>
<P>
"Hurried constitutional reformulations, especially in the
current changed political atmosphere of the general election eve,
can easily end up resulting in provisions designed... to satisfy
short term interests," he warned.
</P>
<P>
He also charged the opposition umbrella body National
Convention Assembly (NCEC), which claimed last Thursday the
formation of a 50-member team for talks, has always intended to
cause chaos by calling illegal mass actions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he denied any involvement of KANU with a nearly
week-long bloodshed violence in the region around the coastal
city of Mombasa where more than 30 people, including nine
policemen, were killed.
</P>
<P>
The KANU parliamental group "condemned the perpetrators of the
violence and called upon the national law enforcement agencies to
bring them to book and... do everything possible to restore peace
and tranquillity in the area," said Kamotho.
</P>
<P>
The KANU lawmakers' meeting came at a time when the political
temperature was being simmered as the east African country gears
for the general elections whose date is yet to be fixed.

<HEADLINE> US Housing Starts Unchanged Last Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Housing starts in the U.S.
were unchanged in July although the mortgage rates declined in the
month, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the housing starts in July were at a
1.45 million seasonally adjusted annual rate.
</P>
<P>
But it revised the originally estimated 4.8 percent increase in
June down to just 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Single-family starts, which account for about 80 percent of the
total, increased by 2.7 percent to a 1.14 million annual rate. It
was the second straight advance.
</P>
<P>
But construction of apartments and condominiums fell by 8.9
percent to a 306,000 rate, nearly erasing a 10.5 percent gain a
month earlier.
</P>
<P>
So far in 1997, U.S. housing starts totaled 3.1 percent less
than they did during the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, the starts soared by 41.4 percent in the Northeast.
But they were down by 5.3 percent in the West, 3.7 percent in the
Midwest and 2.4 percent in the South.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.43
percent in July, down from 7.69 percent a month earlier. However,
the rates increased to 7.54 percent last week, highest since 7.62
percent in early July.
</P>
<P>
Applications for building permits, often a barometer of future
activity in the country, rose 1.4 percent in July to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.42 million compared with 1.4 million in
June.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts expected construction in the U.S. would level off
this year while continuing at a healthy pace after the housing
starts had reached an eight-year high of 1.48 million last year.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia, China Sign Extradition Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen signed here today with his
Mongolian counterpart Shukher Altangerel a treaty of extradition
after the two ministers vowed to further develop bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that Mongolian and Chinese peoples enjoy a
traditional friendship, and exchanges and cooperation between the
two countries in the fields of politics, economy, culture and
education have made great progress since they normalized bilateral
relations in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Qian also spoke highly of Mongolia's China policy, which he
said was in keeping with the interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
As for economic relations, Qian said the economy of the two
countries complement each other and they should, on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit, explore new ways to further expand
economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Mongolia is committed to forming a good-neighborly
relationship with China, Altangerel hoped the two countries would
also expand economic cooperation and trade ties. He said Mongolia
was rich in mineral resources and would be happy to cooperate with
China and other countries in exploring these resources.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who arrived here today for a four-day official visit,
held talks earlier with Mongolian Prime Minister Mendsaikhan
Enkhsaikhan. Both expressed the hope during the talks to further
develop friendship and cooperation between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Foot, Mouth Cattle Disease Breaks Out in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Lands and Agriculture
Minister Kumbirai Kangai today said an outbreak of the foot and
mouth cattle disease has broken out in Bikita and Chiredzi
districts of Masvingo province in south Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the congress of the Zimbabwe Farmers Union
that affected areas were far away from European Union beef
catchment areas.
</P>
<P>
He said teams from the Veterinary Services Department have
been deployed to the districts to vaccinate affected cattle while
more tests are being carried out to curb the spread of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of the contagious viral cattle disease which can
cause instant deaths in cattle was discovered last week.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the cattle in the area have been quarantined and
road blocks have been set up to avoid the disease's spread to
other areas."
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, the affected areas are more than 300 km away
from the European Union beef catchment areas, so our exports will
continue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last time that foot and mouth affected beef exports from
Zimbabwe was between 1989 and 1993.

<HEADLINE> Private, Public Sectors' Partnership Urged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- President of Zimbabwean National
Chamber of Commerce Danny Meyer today urged partnerships between
the private and public sectors for economic prosperity in a
concept dubbed "Team Zimbabwe".
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon hosted by the Chartered Institute of
Secretaries, Meyer said economic development in the country was
being hindered by various aspects being turned "political".
</P>
<P>
"It has taken us all a long time to realize that "team
zimbabwe" is the way forward, and to remove the them-and-us
culture which has developed and existed for decades between the
public and private sectors," said Meyer.
</P>
<P>
The private and public sectors, he said, should work for a
common goal to make Zimbabwe and the region succeed economically
and socially.
</P>
<P>
Important issues such as accelerated participation by black
Zimbabweans, creating an enterprise culture, increasing
unemployment, non-availability of funding for projects at
affordable and realistic interest rates, a national industrial
policy have been turned into "political" ones which have much
talk with no action.
</P>
<P>
"We all dearly love our country and we want it to succeed.
Team Zimbabwe is the only way forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meyer chronicled failures or disappointments on the part of
the government, which he said included a failure in reviewing the
educational system to modify it in order to contribute more
positively toward creating an enterprise culture in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The other failures included the continued absence of a
national productivity center, the slow pace or length of time it
had taken to establish a permanent private-public sector
consultative body and the tariff commission, as well as removal
of laws or by-laws which retarded business development or stifled
entrepreneurial initiatives.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's Michelle de Bruin took
her first gold in the 400-meter individual medley Tuesday in the
European Swimming Championships held in Sellive of Spain since she
won three gold medals in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
De Bruin, 27, clocked four minutes 42.08 seconds, the best time
in Europe this season and the third best time in the world, though
she had no qualifying time in this event.
</P>
<P>
Yana Klochkova of Ukraine was second in 4:43.07 and Hana Cerna
of the Czech Republic was third in 4:44.05.
</P>
<P>
De Bruin won the 200 and 400 individual medley and 400
freestyle in Atlanta last year but seldom raced after that.
</P>
<P>
In other races, German Sandra Voelker finished first in the
100-meter women's freestyle final, clocking 55.38 seconds. Martina
Moravcova of Slovakia was second with a time of 55.46 and German
Antje Buschschulte third with 55.50.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 100-meter breaststroke final, Bulgarian Alexander

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Help Farmers with Water Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Vice-President Simon
Muzenda today said water and irrigation and the implementation of
an appropriate land policy are key issues critical to the
commercialization of small-holder agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the 58th annual congress of the Zimbabwe
Farmers Union, Muzenda said the government has now committed
itself to building dams to enable farmers to derive more benefits
from water resources for irrigation.
</P>
<P>
"My government has initiated a medium-size dam construction
program that will cover all provinces," he said.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda said the distribution of seed and fertilizer packs
throughout the country, which was started in 1992, would be
extended again this year.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government is receiving assistance through a
non-governmental organization, Care International, in
implementing an "agro-dealer program" aimed at developing the
capacity of local entrepreneurs to source, store and distribute
inputs to the small-holder farmers.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the rate of growth in small-holder farm output
for food and cash crops had been low in recent years resulting in
many farmers unable to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
"Admittedly, the problem has been partly due to resource and
climatic constraints," he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Intelligence Head Denounces Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Army intelligence
head Moshe Yaalon today denounced Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat for not giving up violence and terrorism as means to reap
political gains.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a security briefing to the Knesset (Parliament)
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Yaalon said that there was
only slight progress in stepping up the cooperation between
Israeli and Palestinian security forces despite the recent thaw in
security relations.
</P>
<P>
Yaalon claimed that the moves taken by the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) in resuming security cooperation with
Israel was only aimed at pleasing the United States ahead of the
pending visit of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was very keen on Albright's first visit to the region
because he believed that this would lead to the calming of the
tense situation, and the PNA could take advantage of this
opportunity to stress the economic hardship caused by Israel's
sanctions taken following the July 30 Mahane Yehuda market
bombings in Jerusalem, the general added.
</P>
<P>
Yaalon believed that the twin bombings, which killed 16 people
and wounded 170 others, were carried out by the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas), an anti-Israeli militant group, as it had
claimed. But he still could not rule out the possibility that the
two suicide bombers were from abroad as the PNA has insisted.
</P>
<P>
The intelligence chief also charged that Arafat was trying to
unite all Palestinian opposition groups in an attempt to
strengthen the capability to sponsor what was called "spontaneous
violence" against Israel. He criticized Arafat for refusing to
crack down on terrorism and their infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, Palestinian officials were quoted by Israel
Radio as condemning Yaalon for his consistent anti-Palestinian
attitude. They noted that this was not the first time for Yaalon
to try to damage the relations between the PNA and Israel's
General Security Service (GSS).
</P>
<P>
Yaalon's accusation came only after a secret meeting held
Monday night between GSS head Ami Ayalon and Arafat, during which
Ayalon thanked Arafat for his cooperation in investigating the
Mahane Yehuda bombings and in apprehending three Palestinian
killers of an Israeli taxi driver last Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Arafat renewed his call for Israel to
lift totally the sanctions on the Palestinian people, including
a total closure on the territories and the continued freeze on
most of tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
Despite the exchange of charges, Israeli, Palestinian and
U.S. representatives conducted joint investigations today into
the Jerusalem bombings. They detonated some explosives uncovered
by the Palestinian police from a Hamas bomb factory near
Bethlehem to determine whether they were the same explosives
used in the twin bombings.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security experts said that the explosion showed
that there was no connection between the explosives, indicating
once again that the suicide bombers were not from the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Israeli Finance Ministry today
informed its PNA counterpart that Israel had transferred 4.2
million dollars of the tax revenues to the PNA. The money, which
was deposited into the PNA account in an Israeli bank, was part
of the total 14 million dollars withheld by Israel following the
Mahane Yehuda bombings.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced Monday to partially release the frozen money
as a reward for the partial security cooperation provided by the
Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said that Israel
was still demanding the PNA to take tougher measures against
terror organizations and their infrastructure, and Israel's
further easing of the sanctions depends on the PNA's actions on
this issue.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Wants U.N. to Adopt Measures on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government wants to
see the U.N. adopting measures to ensure the implementation of its
resolutions on the Cyprus issue, a Cypriot government spokesman
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Manolis Christofides
stressed that it is the time for the U.N. to examine all available
ways to promote the implementation of their resolutions on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Cyprus expects the U.N. and the Security Council
to "present an objective picture" of the direct talks already held
between President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Special Advisor to the U.N. Secretary-General Diego Cordovez,
who chaired the two rounds of direct talks between the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides, will present his report on the talks to the
Security Council on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The first round of talks between Clerides and Denktash was
held in mid-July in Troutbeck, near New York, and the second was
held last week in Glion, near Montreux, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
In Montreux, Denktash rejected unofficial documents presented
by Cordovez on the guidelines leading to a resolution of the
Cyprus problem and threatened to walk out of the talks if he
was in any way pressured to sign them.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader also threatened that he would not
attend any further talks if accession talks between the European
Union and Cyprus go ahead as scheduled for early next year.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said the Cypriot government expects the Security
Council, taking into consideration the continued impasse toward a
Cyprus settlement, to examine available methods for breaking the
deadlock and implementing its resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He severely criticized both Turkey's and Denktash's attitude at
the talks, stressing that it was "completely contrary to the
spirit and the letter of the U.N.'s invitation."
</P>
<P>
Christofides reiterated the government's firm positions on the
nature of a solution of the Cyprus problem, saying that a solution
must be based on a single and indivisible sovereignty, territorial
integrity, independence, one international personality and one
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The principles are roughly the same as those pursued by the
United Nations regarding the Cyprus issue. And about 1,200
U.N. peacekeepers patrol the 180-kilometer "Green Line" between
the two Cypriot communities.
</P>
<P>
A settlement must also exclude union, in whole or in part, with
another country as well as partition or secession, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when
the island was divided after the Turkish troops invaded and
took over the northern third in the wake of a short-lived
coup seeking union with Greece.

UNITED NATIONS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today appointed Olara Otunnu of Uganda as his Special
Representative to study the impact of armed conflict on children,

<HEADLINE> Egypt Transfers 10 Million Dollars to PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has ordered a transfer of 10 million U.S. dollars at once to the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) which suffers from a
financial freeze imposed by Israel, Egypt's MENA news agency said
today.
</P>
<P>
During a telephone contact today, Mubarak informed PNA
President Yasser Arafat that he is making efforts to ease the
financial crisis through which the Palestinian government and its
people are passing through.
</P>
<P>
Israel said Monday it is to free about 30 percent of the
transfers in taxes and customs duties Israel has withheld from
Palestinian self-rule areas since the July 30 bombing in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel said the easing was in response to "partial cooperation"
in the investigation into last month's double suicide bombing, but
insisted that an end to Israel's financial blockade hinges on
whether Arafat cracks down on terrorists.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli Treasury Ministry spokesman said some 134 million
shekels (34 million dollars) has been frozen since the attack,
carried out by two suicide bombers who killed 14 other Israeli
civilians.
</P>
<P>
But Palestinian officials say Israel has kept back some 220
million shekels (62.5 million dollars) of the money, owed under a
1994 agreement on economic links between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been working with the U.S. to lift other punitive
measures, including overall closure of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

<HEADLINE> Russian Foreign Trade Turnover Goes Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian foreign trade turnover
decreased by 3.9 percent in the first half of 1997 compared to the
same period last year, the Interfax quoted sources in the Ministry
for Foreign Economic Relations and Trade as reporting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry experts, the decrease was caused by a
number of objective economic factors, including the attainment of
maximum export quotas in most of the raw-materials branches, an
unfavorable situation for Russian exports on the world market and
the low quality of Russian products.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they said, "the Russian market has been filled with
foreign-made consumer goods, while tariff and non-tariff
regulations have been tightened to protect Russian producers.
</P>
<P>
Russian exports in January to June 1997 shrank by 2.4 percent
compared to the same period of 1996 and did not exceed 40.4
billion US dollars, according to the Russian state Statistics
Committee and customs services.
</P>
<P>
It said that Natural gas, which accounted for 21.6 percent of
Russian exports and crude oil, 18.2 percent, were the main Russian
exports.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Namibia to Build Hydro-electric Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The building of a
hydro-electricity dam on the Cunene River in Namibia was both
technically and financially viable, Namibian President Sam Nujoma
said today.
</P>
<P>
Sources reaching here today quoted Nujoma as saying that an
in-depth engineering, financial and environment study was
expected to be completed by October.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said that his government would not be deterred by the
misguided activities of those who want to impede the national
economic development and the upliftment of the standards of
people.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma's remarks was apparently referring to Namibia's
Ovahimba people, who have threatened to take legal action if the
government went ahead with the dam-building scheme.
</P>
<P>
The Ovahimba's ancestral sites and grazing land reportedly
would be flooded if the dam was built on the Cunene River.
</P>
<P>
Ovahimba's Chief Hikuminue Kapika warned recently if the dam
was built, "we will all gather there and they have to build the
dam on top of us".

AMMAN, August 19 (Xinhua) - King Hussein of Jordan today
called on the U.S. to continue its effort for Mideast peace in
order to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Hussein made the remark while meeting a U.S. congressional
delegation, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The king stressed the need to resume and intensify the efforts
to push forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations which
have been stalled since Israel began construction of a Jewish
settlement in East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the necessity to overcome the crisis after the
double suicide bombings on July 30 in West Jerusalem which killed
16 people and wounded 170 others.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation praised the king for his efforts to
achieve peace in the region and underlined the U.S. government's
efforts to help Jordan develop its economy in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which arrived here Monday on a two-day official
visit, also met Jordanian Prime minister Abdul-Salam Majali and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh before its meeting with
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has decided to grant Jordan with 300
million U.S. dollars worth of military aid and 100 million
dollars worth of economic aid to help enhance its role in the

<HEADLINE> Canada's Pulp Industry Invests More on Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Canada's pulp and paper industry
invested 685 million U.S. dollars on capital projects for
environmental protection in 1995, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
This investment represents by far the largest amount of any
Canadian industry, the federal statistics agency noted.
</P>
<P>
The expenditure was 55.3 percent higher than the amount it
spent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Its share of capital investment for environmental purposes
among Canadian industries rose from 39 percent to 42 percent in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Much of the new pulp and paper investment went into pollution
and abatement and control projects, in large part to comply with
the new environmental regulations that came into effect at the end
of 1994, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Canadian industries spent 1.6 billion dollars on
capital projects for environmental purposes in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Combined with 1.7 billion dollars in operating expenditures,
Canada's industry spending on environmental protection totaled
3.3 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In that year, Canada's crude oil and natural gas industry spent
233 million dollars on environmental protection, the second
largest of all industries.
</P>
<P>
It accounted for 14.4 percent of capital spending for
environmental purposes for the surveyed industries.

<HEADLINE> Hamburg Firm Suspected of Importing 600 Ton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A German firm in the northern port
city of Hamburg is suspected of importing 616 tons of British beef
in the past six months, violating a European Union export ban
imposed against the possible human infection of Mad Cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the firm was suspected of having sold 116 tons
of the beef to four firms across Germany between April and June.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear yet whether any of the beef have reached the
shops. Customs officials had been instructed to seize the beef.
Last week, they seized 60 tons at the firm.
</P>
<P>
Investigators also said that documents found during a raid
showed that 440 tons of the imported beef were later shipped on
to eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Hamburg firm owner was briefly detained and released last
Thursday, who told police the beef were imported from Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But investigators believe the beef originated from Britain or
possibly northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The EU ban on British beef was imposed last year following
revelation of the possible link between Mad Cow disease and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Disease (CJD), the corresponding human form of
the fatal brain disorder.

UNITED NATIONS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today welcomed the announcement that the United States
would participate in the Ottawa process negotiations on a treaty
banning anti-personnel landmines, said a statement by the

</P>
<P>
Annan hoped that the Oslo Conference would succeed in
concluding a truly comprehensive ban, which would come to the
General Assembly for endorsement at its coming session.
</P>

He also hoped that there would be progress in the parallel
efforts being made in the Conference on Disarmament to achieve

<HEADLINE> Bonn Opens Compensation Talks with Holocaust Survivors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The German government and a Jewish
group opened a two-day talks today on compensation to Holocaust
survivors now living in the former East Bloc.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's talks were held in the German Finance Ministry and
were described as preliminary prior to the Wednesday meeting
between German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff, Friedrich
Bohl, and representatives of the Jewish Claims Conference.
</P>
<P>
Germany has faced growing pressure to pay compensation, in the
way of pensions, to elderly Holocaust survivors in eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union, who were excluded from the estimately
100 billion German marks (55 billion U.S. dollars) of reparations
made to western victims during the Cold War. Most of the up to
20,000 Holocaust victims live in the former East bloc.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in
Germany, Ignatz Bubis, called for a quick solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
"A swift solution is needed because most of the victims are
very old," Bubis said in an interview with the German Bayerische
Rundfunk radio on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
German opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens
also called on the government to swiftly approve the pensions.
</P>
<P>
While Jewish victims in the West can get a pension of 500 marks
(273 dollars) a month, those in eastern Europe were totally
excluded, said Volker Beck, a leader of the Greens.
</P>
<P>
"The Iron Curtain against eastern European victims must go down
eventually," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Corel Corp. has dropped
its previously announced plans to produce new versions of all its
software in the Java programming language, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Ottawa-based company said it has developed
technology that allows software to run on any kind of operating
system or hardware from a centrally located server.
</P>
<P>
The new technology will replace its plans to write software in
Java, the universal programming language.
</P>
<P>
Code-named Remagen, the new technology allows different
versions of software programs to talk to share information, and
all the program processing and document storage will take place on
a computer server, not a desktop.
</P>
<P>
"It allows people to have low cost of ownership without giving
up functionality," Michael Cowpland, Corel's president and chief
executive, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Remagen is at the core of Corel's plan to grab a larger share
of the lucrative corporate market from its arch rival Microsoft,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The new move also suggests that Corel has abandoned its
much-publicized plan to be the first company to offer all its
software in Java.
</P>
<P>
Corel's first attempt, a Java prototype version of its Office
software, has been criticized by users as too slow.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Orders to Close Embassy in Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone has ordered the closedown of the country's embassy in
Conakry, capital of neighboring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, the order was
announced through a radio in Sierra Leone's capital Freetown
following the demonstrations Sierra Leonean students and others
on exile held against the junta's continued stay in power in the
embassy compound on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that the decision was made possibly because
the embassy has become a rallying point against the military
junta.
</P>
<P>
Conakry is also the place ousted president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
chose to stay after the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, angry Sierra Leoneans who gathered in
the embassy this morning described the order to close down the
embassy as displaced, saying that the junta was irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, a military man who was appointed by the ousted
government of Kabbah, said the embassy would remain open as
wished by Sierra Leoneans in Conakry.
</P>
<P>
The envoy's announcement was widely seen among the people in
Conakry as an attempt to discard himself from the military junta
in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
He has often been accused of collaborating with the Armed
Force Revolutionary Council, the highest governing body set up
after the coup.
</P>
<P>
The embassy compound remains as the focal point of Sierra
Leoneans in Conakry who congregate there daily to hear of news
from home and immediate fellow Sierra Leoneans.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Warned Hezbollah Against Targeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today called Hezbollah's Katyusha attacks on
northern Israel this morning "a very severe violation of the
understandings" between two sides.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who toured Israeli northern border hours after the
attack, said that Israel obviously did not seek any escalation of
tensions in the area, but equally could not accept "very grave
infection" of the attacks on Israeli civilians.
</P>
<P>
"This something we can not tolerate," he stressed, adding "We
have simple principle: if there is quiet on the Israeli side of
the border, there is quiet on the Lebanese side of border."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also urged Syrian government and Lebanese government
to make all efforts to exercise control of Hezbollah, saying that
that the control would be not only in Israel's interest but also
in their two countries' interest.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas fired Katyusha rockets into northern
Israel in two heavy waves this morning. Israeli army sources said
that at least forty rockets fell in the western Galilee and in the
Galilee panhandle.
</P>
<P>
Three Israelis were lightly hurt in the rocket attacks,
including one woman who was treated for shock, and one Lebanese
woman was more seriously injured from the shelling. But exploding
rockets caused quite some damages to buildings of the area.
</P>
<P>
It was the heaviest Katyusha attack since the cross-border
fighting in the Grape Wrath campaign some 16 months
ago. Hezbollah took responsibility for the attack, saying it was
revenging the South Lebanon Army's shelling of Sidon Monday,
killing some seven Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the April truce agreement which ended a
17-day Israeli offensive, called the Grape Wrath Campaign,
against Hezbollah, both sides are prohibited from attacking
civilian targets or launching attacks from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, a Muslim Shiite movement backed by Iran, has been
battling to force Israel out of the buffer zone Israel set up in
south Lebanon in 1985 to prevent cross-border attacks by
anti-Israeli guerrillas.

DAMASCUS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Syrian and Lebanon today
condemned Israeli brutal shelling of civilian targets in the
southern Lebanese city of Sidon, killing at least nine and
wounding many others.

</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also emphasized in the minutes the
importance of cooperation in the various fields, particularly the

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said today in Cape Town that he hopes to host
direct talks between Sudanese President Omar Bashir and rebel
leader John Garang.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told reporters that he had been in touch with Bashir
and Garang, leader of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army
(SPLA), and that he would soon be hosting Bashir, Garang and
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, who is involved in a regional initiative to end the
14-year civil war in Sudan along with other east African leaders,
would also be present in the direct talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Mandela met Bashir in South Africa in an
effort to kick off peace talks between Bashir's government and
SPLA, Sudan's largest southern-based guerrilla movement. He also
held talks with Garang in Cape Town last December.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela did not say when the talks between Bashir and
Garang would take place.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Bashir in Pretoria two weeks ago, Mandela
called on both sides to "sit down and negotiate".
</P>
<P>
He also urged a ceasefire, saying unless this happened there
could be no permanent peace in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
In April, smaller rebel movements in the south signed a peace
agreement with the Sudanese government, but it was rejected by
Garang.

<HEADLINE> China Rocket Successfully Sends Philippine Satellite into Orbit (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XICHANG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The China-made Long March 3B
rocket successfully sent a telecommunications satellite into space
from the launching center in Xichang in southwest China's Sichuan
Province at 1:50 A.M.(Beijing time) today.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunication satellite was made by the US-based Space
Systems/Loral Inc. (SS/L) for the Mabuhay Philippines Satellite
Corporation (MPSC).
</P>
<P>
The success has proved that the Long March rocket, which has
the biggest carrying capacity, is capable of projecting any
satellite with a maximum weight of 5,000 kg into orbit.
</P>
<P>
It also signifies the fulfilment of the contracted task of China
Great Wall Industrial Corporation to send the telecommunications
satellite into space for the Mabuhay Communications Satellite
Corporation (Mabuhaysat).
</P>
<P>
At 1:50 A.M. this morning, the Long March 3B rocket
blasted into the sky with the Philippine communications satellite.
</P>
<P>
Initial data from the Xi'an Satellite Monitoring Center of
northwest China's Shaanxi Province 30 minutes after the
separation of the satellite from the rocket indicated that the
satellite had gone into a geo-synchronous orbit with a perigee of
205 km, an apogee of 44,771 km and a bank angle of 24.6 degrees.
</P>
<P>
The launch was the second carried out by the Long March 3B
rocket, the 46th launch by the Long March rocket family and the
12th commercial launch done by China Great Wall Industrial
Corporation for overseas clients.
</P>
<P>
The Long March 3B rocket is a new three-stage, liquid-fueled
space carrier developed by China. With the "Long March 3A" used as
the core stage, the new model also has four booster rockets used
in the first stage. The enhanced power allows for the projection
of 5,000 kg into a geo-synchronous orbit. So far, it has the
largest carrying capacity among all China-made rockets.

<HEADLINE> Retired Teachers Called to Back Turkey's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Education Minister
Hikmet Ulugbay today called on retired teachers to support the
implementation of the newly adopted eight-year compulsory
education law.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, the education minister
said that retired teachers are welcomed to return to schools
since the country is short of qualified teachers.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, where more than 1.3 million children start schooling
every year, needs large numbers of teachers, Ulugbay added.
</P>
<P>
The minister, whose ministry proposed the controversial
education reform bill, said that the government would encourage
people to choose the profession of teaching.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his ministry would provide financial aid to
those students from poor families to help them finish their
eight years of education.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament passed the bill Saturday with a margin of 35
votes following a heated debate, and President Suleyman Demirel
signed it into law the next day.
</P>
<P>
The new education law enraged the pro-Islamic Welfare Party
led by Necmettin Erbakan, former prime minister, and its
followers since its adoption will lead to the closure of many
schools teaching the Koran.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that the new law is part of the
government's efforts to curb the rapidly expanding fundamentalists
in the secular country.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has announced a loan of 1 billion U.S. dollars
for Turkey's eight-year education project, earlier reports said.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Adjusts Deployment in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The West African Peace-keeping
Force known as ECOMOG is to adjust its deployment in Liberia to
ensure the national security of that country.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted ECOMOG commander,
major-general Victor Malu as saying this at the weekend at the
ECOMOG headquarters in Monrovia, during a visit by Kalu Kaluniya,
the out-going U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' resident
representative in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The commander said that the re-deployment will fortify
Liberia's border with its neighbouring countries, especially with
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the trouble in Sierra Leone triggered off
by a military takeover on May 25 is having an adverse effect on
the security situation in Liberia, which has just stepped out a
seven-year bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fightings in Sierra Leone have reportedly driven a
large number of refugees, including about 200 disarmed militiamen
into Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Malu also took the chance to call on the Sierra Leonean
military government to accept an international request to restore
ousted President Ahmed Kabbah, adding that his troops are ready
and capable of enforcing a reverse of the situation.

CAIRO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) has warned
the Walt Disney Film Production Company and its affiliates against
churning out films that mar the image of Arabs and Muslims, the
Egyptian MENA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
AL Assistant Secretary General Saeed Kamal said that
Washington-based U.S.-Arab Committee on Combating Racial
Segregation had previously warned the company against producing
such films.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the firm had persisted in producing such "brutal
and backward" movies, he said. But the AL official did not
identify those films under attacks.
</P>
<P>
The 22-member Arab League, in its upcoming session, will
discuss a report presented by the committee for adopting
collective Arab measures to confront this phenomenon, he added.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Leaves Short-term Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
(Fed) today left short-term interest rates unchanged, deciding
there was no need to dampen the current economic expansion by
raising borrowing costs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. central bank's decision had been widely anticipated
given recent comments about the "exceptional" economy from Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan and the fact that the inflation is under
control.
</P>
<P>
With unemployment rate at 24-year low of 4.8 percent, inflation
so far has been a no-show in the country. Prices at the wholesale
level have fallen for an unprecedented seven straight months and
consumer prices so far this year are rising at an annual rate of
just 1.5 percent, less than half of the increase in last year.
</P>
<P>
After increasing the interest rates a tiny quarter point at its
March meeting, the U.S. Fed has been content to leave monetary
policy unchanged at its subsequent meetings in May, July and
today.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists are worrying that wage pressures may
finally start to be emerging now that unemployment has fallen to
the lowest level in nearly a quarter of a century.
</P>
<P>
They said it is only a matter of time before wage and price
pressures begin to emerge.
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe the U.S. Fed will see enough threats of
inflation to start raising rates again in coming months, perhaps
as soon as their next meeting on September 30 or by the November
12 session.

WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A 10-member U.S. forensics
team will travel to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) "in a day or two", to resume the search for the remains of
American soldiers still listed as missing after the Korean War in
the early 1950s, The Pentagon said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team will work with a detachment of the DPRK troops in
their search of an old battlefield in UNsan country, some 50 miles
south of the Yalu river, said Mike Sasek, a spokesman for the
Pentagon's Prisoner of War-Missing Personnel Office.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, DPRK turned over the remains of four U.S.
servicemen, which will be repatriated soon.
</P>
<P>
So far, the search has focused on Unsan, where some 350
Americans died in a battle in 1950.
</P>
<P>
"Ideally we'd love to recover all 350, but that's not going to
happen," Sasek said.

<HEADLINE> German Central Bank Leaves Repo Rate Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The German central bank today
decided to leave its key money market interest rate, the
securities repurchase rate, unchanged at three percent, a move
which will bring some relief to money traders who are fearing of
an imminent tightening of German monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after weeks of speculations that the
German central bank, the Bundesbank, was preparing to raise
interest rates in order to arrest strong rises in consumer prices
and check the German mark's steady decline against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
But the inflation danger appear to be easing up as Bundesbank
said on Tuesday that Germany's M3 money supply, which serves as a
key indicator for future inflationary trends, was under control
after growing at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in July, down from
6.4 percent in June and 7.0 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
With the repurchase rate fixed, financial markets are now
refocusing attention on Thursday meeting of the Bundesbank's
central council, which would make decision on the country's two
other benchmark rates, the discount rate and the Lombard rate.

</P>
<P>
The games, second largest sports meet only after Olympics, will
start a new era as for the first time the games will be held in
three cities of Palermo, Catania and Messina.
</P>
<P>
The 19th World Universiade will feature in 10 sports of

for Sicilian people to show their hospitality to the world and at
the same time, a challenge to the organizing committee to show their
organizing skills.

The organizing committee will have a tough task of making the
games a great success, especially as the games are being held in
three cities 100 to 200 kilometers away from each other.

<HEADLINE> Iran's MPs Threaten to Veto New Cabinet Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran's liberal-minded President
Mohammad Khatami today confronted stern challenge from the
Parliament dominated by conservatives who threatened to veto
one-fifth of his proposed 22 cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
This is the first battle for Khatami to fight with rightist
hardliners for his new government since he was sworn in office on
August 4.
</P>
<P>
This would also be the first time for an Iranian president to
face such tremendous pressure from the opposition camp headed by
his presidential election rival Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
The major controversial point between the 54-year-old president
and the rightist camp in the heated parliamentary debate today was
his proposed candidate for the Ministry of Culture and Islamic
Guidance liberal author and journalist Ata'ollah Mohajerani.
</P>
<P>
But behind the open debate is the fierce power struggle
between the two camps because the rightist camp suffered a
miserable defeat in the presidential election on May 23. It does
not want to lose any field in the political arena, especially the
key posts such as foreign minister, interior minister, defense
minister, information minister and cultural minister.
</P>
<P>
Rightist parliament members (MP) today pounded Mohajerani for
his past liberal record and digged up dirt by reminding the nation
of his past association with the outlawed Mojahedin Khalq
Organization (MKO), an opposition group which has waged war
against Islamic government for the past 16 years.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani also came under attack for having supported the idea
of direct talks with the U.S. and promoting liberal ideas in his
defunct weekly called Bahman, which was published for about 10
weeks in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Another member of Khatami's cabinet that came under fire
today was his proposed interior minister Abdollah Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Nouri is the leader of a minority leftist-liberal faction in
the Iranian Parliament called Majma'e Hezbollah (Association of
the Party of God). He served as Interior Minister between 1989
and 1993.
</P>
<P>
The rightists attacked Nouri for a number of things including
his nonchalant attitude toward the MP's and his having gained
his son's military exemption through influence-peddling.
</P>
<P>
Eesa Kalantari, Khatami proposed minister of agriculture, was
also under attack for lack of planning on agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The rightist MP's today also took turns at attacking the
credential of Khatami's proposed housing and urban development
minister Ali Abdolalizadeh who is now serving as Governor General
of the northwestern Iranian province of Eastern Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Abdolalizadeh failed to gain the approval of the influential
Guardian Council to run in Parliament elections of 1991.
</P>
<P>
The rejection by the 12-member Guardians Council is viewed by
the rightists as a sign that Abdolalizadeh is not considered
worthy for ministerial posts.
</P>
<P>
Although the rightists freely criticized all of the four
ministers above, they were a bit more cautious about attacking
Hossein Mozaffar, Khatami's proposed minister for education.
</P>
<P>
He was praised by both camps as a veteran of the war and as a
man who lost his three brothers in Iran-Iraq war (1980-88).
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Khatami would have a hard time
gaining the Parliament's approval for important ministries such
as interior and cultural ministers because the rightist camp
headed by Nateq-Nouri controls about 150 seats of the 270-seat
Parliament.

</P>
<P>
The gifts were presented to representatives of the New York
Public Library, the Boston Public Library and Harvard University's
Yenching Library by the Chinese Association for Promoting of
Culture Exchange and Cooperation, the United World Chinese
Association and China's Cheng Cheng Enterprises Holdings at a

A limited edition of 10,000 copies, the Treasure of Chinese
Classics is truly the most significant and consummate magnum opus
in Chinese publishing history. It represents the concerted efforts
of more than 3,700 scholars and experts in Chinese cultural
circles.

contains 276 million words in Chinese, representing the best
editions of more than 1,000 classical titles covering history,
philosophy, Buddhism, Taoism, arts, literature, medicine, war,
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
It covers a 5,000 years span of the quintessence of Chinese
culture dating from ancient China to modern times.
</P>
<P>
The gifts add a major strength to the three U.S. libraries'
Chinese language collections and will benefit numbers of users
from many parts of the United States and the world, library
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Calls for Immediate Meeting of Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz said today that intensive efforts were being made to bring
the ceasefire monitoring committee to meet tonight instead of
Thursday, the official Lebanese National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The move was made according to the suggestion of the United
States, Boueiz said at a news conference this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The committee is expected to consider Lebanon's complaint about
Israel's shelling of port city of Saida on Monday which killed
nine civilians and wounded 43 others, and an Israeli complaint
about Lebanon's retaliation against the southern town of Jezzine
which is occupied by Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
The five-nation committee, comprising of delegates from the
U.S., France, Syria, Israel and Lebanon, was set up under a
ceasefire accord brokered by the U.S. to end a 16-day Israeli
blitz against Lebanon in April last year.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister warned that if the already
worsened situation continues, Lebanon will consider submitting a
complaint against Israel to the U.N. Security council and its
assembly.
</P>
<P>
Israel strongly denied firing the shells and blamed it on the
SLA, saying the SLA's fire was without the knowledge of the
Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
But the Lebanese Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
insisted that the SLA made the attack after obtaining the
permission of Israel.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Saida held mourning and funeral
ceremonies today for the victims of the shelling, including a
six-year-old boy, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
Faisl Soia, governor of the South Province, attended the funeral
as the representative of Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and the
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
The funeral parade shouted anti-Israeli slogans and some of
them burned down Israeli national flag.

<P>
DAMASCUS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Syrian and Lebanon today
condemned Israeli brutal shelling of civilian targets in the
southern Lebanese city of Saida, killing at least nine and
wounding many others.
</P>
<P>
The condemnation was made in the minutes signed by Syrian Prime
Minister Mahmoud Zobie and his Lebanese counterpart Rafiq Hariri
after their talks here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Syrian news agency said that the Syrian and
Lebanese sides have expressed their appreciation of the
steadfastness of people in south Lebanon against Israel's
aggression, offering their condolences to the families of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
Both the Israeli troops and the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army
shelled Saida, a southern Lebanese city with a population of some
200,000. The raid killed 9 civilians and injured 43 others.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also emphasized in the minutes the
importance of cooperation in the various fields, particularly the
economic domain.
</P>
<P>
The minutes revealed that the two sides had agreed on gradually
liberalizing the exchange of agricultural and industrials
goods. Accordingly, a joint committee of the Ministers of Economy,
Finance, Agriculture and Industry, as well as the directors of
customs in the two countries, will prepare a study on the
coordination and unification of custom duties levied on the
primary material used in such products.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expressed their satisfaction with the progress of
the work done in the projects of electrical grids. It was agreed
to provide Lebanon with some 50 megawatts for the Angar transfer
station along the recently established linkage lines.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Lebanese Coordination Authority for Economic
Cooperation began its annual session earlier in the day under the
co-chairmanship of the Syrian and Lebanese Prime Ministers.

LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe all
extended their Monday rebound from last Friday's steep drop and
made solid gains today, supported by Wall Street's revival and a

</P>
<P>
Leading British shares on the London market ended a buoyant
session on a strong note, sending the FTSE 100 index above the
4,900-level once again to end up 79.2 points at 4,914.2.

<P>
A positive performance on Wall Street helped sentiment and
expectations that US and German interest rates would stay on hold

<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares advanced strongly and closed higher
on the back of overnight gains on Wall Street, firmer bond prices
and a stronger dollar which is good news for German exporters.

<P>
The DAX-30 index climbed 91.02 points to 4,169.62 by the close

</P>
<P>
French stocks on the Paris bourse jumped as well, boosted by a

<HEADLINE> Germany Still Meets EMU Criteria: OECD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Germany is set to go beyond debt
and deficit limits required for joining the single European
currency, but could still be a founding member of the 1999
European Monetary Union (EMU)
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) in a report today expected Germany's budget deficit this
year to be 3.25 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and
overall public debt to rise to 62 percent of GDP, exceeding the
deficit limit of 3 percent of GDP and the debt limit of 60 percent
under the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, "The difference from 3 percent is
well within the range of normal statistical revision so at this
deficit level the criterion could be effectively regarded as being
met."
</P>
<P>
"We would regard 3.2 percent as meeting the criteria," Robert
Price and Grant Kirkpatrick, the authors of the report, told
reporters in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
It has long been accepted that Germany would not make the 60
percent public debt limit, because of the dear costs of
unification.
</P>
<P>
Bonn has insisted that it would cut back public spending to
meet the budget deficit limit, but the OECD report deemed this
impossible, citing lower than expected tax revenue and the high
costs of paying unemployment benefits.
</P>
<P>
Based on full fiscal and economic data from 1997, it will be
decided in May 1998 which European Union countries will join the
single European currency, the euro, which is due to be launched in
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The OECD also noted, "The acceptability of the 1997 budget
outcome should be judged on the basis of whether the underlying
fiscal position is sustainable in 1998 and beyond -- not just in
terms of debt and deficit... but also in terms of tax and
expenditure goals."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the OECD report expected Germany's GDP to grow by
2.25 percent this year and 2.75 percent in 1998, thanks to
continued strong exports. Domestic demand will remain low as a
result of Germany's record joblessness.
</P>
<P>
Germany's unemployment would remain at the current level of 4.3
million, and drop to 4.2 million, or 10.9 percent, in 1998,
according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Britain: Montserrat Evacuation to Begin Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
here today that a voluntary evacuation from the volcano-stricken
Caribbean island of Montserrat will begin Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC radio interview this afternoon, Britain's
International Development Secretary Clare Short said, "A voluntary
evacuation system will start tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
"People will be helped to go to Antigua, be received there,
looked after, fed and housed and then given choices about their
longer term decisions," she said.
</P>
<P>
She also noted that those Montserrat residents would be given
the choice of settling elsewhere in neighboring Caribbean
countries or in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The volcano, which was dormant for 400 years until 1995, has
killed at least 19 people and virtually destroyed the whole
country. A decision to launch a large-scale evacuation was made
last week when new scientific advice suggested that a massive
eruption was approaching.
</P>
<P>
The island's population is sharply down to less than half the
11,000 residents living there before the volcano became active in
1995.

<HEADLINE> World Population Totals 5.75 Billion in Mid-1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The world population was
estimated at 5.751 billion in mid-1996, 0.61 percent more than the
mid-year estimates in 1995, the UN Statistics Division reported
here today.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that the 10 most-populous countries
each with over 100 million people have a combined population of
3.44 billion while people of the 13 countries, each with a
population between 50 and 100 million, number 834 million. The
population of the 23 countries in the two groups above amounts to
4.249 billion, nearly three quarters of the world total.
</P>
<P>
Among the 10 biggest countries, India with a population of
944.58 million came first in terms of absolute growth, registering
an increase 15.58 million people. In terms of growth rate,
Pakistan took first place with an increase of 2.99 percent over
the figure in the previous year, while Nigeria recorded 2.95
percent growth, ranking second.
</P>
<P>
China's population numbered 1.232 billion in mid-1996, 10.58
million more than in the previous year. Its growth rate of 0.86
percent was lowest among main developing countries and only higher
than Japan and the Russian Federation among the 10 leading
countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the third most populous country, recorded a
1.28 percent growth or an increase of 3.39 million. Its population
came to 266.56 million in the latest mid-year estimates.
</P>
<P>
Among the 10 most populous countries, the Russian Federation
was the only country registering negative growth of population.
The mid-year estimates show that the population of the Russian
Federation was 147.74 million, compared to 148.14 million a year
ago.

FREETOWN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's capital
Freetown and its surrounding towns and villages in the western
areas have been put under a 10:00 p. m. to 6:00 a. m. curfew with
immediate effect by the military government, a radio report said
today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement made on State Radio today said that the

</P>
<P>
The release also warned soldiers "harassing peaceful citizens
will be made to face the full penalty of the law."
</P>
<P>
It also said any "soldier or civilian caught looting will be
shot on the spot" while any soldier or armed civilian caught
commandeering or making any attempt to commandeer any civilian
vehicle will be shot on sight without warning or explanation."

<HEADLINE> Marco Polo: Tibet is Province of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Italian medieval traveler Marco
Polo wrote in his travel notes more than 700 years ago that Tibet
was a "province" of China, a Chinese researcher has claimed.
</P>
<P>
Wang Gui, a research fellow at the Military Academy of
Sciences, made the discovery in the English version of "Il
milione," or "Travels of Marco Polo," and shared his find today at
the ongoing 1997 Beijing Seminar on Tibetan Studies.
</P>
<P>
The term "Province of Tibet" can be seen on page 172 of
"Travels of Marco Polo," published by the MacMillan Company in
1927, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Marco Polo wrote his world famous "Travels of Marco Polo" in
1298. It is the earliest European account of Asia.
</P>
<P>
The book's 1948 edition, published by John Company of New York,
also mentions the "Province of Tibet".
</P>
<P>
In his book, Polo wrote, "The Province of Tibet is also under
the jurisdiction of the Great Khan."
</P>
<P>
Wang said the find is "extremely valuable, because the Travels
of Marco Polo is a believable history book."
</P>
<P>
"Kubla Khan trusted Polo very much, therefore Polo was familiar
with the local folk customs and traditions. He also traveled to
some areas inhabited by Tibetan people," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Marco Polo went overland to China across the Pamirs and the
Gobi Desert. After 17 years of itinerant service for Kubla Khan,
he returned home.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Stresses Stabilizing North Caucasus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today stressed the necessity of stabilizing the North Caucasus,
saying that its settlement is essential to Russia's national
security.
</P>
<P>
Dissatisfied with the situation, Yeltsin said at a meeting of
the Security Council that conditions there were slowly returning
to normal, but it remained an explosive region.
</P>
<P>
There are "quite a few hotbeds of tension" in the North
Caucasus -- above all, Chechnya, the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush
conflict and Dagestan, where the situation is extremely
complicated, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Security Council must work out a common Caucasian
approach to solve regional problems.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also said the Interior Ministry, the Federal Security
Service, the Federal Border Service and the State Customs
Committee did not properly coordinate their actions in their
efforts to restore stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
For lack of a single coordinating center between these
agencies, the president complained that he often received
diversified and sometimes contradictory information on the
situation in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
All this "is extremely alarming, as Russia's integrity is at
stake," Yeltsin warned.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation in this region must be resolved in a way
that would not breach the interests of Russia's national security.
</P>
<P>
"All agencies without exception must take serious, additional
measures and efforts to stabilize the situation." the president
added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the interests of many countries, "Not only
those of our Commonwealth, but of foreign countries as well," were
interwoven in this region.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is claiming that the North Caucasus is a zone in its
interests. As our interest fades, the U.S., on the contrary, is
making moves to penetrate this zone and is openly speaking about
this," Yeltsin noted.
</P>
<P>
On the Chechen issue, Yeltsin said it was extremely important
to conclude a large-scale treaty between Chechnya and the federal
authorities.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission drafting the treaty will be comprised of
Security Council Secretary Ivan Rybkin, Head of the Presidential
Administration Valentin Yumashev, Minister for Nationalities
Vyacheslav Mikhailov and Deputy Prime Minister Ramazan Abdulatipov.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the commission must do its work "insistently,
confidently and scrupulously."

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Finland-based Nordic
Development Fund has agreed to provide Nepal with a loan of about
3.5 million U.S. dollars for the construction of the Khimti power
transmission project, the official RSS news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be used for the installation of the Lamosanghu
sub-station component of the project, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The transmission line and the Bhaktapur sub-station component
of the project have been financed by the government of Finland.
</P>
<P>
Once the project is completed as expected in 1999, the
electricity it generates will be connected to the national grid,
the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
The Khimti power project, which has a capacity of 60,000 kw,
will cost a total of 138.6 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> German Economy Increasingly Dependent on Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economy has become
increasingly dependent on foreign markets with exports expected to
account for over 28 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this
year, an umbrella organization of German trade unions said today.
</P>
<P>
German exports expanded by 20 percent from 1993 to 1996 and are
expected to grow seven to 10 percent this year, Michael Geuenich,
a member of the organization said.
</P>
<P>
The boom in exporting is the best evidence of Germany's
competitiveness on the world market, Geuenich said.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted that the economy's dependence on world markets
carried the risk that an economic setback in foreign countries
could also take its toll in Germany.
</P>
<P>
It is therefore necessary to achieve a balanced relationship
between exports and imports in order to ensure a sustained
economic upswing, Geuenich said, adding that the government should
take measures to spur private spending and increase state
investment.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Fails to Agree on Compensation to Holocaust Survivors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The German government has failed to
reach a comprehensive agreement with a Jewish group on
compensating Holocaust survivors now living in Eastern Europe, but
agreed to continue negotiations, a German official said today.
</P>
<P>
"There is still no agreement," said Friedrich Bohl, German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff, after two days of talks
with the Jewish Claims Conference.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to set up a joint commission to make
recommendations on a detailed solution to the issue within three
months, he added.
</P>
<P>
Germany is currently under growing pressure from the United
States and Jewish groups to compensate elderly Holocaust survivors
in east European countries and the former Soviet Union, who were
excluded from compensation made to Western victims during the Cold
War.
</P>
<P>
According to government figures, Germany has paid about 100
billion German marks (55 billion U.S. dollars) to Holocaust
survivors in the West since 1949.
</P>
<P>
After Germany was reunited, Bonn offered a one-time payment to
Holocaust survivors in Russia and parts of Eastern Europe, but
Jewish groups and the U.S. government say that has not been enough.
</P>
<P>
Jewish groups want Holocaust survivors in the former East Bloc
to be eligible for monthly German pensions of 500 marks (270
dollars), the same as Nazi victims in the West. The estimated
numbers of Holocaust survivors in Eastern Europe range from 15,000
to 40,000.
</P>
<P>
Bohl, however, ruled out the possibility of paying monthly
pension to Nazi victims in Eastern Europe. Instead, he suggested
that Bonn would agree to offer one-time payments to them.
</P>
<P>
Israel Singer, chief negotiator of the Jewish group, said after
the talks that "What we've achieved today is a framework for the
solution of a moral problem.... We must work hard in the next 90
days to show the world that we are tackling moral problems in a
moral way."
</P>
<P>
The German opposition Greens Party, however, sharply criticized
the Bonn government for delaying a solution for another three
months. Such a delay was unacceptable because many of the elderly
victims die every day, the Greens said.

<HEADLINE> China Should Expand Mineral Resources Development: Minister (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China will in the next decade
invest several billion yuan in geological prospecting in the
western areas and the development of mineral resources badly
needed by its economy, said the country's top mining official.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, efforts should also be made to attract more
overseas investors to finance development of the country's mineral
resources, Song Ruixiang, minister of geology and mineral
resources, said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said the state has been drafting rules and regulations on
encouraging overseas investors to put money in China's geological
projects.
</P>
<P>
"China will also intensify its plan to go abroad for
prospecting and developing mineral resources and strive to
alleviate the pressure from the ever-growing demand for minerals
by the way of comprehensive, multi-channel cooperation," Song said.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, China has suffered a deficit of 10
billion U.S. dollars in trade for mineral commodities, and related
energy and raw materials, according to statistics, which also show
that China has become the world's second-largest consumer of
mineral products.
</P>
<P>
Song said he believes that at the dawn of the 21st century,
China will face a "serious situation" in terms of availability of
mineral products and resources. But conducting geological
exploration and development projects on overseas land will be "one
of the major strategic measures taken to guarantee a safe,
long-term and stable supply of mineral resources in China."

<HEADLINE> China Should Expand Mineral Resources Development: Minister (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding China's geological prospecting work since the time of
the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
in 1992, Song said the country had scored "remarkable progress,"
and the country's development of mineral resources had gradually
been brought onto a course featuring "sustainable development of
resources and the environment."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that so far, China has found mineral resources
in more than 25,000 places. Since 1992, mineral resources have
been located on over 1,000 of these sites.
</P>
<P>
China has become one of the several mining countries in the
world to have a complete variety of mineral resources and rich
reserves.
</P>
<P>
In terms of gross volume, China ranks high in the area of
verified mineral reserves, mining of mineral ore and the
consumption of mineral products. Geological prospecting and mining
has supported the operation of 70 percent of China's national
economic departments, with mining alone providing Chinese people
with more than 14 million job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The annual mining volume of mineral ore in China amounts to 5.8
billion tons. China ranks the first worldwide for the output of
coal, iron and steel, and cement, and is also a global leader in
the output of non-ferrous metals, petroleum and mineral products
for chemical industrial production.
</P>
<P>
After years of effort, "China has established a strong supply
mechanism of energy, raw materials and mineral commodities," Song
said, adding that this has made "tremendous contributions" to the
country's modernization drive.

in northeast China's Liaoning Province, Wuhan Iron and Steel
Company Group in central China's Hubei Province. A number of large
production bases for non-ferrous metals, oil and gas, and coal
have also been set up across the country.
</P>
<P>
It has also formed a group of large coal mines, industrial
chemical bases, over 9,000 large and medium-sized state-owned
mines, as well as 270,000 township-owned or collectively-owned
mining enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"China will face pressure from a growing big demand for more
mineral resources in the next century," Song said when commenting
on China's future availability of mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2020, China's demands for various kinds of minerals
will be more than double the present level, he said.
</P>
<P>
By then, except for a few kinds of minerals such as petroleum
and copper, China's demand for minerals will exceed that of the
United States' to be first in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it is essential to set up a long-term, stable, and
safe guarantee network of mineral resources," Song said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: American Couple Make 61st Trip to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Phillips and his wife
Mary will leave here in a few days on their 61st trip to China.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, the American couple has visited the country
regularly, two or three times a year. They have been to all 31
provinces and autonomous regions in the country, including Tibet,
where they toured four times.
</P>
<P>
The numbers may sound astonishing, but for Phillips and his
wife, who are keen to learn about China, the best way to
understand a country is to go there and see it for oneself.
</P>
<P>
"Hearsay is not reliable," Phillips, an emeritus professor of
obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, and the
chairman and founder of the American Association of Gynecologic
Laparoscopists, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The trips have made them experts on China, particularly on
Chinese medicine and the country's modern health and medical
conditions.
</P>
<P>
In the past 18 years, they have given hundreds of lectures
about Chinese medicine in hospitals and research institutes in and
out of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We know that China is experiencing a transition from an
undeveloped country to one that is on the road of rapid
development," Phillips said, adding: "What has impressed us most,
however, is the fact that China is interested in improving the
quality of life for its people."
</P>
<P>
Phillips stressed that medical and health care conditions in
China have improved over the past decade, citing the fact that
brand new 100- to 1,000-bed hospitals are being built. Chinese
doctors are open-minded and able to keep up with the latest
developments in the field of medicine, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on her impressions of China, Mary Phillips said the
Chinese people opened their hearts to them and accepted them as
real friends. She talked about the history of their ties with
China, which stemmed from an accident in 1979 when they first
visited the country.
</P>
<P>
During that visit, they found that medical texts and reference
books in medical schools were far from sufficient. Deeply
interested in medical education, the couple made up their minds to
provide more books for China.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, they set up a nonprofit corporation, Medical Books for
China, which called on U.S. libraries to donate books to China.
The company has been growing ever since. So far it has sent a
total of 960 tons of medical, dental, nursing, veterinarian,
pharmacy, basic science books, journals, videotapes, and other
educational materials.
</P>
<P>
Phillips said he and his wife have made some 1,500 Chinese
friends over the years. He also believes that the ties between
the United States and China will grow.
</P>
<P>
"The problem I see is that some people talk about China but
they have never been there," he said,"How do you know what you are
talking about if you have never been to the place?"
</P>
<P>
Mary, a photographer and poet, is more concerned about China's
future. She said that China is moving toward commercialization,
but fortunately a thread of traditional culture still exists.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this thread of Chinese culture will never be lost, and
the strong family ties will still remain," she said.

<HEADLINE> IBF to Apply New Scoring System in World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 20 (xinhua) -- The International Badminton
Federation (IBF) will apply the new scoring system for singles
events in the 1997 World Cup badminton championships which opened
in Yogyakarta of Indonesia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
IBF official Jeff Robson told a press conference that the new
scoring system, which was tried out in the 1996 World Cup in
Jakarta, benefits the television station which broadcasts the
games live with airing commercials during timeouts.
</P>
<P>
The new scoring system allows a 90-second timeout in each set
when eight points have been collected in the men's singles, while
it was 60-second for a women's singles set after six points have
been reached.
</P>
<P>
"If players, coaches and the community give a good response to
the application of this scoring system, it will continue. If all
are against it, it will be stopped," Robson said.
</P>
<P>
Under the old system, a deuce in the men's singles will occur
in the position of 13-13 or 14-14, but under the current one, the
deuce will occur only in 14-14, in which the first player to
collect 14 points may opt for a deuce of one point or three points.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles, the deuce in the old system will occur
in 9-9 or 10-10, but in the new system the deuce will occur only
in been reached in each set.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15 countries and regions will take part in the
200,000 U.S. dollars World Cup event, which ends at August 24.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Tibetan Diagnosis Deciphered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Blood testing is almost always
required nowadays to accurately diagnose poisoning, but in ancient
Tibet, the only thing needed to make the call was saliva.
</P>
<P>
According to newly-deciphered ancient Tibetan medical classics,
people living on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau some 1,000 years ago
could determine if poisoning had occurred by spitting into a
bronze bowl full of water.
</P>
<P>
If the saliva remained on the surface of the water after a
certain period of time, no problem, no poison. If the saliva sank
to the bottom of the bowl, the person was poisoned, but not too
seriously. If the saliva was suspended in the middle of the water,
things looked grim.
</P>
<P>
And to determine the exact cause of poisoning, a victim simply
had to spit onto a finely-textured white stone which had been
heated. If the saliva in the cracks of the stone turned black
after it cooled, the person had been poisoned.
</P>
<P>
"The method is simple, but feasible," says Luo Bingfen, an
associate professor with the Central University for Nationalities
who deciphered the ancient medical classics.
</P>
<P>
The classics were found in a cave in the Mogao Grottos in
Dunhuang, northwest China's Gansu Province, in the early 1900s and
were later looted by Britain and then India.
</P>
<P>
Luo's translation, based on copies of the original text,
includes more than 40 diagnoses and cures for ailments such as
heart, liver, and lung diseases, bone fractures, constant
nosebleeds, skin problems and impotence.
</P>
<P>
Other treatments can also be found in the translation for
people suffering from attempted hanging, those who have nearly
drowned, or people who have been bitten by a mad dog.
</P>
<P>
Luo has also delivered a thesis to the 1997 Beijing Seminar on
Tibetan Studies, which opened here today.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Hail Egypt's Aid to PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Arab leaders today hailed Egypt's
transfer of 10 million U.S. dollars to the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) which is subject to Israel's economic sanctions,
calling on other countries to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Arab League Secretary
General Abdel Meguid as expressing the hope that all Arab
leaderships would cooperate to provide the PNA with financial aid
to "enable it stand up to the (Israeli) collective punishment."
</P>
<P>
Meguid said he held intensive contacts with Arab foreign
ministers Tuesday on efforts to offer immediate financial
assistance to the PNA, in response to PNA President Yasser
Arafat's report two days ago on the deteriorating economic
conditions in the self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza today, Arafat praised the Egypt's decision on Tuesday
of the fund transfer to ease the suffering of the besieged
Palestinians and voiced confidence that the Arab nation will
support the Palestinian people at this tough phase.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt Zuhdie Al Qudra said President
Hosni Mubarak's initiative sets an incentive for other Arab
leaders and monarchs to offer more aid for their Palestinian
brothers.
</P>
<P>
"The move implies a strategic and political significance for
all those seeking a fair and prevailing peace in the Mideast,
including the United States," Kamal said.
</P>
<P>
Adel Attia, chairman of the Palestinian Trade Union here, said
the Egyptian contribution will have great impact in alleviating
the Palestinian economic crises as a result of the collective
punishment policies carried out by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will host on September 7 the emergency meeting of the
Central Council of the International Confederation of Arab Trade
Unions to forge out an Arab stand towards the Israeli measures,
according to Attia.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli Treasury Ministry spokesman has said some 134
million shekels (34 million dollars) in taxes and custom duties
due to the PNA has been frozen since the July 30 attack in a
Jerusalem market carried out by two suicide bombers who killed 14
other Israeli civilians.

<P>
CHENGDU, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Extension Project of the
Panzhihua Iron and Steel (Group) Company in southwest China's
Sichuan Province, which has been completed, is set to increase the
company's steel production capacity to three million tons annually.
</P>
<P>
General Manager Hong Jibi today told a group of Beijing-based
reporters at a press conference that the completion of the project
has changed the layout of the country's iron and steel industry
and speeded up the exploration of local mineral resources,
including a nearly 10-billion-ton reserve of iron ore in Sichuan's
Panzhihua-Xichang area.
</P>
<P>
Hong said the first phase of the iron and steel complex was
built from 1965-74, and had an annual capacity of 1.5 million
tons. And the second-phase extension project, was launched in 1986
and cost about nine billion yuan. The complex is now capable of
producing both hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel plates.
</P>
<P>
Hong said his company has paid back 210 million US dollars of
overseas loans, and that it is the first industrial enterprise in
China that has raised funds from the international financial
market.

<HEADLINE> HK Discovers First Case of Influenza A Virus in Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A strain of influenza A virus,
H5N1, has been isolated in man in Hong Kong recently, the
Department of Health announced today.
</P>
<P>
This virus, known to infect birds primarily, was for the first
time ever detected in man.
</P>
<P>
The case involved a three-year-old boy who died in Queen
Elizabeth Hospital in May 1997 due to multiple medical
complications.
</P>
<P>
Tracheal aspirate of the boy, sent to the government Virus Unit
for testing, grew atypical influenza A virus.
</P>
<P>
Isolates were then sent to World Health Organization
Collaborating Influenza Laboratories in the United States and
Britain as well as a research laboratory in the Netherlands for
further identification.
</P>
<P>
And results showed that the virus was influenza A of H5N1
strain. This is the first time in history this virus was isolated
in human being.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference today, Director of Health
Dr. Margaret Chan advised members of the public not to panic as
there was yet no conclusive evidence indicating the virus posed
any threat to man. Investigations indicated that the boy's case
was the only one found so far.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the importance of this discovery, a special team
has been set up to work closely with local experts, international
experts and health agencies to assess the global health impact of
this strain of influenza virus in man, and, where applicable, to
expedite the development of a new vaccine," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the department is actively conducting field
investigations and laboratory tests with other organizations to
trace the source of infections, she said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a medical team was sent to the deceased's
home to collect blood specimen from his family members. Blood
tests results showed that his family members had not been infected
with the virus and the case is considered to be an isolated
incident, the director added.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate Drug Committee Chief Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Embattled Philippine Senator
Vicente Sotto today resigned as chairman of the Senate Committee
on Illegal Drugs among the accusations on his alleged linkage with
drug syndicates.
</P>
<P>
Sotto announced in a speech before the Senate that he will
inhibit himself from the proceedings of the Senate Select
Committee which is presently investigating allegations linking
some senators to the illegal drug trade.
</P>
<P>
But he asked the Select Committee to allow his legal counsel to
audit the proceedings and represent him during the Senate
hearings.
</P>
<P>
He also challenged the law enforcement agents investigating his
case to charge him in court rather than utilizing the evidence
against him.
</P>
<P>
Sotto was the first senator to be implicated as the protector
of the country's suspected drug godfather Alfredo Tiongco in the
intensive movement launched against illegal drugs during the past
months.
</P>
<P>
He was dragged into the illegal drug controversy after his
chief security officer, Fernando Vinculado, was discovered to be
working allegedly as Tiongco's protector.
</P>
<P>
Vinculado was the head of the Liaison Office created to
coordinate between the Senate Committee on Illegal Drugs and the
Narcotics Command of the Philippine National Police regarding
operations taken against illegal drug syndicates.
</P>
<P>
But Sotto has strongly denied having any direct link with
Vinculado and Tiongco.
</P>
<P>
Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, who is presently the chairman of the
Senate Ways and Means Committee, will replace Sotto as the
chairman of the Illegal Drugs Committee.

<HEADLINE>   Malaysia's Current Account Deficit Likely to Exceed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's current account
deficit for 1997 may exceed the forecast by the government if the
local currency ringgit continues to weaken, Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said today.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government forecast this year's current account
deficit to be 14.8 billion ringgit (about 5.48 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The deficit may be bigger because the ringgit is being kept
pushing down and the cost of imports is much higher, Mahathir told
reporters after launching a pictorial book on Former Malaysian
Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak here.
</P>
<P>
Several Malaysian economists predicted that the deficit might
even reach between 25 billion ringgit (about 9.26 billion U.S.
dollars) and 27 billion ringgit (about 10 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Statistics Department of Malaysia reported today that the
current account recorded a deficit of 1.8 billion ringgit (about
670 million U.S. dollars) in the first quarter of this year, a
marked improvement over the 4.5 billion ringgit (about 1.67
billion U.S. dollars) in the fourth quarter of last year and 3.2
billion ringgit (about 1.185 billion U.S. dollars) for the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said "but we have to look at what it is going to be
like by the end of this year."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir criticized once again speculators like American
financier George Soros for speculative attacks on currencies in
the region.
</P>
<P>
He said these speculators had huge amounts of money in their
hands to undermine the economies of many developing countries,
including Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Now even South Korea is the latest to suffer, he said.
</P>
<P>
"They are crooks who are out to make money for themselves at
the expense of the poor people. And of course, developed countries
are cheering him (Soros) on," Mahathir said.

<P>
HARARE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The newly-formed Canadian
Alliance for Business in Southern Africa (CABSA) said here today
there is growing interest among Canadian businesses to link up
with local companies.
</P>
<P>
Project coordinator for CABSA Emily Evans told the Zimbabwean
News Agency business contacts have been made between the two
countries in mining, construction, information technology,
cleaning services, printing and publishing sectors.

business partners in southern Africa, and just recently we
notified relevant Zimbabwean companies from different sectors and
we expected them to respond any time from now.''
</P>
<P>
Evans said at the moment there has not been much on
franchising developments, but said they are currently waiting for
information from Canada on a company that intends to set up an
airline and another one in the pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
Business developments are in the range of five million U.S.
Dollars each.
</P>
<P>
With more than 3,000 members throughout Canada, CABSA's main
objective is the creation of long term strategic business
alliances between Canadian and southern African firms.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Wholesale Trade Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada's wholesale trade slipped
0.8 percent in June to 17 billion U.S. dollars, following two
consecutive monthly increases, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
However, overall sales in the first half of this year went up
by 11.8 percent from the same period in 1996, the federal
statistics agency noted.
</P>
<P>
In June, wholesalers reported weaker sales in 6 of the 11 trade
groups, mainly in the section of motor vehicles, farm machinery,
metals and food products.
</P>
<P>
As sales fell in June, Canada's inventories rose 1.2 percent
from the previous month to 24.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"High inventories in conjunction with lower sales moved the
inventories-to-sales ratio to 1.42 in June compared with the
historic low of 1.40 recorded in May," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, the ratio "has been on a downward trend, which
partially reflects the `just-in-time shipments philosophy'
introduced in the 1980s."
</P>
<P>
The inventories-to-sales ratio normally peaks during a slowdown
of the economy.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Areas Form Orderly Market System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China's eastern coastal areas
have set up a rational and orderly market set-up, after learning a
few lessons from the random growth of the market economy and
abandoning the concept of relying on their own regional economy,
People's Daily, China's leading newspaper, reported today.
</P>
<P>
The article cited Wenzhou, a coastal city in east China's
Zhejiang Province, as an example. The city began to develop its
industry in the late 1970s, when the reform and opening-up was
launched.
</P>
<P>
Hunting higher profits, many people in the city opened
factories to produce goods that were imitations of world-famous
brands, which undermined the reputation of the city's products.
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, the city worked out a strategy which focused
on quality control, and has greatly improved its commodity
production in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Like Wenzhou, many areas in east China have attempted to smooth
out the disarray, meanwhile observing the law of market economy,
the article said.
</P>
<P>
A large group of enterprises known for a more refined sense of
quality and good reputation outlasted their competitors with poor
products and images, and developed into big group companies.
</P>
<P>
The south China island province of Hainan, the country's
largest special economic region, has drawn many international
investment companies by standardizing the economic cooperation,
promoting equal market competition and improving the efficiency of
the government organizations.
</P>
<P>
The city of Jinjiang in east China's Fujian Province has become
the most rapidly-developing place in the province thanks to the
focus on quality.
</P>
<P>
In addition, other parts of the market system, including stock,
information, technology and labor markets, have also undergone a
similar change from confusion to orderliness, according to the
article.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Areas Form Orderly Market System (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The practice of following the traditional concept of regional
economy has been a bitter experience for many enterprises in coastal
areas.
</P>
<P>
In the "Silk Campaign" which was waged several years ago in
the silkworm-raising areas in east China, many Chinese silk
manufacturers reduced the prices of their products in the world
market to better compete. This led to major losses for a large
number of Chinese silk firms.
</P>
<P>
"Regional economy" refers to the economy, developed in the unit
of one county or city, which often leads to fierce competition
between various areas to obtain more energy, more raw material and
a larger share of the market, and the repeated construction of
primary industries.
</P>
<P>
As more people in east China became aware of the drawbacks of the
concept, they began to tear down the ideological walls between
regions and join the larger market economy.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry in Shaoxing, in east China's Zhejiang
Province, which took a pounding from the textile products from the
outside areas, introduced advanced techniques and turned out 220
million yuan (26.5 million US dollars) in revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
This shows, however, that though opening-up sometimes produced
growing pains in an area, it ultimately produced better economic
results, the article commented.
</P>
<P>
To gain investors' confidence, an area must improve its
economic environment, the article pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The advantage of the city's future lies in the basic framework
of the socialist market economic system the city has just
established," said Li Youwei, the city party secretary of Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, Shenzhen has adopted more than 60
sets of local laws and regulations, 76 percent of which concern
the economy, and has formed a legal system for the special
economic region, which is mostly devoted to local commercial laws
and economic laws.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Areas Form Orderly Market System (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The entire eastern coastal region has improved system of the
the socialist market economy by strengthening legislation in the
work.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the total number of economic cases which
occurred in the coastal areas amounted to two-thirds of the 1,265
cases sent by the local areas to the National People's Congress to
be filed during the 1993-1996 period.
</P>
<P>
Law should act as a "guardian" of the market economy, the
article said, and the government should take the responsibility of
executing the laws and practising macro-control on the market.
</P>
<P>
The city of Shishi in east China's Fujian Province eased its
control on local enterprises at the beginning of the reform and
opening-up, which led to a general disorderliness of the market.
</P>
<P>
The city then decided to readjust the policies on local
enterprises, providing guidances for the investors and uniting the
small enterprises to form a larger market.
</P>
<P>
The city has in this way cultivated some domestic famous brands
and became part of one of the 100 pilot counties in the country.
</P>
<P>
Illegal competition has become a major problem as the market
competition intensifies. More than 30,000 cases of monopolization
and illegal competition across the country have been investigated
in the last several years.
</P>
<P>
In coastal areas, bans have been put on the making of
imitations of famous brands, bribery in commercial activities,
false advertising, the leaking of commercial secrets and illegal
contests involving commercial goods, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
The preferential policies provide the coastal areas with
chances to develop earlier than other parts of the country, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
But as the standard socialist market economy is now taking
shape in these areas, the advantages of an improved market system
will gradually outweigh the preferential policies and geographic
advantages in their future development, the article said.

<P>
PARIS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed support to
early legislative elections in the Bosnian Serb sub-state of
Republika Srpska and withdrew its support for Bosnian Serb
president Biljana Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted French ambassador to Sarajevo, Yves
Gaudeul, as saying today in Banja Luka that France thinks the only
peaceful way out of the crisis in Republika Srpska is to organize
"free and democratic new legislative elections."
</P>
<P>
Plavsic Tuesday met with the United States envoy for former
Yugoslavia, Robert Gelhard, and the European Union High
Representative for Bosnia, Carlos Westerdorp, on the crisis in her
country.
</P>
<P>
Both envoys suggested that Bosnian Serbs hold early legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serbs held their last general elections in September
1996 in accordance with the Dayton peace agreement on Bosnia
signed in December 1995, which put an end to the 43-month civil
war in the country.

<HEADLINE> Flood Death Toll Rises to 14 in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Death toll from massive floods
has risen to 14 in the northern Philippines while thousands of
residents continued to fight rising flood waters, local media
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The reported death toll was five more than the latest figure
released by the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC). The
council put the casualties at nine dead and five injuries.
</P>
<P>
But the local Sky Cable television reported in its evening news
cast that a total of 14 lives have been claimed by the widespread
flooding which was triggered incessant monsoon rains during the
past two days.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the fatalities were mostly drowned victims and
from Metro Manila or the national capital area and its nearby
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency reported a new landslide caused by
flash floods today in Subic, about 100 kilometers north of Manila,
which killed a young girl and a seven-year-old boy and injured
several others.
</P>
<P>
The agency earlier reported a landslide in Batangas city, Metro
Manila, on Tuesday, burying alive an old woman and injuring her
husband.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos today approved the release of 10 million
pesos (about 330,000 U.S. dollars) for the relief services and the
rehabilitation of various infrastructure damaged by the big flood.
</P>
<P>
The widespread flooding has submerged many low-lying towns and
villages, forcing more than 21,000 families or 111,000 residents
to be evacuated to safer places, according to the NDCC.
</P>
<P>
The NDCC said thousands of troops and social workers have been
rushed to flood-stricken areas to help rescue and relief
operation. The council estimated preliminary economic losses at
nearly 6 million pesos (about 200,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Life in most parts of Metro Manila has returned to normal as
flood waters began to subside with rains easing. But some
low-lying villages in the capital area were still under
roof-top-deep water, television footage showed.
</P>
<P>
Two dike breaches were reported as two rivers swollen by mud
flows overflowed, one in Pampanga Province and the other in Lubao
Province, inundating at least 14 villages and towns today.
</P>
<P>
Weathermen said usually moderate monsoon rains have been
intensified by super typhoon Winnie which spared the country and
is now slamming Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
They cautioned the country against more rains during the next
few days as a new typhoon Luming is gathering strength in South
China Sea northwest of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
This is the second big flood stricken the country since January
this year. In late May, torrential rains spawned by typhoon Bining
also brought about a massive flooding in the northern Philippines,
killing 24 people and injuring dozens of others.

HARARE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's small crocodile
farming community, buoyed by its growing stature, is now seeking
to expand and increase its membership to include black
small-scale farmers, an official said today.
</P>
<P>

farming obtainable free of charge to Zimbabweans to encourage
blacks to venture into crocodile farming.
</P>
<P>
Exports during 1996 included 38,416 skins and 38,561 kg of
meat, Foot said, adding importers were Japan, Singapore, Europe
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
''This year we hope to see a two to five percent increase
above the production for 1996,'' foot said.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Rebels Reject Talks With Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The head of Sudan's exiled
opposition said today two major opposition parties have rejected
offers for dialog with the Sudanese government as a way to end 14
years of civil war in Africa's largest country.
</P>
<P>
"The Ummah and Unionist parties rejected mediation by some Arab
states for bilateral dialog with Khartoum," Mohamed Othman
el-Mirghani, leader of the Sudanese National Democratic Alliance
(NDA) told reporters before leaving here after a visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir's
call for a ceasefire in the war with Sudan People's Liberation
Army (SPLA) rebels, led by John Garang in the south of the
country, during a visit to South Africa on August 12.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Osman Mohammad Taha said Sunday
peace talks between the government and SPLA had been
postponed. The talks had been scheduled for August 19 in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Mirghani is president of the Cairo-based NDA, an umbrella group
of northern and southern opposition parties including Ummah Party,
SPLA, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and other groups.
</P>
<P>
Mirghani said he had met with President Hosni Mubarak and
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa to discuss the situation in Egypt's
neighbor Sudan during the week-long visit.
</P>
<P>
He also met ambassadors of member states of the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), a group of
African countries working on an initiative to end the war, being
fought mostly in the south and northeast.
</P>
<P>
Mirghani said he conveyed the NDA view in letters to the
presidents of Uganda, Kenya, Eritrea and the prime minister of
Ethiopia.

<P>
BRUSSELS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Union today
approved an aid program worth 6.175 million ECUs (6.65 million
U.S. dollars) to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The program, to be carried out by the EU's European Community
Humanitarian Office with the assistance of the Organization of
Medicine Without Borders, will be part of a nutrition program
launched by the United Nations Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
It is also part of an EU food aid program worth 46.3 million
ECUs (49.8 million dollars). The program started in late May when
the 15-nation union decided to provide the DPRK with 155,000 tons
of food.
</P>
<P>
Flooding in 1995 and 1996 reportedly damaged the summer
harvests of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimated last December
that the country needs to import at least 2.36 million tons of
food to make up the food shortage.

<HEADLINE> NATO Forces Help Inspect Serb Police Facilities in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- NATO-led SFOR troops
participated earlier today in simultaneous inspections on all the
Serb police facilities in Banja Luka, according to a NATO press
release available here.
</P>
<P>
The inspected facilities included three police stations, a
police academy as well as the local police and public security
headquarters in the Bosnian Serb town.
</P>
<P>
The inspections were conducted when the United Nations
International Police Task Force (UNIPTF) reported evidence of
serious criminal activities on the part of local police including
illegal interception of Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic's
telephone calls, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO forces were on hand to provide security by surrounding
the police facilities as early reports said.
</P>
<P>
The inspection will not last longer than it is necessary, the
press release said, while SFOR troops continue to operate routine
patrols and maintain a "secure environment."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Bosnian Serb president invited officials from
the U.N. peace mission and the high representative office of the
international community and briefed them about her concerns
regarding the irregularities of local police.
</P>
<P>
The local police stations have reportedly been used by
supporters of Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic.
Karadzic's loyals are against Plavsic.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Government Quibbling Over Taiwan Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Despite criticism by China, the
Japanese government continues to violate international law by
claiming that an ongoing review of its 1978 defense arrangement
with the U.S. covers the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Japan's Deputy Chief Cabinet
Secretary Kaoru Yosano reiterated the view that new guidelines for
the Japan-U.S. defense cooperation should include handling
emergencies in the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
"Emergencies in surrounding areas, under the guidelines, are
defined in accordance with the nature of the occurrences, not
geographical concepts," the deputy government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
His quibbling echoed remarks by Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku
Kajiyama in a TV interview program on Sunday. During the
interview, Kajiyama said the geographical scope of Japan-U.S.
defense cooperation in areas surrounding Japan should cover the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang has made it
clear that China is "seriously concerned" about the remarks made
by Kajiyama, a chief member of the Japanese government. He has
also asked the Japanese government to make "a clear-cut
clarification" on Kajiyama's statement.
</P>
<P>
However, Yosano insisted that "Chief Cabinet Secretary
Kajiyama's remarks are in line with the government stance."
</P>
<P>
Describing Kajiyama's remarks as "indecent and strange,"
Chinese Foreign Vice-Minister Tang Jiaxuan on Tuesday accused
Kajiyama of interfering in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing review of the defense guidelines is designed to
pave the way for Japan to provide a broad range of logistical and
noncombatant support to the U.S. military if an emergency occurs
in areas surrounding Japan.
</P>
<P>
Yosano said the review of the guidelines would not affect
rights and obligations defined by the Japan-U.S. security treaty.
</P>
<P>
"The definition of the Far East under the Japan-U.S. security
treaty will not be changed," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has defined the Far East under the
security treaty as areas from the Philippines to the north,
including Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Tie up With ASEAN Fund Managers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
enter into an agreement with fund managers in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region to protect the further
depreciation of the country's currency peso.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo today
as he assured the public not to worry about the current financial
situation, according to the Philippine News Agency.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo was quoted as saying that the government is doing
everything to normalize the foreign exchange crisis.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to speculations that the exchange rate of the
peso will continue to weaken thus giving stock market speculators
a chance to prop up their activities.
</P>
<P>
But the finance chief did not say whether these speculative
attacks have something to do with the continuing distrust of
foreign investors in the country's economic stability as shown by
the on-going drop in the composite index at the Philippine Stock
Exchange (PSE).
</P>
<P>
Sources at the PSE said that an agreement between fund managers
and the government is expected to provide as a buffer to the
impending attacks on the local currency.
</P>
<P>
At the country's currency market, the peso fell to a record-low
of 30.14 pesos to one U.S. dollar last Friday and appreciated
slightly to 30.03 peso to one dollar today. Monday trading was
suspended because of heavy flooding in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Central Bank reportedly will stand firm on its
decision not to intervene in the local currency market in order to
maintain the country's foreign reserve of 10 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said that the currency crisis will be solved once
remittances from the country's millions of overseas Filipino
workers will start coming in at the end of this quarter in time
for the pre-Christmas season.

25th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations
between China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central

Japan should stick to the principles enshrined in the
Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration and the China-Japan Peace and
Friendship Treaty, bear in mind both positive and negative
historical experience, and treasure the hard-won Sino-Japanese
friendship.
</P>
<P>
Both countries should have their eyes on the overall situation
of Sino-Japanese friendship, remove all disturbances, and promote
the cause of friendship, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He highly evaluated the great contribution made by the Japanese
trade unions in promoting the normalization of diplomatic
relations, and the development of bilateral ties.

Japanese unions would increase their contacts with the All-China
Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) in order to deepen mutual
understanding, develop friendship, expand cooperation, and
contribute more to the Sino-Japanese friendship cause.
</P>
<P>
Daisaku Kohchiyama, vice-president of the Japanese Trade Union
Confederation, said that trade unions of China and Japan enjoy
traditional friendship, and they should further intensify their
communication as the 21st century is drawing near, with an effort
to push bilateral ties to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is here at guest of the ACFTU.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Universities Enroll More Macao Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China's interior universities
recruited a total of 1,014 Macao students this year, a record
number following a steady increase over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the Macao Chinese Education Association said that
these students will go to 33 universities and colleges in the
coming September, which include such famous institutions of higher
learning as Beijing University and Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
Over 700 freshmen will seek bachelor's degree after four years
of study, while 114 will seek master's degree and 11 will seek
doctor's degree at those institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
Another 172 students will take preparatory courses at the
Ji'nan University in Guangdong province, the Overseas Chinese
University in Fujian province and Shantou University in Guangdong
for one year before becoming a formal college student.
</P>
<P>
The number of Macao students enrolled last year added up to
849, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
China's inland universities began recruiting Macao students in
the mid-1980s. The number rose continuously over the past several
years.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,942 Macao middle school graduates applied this
year, accounting for two-thirds of all graduates, according to the
sources. It means an increase of nearly 600 from the number of
last year's applicants.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Macao students seemed most interested in such
majors as clinical medicine, biochemistry, mechanics and
electronics, construction and engineering, transportation,
administration, international trade, computer, education, law and
languages.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the increasing enthusiasm for Chinese
universities among Macao graduates was largely because of the fact
 that China will resume its exercise of sovereignty over Macao as
of December 20, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Burundi MPs Tour Uganda for Sanction Lifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Four Burundi parliamentarians
are in Kampala to solicit support for easing sanctions imposed on
their country after an army coup that toppled the elected
government of the former President last year.
</P>
<P>
According to local press today, the MPs led by Frederic
Bamvuginyumvira Tuesday briefed the Parliamentary Committee on
Foreign Affairs and deputy speaker Betty Okwir on the planned
Arusha summit next week at which the parties will have to resolve
their differences on sanctions against Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The summit is scheduled to start on August 25, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Bamvuginyumvira said despite their differences, the Burundi
political parties had decided to work together to find solutions
to their current problems.
</P>
<P>
He also said Uganda's MPs are welcome to Bujumbura to give
advice in the national debate of how to resolve the differences
between political groups there.
</P>
<P>
Karuhanga, Onyango Kakoba and Michael Mukula, all Ugandan MPs
later told the Burundi counterparts that they supported the
lifting of the embargo because it was hurting the ordinary
citizens more than Burundi President Pierre Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
Burundi sank into genocide in 1993 when President Melchoir
Ndadaye was assassinated by Tutsi extremists. More violence
between Tutsis and Hutus erupted after Buyoya ousted President
Ntibatunganya in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, 150,000 people have been killed in the tribal
strife in the country.
</P>
<P>
Trade embargo was subsequently imposed by east and central
African countries like Uganda, Tanzania, Eritrea, Zimbabwe,
Democratic Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zambia as well as the
organization of African Unity (OAU). These countries and the OAU
will be attending the summit.

<HEADLINE> Israel Shows Restraint After Rocket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has
showed restraint towards Tuesday's massive Katyusha rocket attack
on northern Israel by Lebanese Hezbollah guerillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel's "immediate goal is to halt the cycle of escalation
which dose not serve the interests of any side of the border,"
said an official statement issued by the government after the
attack.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that "Israel wants both the citizens of
Israel and Lebanon to live in tranquility."
</P>
<P>
Last night, the entire region of Northern Israel was on
alert. Many residents spent the night in shelters and security
rooms in anticipation of more bombardments, ignoring the
military's advice against the practice.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Defense Ministry has also confirmed that there have
been no unusual military movements in the south.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah fired some 60 Katyusha rockets to northern Israel on
Tuesday morning and the Israel Defense Force (IDF) confirmed that
some 45 landed inside Israel, most of them hit the northern area
of Kiryat Shmona in Galilee, but causing slight casualties.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Iran guerrilla force said its attack was in response to
the shelling by the South Lebanese Army (SLA) -- the ally of
Israeli forces stationed in south Lebanon -- of the Lebanese south
port city of Sidon Monday, which killed at least six civilians and
wounded 35 others
</P>
<P>
Following Tuesday's attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and several other cabinet members inspected the attacked
areas. Netanyahu said Israel will act to make sure this is not
repeated.
</P>
<P>
Despite the tough talks, the Israeli government's policy is
apparently aimed at winding down the current escalation of tension
by refaining from instant retaliation, observers here said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Defense Committee of
South African Parliament is debating a bill to curb mercenary
activities in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The bill was prepared by National Conventional Arms Control
Committee Chairman Kader Asmal.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the bill to parliament, Asmal said mercenary,
military and security type involvement of South Africans abroad
had a direct impact on the country's foreign policy and had to be
controlled.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, bona fides transactions between local
security-type companies and foreign countries would have to be
vetted, and authority granted if the type of activity and
contract country were acceptable to government.
</P>
<P>
Non-governmental organizations involved in legitimate conflict
resolution activities would also have to register, but would have
no problem getting the required authority.
</P>
<P>
Military training to democratic countries would be approved on
the payment of a fee which would not be applied to
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, South African mercenaries
took part in armed conflicts in Zaire, Angola and Rwanda during

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Tremendous Contributions of Deng Xiaoping's Theory (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily and Xinhua News
Agency today jointly published a commentary hailing the tremendous
contributions Deng Xiaoping's theory has made in building
socialism in China.
</P>
<P>
The following are excerpts from the commentary:
</P>
<P>
The 14th Party Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
held in 1992 made a historic decision to establish Deng Xiaoping's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the
guideline of the whole party and required all party members to
embody the theory.
</P>
<P>
The CPC upholds this great Marxist theoretical banner in
contemporary China.
</P>
<P>
China's reform and opening and its moderization drive have
brought the country into a new era since the 14th Party
Congress. The country's economy in the period has been kept on a
fast track marked by sustained, speedy and sound development, and
the goal to quadruple China's gross domestic product has been
scored ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The past five years has been a brilliant, victorious period for
China.
</P>
<P>
The success is based on the constant efforts of the CPC Central
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, to arm and educate
the whole party, cadres and the Chinese people with Deng's theory,
now the spiritual pillar of the people of all ethnic groups in
China.
</P>
<P>
The success should also be attributed to the creative work done
by the CPC Central Committee in the implementation of a series of
strategic measures meant to solve certain critical problems and
unify the people of all ethnic groups.

<TEXT>
<P>
In contemporary China, it can be said that to adhere to genuine
Marxism and Mao Zedong Thoughts is to persevere in Deng Xiaoping's
theory.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee in the past five years urged party
cadres to stress learning, politics and healthy practices, and has
taken a number of important steps to push forward the study and
promotion of Deng's theory.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 21 million officials nationwide,
including 390,000 at or above the county or division level and
1,200 of ministerial or provincial level, enrolled in various of
research forums and study courses. Consequently, an upsurge of
theoretical study led by leading officials has emerged throughout
China.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee has given approval to the founding of
five bases for the theoretical study of Deng's theory, in the
Central Party School, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the
State Education Commission, the University of National Defense and
the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Theoretical researchers
are now actively involved in projects.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee in the past five years followed
Deng's theory in a comprehensive, appropriate and active
way. Taking into account the reality of contemporary China and new
practices adopted to suit its ever-changing situation, the CPC
Central Committee has formulated the principle of "seizing
opportunities, deepening reform, furthering the opening-up,
promote development and maintaining stability."
</P>
<P>
After a thorough analysis of 12 major issues that would prove
fatal to China's socialist construction, the party urged that the
handling of the areas of reform, development and stability and
strengthen macro-adjustment be handled correctly.
</P>
<P>
In the economic realm, the party advanced the reform in
financial, foreign trade, investment and taxation sectors and
adopted a new development strategy that emphasized sustained
growth and the role played by scientific progress.
</P>
<P>
In the domain of politics, the party put more effort into the
fight against corruption, criminal activities and other social
evil phenomena.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Commentary: Tremendous Contributions of Deng's Theory (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Using the theory as a guideline, the commentary said, the
Chinese people achieved a higher level of understanding, unity of
thought, and boosted morale.
</P>
<P>
Also as a result, patriotism, collectivism, and socialism
received full play in the country, accompanied by an improved
sense of independence and self-reliance, competition, efficiency,
creativity and a better understanding of democracy and the legal
system, it added.
</P>
<P>
Social activities to promote socialist ethical and cultural
progress were also widely held across the country, and were
regarded as an healthy, and inspiring mainspring in the social
life in China, according to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
As President Jiang Zemin once pointed out, the presence of a
guiding principle is of crucial importance, and without such a
backbone, it would be impossible for China to reach the final goal
of the socialism undertaking, because its population is vast, its
level of economic growth as well as the social and cultural
progress are relatively backward, and the competition in the
international arena is fierce, it said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary quoted the final lines of Jiang's speech at the
Party School of the CPC Central Committee in late May, saying that
the Chinese people, during the course of the modernization push,
and the reform and opening-up drive, should hold high the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
China's own characteristics, and practice the theory in various
fields of work as well as in the entire cause of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Cape Verde promises to train
health personnel for Angola and offer scholarship for demobilized
military men in its peace process, a visiting Cape Verde minister
said today.
</P>
<P>
Joao Medina, Minister for Health, Labor and Social Affairs of
Cape Verde, who arrived here for a week-long visit said Angola
and Cape Verde, which share similar history in fighting against
colonial rule, are striving to raise the level of their
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Although Cape Verde is a small country in terms of land
acreage and population, while Angola is big and rich in natural
resources, the two countries could have effective cooperation in
the social sector, and exchange experiences in this field, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Medina said that Cape Verde could learn from Angola in
afforestation and in its efforts to fight against poverty.
</P>
<P>
As former colonies of Portugal, both states now belong to the
Economic Community of Portuguese-speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
The Cape Verde minister said he believed that his visit to
Angola will further promote the brotherly ties of cooperation
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese MP: Lebanon Will Continue Confronting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese member of parliament
said today that Lebanese army and resistance forces will continue
confronting Israeli attacks, the Cairo-based Voice of Arabs radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sami el-Khateeb, chairman of the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies'
Defense and Security Committee, was quoted by the radio as saying
that Monday's Israeli attacks on the southern Lebanese city of
Saida are reminiscent of last year's Qena massacre, in which about
100 Lebanese civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Israel of shelling civilians, he said that "under the
plea of security, the Israeli government finds an excuse to go
unbridled."
</P>
<P>
Nine civilians were killed and 43 wounded in fierce shelling
Monday in the southern Lebanese port city of Saida.
</P>
<P>
On April 18, 1996, Israeli gunners shelled a U.N. camp in South
Lebanon. Of the 400 villagers who had sought shelter in the Qena
Camp, 100 were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese official also dismissed Israeli army statement
that the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) in the occupation
zone, not Israeli troops, were behind the attacks.
</P>
<P>
"Blaming the attacks on guerrilla forces of Antoine Lahd is
nonsensical because these forces are instructed by Israel," he
told the radio.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli surrogate South Lebanon Army (SLA), led by Lahd, is
patrolling the occupied border strip in south Lebanon alongside
with the Israeli army, he added.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 Israeli troops have held a border occupation in a
self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon since 1985, in
defiance of U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Counts on Private Enterprises to reduce Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
expressed displeasure today over what he called the "massive
creation of permanent public jobs" for the country's youth as
planned by the Socialist government of Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement published by the French presidential
office, Chirac, who returned recently to Paris from a vacation,
said that he is counting on private enterprises to create jobs to
reduce France's 12.8 percent unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
"It is jobs in the private sector which will reduce the
unemployment," Chirac said, adding that the forthcoming national
job conference in France will discuss the creation of jobs by
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Minister of Employment and Solidarity Martine
Aubry will present to the council of ministers today a draft law
creating 350,000 jobs in the public sector within three years,
which is expected to cost the state 35 billion francs (5.8 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This is partial fulfilment of the electoral promises made by
the Socialist Party during legislative elections in May and June,
which brought a Left-wing coalition to power in France.

<HEADLINE> Increased Heilongjiang Grain Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang Province, once a
vast wasteland area, has been transformed into a major grain
producer in northeast China, with this year's spring wheat output
topping 3.64 million tons, up 10.5 percent from the corresponding
1996 period.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang's average annual grain output has jumped by 10.5
percent in each of the past seven years, seven percentage points
higher than the national average growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The province's total 1996 grain output of 30.4 million tons was
up 17.5 percent from the previous year and reached the Ninth
Five-Year Plan targets set for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The successful effort has been attributed to the provincial
government priority on the agricultural sector. The local
government had increased the sector's budget by 13.3 percent
annually between 1991 and 1995. The government allocated 1.8
billion yuan to the sector in 1996, an annual increase of 23.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The province's financial sector has introduced preferential
loan for the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang has also attached great importance to water
conservation constructions in order to enhance local resistance to
natural calamities. Heilongjiang invested 2.7 billion yuan in
water conservation projects between 1995-1996.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of scientific farming used in grain production
has jumped 42 percent from 35 percent years ago.

<HEADLINE> Health Alert as Pollution Level Soars in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Health warnings were issued by
experts here today to the public as the air-pollution index has
hit the danger zone.
</P>
<P>
The index, made worse by soaring temperatures and a lack of
wind, reached 109 in new development areas, mostly new towns in
low-lying parts of the "New Territories", on Tuesday, but is
expected to drop below 100 to about 80 today.
</P>
<P>
Anything above 100 is considered "unhealthy" and health
warnings are issued after the index passes 100 points, according
to the air-pollution index from the Environmental Protection
Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Standard newspaper quoted Environmental
Protection Department official Arthur Chu as saying that high
temperatures over the past few days had given rise to the
"unhealthy" pollution index.
</P>
<P>
"The poor air quality we are now experiencing is due to ozone,
which is not directly emitted from pollution sources, but formed
by the reaction of air pollutants in the atmosphere when under
sunlight," Chu said.
</P>
<P>
"The calm and sunny weather over the last few days has provided
sufficient time and the necessary conditions for the polluting
chemicals in the atmosphere to form ozone," Chu added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Environmental Protection Department experts have
advised people with asthma, lung and heart diseases to stay
indoors as much as possible to avoid breathing in chemicals
suspended in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The highest pollution index reading in Hong Kong was 118 on
July 26, 1996, in some industrial areas including Kwun Tong, Kwai
Tsing and Tsuen Wan.

<P>
So far, more than 93,000 families or 475,000 people have been
affected by the widespread flooding, which was caused by
continuing monsoon winds beginning to slash the country since
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Among the affected, the NDCC said more than 21,000 or 111,000
residents living in low-lying areas have been evacuated to 91
makeshift evacuation center set up in churches and public schools.
</P>
<P>
The National Red Cross and the military have extended emergency
food assistance to the evacuees.
</P>
<P>
The worst-hit areas were Metro Manila or the national capital
region, and the provinces of Pampanga and Bulacan around volcanic
Mount Pinatub in central Luzon.
</P>
<P>
Life in the capital city gradually returned to normal today as
continuous downpour turned into occasional moderate rains.
Government offices, schools and businesses reopened today after
being suspended for one day Tuesday in Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
But heavy rains are reportedly continuing to fall in other
parts of central Luzon.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Population Quadruples in 38 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A Tibetan scholar has claimed
that the Tibetan population has not decreased since 1959, in fact
it has quadrupled in the past 38 years.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ongoing 1997 Beijing Seminar on Tibetan Studies,
Tendzin Lhundrub, from the Research Center of Tibetan Studies,
said the belief that the population of the Tibetans was over ten
million in the 7th century was historically groundless and was a
misunderstanding and distortion of historical documents.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the figure might be calculated if the entire
number of the troops during the Tubo period are added, and a
comparison was made between the area and population under the
control of the Tubo regime and the Tibetan area of modern times.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that up to 1959, the total population was about
one million and a large-scale reduction of the Tibetan population
never occurred.
</P>
<P>
"In history, wars, earthquakes and other natural calamities and
epidemic diseases happened many times but the total population
remained unchanged," according to the scholar.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Tibetan population had not been increased, he
added, was determined by material production and social system
in Tibetan society.
</P>
<P>
Religion has played a "regulatory role" in the population
changes, and non-growth in Tibetan population is decided by social
material production and social system in Tibet, he said.
</P>
<P>
A large number of grown-ups and young laborers converged onto
temples to become living Buddhas and religious people, and low
productive forces and poor natural conditions also affected the
population growth in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
However, he went on to say, the Tibetan population has doubled
since 1959, which demonstrates that changes of the Tibetan social
system and the progress and development of productive forces and
improvement of science and medical technology constitute key
factors for population growth in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"The Tibetan people have chosen their own road of growth and
are carrying out socialist modernization with Chinese
characteristics. This is the fundamental factor for the steady
population growth," he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kenyan Economy Hit by Shilling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Over 20 percent drop in the
value of the Kenyan currency of Shilling in the past three weeks
has adversely affected the country's economy with local industry
undermined and commodity prices increased.
</P>
<P>
Manu Chandaria, Chairman of the Kenya Manufacturers
Association, said the depreciation of shilling to the present 71
against the dollar has undermined the local industry as Kenya imports
more than it exports.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that the value of imported goods for Kenya
in 1996 is 3 billion U.S. Dollars, compared with exports standing
at 2.1 billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"What's worrying to the industry is the sudden fall of the
currency. Had this been gradual over a period of time, it could
have been absorbed," Chandaria noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that local manufacturers had to pass the
increased production cost to consumers as most of the inputs used
in the sector were imported.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan manufactured goods will also become less competitive
because countries with stable currencies can afford to keep down
their prices, the chairman added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the depreciation of Kenyan currency places a higher
burden on the country's ability to serve its external debt.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's debt service stood at 333
billion shillings in March 1997 when the shilling was 54.9 to one
U.S. Dollar, but it has now risen to 437 billion Shillings.
</P>
<P>
At the local market, the wholesale and retail prices of
products have begun to rise following the depreciation of the
shilling against major convertible currencies as a result of the
suspension by the International Monetary Fund of a three-year
loan package to the country on July 31.
</P>
<P>
Mobil, Kenya Shell and BP oil companies have already announced
price increases for the past several days by about eight percent,
which will have a spiral effect on other goods.
</P>
<P>
Staff of the Nakumatt Holdings Ltd., a supermarket chain in
the east African country, said the company had to adjust prices
in response to the shilling depreciation because 50 percent of
their stock was imported.
</P>
<P>
The price of refrigerators went up by 15 percent at Nakumatta
Supermarket while Crown-Berger effected a price rise for various
products effective from August 15 all over the country.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the inflation which had been kept at a single
digit over the past year is expected to rise. Analysts here
noted that the Kenyan government's prediction of 4 percent
economic growth in the 1997/98 fiscal year seems impossible to
realize unless the shilling is stabilized quickly.

<HEADLINE> House Fire Kills Seven in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- An overnight house fire in the
northern German town of Rheine killed seven people, including four
children, and seriously injured two others, the local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The deaths were likely to be all members of an ethnic-German
family which migrated to Germany from the former Soviet Union five
years ago, police said.
</P>
<P>
The two injured had eventually managed to escape the fire by
jumping from a second-floor window to a mattress which
firefighters had dragged before the house from a nearby bed shop.
</P>
<P>
Although the fire had been put out, the cause was not
immediately known. Preliminary investigations by local
authorities pointed to a family tragedy caused by panic reaction
after a quarrel on Tuesday evening.

<HEADLINE> South China City To Carry Out "Lifeline Project" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, Guangdong, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Chaozhou, a coastal
city in the eastern part of South China's Guangdong Province, will
carry out a "lifeline project" to protect itself from the threat
of flooding, local authorities announced recently.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is expected to cost a total of 240 million
yuan (about 29 million US dollars), will connect roads along the
southern and northern banks of the Hanjiang River, a major river
flowing by the city, to strengthen the banks and prevent flooding,
according to the city's department of natural disaster prevention.
</P>
<P>
The work is scheduled to be completed within five years. The
first phase, which will soon begin in the fourth quarter of this
year and involves an investment of 63 million yuan, is expected to
end in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
The banks of the Hanjiang River are the second largest in
Guangdong. In recent years they have been repeatedly eroded by
floods, posing a constant danger to the city.
</P>
<P>
Experts warn that the city now faces the threat of the most
serious flooding in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
If the embankments collapse, they said, some three million
people and over one million mu (about 70,000 hectares) of farmland
in Chaozhou and its nearby regions would be affected.
</P>
<P>
Preparatory work for the large project is now underway.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Absorbs Foreign Investment for Rising Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's rising industries of
medicine, new materials, micro-electronics, and environmental
protection will become magnets for foreign investment, sources
from the city's economic circles have predicted.
</P>
<P>
According to the city's development program, the annual foreign
contractual value will top 7.5 billion US dollars by the end of
2000, and 4.8 billion US dollars will be used every year. Overseas
investors are encouraged to put more money in the rising
industries.
</P>
<P>
These developing businesses are springing up all over China's
leading economic city, and will play the same important role in
Shanghai's economic development as its six pillar industries --
automobiles, telecommunications, power station, petrochemicals,
iron and steel, and household electric appliances.
</P>
<P>
The annual output value of the modern biology and medicine
industry and the new materials industry have respectively reached
12 billion yuan (1.4 billion US dollars) and nine billion yuan
(1.1 billion US dollars). As forecast, the modern biology and
medicine industry will generate 100 billion yuan (11 billion US
dollars) of the annual output value in next few years, and is
expected to become the city's seventh pillar industry.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai also attracts foreign investment in the fields of
modern agriculture, tourism, foreign trade, education, and science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
So far, Shanghai has more than 16,000 foreign-funded projects,
involving a total of 48 billion US dollars of foreign contractual
investment.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Landmine-clearing Delegation Visits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A Mozambican delegation of the
National Landmines Clearing Committee led by its President Osorio
Severino, arrived in Luanda Tuesday evening for a five-day
working visit to Angola.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the press at the airport, Severino said, the
main aim of the Mozambican delegation is to exchanges with Angola
their experiences in landmine clearing.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Mozambique's progress in removing landmines,
Severino said, the urgent period for landmine clearing has come
to an end. At the moment, the major issue for landmine removing
is to consolidate the peace process and promote economic
development.
</P>
<P>
According to him, landmine clearing has opened the gate for the
realization of national economy and social development.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in Angola, the Mozambican delegation will
visit the School of Landmine Clearing located on the outskirts of
Luanda.
</P>
<P>
They will also visit Kuito, the city with the most landmines,
to acquaint themselves with its progress in landmine clearing.
</P>
<P>
Angola and Mozambique were both suffering from long-time civil
war, during which a large number of landmines were planted,
making them the countries with the most landmines in the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the International Red Cross, there are 15
million landmines in Angola as against the 3 million in
Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> HK Sharemarket Closes High After 1,000-point Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index
added 378 points to end at 15,855 today, after a 1,000-point fall
set altogether last Friday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe the rise came partly due to the influence
from Wall Street's rise in currency trading in the past two days
after last weekend's fall.
</P>
<P>
However, the main reason was that Hong Kong's economy is good
and stable and its stock market is perfect, the experts noted.
</P>
<P>
In their view, Hong Kong has a good financial system and has as
much as 80 billion U.S. dollars in its foreign exchange reserves,
and also may rely on the backing of China's huge inland market
and foreign exchange reserves. It is powerful enough to defeat
speculators, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the fall wave, the experts said there was also a
fundamental factor in the slump. Share prices in Hong Kong were on
the upward trend from the beginning of this year, they said,
adding that international speculators may have taken advantages of
this factor to speculate in the Hong Kong dollar and, at the same
time, sell Hong Kong shares.
</P>
<P>
There is no stock market that only rises and never falls, they
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), Tung Chee Hwa, told reporters on Tuesday that the
SAR government would continue to monitor the stock market's
performance.
</P>
<P>
He warned speculators they were certain to lose if they tried
selling the Hong Kong dollar short.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on the same day, Financial Secretary of the SAR
government Donald Tsang Yam-kuen said it was reasonable for Hong
Kong's stock market to adjust after the shares had stood at a high
level for two months.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index rose from 12,000 in April to over
16,000.

<HEADLINE> Environmentally-friendly Dinner-boxes Used on Passenger Trains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Environmentally-friendly
dinner-boxes are now available in most of China's passenger trains
as part of the effort to combat white pollution caused by the
former widely-used polystyrene containers.
</P>
<P>
China's trains travel along 60,000 kilometers of railways and
carry one billion passengers a year, using over 300 million
dinner-boxes.
</P>
<P>
The polystyrene containers are not easily recycled, and there
have been calls for substitutes made of recyclable and degradable
materials.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, about 95 percent of the passenger trains began to
use dinner-boxes made of degradable materials such as cardboard,
according to the Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>
In another effort, over 200 million yuan (24.096 million US
dollars) have been spent over the past decade to make it possible
for collecting garbage from trains by bags.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, almost all trains had started the practice,
and garbage disposal stations had been built in 151 of the over
5,000 railway stations.

<HEADLINE> 70 People Die Of Malaria in S. African Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- At least 70 people have
died after contracting the deadly tropical disease malaria in
South Africa's Northern Province during the 1996/97 period,
sources reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Philip Kruger, Malaria Co-Ordinator, said more than 6,260
people contracted the disease during this period, which was the
worst malaria season for the province in many years.
</P>
<P>
During the 1995/96 season, 34 people died of the disease in
3,510 reported cases.
</P>
<P>
Kruger said the good rainy season for the past two years was
the most significant contributor to malaria reaching epidemic
proportions.
</P>
<P>
"Should predictions be true that the phenomenon of El Nino was
building up over the ocean, generally associated with dry seasons
and even droughts, we can again expect a high incidence of
malaria (in the northern province)," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Changsha, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan Province
is seeking a grant from the World Environment Fund to improve
ecological conditions in the east Dongting Lake area.
</P>
<P>
Hunan wants an 18 million US dollars WEF grant to finance four
environmental projects to maintain the diversity of life in the
wetlands.
</P>
<P>
The easternmost section of Dongting Lake, one of China's five
largest freshwater lakes, is home to 216 bird species, including
32 species on the government list of protected animals.
</P>
<P>
Over 10 million birds migrate from the north in winter to the
area, the most extensive wetlands in south China.
</P>
<P>
Local environmental protection officials say WEF funding will
support a project to lower silt levels in the lake and cultivate
grasslands to provide a winter food supply for migrating birds.
</P>
<P>
They also plan to introduce various projects which will enable
local people to earn a living from trades other than fishing, an
activity which currently poses a threat to both wetlands and
wildlife protection.
</P>
<P>
Environmental officials in Hunan, one of many candidates for
WEF funds, have pledged more extensive efforts to ensure
funding.

<HEADLINE> China Voices Regret for Japanese Officials' Stand on Kajiyama's Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed deepest
regret for the open support given by some senior Japanese
officials to the recent statement by Japan's Chief Cabinet
Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama concerning the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Kajiyama clearly indicated in a recent statement that the scope
of the Japan-US security cooperation should include the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
Japan's deputy chief cabinet secretary claimed today that the
remarks of Kajiyama reflect the position of the Japanese
government and there is nothing wrong with that. He noted that
some other officials of the Japanese government also supports this
view.
</P>
<P>
Asked by Xinhua to comment on the situation, Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang said today that the remarks of
Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, a high-ranking member of
the Japanese government, seriously interfere in China's internal
affairs. China had expressed its solemn and just stand to the
Japanese side about this issue.
</P>
<P>
"China is firmly opposed to the statement of Kajiyama and had
asked the Japanese side to make a 'clear-cut clarification' on
Kajiyama's statement," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Chinese side is "surprised that Japanese
officials concerned even openly support the statement of
Kajiyama." He added that the Chinese side "deeply regrets" this.
</P>
<P>
As everyone knows, Shen reiterated, Taiwan is an inalienable
part of the Chinese territory, and the Taiwan question is purely
China's internal affair. This has become the consensus of the
international community, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side has made solemn commitment and shoulders
political responsibility on this matter in the Sino-Japanese Joint
Statement and the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between China and
Japan, Shen added.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side strongly demands that the Japanese side
should strictly carry out its commitments and be consistent in
words and deeds, and refrain from doing anything again that
amounts to interference in China's internal affairs or jeopardizes
the Sino-Japanese relations," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Vaccine Could Be Available in 5 Years: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A world-first vaccine which
could prevent breast and other cancers would be available to
general practitioners in five years if tests were successful, one
of its Australian developers said today.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage, where it would be available for practicing
doctors, I would say it will be a minimum of three to five years,"
said Professor Ian McKenzie of the Austin Research Institute in
Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
While the vaccine was not a cure and he did not want to be
prematurely optimistic, the professor said trials beginning in
Melbourne this month were an important step towards eradicating
many cancers.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be optimistic," he was quoted today by the
Australian Associated Press (AAP) as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We're starting these trials and the trial by definition is to
find out if it's any good or not.
</P>
<P>
"If the trial ... is non-toxic and in response the tumors do
shrink away, we can then have another conference and tell you it's
the best thing this century."
</P>
<P>
The trials would be performed on breast cancer sufferers, or
those with colon, rectal and prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine, initially tested on mice and then on 25 advanced
breast cancer patients in the state of Queensland, northeast
Australia, last year, did not have side effects and did cause
tumor shrinkage, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
The Melbourne trials, which will start with colon and rectal
cancer patients in the next two weeks, involving 20 patients
overall, will be conducted on advanced cancer sufferers.
</P>
<P>
Paul Mitchell, director of cancer services at the institute,
said the trials would concentrate more on tumor shrinkage.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine is designed to work in the same way a tetanus or
the successful smallpox vaccine worked, by creating an immune
response in the body to a synthetic antigen.
</P>
<P>
In this case a synthetic form of mucin, a substance found on
cancer cells, is injected into patients, stimulating the white
cells to fight and kill cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Vasso Apostolopoulos, one of the developers, made the
breakthrough discovery to coat the synthetic cancer in sugar,
which stimulates the immune response, as part of her Ph.D.
studies.
</P>
<P>
Professor McKenzie said plans were underway for similar trials
to be conducted in Greece.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks to Resume Lending to Thai Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Foreign banks with branches in
Thailand have agreed to resume extending credit to Thai companies
and roll over the existing loans, a senior Thai official said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new movement was reported by local media after Bank of
Thailand governor Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi met with representatives
of the Foreign Bankers' Association in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
However, Chaiyawat did not make further comment on any
conditions that might be attached to new loans or the terms of
rolling over the current debts.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign bank branches in Thailand a few months ago froze
their Thai credit due to currency and default risks and the
problems facing the country's finance sector.
</P>
<P>
David Proctor, chairman of the association, said that the group
was confident that Thailand's economy will improve under the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s rescue package.
</P>
<P>
The association will fully support the IMF rescue plan, which
will help in restructuring and developing Thailand's financial
system, Proctor said.
</P>
<P>
Association members had agreed to comply with the Thai central
bank's new requirement to raise their contribution to its
financial institutions development fund, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, foreign banks' total outstanding loans to Thailand's
91 finance firms stood at 5 billion U.S. dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
So far, 19 foreign banks have opened their branch in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank earlier had required foreign bank
branches, which saw a rising inflow of deposits after the bank
suspended extra 42 finance firms on August 5, to raise their
contribution to the fund as a measure to protect local small banks
from collapsing due to the withdrawal panic.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Continues Fuel Importation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will continue to import
fuel after September, when the current import package expires, a
senior industry official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ahaji Haruna Abubakar, the Managing Director of the Pipelines
and Products Marketing Company (PPMC) said this is necessary for
the country to build up a reasonable reserve.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's short-term target is to have a 20-day reserve, while
the long-term target is a 45-day reserve, according to managing
director.
</P>
<P>
An acute fuel shortage forced Nigeria, the world's major oil
producer, to order for 33 cargoes of petroleum products in July.
</P>
<P>
The import has successfully eliminated fuel scarcity in major
cities like Lagos, Warri, Port-Harcourt and Suleja, said
Abubakar, adding that the company now now has a 10-day reserve of
petrol, 18 days of dried oil, 19 of aviation kerosene and 14 of
domestic kerosene.
</P>
<P>
Extremely improper national reserve is widely held responsible
for the country's constant fuel scarcity, besides the poor
performance of its four refineries.
</P>
<P>
In a latest development, the government has contracted TOTAL,
the French oil firm to repair and manage the Kaduna Refinery for
three years, a major progress in revitalizing the refineries.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Language Continues to Flourish: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A Tibetan educational expert has
cited the Tibetan still as the common language in the
Tibetan-inhabited regions and said that it continues to flourish.
</P>
<P>
In a paper submitted to the 1997 Beijing Seminar on Tibetan
Studies which opened here today, Changngupa Dorje Ngodrub, deputy
director of the Education Commission of the Tibet Autonomous
Region, said that the Tibetan language was taught in the 1950s as
the part of the main curriculum at primary schools set up by the
Chinese government in the region.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Lhasa Middle School, founded in 1956, and
other middle schools taught mathematics, physics and chemistry in
Tibetan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the reform and opening-up was launched in the late 1970s,
the work of teaching in Tibetan has been reinforced, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Now in Tibet, primary schools, middle schools, secondary
professional schools, as well as universities and colleges all
offer Tibetan language as a required course. Special textbooks
have been written for these classes, he added.
</P>
<P>
And universities in the Tibet autonomous region and other
provinces have been responsible for training Tibetan language
teachers, he said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that Tibetan language has the advantage of
being less of a burden for teachers and students, as it is easier
for them to understand and better teaching results can be
achieved. The language is especially welcomed by children of the
farmers and herdsmen, who constitute 80 percent of the students.
</P>
<P>
He went on say that the Tibetan language is now the
indispensable instrument used by the Tibetan people to exchange
ideas and develop their culture and education.
</P>
<P>
"Tibetan has been used for a long period of time already and is
still in use in Tibet," he said.

<HEADLINE> PLA General Meets US Deputy Under-Secretary of Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior People's Liberation

</P>
<P>
Wang, who is also director of the PLA General Logistics

positive influence on the improvement of cooperation in logistics
and the understanding and friendship between the two armed forces.

</P>
<P>
Wang also briefed the guests on China's economic construction,
the logistics building of the PLA, as well as China's defense

<HEADLINE> Sunken Warships Discovered in Northeast China Province (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The warship Jingyuan, which
sank in a fierce battle against Japanese imperialists 103 years
ago, has been discovered 10 miles from the Heidao Island in the
Yellow Sea in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sites where three other battleships sank, the
Zhiyuan, the flagship headed by Deng Shichang, a national hero,
together with two other smaller ships, Chaoyong and Yangwei, have
been located in an area between Dalu Island and Heidao (Black)
Island after a three-month investigation.
</P>
<P>
During the 1894-1895 Sino-Japanese War, the four Chinese
warships fought a five-hour bloody battle against the Japanese
invaders in the Huanghai Sea. All of the vessels sank on
September, 17, 1894.
</P>
<P>
Famed Chinese salvage expert Zhang Zhiqui, who is also the top
official of the headquarters of warship salvage, told Xinhua that
the Jingyuan is now only an empty hull, as the Japanese had
dismantled the warship along with three others in 1939.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that "the sunken ships still could be used as
a good patriotism 'textbook' full of historical evidence to teach
young people to remember the national disgrace."
</P>
<P>
Salvage workers found that the bow and stern of the Jingyuan
are buried deep under the seabed. The parts of the boat sticking
out stand only 0.5 meters high above seabed and are covered with
marine organisms. The ship is 17 meters below sea level.

<TEXT>
<P>
Military experts here said that Lin Yongsheng, captain of
"Jingyuan" was a wise and capable commander. When the warship was
torpedoed by the Japanese, Li chose to sink the ship in the area
just offshore where it could avoid further pounding from the
Japanese artillery and sailors would be safe.
</P>
<P>
They said his choice was the most rational under those
conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, 16 sailors from the downed
ship survived, though Lin and hundreds of other soldiers died in
the battle.
</P>
<P>
Divers have found a round iron casting that looks like an air
passageway from the Jingyuan, which might have been used by
sailors.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, the Jingyuan weighed 2,900
tons and the Zhiyuan, 2,300 tons. The Jingyuan was made in Germany
and the other three warships were made in Britain. They were
modern vessels in their day and carried dozens of big guns.
</P>
<P>
Li Guiben, an 84-year-old eyewitness to the battle, said in
1938 he was forced by the Japanese to help destroy the sunken
ships. Nearly 60 years later, he guided the salvage workers to the
sites.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said China began in May to search for the four warships
using submarine sonar, magnetic detectors and other advanced
technology.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that after the four warships are
salvaged, they will be put into a memorial hall, to be built in
the city of Donggang in Liaoning Province, which will be funded by
the central government.

CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are the business
briefs from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Israeli exports to Jordan were estimated at 6.75
million U.S. dollars in the first half of this year, while the
Jordanian exports to Israel reached 6.12 million dollars over the
same period, semi-official Jordan Times today quoted a statement
from the Israeli Embassy in Jordan as saying.
</P>
<P>
This is a reflection of the steady flow of cross-border trade
between the two countries despite a setback in the Middle East
peace process, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good start, but not the whole potential," said
Shaul Sasson, commercial attache at the Israeli Embassy in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's main imports from Israel were machinery, chemicals
and other goods used in joint Israeli-Jordanian ventures, while
its main exports to Israel were textiles, air conditioning
machinery, pharmaceutics, foodstuffs and agricultural goods.
</P>
<P>
A peace treaty was signed between the two countries in 1994
after a 46-year state of war between them, but cross-border trade
only began in mid-1996, when they reached a transport accord.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Jordanian government signed a contract of 4.4
million U.S. dollars with two local companies on Tuesday to
develop infrastructure construction on the eastern coast of the
Dead Sea.
</P>
<P>
The contract stipulates that the two firms, the Zakariya
Tarawneh Contractors and the Cooperative Contracting Company,
should build roads and drainage canals in an area where hotels and
water, electricity and telephone networks are to be constructed,
semi-official Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Minister of Water and Irrigation
Munther Haddadin affirmed that the Jordan Valley Authority (JVA),
responsible for developing the Valley, has intensified efforts to
attract investments to develop the tourists facilities near the
Dead Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Dead Sea is one of the notable tourist spot in Jordan as
well as in the world. It attracts millions of visitors every year.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Some 25 Egyptian companies for foodstuff, meat and
dairy products will participate in the biggest food industries
exhibition "Anoga 97" to be held in Cologne, Germany, on October
11-16, the Egyptian economic weekly Middle East News issued
Tuesday reported.
</P>
<P>
Products of more than 6,000 producers representing 100
countries will be displayed at the exhibition, which includes 10
departments and is considered the biggest international exhibition
in this field.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Restates Military Option in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General
Sani Abacha has restated the stand of the west African sub-region
to use force as the last option to flush out the military junta
in Sierra Leone which seized power in a coup on May 25.
</P>
<P>
However, the action would depend on whether the junta should
maintain its belligerent position by not acceding to popular
global demand that it return power to the toppled civilian
government, Abacha noted.
</P>
<P>
Abacha, who is also the current Chairman of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), made the remarks on
Tuesday in the capital Abuja on his just-concluded visit to Cote
d'Ivoire and Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The position of the sub-region was supported by the United
Nations and the Organization of African Unity, he said.
</P>
<P>
While refusing to say if military action would come soon,
Abacha said that ECOWAS heads of state would have to "consult and
coordinate".
</P>
<P>
But clearly "we have wasted a lot of time," he noted.
</P>
<P>
A summit of ECOWAS heads of state is scheduled for next week
in Abuja. The crisis in Sierra Leone is believed to be high on
the agenda of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The issue was also the focus of his one-day trip on Monday to
Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea. Both countries have been working
closely together with Nigeria and Ghana in the ECOWAS committee
of four on Sierra Leone, which was set up in the wake of the
coup.
</P>
<P>
The committee has held two rounds of talks with
representatives of the junta. Sanctions against the troubled
country have been tightened, but the efforts have not yielded any
fruit.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 Tamil rebels were
killed and another 200 more injured in a fierce fighting Tuesday
with government troops, who resumed their campaign on the rebel
northern stronghold of Puliyankulam town, military sources here
said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the troops met stiff resistance from the
rebels east of Puliyankulam as they advanced northward from
earlier-held positions.
</P>
<P>
The troops engaged the rebels with artillery, tanks, aircraft
and helicopter gunships, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Two buses carrying rebel reinforcements were completely
destroyed by the government troops in an ambush southwest of
Puliyankulam.
</P>
<P>
A total of 29 government soldiers were killed, as well as six
officers and another 58 soldiers were injured during the
confrontation, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Three battle tanks of the troops were damaged by rebels' fire
east of Puliyankulam.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the maneuver of battle tanks was limited on
the eastern flank of the town as the rebels had dug many ditches
and set up other obstacles.
</P>
<P>
By afternoon the troops commenced consolidating the
newly-captured areas after forcing the rebels to move further
northward.
</P>
<P>
The troops were within one kilometer from Puliyankulam, 220
kilometers north of the capital Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The troops launched the campaign on the town in an effort to
capture the highway that links the government-held Vavuniya to
Kilinochchi further north, a vital supply route to the north.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Up in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The total trade of Singapore
grew by 7 percent in July on a three-month moving average basis,
reflecting increases in both exports and imports, the Singapore
Trade Development Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
On a three-month moving average basis, the TDB said that
non-oil domestic exports increased by 4.8 percent while re-exports
increased by 7.9 percent. Oil exports recorded moderate growth of
5.7 percent, while imports increased by 7.8 percent in July this
year.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, however, non-oil domestic exports increased
by 6.9 percent, lower than the 8.8 percent growth registered in
the previous month.
</P>
<P>
In particular, domestic exports of electronics and related
products recorded a moderate growth of 5.4 percent following a 7.6
percent increase in June.
</P>
<P>
The TDB noted that the growth performance within the
electronics industry was uneven. While domestic exports of
integrated circuits, disk drives and printed circuits boards
assembled continued to grow, domestic exports of personal
computers and computer peripherals were weak.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports increased steadily by 7.1 percent in the month, due
mainly to demand for electronics from the United States and the
European Union, it said.
</P>
<P>
Imports rose by 11.4 percent in the month, marking the highest
growth since April 1996.
</P>
<P>
The TDB said that this was partly boosted by imports of ships
and aircraft. Excluding lumpy items such as ships and aircraft,
import growth was 9.4 percent in July, it said.

<HEADLINE> Advanced AN-140 Plane Ready for Maiden Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The prototype of the advanced
AN-140 passenger plane has nearly finished all ground trials and
is ready for its maiden flights, press here reported today.
</P>
<P>
Antonov Aviation Design &AMP; Production Complex, the manufacturing
company, said the plane was assembled in June, and has been
undergoing a series of ground trials limited to its performance on
runways and taxiways.
</P>
<P>
AN-140, capable of carrying 52 passengers and using airfields
with rather rough runways, is supposed to replace AN-24s and
YAK-40s which served mostly on domestic flights in the member
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that AN-140 will be highly competitive on markets,
because of its superb passenger comfort and safety standard and
low fuel consumption which will be less than half of that of AN-24.
</P>
<P>
Its serial production will be centered in Ukraine's second
largest city, Kharkov and Russia's Samara. A plant in Isfahan,
Iran, will likely be the third manufacturing center for AN-140s.
</P>
<P>
The company indicated that AN-140 will appear on global markets
as early as 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of telephones
available to every 100 Chinese people had increased from one in 1991
to six by the end of last year, while for city residents the figure
leaped to 22.4.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the business volume of posts and
telecommunications enjoyed an average growth of 45.7 percent
annually, with a total of 337.4 billion yuan of investment in
fixed assets, 16.7 times that of the previous six years combined,
according to a report recently released by the State Statistical
Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
A 130,000-km nationwide fiber optical network now links all the
capital cities and major coastal cities, with the exception of
Lhasa. Another two inter-provincial expressway postal routes have
been added, as well as a water mail route along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The country had a total switching capacity of 109 million
telephone lines at the end of last year, a more than quadruple
increase over five years ago, to rank third in the world.
</P>
<P>
China's telecommunications network is now dominated by
program-controlled exchange, fiber optics, digital microwave,
satellites, mobile and digital communication, and transformed from
man-made into automatic operations.

<P>
Consequently, the network has advanced from using simulated
technology to digital technology, with a simulated network roaming
nationwide, and a digital network connecting 15 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities. The digital network covers
prefectural-level cities, most of the counties and part of
townships.
</P>
<P>
The total number of telephone subscribers has expanded to 54.9
million, that of pager users to nearly 30 million, and mobile
phone users have topped 10 million to become one of the world's
largest mobile phone networks, the SSB report said.
</P>
<P>
As China's market economy grows, there have been emerging
commodity markets, financial and stock markets, as well as markets
for technology, labor service and information. All these not only
exerted great pressure on the formerly-lagging posts and
telecommunications, but also opened unprecedented business
opportunities for the sector.
</P>
<P>
The sector has markedly improved its structure during the
period. Telecommunications service volume rose from 71.8 percent
in 1991 to 88.2 percent at the end of 1996, whereas mail service
volume dropped from 28.2 percent to 11.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the establishment of China Unicom has ended the
monopolization of the sector. And it is believed that competition
will certainly help push China's telecommunications onto the
market, and meet the needs of national economic development.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the sector has reported a qualitative
leap in business scale, technological improvements, and service
standards, creating a grand achievement not only in the history of
China's posts and telecommunications, but also in the world's, the
report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 20 (Xinhua) --Four Burundi parliamentarians
who are on a visit here, will solicit support for the easing of
sanctions imposed on Burundi after an army coup that toppled the
elected President Slvestre Mibalunganya in July last year.
</P>
<P>
According to local mass media today, the Burundian MPs led by
Frederic Bamvuginyumvira Tuesday briefed the Ugandan
parliamentary committee on foreign affairs on the planned
all-party Burundian conference scheduled for August 25 in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Bamvuginyumvira said that despite differences among the
Burundian parties, the parties had decided to work together to
find solutions to the problems facing in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that Uganda's MPs are welcome to Bujumbura to give
advice in the national debate of how to resolve differences
between political groups there.
</P>
<P>
Burundi sank into genocide in 1993 when President Melchior
Ndadaye was assassinated by Tutsi extremists. More violence
between Tutsis and Hutus erupted after Major Pierre Buyoya ousted
President Ntibatunganya in July last year. About 150,000 people
have been killed since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions have been imposed last year by neighboring African
states against the military regime in Burundi.

JOHANNESBURG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic fever is
mounting in Cape Town when people in the South African capital
are waiting for September 5, the date when the International
Olympic Committee will announce the successful bidder of the 2004
Olympic Games.
</P>

BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The first Western-style opera
about the Three Gorges on the Yangtze River, a famous tourist site
and future home of the world's largest dam, will be staged later
this month in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The opera, entitled "The Goddess of the Gorges," highlights an
ancient legend about a female celestial who fell in love with a
sailor plying the waters of the Three Gorges. Natural and social
factors combine to destroy their love affair. The couple commits
suicide and the female celestial is transformed into a mountain
peak on the banks of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people over the centuries have written thousands of
poems and pieces of prose to memorialize the couple and the
mountain. The mountain known as the "Goddess" has long been a
major attraction in the Three Gorges.
</P>
<P>
The opera, produced by the Chongqing Opera Troupe, will be
presented as part of festivities scheduled for the '97 China
International Opera and Dance Year. The opera is expected to
provide foreign tourists with a new image of the Three Gorges.
</P>
<P>
The artists from Chongqing, the largest commercial city in
southwest China, view the opera as a tribute to the massive
reservoir which will be completed along the Yangtze later this
year.

SHANGHAI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Dekang Auction
Co. recorded a total transaction volume of 3.87 million yuan
(433,750 US dollars) for an art auction held between Aug. 10-17.

<HEADLINE> Inflation in Zambia Likely to Rise Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The inflaion rate which has been
declining steadily in Zambia in the last few months is likely to rise
in the later part of the year due to the recent price increases of
some commodities.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and
Industry (ZACCI) indicates that the inflation rate which is currently
at 23 percent will rise due to the recent price increases of some
commodities such as fuel, electricity and water tariffs, combined with
the expected massive importation of expensive maize from outside
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The economic report for the second quarter says the government
recorded a significant fiscal budget surplus of 41.8 billion Kwacha
(about 32 million U.S.Dollars) for the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The surplus is mainly attributed to tremendous improvements in the
collection of import Value Added Tax (VAT) which in the first quarter
was on the decline at 25.6 billion Kwacha (about 20 million dollars)
compared to 32.2 billion Kwacha (about 24.6 million Dollars) collected
in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Collections in other areas such as customs duty, excise duty,
domestic VAT, fees and fines also show dramatic increases in the
second quarter, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Businessmen Blast Nation's Economic Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's leading business
leaders have criticized the country's overall economic condition,
law and order, saying it had become increasingly difficult for
them to pursue normal business and industrial activities.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of some leading chamber and trade bodies in a joint
statement on Tuesday also urged the government to dispassionately
review the economic situation as well as law and order.
</P>
<P>
"Take necessary corrective measures before the economic
deterioration goes beyond control," said those disappointed
business leaders, who are from the Metropolitan Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, the Foreign Investors Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters
Association and some other major bodies.
</P>
<P>
According to them, the macro-economic fundamentals are under
pressure, which has already threatened investment climate, upset
trade and industry. If the trend continues, it will be impossible
to achieve this year's envisaged growth rate of 7 percent, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The worried business leaders urged the government to contain
liquidity crisis in the banks, stop alarming fall in the foreign
exchange reserve and break stalemate in the export sector, which
is the locomotive of this country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"Tight monetary policy, liquidity problems in the banks arising
from large-scale borrowings by the government and the state-owned
enterprises have brought about a near stalemate in financing new
investments," they observed.
</P>
<P>
They urged the government to check manifold increase in
smuggled goods on the market, curb decline in the prices of crops
and retrieve the collapsing stock market.
</P>
<P>
These problems, they said, coupled with energy shortages and
unbelievable harassment of business people by local hoodlums, make
it difficult to run normal business activities.
</P>
<P>
They complained that till date there was no indication that the
earlier assurance of the energy minister to solve the power
problem after September this year would come true.

</P>
<P>
The scholars came from a dozen countries and regions
including China, Russia, Britain, India, the United States,
Switzerland, Australia, Nepal, Japan, New Zealand, Germany,
Canada, and China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and
Taiwan region.

</P>
<P>
The "1997 Beijing Seminar on Tibetan Studies" follows similar
seminars held in Lhasa and Beijing in 1986 and 1991, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan studies involve research related to the society and
culture of the Tibetan ethnic group which inhabits the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau known as the "roof of the world" in
southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan studies also cover the ethnic group's written and
spoken language, as well as history, philosophy, religion,
literature, arts and folklore in the category of human studies;
politics and economic in the social sciences; and Tibetan
medicine, astronomy, geography, architecture and natural sciences.
</P>
<P>
"The Tibetan ethnic group is one of the outstanding members of
the big family of the Chinese nation, and the Tibetan people have
used their diligence and wisdom to create a culture which bears
its own unique characteristics," according to CTRC
Director-General Doje Cedain.
</P>
<P>
Doje told participants attending today's opening session that
the remarkable Tibetan culture has synthesized the outstanding
achievements of cultures and long history of the Han and various
other ethnic groups. Tibetans are an organic component of the
Chinese civilization and have contributed greatly to world
civilization.
</P>
<P>
"The central government cares greatly about the social,
economic and cultural development of the Tibet Autonomous Region,
and has adopted a series of favorable policies promoting economic
development in the region," said Doje.

The 580 km expressway, the longest highway currently under
construction in the country, is considered vital to the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region. The expressway will not only link the
two most important local cities, but also will be linked to
high-grade roads in neighboring Guizhou and Hunan provinces to the
north, and Zanjiang City in Guangdong Province to the south. The
completed expressway will be a major trunk line linking southwest

<HEADLINE> Beijing Tibetan Studies Seminar (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Statistics show that well over 2,000 researchers work in the
nation's more than 50 institutions engaged in Tibetan studies.
</P>
<P>
Six Chinese and foreign scholars delivered speeches at the
plenary meeting today. They noted that the Tibetan people
have learned from one another and from the Han people and members
of other ethnic groups for hundreds of years, with the combined
efforts leading to the creation of Chinese civilization.
</P>
<P>
The harsh natural environment on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and
the characteristics of Tibetan society have formed a culture with
very distinct features. Tibetan studies originated in China and
have attracted the great attention of both Chinese and foreign
scholars.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Tibetan writing was introduced in the seventh
century has yielded a wealth of ancient books and records in the
Tibetan language, as well as voluminous historical records about
the Tibetan society in the Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
Related research led to the formation of Tibetan studies. The
care and support of the Communist Party and the government over
the past four decades since the peaceful liberation of Tibet have
led to marked progress in Tibetan studies throughout China.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, publishing houses across the country have
published a large number of academic monographs and reference
books in both the Tibetan and Chinese languages.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bibliography on Tibetan Studies in China, was
published by the Foreign Languages Press, 1,497 kinds of books
were published in China between 1949-1992. According to recent
estimates, nearly 1,000 books on Tibetan studies have been
published since 1992.
</P>
<P>
In addition, research institutions on Tibetology are providing
numerous periodicals.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 12-odd years, Tibetan studies have been closely
linked with the social, economic and cultural development in areas
inhabited by people of Tibetan ethnic group, including the Tibet
Autonomous Region and Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu and Yunnan
provinces. Related efforts have helped to promote local reform,
opening to the outside world and modernization.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scholars have played an active role in expanding
academic exchanges with their counterparts abroad, and have
translated many important works by foreign specialists.
</P>
<P>
Publishing houses are sponsoring an exhibition, providing
seminar participants with access to Tibetan studies books in the
Tibetan, Chinese, English, German and French languages.
</P>
<P>
The CTRC and the Social Academy of Tibet Autonomous Region are
sponsoring the seminar, which will be followed by fact-finding
tour of Tibet by a group of foreign scholars.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
is making plans for privatizing and restructuring four state
giant utility companies by June 1999.
</P>
<P>
The companies due to be privatized are the Tanzania Harbors
Authority, the Tanzania Electric Supply Co. Ltd., the Dar es
Salaam Water and Sewage Authority and the Tanzania

</P>
<P>
Restructuring has already started for the giant utility firms,

major utility firms, according to Malocho.
</P>
<P>
PSRC, the institution in charge of reform of parastatals,
started operation during the 1992/93 financial year. It has
already brought about 79 state firms to restructuring, through
the sale of shares to different investor.

in July decreased to 9.6 percent from 10.1 percent in June,
reported the local daily "The New Vision" today.

A report issued recently by the state-owned Bank of Uganda was
quoted as saying that this is a result of falling in food prices
after the April-May raining season.
</P>
<P>
Another reason is that the Bank of Uganda increased its public
borrowing through treasury bills from 24.5 billion shillings

NAIROBI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's constitutional reforms
talks between the government and the opposition set for August 20
have been put off suddenly, simmering the political tension ahead
of the general elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
"After necessary consultations, it has been decided that the
launching of negotiation scheduled for tomorrow (today) at Safari
Park Hotel be postponed until further notice," said spokesman of
the mediation committee Mutava Musyimi last night.
</P>
<P>
He gave no reasons for the postponement, which came hours
after a meeting by the parliamental group of ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU) over the talks.
</P>
<P>
Tthe KANU lawmakers announced Tuesday their party will only
hold talks within the legislative framework, though a 37-member
KANU negotiation team has been formed.
</P>
<P>
It indicated that the KANU will not enter into any talks with
the opposition umbrella body National Convention Executive
Council (NCEC), set up in April to coordinate the opposition's
campaign for the constitutional reforms.
</P>

The NCEC itself named a 50-member team of its representatives
to the mediation talks last Thursday. The NCEC team composed
representatives from all political parties and other interest
groups.

<HEADLINE> More Tourists Visit Huangshan Mountain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Over two million tourists visited
the Huangshan Mountains, a well-known scenic spot in east China's
Anhui Province, in the first seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented a nearly 68 percent jump from the same
period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 114,400 overseas tourists represented a substantial rise of
132 percent.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from domestic tourism hit 261 million yuan (31.45
million US dollars), up 46.6 percent, and those from overseas
tourists shot up 77 percent to 21 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Huangshan Mountains are best known for peaks shrouded by
clouds, unusual rock formations and unique pine trees. The
mountains, considered one of the most picturesque mountains in
China, are on the World Natural and Cultural Heritages Lists of
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Local tourism authorities attributed the surge in visitors to
the opening of air routes linking the mountains with other major
tourism cities throughout the country and the recent introduction
of direct train services to big cities of Shanghai and Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
Last year's successful listing of the Huangshan Tourism
Development Co. Ltd. on the domestic stock market has helped to
improve Huangshan's reputation and has been a major factor
contributing to growth in the area's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Local officials have tried to provide a better environment by
launching an extensive campaign to eradicate malpractices such as
tourist guides soliciting kickbacks, high-pressure selling, and
restaurants earning excessive profits.

<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Police have arrested a Japanese
national for allegedly selling a non-existing
17-million-peso-worth of cargo ship to a Filipino shipping
magnate, police said here today.
</P>
<P>
Police said that they placed under custodial investigation
Tuesday Masaru Igawa, 59, who introduced himself as a businessman
of 727 Higashi, Shizuoka Ken, Japan, upon complaint filed by Felix
Pontino, a rich trader in the city of General Santos, the Southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Police said Igawa agreed to sell to Pontino on May 23 this year
a ship for 17 million pesos (about 1.2 million U.S. dollars) and
Pontino initially paid Igawa 15.6 million pesos (570,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The rest of the total amount was paid by five separate down
payments before August 4, police said.
</P>
<P>
Pontino, to make sure, secretly went to Japan to verify Igawa's
credibility early this month but found it was a fraud, according
to the police.
</P>
<P>
Police said that Igawa was detained at the Western Police
District Headquarters in Manila and will be charged.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Reactors to Promote DPRK-South Korea Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The building of two light-water
nuclear reactors in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) will serve as a catalyst in promoting exchanges between the
two sides on the Korean Peninsula, observers here say.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's ground-breaking ceremony for the two 1,000-megawatt
nuclear reactors in Sinpo, South Hamgyong Province, DPRK, signaled
the conclusion of the nearly three year-long efforts to get the
1994 Geneva nuclear accord underway.
</P>
<P>
Under the Pyongyang-Washington accord, the U.S.-led
multinational consortium of Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization (KEDO) will provide the two units of pressurized
water reactors in exchange for the DPRK's freezing of its
Soviet-designed nuclear program which is more capable of producing
weapon-grade plutonium.
</P>
<P>
The units also laid the foundation for long-term rapprochement
of the two sides, in which South Korea will play a leading role in
the seven- or eight-year-long reactor building, observers say.
</P>
<P>
South Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) will take the
major responsibility for building the infrastructure prior to the
full-scale construction as the nuclear project's prime contractor,
while South Korea Telecommunication Company was permitted to join
the work of improving the tele-facilities.
</P>
<P>
Two South Korean diplomats were placed at KEDO's office in
Sinpo on July 28, for the first time since the division of the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
For telecommunications, direct phone lines were established on
August 4, the first ones in several decades in which Seoul and
Pyongyang had only the hot lines between their Red Cross societies.
</P>
<P>
KEPCO said that more than 10 million men-days of workers will
be involved annually in the project scheduled to be finished by
the year 2004, at a total cost of 3 trillion won (3.36 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
When the construction work enters into a full swing in 2000, a
maximum of 7,000 workers from both the north and south would be
toiling at the site a day, a KEPCO official said.
</P>
<P>
More than one million tons of building materials and equipment,
including heavy-duty equipment, will be transported to Sinpo for
the project, helping accelerate the exchange in the transportation
sector between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
As the 8.93-million-square-meter construction involves
personnel, equipment and raw materials from DPRK, Sinpo will
naturally serve as a site for exchange and economic cooperation
between the two sides, observers believe.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Price Hike Sparks Strong Protest in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The price hike of petroleum
products has triggered sharp reactions among different political
parties and transport circles while the main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) threatened a nation-wide strike on August
24.
</P>
<P>
BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia Tuesday urged the government to
withdraw the decision, saying that a country-wide dawn-to-dusk
strike will be observed on August 24 if the fuel prices are not
lowered by August 23.
</P>
<P>
From Tuesday, the petrol price rose sharply to 21 taka (about
0.47 U.S. dollars) from 13.70 taka (about 0.31 dollars) after the
government refixed the prices of all petroleum products in a bid
to keep pace with the international market.
</P>
<P>
This move, however, touched off strong protests in the country.
On Tuesday, the owners and workers of motor tricycles, a major
transport means in Bangladesh, went on a wildcat strike in the
capital Dhaka and the second-largest city Chittagong.
</P>
<P>
The angry motor tricycle drivers announced that they would go
for a greater movement if the government did not withdraw the
enhanced prices by August 25.
</P>
<P>
Even the two partners of the present government, the Jatiya
(national) Party and the JSD (Rab), also expressed concern over
the price hike of the petroleum products, saying the government
should immediately withdraw the new prices.
</P>
<P>
The Jatiya Party chief, former president H. E. Ershad said in a
statement Tuesday that the abrupt price rise would increase the
cost of essential commodities resulting in high prices of all
goods.
</P>
<P>
Ershad said the increase in fuel prices would also have a
negative impact on the national economy and urged the government
to refix the fuel price as before.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation, the lone importer of
petroleum products, proposed to raise the petroleum prices in
early June, arguing that a loss of 5 billion taka (about 112
million dollars) has occurred due to the higher prices on the
international oil market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the donor countries and agencies including the World
Bank have been pressing the government hard to stop the huge
subsidy in the petroleum sector by raising the petroleum prices.
</P>
<P>
The price structure of widely-used petroleum products was
framed six years ago.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters Leaders Ratify Tentative Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Teamsters union's
50-member national negotiating committee and the Teamsters panel
of local representatives today voted unanimously, on separate
occasions, to ratify a tentative contract reached late Monday
night with the United Parcel Service (UPS).
</P>
<P>
Teamsters President Ron Carey said the offer would now be
mailed to the 185,000 union members to be ratified.
</P>
<P>
Teamsters were reportedly getting ready to return to work after
the tentative agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
The Teamsters and UPS late Monday agreed on a tentative
five-year contract providing substantial pension benefit increases
and 10,000 new full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton, vacationing outside
Washington D.C., told reporters the agreement that ended the
Teamsters' 15-day strike "is a victory for the proposition that
you can have good strong labor relations and treat your employees
well and make money in this economy of ours."
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman set up
residence at the Washington Hotel where the talks were held and
urged the sides to continue talking.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference at UPS headquarters in Atlanta earlier
today, UPS head, James Kelly, said UPS trucks and planes would be
up and running in a limited capacity tonight and in "full
operation" by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Teamsters spokesman Steve Trossman told reporters earlier today
that two-man teams from each local group representing UPS workers
have been summoned to Washington to vote today on the tentative
pact. If they approve the conditions of the new agreement, the
"rank-and-filers" will be told to report to their jobs while they
vote.
</P>
<P>
Teamsters President Ron Carey told reporters earlier today the
contract calls for wage increases of 3.10 dollars an hour for
full-time employees and 4.10 dollars an hour for part-timers over
the life of the contract, lifting full-time wages to 23 dollars an
hour and part-time to 15 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Serb Leaders Urged to Stop Infighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Parliament leader of Bosnia's
Serb Republic, Dragan Kalinic, today urged Bosnian Serb leaders to
stop infighting, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Serb Republic is facing a huge danger with the
intensification of infighting among the Serb leadership, Kalinic
said in a public rally in Doboj, about 100 kilometers north of
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the Serbs could lose control of the strategic
town of Brcko in the coming elections if the infighting does not
come to a halt immediately.
</P>
<P>
Brcko, a northeastern town across the Sava River border with
Croatia, is vital for both Serbs and the Muslim-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
For Serbs, the town sits astride a narrow corridor linking the
eastern and western halves of the Serb Republic.
</P>
<P>
For the Muslim-Croat Federation, Brcko, with a river port, rail
depot and highway, provides the only trade link between Bosnia and
northern and western Europe.
</P>
<P>
Serbs and Muslims and Croats had fought heavily for the control
of the town during the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
Infighting among the Serb leadership flared up in early July.
</P>
<P>
Serb President Biljana Plavsic dissolved the parliament on July
3, but the decision was strongly opposed by parliament and the
Serb government believed to be actually controlled by former
president Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court ruled last week that Plavsic's
decision was unconstitutional and invalid. Plavsic rejected the
verdict of the court.
</P>
<P>
Among the wrangling of the Serb leadership, western countries
led by the United States voiced support for Plavsic and are trying
to force Karadzic out of the political arena and bring him to
trials before the International Criminal Tribunal for former
Yugoslavia in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic, who led Serbs in the Bosnian war, has been indicted
by the tribunal.

<HEADLINE> 30,000 Cambodian Refugees Flee into Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 30,000 Cambodian
refugees have fled into southeastern Thailand due to recent
attacks launched by Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen's
forces against those loyal to Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees, carrying possessions on bicycles,
motorcycles and carts, streamed into southeastern Thailand's Surin
province through Chong Chom pass in Dap Choeng district, local
media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities and non-government organizations were
providing food and medical services to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Thai authorities Monday night opened the pass to let in
some 10,000 Cambodians, mainly women, children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Another 20,000 Cambodians fled into Surin later as fighting
intensified near the Cambodian town of O'Smach, only several
kilometers away from the Thai-Cambodian border.
</P>
<P>
Major General Chirasak Prommopakorn, commander of Thailand's
Suranaree Task Force, said that the pass was opened to allow the
Cambodians to come in because they were in danger at O'Smach.
</P>
<P>
The refugees will be sent back once calmness was restored, the
commander said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some other sporadic groups of Cambodians fled into
other provinces in southeastern Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Auto Production Up First Time In the 1990s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia's auto production recorded
its first rise in the 1990s, with car, truck, bus and motorcycle
output increasing together in the first seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Russia rolled out 549,000 cars and 84,000 trucks, which was
12.9 percent and 11.5 percent more than the same period last
year. Bus and motorcycle production grew 16.8 percent and 79.7
percent to 24,800 and 35,000 respectively, the State Statistical
Committee said.
</P>
<P>
As Russia's two auto giants, Gorky and Volga, saw their
production going up steadily, Zil and Moskvich, which were on the
verge of shutdown last year, renewed operations this year with
production jumping 250 and 150 percent.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of Russia's auto industry was partly the result of
the government's campaign to ask public officials to use home
produced cars.

<HEADLINE> Flood Death Toll Rises to 6 in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Death toll from heavy floods has
risen to six in the northern and central Philippines as of this
morning while thousands of residents are still combating rising
flood waters caused by continuous monsoon rains.
</P>
<P>
A civil defense officer at the National Disaster Coordinating
Council (NDCC) told Xinhua by telephone that as of 5:00 a.m.
today, six people have been confirmed dead and one injured in the
widespread flooding.
</P>
<P>
The six fatalities included four drowned, one buried by a
landslide, and the other electrocuted while walking in a flooded
street in Metro Manila, according to the latest NDCC report
provided by the officer.
</P>
<P>
But local press reports said eight were killed in flood-related
accidents during the past two days.
</P>
<P>
The NDCC said thousands of residents in low-lying areas in
central Luzon and Visayas are still fighting the rising flood
waters which were brought about by heavy rains during the past two
days.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 51,000 families or 264,000 persons have been
evacuated to makeshift shelter centers set up in churches or
public schools.
</P>
<P>
The worst-hit areas were Metro Manila or the national capital
region, and the provinces of Pampanga, Bataan and Bulacan in
central Luzon, according to the NDCC report.
</P>
<P>
In Metro Manila, more than 11,000 families or 67,000 people
were displaced Tuesday and transportation was paralyzed as about
80 percent of the capital area was submerged by flood waters.
</P>
<P>
Widespread flooding also forced the government to suspend
classes and services for one day in the capital region while many
business activities including trading at the stock and currency
markets were also canceled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But today, flood waters are seen subsiding in the capital city
and some streets are passable as heavy rains ceased to slash the
city late last night. Several highways linking Manila and nearby
provinces, however, remain impassable.
</P>
<P>
In central Luzon, the first alert level has been hoisted over
at least three main rivers around volcanic Mount Pinatub as heavy
rains loosened tons of volcanic ash on the mountain, turned them
into mud flows and swelled many rivers.
</P>
<P>
The NDCC report said troops, using amphibious vehicles, have
been dispatched to the stricken areas to help the rescue and
evacuation operations.
</P>
<P>
Weathermen forecast that monsoon rains will continue to batter
some parts of the country today after being intensified by Typhoon
Winnie which is now affecting Japan and China.

TIRANA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Rexhep Meidani
met the Chinese ambassador to Albania today and said Albania hopes
to promote cooperation with China, especially in economy and trade.

Meeting Chinese Ambassador Ma Weimao, Meidani said he hoped
China could lend help to Albania while it was struggling to tide
over the current difficulties in reconstructing the country.
</P>

He said the situation in Albania has improved as the new
government, sworn in last month after the June elections, had
started work on restoring social order and revamping the economy
which were shattered in months of anarchy after shaky savings
schemes collapsed in January.
</P>
<P>
Meidani also spoke highly of China's achievements in recent
years and congratulated China on its resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1.

<HEADLINE> Hungary, China to Strengthen Military Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian and Chinese
armies should maintain frequent contacts and further their
friendly ties, the Commander and Chief of the General Staff of the
Hungarian National Defense Forces, Vegh Ferenc, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Vegh made the remark at a meeting with the visiting Deputy
Director of the Chinese General Political Department, Zhou Ziyu,
who arrived in Budapest last Friday heading a delegation on a
six-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Vegh said China has been and will remain an important component
of the global strategy.
</P>
<P>
He was also fully confident of the complete success of his
China tour early September, believing the visit would certainly
boost the development of relations between the Hungarian and
Chinese armies.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy State Secretary of the Hungarian Ministry of
Defense, Gyarmati Istvan, also met the delegation.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that both the Hungarian and Chinese governments
were playing active roles in maintaining regional and world peace
and stability.
</P>
<P>
The differences between the two countries in certain fields
would not affect the relationship between the two nations,
Gyarmati noted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Hungary's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), Gyarmati said the entry would not weaken
Hungary's links with non-NATO countries, but further strengthen
them instead.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his appreciation of China's understanding of
Hungary's entry into NATO.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that the Chinese army is willing to strengthen the
friendly cooperation with the Hungarian army on the principles of
mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit, and seeking common
ground while reserving differences and common development.
</P>
<P>
The delegation ends its visit tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Armenia Supports China on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YEREVAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Armenia strongly supports
China's position on the Taiwan issue and opposes Taiwan
authorities' attempts to join the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Aleksandr Arzumanyan, the Armenian Minister of Foreign Affairs,
reiterated this today to Chinese National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee Vice-Chairman Wang Bingqian who heads a
visiting delegation here.
</P>
<P>
He said Armenia would never develop any official ties with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-Armenian relations, Arzumanyan said Armenia attached
great importance to developing ties with China. The joint
declaration signed by Armenian President Levon Ter-Petroscyan and
Chinese leaders in Beijing last year was of great significance to
the future development of bilateral ties. The two countries should
make joint efforts to further close links with each other, the
Minister added.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that although China and Armenia are far from each
other in distance, the two peoples have a long history of friendly
ties. This friendship had been strengthened and improved since the
two countries established diplomatic relations in 1992.
</P>
<P>
China was also glad to see stable bilateral political ties and
broader cooperation in areas such as science and trade.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government highly appraised Armenia's consistent
position on the Taiwan issue and the no official ties with Taiwan
policy on this matter. China hopes to gain further supports from
the Armenian government in the future, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Arzumanyan congratulated China on its resumption of the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and said China's experience
on solving the Hong Kong issue was of referential significance to
Armenia.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the Armenian National Assembly, the
Chinese delegation arrived in Armenia on Monday on an official
goodwill visit.

<P>
CARACAS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan farmers went on a
national strike today, accusing the government of lacking a
consistent public policy on agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Farmers claimed the inconsistent policy on agriculture is
provoking a shortage of food, and a lack of Venezuelan products
available for international markets.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural producers and Cattle breeders' unions from all
over the country decided to rally next Thursday in Cabello Port,in
the northern state of Carabobo.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the president of National Federation of
Farmers (Fedeagro) and the president of National Federation of
Cattle Breeders (Fedenaga) presented a document to the Finance
Ministry, expressing their demands.
</P>
<P>
The document stressed that the farmers faced market handicaps
as well as action by armed groups not only on the border with
Colombia but in Venezuela itself.
</P>
<P>
They also asked the Ministry to limit imports and pave the way
for national products to enter domestic markets.
</P>
<P>
They demanded Congress make an emergency agricultural law since
agriculture and cattle were strategic activities for the nation.
</P>
<P>
Today's strike is supported by several political parties, as
well as governors and majors from 14 states.

VIENNA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Federal Chancellor
Viktor Klima and Vice Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel rejected today
any referendum on Austria's membership in the Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Klima and Schuessel took their stand at a press conference here
after a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Austrian main opposition Freedom Party today officially
submitted a petition to the interior ministry for a referendum on
Austria's EMU membership.
</P>
<P>
Klima, who chairs the Social Democratic Party, said, he "firmly
believes Austria should be admitted to the EMU in the first
group," and opposed any kind of "wavering" on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Austria has made great efforts for the EMU
membership in the past two years, he added, "If we abandon the
plan now, that will not be logical."
</P>
<P>
He further stressed that it will be "unthinkable", and even
seriously harmful to its national economy and stability, if
Austria fails to join the EMU while Germany does.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel, also minister of foreign affairs, said the Austrian
government already sounded the public opinion when joining the
European Union. "Any move that creates doubt and distrust will
harm the country's economy, job opportunities and competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
The EMU will be kicked off on January 1, 1999, as scheduled in
the Maastricht Treaty.

YANGON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Myanmar
reached 6.361 billion U.S. dollars at the end of July this year,
the official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
The investment raised for 270 permitted projects came from 22
countries and regions, the report said, quoting the latest
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, foreign investment
increased four times over the corresponding period of last year
while domestic investment increased eight times, the report said.
But it did not give specific figures.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on promoting foreign and domestic investment here
Tuesday, Brigadier General Maung Maung, secretary of the Myanmar
Investment Commission (MIC), called for concerted efforts to
attract more foreign investment this year by granting generous
exemption or tax holiday and land use.

<TEXT>

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Foreign Ministry has
drawn up a bill on foreign relations to enable its foreign policy
to be executed in more integrated and coordinated ways, Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
In his address at a function here to observe his ministry's
52nd anniversary Tuesday, Alatas said diplomacy in today's world
cannot be pursued in partial or sectorally compartmentalized ways.
</P>
<P>
The minister did not give details of the bill.
</P>
<P>
"We can't conduct diplomacy if it is fragmentized into separate
departments such as political, economic, socio-cultural,
information, defense and security etc. It must be carried out in
integrated and well-coordinated ways," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said Indonesia had made a series of international
efforts to spearhead the establishment of a new order in
international relations, namely, the holding of the Afro-Asian
conference, the founding of the Non-Aligned Movement and ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations).
</P>
<P>
He said the 21st century would be the third millennium which
was often said to be the century of global competition.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Indonesian diplomats should face the challenges of
the future with professionalism, fighting spirit and high
morality, he said.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Nobel
Laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez condemned today the Colombian
government for misusing influence in the country's public auction
of frequency modulated radio stations.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to radio RCN, the winner of the 1982 Nobel Prize
for Literature warned that the government may do the same with
television.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Mines and Energy Minister Rodrigo Villamizar and
Communications Minister Arboleda Gomez have reportedly signed an
agreement to sell the 40 radio stations, currently for public
bidding, to "President Ernesto Samper`s friends".
</P>
<P>
Garcia Marquez has said he would support his partners at the
news TV show "Gap" to bid for a TV station, expected to be on
auction on January 1, 1998, though he knows they have little
chance due to their outspoken opposition to the president.
</P>
<P>
"Gap" is known for its critical comments on the
government.

<HEADLINE> Educators Criticize New Electronic Pets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The electronic pets craze sweeping
through many Asian countries is meeting strong criticism from
Chinese educators, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"It is naive to expect children to develop loving hearts simply
by playing with a toy. It will come and go as any passing fad,"
said Ai Ling, vice-chairman of the National Committee of Chinese
Yong Pioneers.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Beijing has seen a rise in pet sales in
big stores since late May, but sales have dropped since late July.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from more sellers, media's voice and teachers words have
contributed to this." said Sun Zhenpo, a manager with the
Wangfujing Department Store in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, stories and comments, most of which are
negative towards the pets, are frequently seen in newspapers, and
the State Education Commission (Sec) has also urged teachers to
give more lessons on how to spend money.
</P>
<P>
Fu Guoliang, deputy director of Sec's Primary Education
Department, warned children against becoming too involved in the
emotional world created by electronic pets.
</P>
<P>
Ai said the toy is not as instructive as advertisements
describe. The machine is personified and caters to children's
craving to make friends in an increasingly busy world.
</P>
<P>
But it is dangerous to have communications with friends in the
real world replaced by raising the electronic animals. They are
the same as game machines, which become harmful if children become
too absorbed in them.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Raises Interest Rates to Stabilize Rupiah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian monetary authorities
Tuesday raised interest rates sharply in an attempt to save the
rupiah from continued slide, a Bank Indonesia (BI) official said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank raised its one-week rates on Bank Indonesia
Certificates to 20 percent from 10.5 percent, head of the bank's
Money Market Division Suprijo Martono said here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Two-week rates were raised to 22 percent from 11 percent,
one-month rates to 30 percent from 11.625 percent, and three-month
rates to 28 percent from 11.5 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rates were left unchanged on overnight certificates at 15
percent, six-day certificates at 16 percent, six-month
certificates at 12.125 percent and one-year certificates at 12.750
percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah weakened against the U.S. dollar after the central
bank scrapped its intervention band last Thursday. The rupiah
dipped to a new low of 3,010 rupiah to the dollar Monday.
</P>
<P>
As a result of BI's measure, the value of the U.S. dollar
remained at the 2,915/2,925 rupiah level in inter-bank
transactions in the spot market Tuesday, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Stock Exchange's composite index fell 1.5 percent
with the announcement that interest rates had been raised,
reversing morning attempts by the government to support the
market.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs Saleh
Afiff said Tuesday that the government will continue exercising
its current tight money policy through fiscal and monetary means
in an effort to stabilize the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
He said what was important was the stability of macro-economy.
</P>
<P>
"It would be all right if the drop did occur -- possibly at
only 0.2 or 0.3 percent -- so long as macro-economic stability
maintained," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economy grows by an average of 7.9 percent a year
during the first three years of the current five-year development
plan period (1994-1999).
</P>
<P>
Last year, the growth was recorded at 7.98 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian federal government yesterday blocked
Australia's first heroin trial in the country's capital Canberra,
because a trial supplying heroin to drug addicts "would be sending
the wrong signal" about illicit drugs to young people.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Alleged Nazi war criminal Konrad Kalejs, who was ordered
deported by both the United States and Canada, will walk free in
Sydney this morning after Canadian authorities gave him just four
hours to pack his bags and leave the country. The 84-year-old man,
who emigrated to Australia in 1950, allegedly served as a
lieutenant with a concentration camp in Latvia during 1941-1944
where more than 20,000 Jews are thought to have perished.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- The Reserve Bank of Australia is no longer certain that the
economy is set to pick up in coming months. In a cautious
statement yesterday, it again forecast an acceleration of growth
this financial year, but conceded that this might not arrive.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- John Prescott, chief executive of Australia's biggest
company BHP, said any of the mining giant's assets will either be
restructured or sold unless they will earn a return on their
capital of more than 10 percent by May 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Technology stocks led a broad
rally on Wall Street today, wiping almost every remaining trace of
Friday's selloff, as the Federal Reserve decided not to raise
interest rates to quench inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average, which on Monday recouped a
little less than half of Friday's 247-point drop, jumped 114.74
points to 7,918.10.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than a 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 545.58
million shares as against 514.27 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock measures also posted sizable gains, led by the
technology-rich Nasdaq composite index, which rose 2 percent on
the day.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index bounced 31.19 points to 1,600.71.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 13.52 points to
926.01, and the NYSE composite index rose 5.99 to 479.54. and the
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 6.63 to 641.22.
</P>
<P>
Although the market's recent tumble came amid worries that
inflationary pressures may be mounting again, there is no
expectation in the market that the Federal Reserve will take any
action today to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
In another sign that the economic pace may still be moderate
enough to keep inflation in check without higher Fed rates, the
Commerce Department reported this morning that housing starts were
unchanged in July.

<HEADLINE> Berlin to Mark Return of Jewish War Refugees From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A commemorative plaque will be
unveiled in Berlin Thursday to mark the 50th anniversary of the
return of 295 Jewish refugees to Germany from their second
hometown, Shanghai, after the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made today by the German association
"Active Museum Fascism and Resistance" in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese port city of Shanghai gave shelter to about 18,000
Jews, mainly from Germany and Austria, who fled the holocaust
during the Nazi era. Only a very small proportion of the Jewish
refugees returned to Germany after the war. Most of them migrated
to Israel, the United States and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the war-time refugees will participate in an
unveiling ceremony for the commemorative plaque Thursday in
Berlin. A symposium titled "The End of Exile in Shanghai" and an
exhibition are also scheduled for the next few days.

<HEADLINE> US Fire Deaths Highest in Six Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Fires engulfed 4,990 people
last year in the United States, more than at any time since 1990,
the National Fire Protection Association said.
</P>
<P>
"This is certainly disappointing news, but we're hopeful it
doesn't signal a long-term trend," The Associated Press quoted
association spokesman John Hall as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hall said fire death rates have generally declined throughout
this century. There were about 6,000 deaths a year for most of the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
"Now we seem to be locked into roughly 4,700 deaths a year," he
said. "Whatever else is true, the numbers demonstrate that fire
still poses a significant problem in the U.S."
