SPORTS COLUMN: AN ECHO FROM '98 IS HEARD IN ATLANTA  
 (HLW)

   ATLANTA _ If Scott Brosius follows form, the Atlanta Braves
better beware on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius, the most valuable player in last year's World Series,
stroked three singles Saturday night, including one that ignited
the four-run rally in the eighth inning that propelled the Yankees
past the Atlanta Braves, 4-1, in Game 1 of this year's World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely hero rapped three singles in Game 2 of last year's
World Series against San Diego, then crushed the Padres in the
third game by lashing two home runs in successive innings and
turning a 3-0 deficit into a 5-4 Yankees victory. The Braves
wouldn't want to see Brosius perform in a similar manner against
them in the second game, then have to go to New York down, two
games to none.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Braves won the first two games in New York and went
home up by two games to none, but didn't win another game. It would
be too much for them to hope for an exact reversal of that World
Series this time, especially with Brosius in the batter's box
against them.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the unassuming third baseman play a pivotal role in
the victories in the second and third games last year, but he also
singled home the second run in the 3-0 victory that completed the
four-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   His World Series performance capped a terrific post-season for
Brosius. He batted .383 and hit four home runs in the three series
the Yankees won. He did not start out this post-season as well. He
had only 1 hit in 10 at-bats in the division series against Texas,
then had 4 hits in 18 at-bats against Boston, though half the hits
were home runs.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the World Series began, Brosius was back on beam.
He led off the third inning tonight with a single to right field,
singled to center with two out in the fifth and opened the eighth
with yet another single, this one to left. At that point the
Yankees had four hits against Greg Maddux and Brosius had three of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, on the other hand, had only one hit against Orlando
Hernandez, who continued his own dazzling post-season performance.
El Duque entered the game with a 4-0 record and a 0.97 earned run
average in five starts this year and last. The hit was a Chipper
Jones home run in the fourth inning, his first home run in a month,
since he destroyed the Mets in a three-game series here.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves were able to do nothing else with Hernandez. He
struck out the side in the first inning, and he struck out the side
in the third. He added four other strikeouts in his seven innings
of work, getting Gerald Williams and Bret Boone, the first two
batters in the Braves' lineup, in each of their first two times at
bat. He also struck out Eddie Perez twice.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was the Braves' leading hitter against the Mets in the
National League Championship Series, amassing 10 hits in 20
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who had batted 59 times without a home run in 19 games
since his four-homer flurry against the Mets last month, did not
perturb Hernandez with his fourth-inning towering fly ball into the
right-field stands. Hernandez retired the next two batters, ending
the inning, then set down the Braves in order in the fifth and
sixth innings. He wisely walked Jones as the leadoff batter in the
seventh, then got Brian Jordan and Ryan Klesko on infield pops.
With Andruw Jones at bat, Chipper tried to steal second and was
thrown out, ending that inning.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius then led off the eighth inning with his third single. It
was Hernandez's turn to bat, but Manager Joe Torre decided this was
not the time for another sacrifice bunt. Hernandez had executed a
perfect bunt for a sacrifice in the third inning, putting his
countryman Rey Ordonez to shame.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez bunted five times in the Mets' series against the Braves
and popped up four times.
</P>
<P>
   Here was an American League pitcher who virtually never bats,
and he bunts the first pitch he sees for a sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Torre had a different idea in the eighth, though. He sent up
Darryl Strawberry to bat for Hernandez and the Braves deployed an
exaggerated shift against him. The Braves had three infielders
between first and second for the left-handed batter and had Chipper
Jones playing at the regular shortstop position, though even he was
shaded toward second.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' strategy didn't work, though, because Maddux walked
him. Torre's strategy worked because the Yankees went on to score
four runs in the inning. Brosius scored the first on a single by
Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez pitched no more, but he ended the evening with his
fifth post-season victory against no defeats and a 1.02 earned run
average.

HEY, PAUL, TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Trojans can't hold 21-point leads and they
continue to take penalties at the darndest times. But we'll say
this for coach Paul Hackett; there's one area in which he has the
USC players impeccably schooled.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to a question of accountability, his athletes and
assistants don't cower. When the sword is presented to them, they
dutifully fall on it.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday at the Coliseum, everybody from offensive
coordinator Hue Jackson to first-year linebacker Markus Steele bore
the humiliation for the Trojans' second disheartening
come-from-way-ahead loss in as many weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They all proclaimed themselves responsible for the Trojans'
35-31 loss to Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   They all waded into the quicksand of culpability.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody, that is, except for Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicably, inexcusably, the second-year Trojans head coach
had to be prodded into offering the weakest of branches to his
sinking players.
</P>
<P>
   While quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst, running back Chad Morton
and the entire special-teams unit but especially placekicker David
Newbury were in the locker room struggling to keep their chins up,
Hackett was in a nearby interview area saying, ``When you fumble on
(Stanford's) 5-yard line, shank punts, miss two field goals, that
hurts you. Those are momentum changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. But so is getting caught with 10 defensive players on
the field, a gaffe an observant Stanford offense exploited by
running Brian Allen through the hole where linebacker Sultan
Abdul-Malik should have been for a 13-yard gain on a drive that
begat seven points.
</P>
<P>
   So is getting caught with only six men on the line of scrimmage
on a down early in a series midway through the fourth quarter in a
situation that screamed ``MUST SCORE.''
</P>
<P>
   So is spending the 20-minute halftime devising ways to cork
Stanford's big-play offense and then watching the Cardinal offense
flow like champagne out of a bottle on the opening series of the
third quarter to pull within three points at 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   So is failing for two-and-a-half quarters to get a pass into the
hands of senior Windrell Hayes, who had caught two passes in each
of USC's first two possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett is being paid handsomely to head off these kinds of
lapses, or at least treat them before they become a cancer that
kills a season.
</P>
<P>
   If professors of philosophy at USC are judged on how well their
students process the information fed to them, why should it be any
different for the resident professor of pigskin?
</P>
<P>
   After he stepped away from the cameras and the microphones and
the tape recorders, someone asked Hackett if his observation that
``we have to do some things better than we're doing them right
now,'' extended to the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said it did. When pressed, he prattled on about the
coaches needing to evaluate their preparation and improve the
efficiency with which they make substitutions and mete out
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Truer words were never spoken. The pity is he waited for an
audience of one to clear his throat and his conscience. If
Hackett's going to openly question the leadership of the seniors _
whom he conveniently didn't happen to recruit _ and not-so-subtly
point out the mistakes of specific players in public, why is it he
must be prodded before poking a finger at himself?
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't look good.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's your perception,'' Hackett said, spitting out his
words. ``You will say whatever you want to write, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   He then disappeared into the coaches' room, safely out of reach
of any more blitzing reporters.
</P>
<P>
   If only Hackett were a stand-up guy, we wouldn't have to chase
after him.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it would be hard not to feel a pang of sympathy if he
looked us straight in the eye, as did Jackson, and said, ``If
anybody should take the blame, it's me. I've got to get (USC's
offensive weapons) in better situations.''
</P>
<P>
   We'd be more inclined to cut Hackett some slack if he didn't act
like there was nothing left for him to know when it comes to X's
and O's. Asked if he considered utilizing Van Raaphorst out of the
shotgun formation to counteract the Cardinal's all-out ballfield
blitzing, Hackett curtly replied, ``We don't use the shotgun.''
</P>
<P>
   Next question?
</P>
<P>
   He talks about his players not all being on the same page, but
sometimes it seems Hackett is the one who is confused. He couldn't
explain why Hayes had four catches after 10 minutes and none for he
next 41. Hackett said Hayes fatigued but Hayes said he was
``perfectly fine'' and that he was getting open in the second and
third quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' Hayes said plaintively.
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: The man in the USC T-shirt who was
screaming expletives at the Trojan players as they trudged toward
the tunnel after the game was out of line.
</P>
<P>
   Any damnation of the USC football players ought to be directed
at Hackett. For better or for worse, it's his team. &QL;

SOWARD INJURY CAPS BAD DAY FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He wasn't included in the postgame report, but USC
wide receiver R. Jay Soward might have suffered the most
troublesome injury against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Soward strained his left hamstring early in the fourth quarter
and wasn't sure how serious it was after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I stand up and move, it hurts really bad,'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would play next week, Soward said: ``We'll see. You
don't really know how it is until the next day. Right now, I'm
still on adrenalin.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Markus Steele sprained his left ankle but said he
would be OK, although he required crutches. Offensive lineman
Faasea Mailo badly bruised his right shin and was X-rayed, but no
damage was detected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's broken. I'm really fortunate,'' Mailo said. ``The
thing went numb on me. It's pretty painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Near goat: Stanford coach Tyrone Willingham almost looked silly
in the fourth quarter, when he decided to go for it on fourth-and-1
at his own 45.
</P>
<P>
   USC linebacker Zeke Moreno stuffed quarterback Todd Husak for no
gain and the Trojans took over with 2:08 left. Fortunately for
Willingham, USC failed to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought process was that if we could get one inch, we
could win the game,'' Willingham said. ``Was there risk? No
question. But we waived the risk. It wasn't about punting.''
</P>
<P>
   Star-crossed game: USC cornerback Antuan Simmons was everywhere
Saturday _ for better or worse. Simmons had two interceptions,
forced a fumble and recovered a fumble against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   He also had 15-yard personal foul and a defensive holding on
third down that gave Stanford a first-and-goal at the 2.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons' second interception was highly dubious, as replays
indicated he did not have control of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Record reception: USC wide receiver Kareem Kelly already owned
the freshman mark for most receptions in a season, and claimed the
freshman record for most yardage against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   He now has 632 yards receiving, which breaks R. Jay Soward's
freshman record of 507. Kelly has three 100-yard receiving games
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Local visitors: Chatsworth quarterback Matt Cassel and his
little brother, Justin, attended the game. So did Taft tight end
Gregg Guenther. Cassel and Guenther have already committed to the
Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Longest play: USC wide receivers Marcell Allmond and Soward each
had 64-yard touchdown receptions. Ironically, those are the
Trojans' longest plays from scrimmage this season. &QL;

CATCHERS: SIBLINGS, WITHOUT THE RIVALRY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The lockers in Fenway Park are a No. 2 pencil or two
wider than those found in most high schools, and after the Yankees
edged the Red Sox in Game 4 and took a commanding lead in the
series, the catchers Joe Girardi and Jorge Posada were crammed
together at their lockers, side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi played that night in Boston, as he has played most
nights in the post-season, vaulting over Posada for the majority of
the action; Girardi knew Posada was greatly disappointed about
this. Six years older than Posada, his crew cut speckled gray,
Girardi turned to Posada and spoke of Game 5, when Orlando
Hernandez would pitch and Posada would catch, just as happened
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be great, Jorge,'' Girardi said. ``I know you
didn't get to play as much as you wanted, but you're going to get a
chance to close it out and be the one who jumps into the arms of
the pitcher. I'm really happy that it worked out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   They are like siblings, except that they don't fight like most
brothers. ``I love working with Jorge, love working together, just
trying to improve and push each other,'' said Girardi. ``We want
the best for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   When Posada arrived in the big leagues for good, in the 1997
season, Girardi was the No. 1 catcher, Posada the heir apparent.
Girardi knew that Posada would eventually take over the majority of
the playing time in the regular season. Rather than resent Posada,
Girardi embraced him. Girardi has a belief _ seemingly out of date
in this era _ that he has a responsibility to do whatever he can to
help the team succeed, even if it means helping the guy who is
taking his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``No catcher could come to the big leagues could be treated any
better than Posada,'' said Don Zimmer, the bench coach. ``But
that's Joe Girardi; that's his style. Joe has done everything he
could to make the other guy better.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada deeply appreciates how helpful Girardi has been, and
cares a great deal about Girardi; he does not resent Girardi's
presence. Posada does have feelings, independent of Girardi, that
his own development was damaged because he was unable to become a
full-fledged front-line catcher this year.
</P>
<P>
   Posada recalled the final weekend of the regular season. ``You
come to the park and you're not playing and you sit down,'' he
said. ``After playing a couple of days, you sit down for two, three
or four days. When you get back in the lineup, you want to do so
well when you do play _ you're not relaxed. You're not doing what
you're supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurts when you go 0 for 4, and the next day, you're not
playing. A lot of negative things go through your head. You've got
a blurry situation and you don't know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada had a horrible start, a time when Manager Joe Torre was
recuperating from prostate cancer surgery and Zimmer was running
the club. Posada hit .210 in the first half of the season,
accumulating the bulk of his 17 passed balls in 1999 _ more than 24
of the 30 teams in Major League Baseball _ and had his eyesight
tested in June as a result. After spending the All-Star break
talking with his father and then seeing ultrasound pictures of his
unborn son, Posada relaxed and played better in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very happy coming into spring training,'' he said. ``I
had a lot of expectations, good things going in my head. And it
didn't turn out that way. I had two tough months, offensively and
defensively, and I had a lot of negative things going through my
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to put that aside. When Joe Torre came back, there was a
lot of relief. We talked a lot; nothing against Zim, but I didn't
know how to approach Zim. I always talked to Torre, and I didn't
know how to talk to Zim. When Torre came back, I started playing
like I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Girardi was prepared to play elsewhere this season. General
Manager Brian Cashman informed Girardi that the Yankees would not
exercise their $3.4-million option for the 1999 season, and Girardi
was curious about playing elsewhere. He had grown up in Peoria,
Ill., attended Northwestern, broken into the big leagues with the
Cubs; word was the Cubs were interested in signing him. The Detroit
Tigers and Baltimore Orioles also intended to bid on Girardi.
</P>
<P>
   But in the hours before Girardi would become a free agent, Torre
persuaded George Steinbrenner to retain Girardi for one more
season. That ended any chance that Posada would develop into a
full-time catcher this year. Posada started 85 games at catcher in
1998, 98 in 1999; most everyday catchers work 125 to 130 games.
</P>
<P>
   There has been disagreement within the Yankees' organization
whether Posada's development should have been accelerated, whether
he should have caught more games and assumed more responsibility.
Some club executives maintained that Posada should have been given
a larger share of the playing time, while Torre continues to lean
on Girardi. Torre knows first-hand how pitchers prefer Girardi for
his experience, and he knows that a contented pitcher is more
likely to win.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's post-season, Posada teamed with Hernandez and
David Wells, while Girardi worked with Andy Pettitte and David
Cone. The playing time was split, Girardi starting six of the 11
games.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Girardi is teaming with Pettitte, Cone and Roger
Clemens, Posada with Hernandez. Girardi has caught five playoff
games, Posada three, and Girardi is scheduled to catch five of the
seven games in the World Series although Saturday night it was
Posada, going 0 for 4 with Hernandez starting.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi doesn't believe Posada's development has been damaged
because of Torre's reliance on both. ``I think he's been part of
something more important than playing every day,'' said Girardi.
``Playing 60 percent of the time and learning how to win and
playing important games can be just as important as playing 80
percent of the games. In the long run, it's more rewarding. He's
got another seven or eight years to play every day. What he's been
able to go through the last three years has been worth a ton of
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The path is clear for Posada to become the Yankees' No. 1,
full-time catcher next season, for at least one year. Posada will
be eligible for arbitration, and even with his diminished offensive
numbers, he remains a relatively low-cost commodity. But he will
have to establish himself once and for all in the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi is almost certainly going to play elsewhere next year;
the idea of playing every day intrigues him. The Cubs again are
said to be interested in signing Girardi, and he and Kim Girardi,
his wife, gave birth to a girl in September and recently built a
new home in the Chicago area. ``You go home and you weigh your
options and you do what's best for your family,'' said Girardi.
``Obviously, our family has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, will the relationship between the Yankees' catching
brethren.

KINGS TRY TO RECOVER FROM LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The yelling was over by Saturday, but the work had
just begun.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 12 hours after the Kings' most embarrassing loss of
the young season, coach Andy Murray and his staff assembled the
club at Iceoplex to address tonight's opponent San Jose and
remember the mistakes against Phoenix on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who benched the first two lines for the final six
minutes of the 6-3 loss, had a one-hour meeting to remind the team
that its lack of effort was not acceptable. Murray then held an
exhausting 90-minute practice that included work behind both nets,
clearing pucks on defense and setting up scoring chances on
offense.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly the practice was about mental preparation. The Kings
had a 3-1 lead in the second period with a power-play opportunity.
But the Coyotes scored short-handed, the first of five consecutive
goals that included scores just 10 seconds apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were embarrassed,'' said benched winger Luc Robitaille, who
has not had a goal in four games after getting seven in the first
week. ``One thing that is very important to an NHL player is his
pride. We were hurt by the way we played and that is one thing we
have to change. We are much better than we showed last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who blasted his team after Friday's game, was a little
more subdued Saturday. A little. After discussing San Jose, which
has the most points in the league, Murray flipped over the
blackboard that still had the names of the Phoenix players from the
night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them if they really think the Coyotes are that strong
and that we are that weak,'' Murray said. ``I wanted them to look
at those names. We have a good team, but that effort was
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of making major lineup changes, Murray is keeping the
group intact. Goalie Stephane Fiset, who by his own account let in
three bad goals, will be back for his 10th start in 11 games. Jamie
Storr, who started the only other game but left after one period
with a sore groin, will start Tuesday against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He let in some bad goals, but the team really let him down,''
Murray said. ``He has played very well this year and picked us up
many times when we needed a lift. Last night he needed to be picked
up and we just left him out there to get beaten up. I think you
just put him back there to show him it wasn't his fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said it was scary to think where the Kings might have
been without the production of their third line. Ian Laperriere
scored his first two goals of the season. Rookie Brad Chartrand did
an outstanding job tailing Keith Tkachuk until the Phoenix captain
scored a power-play goal at 13:49 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, who entered the game with the league's top power
play, went 1 for 4 with the man advantage. Ziggy Palffy scored with
17 seconds remaining in the first period, but it was his only shot
of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the first line, we understand how important it is to set
the tone for the rest of the team,'' Robitaille said. ``We let down
and we know it. I've been benched before. But the message has
gotten through.''

SPORTS COLUMN: EL DUQUE PROVIDES NEW WORLD SERIES MEMORIES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for rewrite throughout)   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Smoltz still recalls the acrid smell of burning
automobiles. Jim Leyritz still tries to will Carlton Fisk's fly
ball foul. Kevin McGlinchy still shudders at the televised horror
of Mookie's grounder going under Buckner's glove.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the World Series memories drive athletic little boys to
become major leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   The World Series is different. The 50 Braves and Yankees who
began the 1999 World Series last night were united in knowing that
the baseball season shifts a mighty gear after the league
championship series.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest feats and shocks usually happen late in a World
Series, but Saturday night's opener saw terrific pitching by
Orlando Hernandez, the Yankee from Cuba. A stirring sight the
moment he began to jog in the outfield to warm up, arms punching
forward like a prizefighter doing road work, El Duque struck out 10
Braves in seven innings and gave up only a home run to Chipper
Jones as the Yanks beat the Braves, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but El Duque, who does not bat in league games
because of the designated hitter gimmick, even laid down a perfect
sacrifice bunt. If his countryman, Rey Ordonez of the Mets, could
bunt at all, there might have been a Subway Series after all.
</P>
<P>
   If this was not a classic game, it was surely a gripping start
to the latest World Series, not merely ``the finals.'' No matter
how much television people yammer about ``post-season records,'' it
is just a case of having too many computers for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   It is irrelevant if modern players approach the records of
Berra, Mantle, Ford and Gibson, who earned their World Series
statistics when there was no league series, just the best teams
from the American League and National League deciding it all.
Nowadays a batter, or even a relief pitcher, could play 19
post-season games in October. Somebody please tell the networks
they are comparing kumquats to persimmons.
</P>
<P>
   Even with league playoffs, the World Series brings back the
little boy in these grizzled professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, only a few minutes after the Mets had lost a
crushing 11-inning decision to the Braves, Turk Wendell from
Pittsfield, Mass., was asked if he had been looking forward to a
Subway Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I'm a Red Sox fan, and I was hoping they'd get in,''
Wendell blurted out.
</P>
<P>
   And Wendell was not alone. Last week, shortly before the Red Sox
went to their preordained defeat to the Yankees, Glavine of the
Braves, but originally from Concord, Mass., said, ``Yeah, I still
keep an eye on the Red Sox. Obviously, the kid in me is happy for
the Red Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   Many players insist they gave away those childlike fantasies
when they began earning major league paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rooted for the Reds and the Yanks when I was a kid, but that
kind of dies out,'' said Walt Weiss of the Braves, who grew up just
north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is the romantic concept of the Red Sox, those doomed
regional heroes, that stays alive longest in the hearts of a few
ball players.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Remlinger, the Dartmouth graduate and the Braves'
left-handed reliever, still quivers at the recollection of a
certain home run by Bucky Dent of the Yankees in 1978, not in a
World Series but in a special playoff with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the East Coast rivalries are more intense,'' noted
Remlinger, who grew up around Plymouth, Mass. ``I remember crying,
`How can he do that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger added, ``The World Series is what all kids grew up
on,'' but he admitted that post-season plays like the fantastic
stop and throw home by Weiss to help the Braves beat the Astros, or
the two extra-inning thrillers with the Mets are as good as
baseball gets.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the World Series stands apart. John Smoltz, the
bearded sage from Warren, Mich., recalls his father taking him to
Tiger Stadium for the fifth game of the 1984 World Series. The
Tigers wrapped it up, but fans burned cars and menaced the
neighborhood on that long and ugly evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad showed me how people react to victory,'' Smoltz said
the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he still rooted for the Tigers, Smoltz seemed to fight
a very human inclination to say yes. What he said was, ``I still
root for the three other Detroit teams. And since I live here now,
I root for the three Atlanta teams, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz, the prodigal Yankee, knew where his boyhood heart was:
``I grew up near Cincinnati,'' he said. ``I remember staying up
late in 1975 to watch the sixth game. I remember Fisk's home run. I
was very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   To some children in Atlanta, he is the latter-day version of
Carlton Fisk _ or even General Sherman _ for the way he torched the
Braves with his three-run game-tying homer in the fourth game of
the 1996 World Series. McGlinchy, the fine young Atlanta relief
pitcher from Walden, Mass., remembers 1986, when he stayed up late
on a Saturday night to watch their New England team put away the
Mets, only to have the awful event take place. As it happens,
McGlinchy was the pitcher when the Mets staged their comeback in
the stirring 15-inning game last Sunday in that very same Shea
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like an inhumane stretch for a journalist to bring up
that linkage to McGlinchy. Besides, Mookie's moment happened in a
World Series game whereas McGlinchy's bad inning took place in a
championship series. The Red Sox never recovered whereas the Braves
have moved on to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody will make baseball history, wonderful or hideous, in
the next week or so. What happens now is a season unto itself. It
is the World Series.

AN ANGEL GETS KICKED UPSTAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - In the morning, she drove to Buckeye to visit with one
of the dying. Now, it was afternoon and she was on her way to visit
another one of the dying.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was the life of Eloise Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   It's what she trained to do. It's what she loved. She was never
late. She never missed an appointment, not until this particular
Tuesday afternoon, Oct. 19, when Eloise herself was one of the dy
ing but did not know it.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, she'd been working as a nurse for Hospice of
the Valley, an agency that helps the terminally ill and their
families deal with the difficul ties, physical and otherwise, of
passing on.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was able to do the job because she was able to take people
just as they were,'' says Donna Moffa, who worked with Eloise at
Hospice. ``You have to have a very special heart to pull that off.
That was Eloise.''
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Erie, Pa., though her friends in Arizona knew
little about her young life, other than the jokes Eloise made about
being a ``wild child.''
</P>
<P>
   Connie Miller was close to her. &QL; 
`NO ORDINARY PERSON'
</P>
<P>
   ``This was no ordinary person,'' she says. ``This was an angel.
I mean, yes, she was a mom and a wife and a friend and a nurse, but
she lived, spiritually, on a level above the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   When she met her husband, Ernesto, he spoke no English and
Eloise spoke no Spanish. They helped each other be come bilingual,
and she used the skill to translate for Hospice families who needed
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She refused to turn off the beeper she carried,'' Connie
Miller says. `` `Someone might need me,' she'd say. And someone
always did.''
</P>
<P>
   Eloise had two boys, one 7 and one 13. She had a husband and a
career and a house and a life. A future.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do work in a profession like this, however, you learn
about ap preciating the present because you don't know what will
happen,'' Donna Moffa says.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone who works at Hospice, Moffa and Miller often are
told, ``I could never do what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something people always say,'' Moffa says, ``but the
truth is many of them could do it. This is really the most
wonderful job in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller adds, ``Once this becomes part of your life, once you've
been able to help one family, one person, if only for a little
while, it's as if you can't see yourself doing anything else. I
know that's how Eloise viewed it. I used to joke with her that our
work was like taking out an insurance policy for the next life.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 2 p.m. on Oct. 19, Eloise Delgado was headed east
on In terstate 10, on her way to visit a family in need. It was a

   A work crew from a local prison was clearing trash along the

highway is 75 mph. The Chrysler drifted into the wide trough of the

HELPING EACH OTHER

<P>
   ``All of a sudden, those of us who help others deal with such
things had to help one another,'' Miller says.
</P>
<P>
   Only, unlike the usual Hospice case, there was no time to
prepare for the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes it a lot tougher,'' says Susan Goldwater, Hospice's
executive director. ``Most of us will die as the re sult of some
illness extending over a long period of time. In this case, there
was no time to come to grips with it. That can be very difficult to
deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   More than once over the years, Eloise told Miller that,
spiritually, she was pre pared for death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like she wanted it, because she had such a great
family, but she be lieved everyone should be prepared,'' Miller
says. ``Eloise was. Like I said, she was an angel on earth.''

   It's a tough job. And after reaching the highest level of
celestial efficiency a human can hope to achieve, she got pro

AN ANGEL GETS KICKED UPSTAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - In the morning, she drove to Buckeye to visit with one
of the dying. Now, it was afternoon and she was on her way to visit
another one of the dying.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was the life of Eloise Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   It's what she trained to do. It's what she loved. She was never
late. She never missed an appointment, not until this particular
Tuesday afternoon, Oct. 19, when Eloise herself was one of the dy
ing but did not know it.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, she'd been working as a nurse for Hospice of
the Valley, an agency that helps the terminally ill and their
families deal with the difficul ties, physical and otherwise, of
passing on.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was able to do the job because she was able to take people
just as they were,'' says Donna Moffa, who worked with Eloise at
Hospice. ``You have to have a very special heart to pull that off.
That was Eloise.''
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Erie, Pa., though her friends in Arizona knew
little about her young life, other than the jokes Eloise made about
being a ``wild child.''
</P>
<P>
   Connie Miller was close to her. &QL; 
`NO ORDINARY PERSON'
</P>
<P>
   ``This was no ordinary person,'' she says. ``This was an angel.
I mean, yes, she was a mom and a wife and a friend and a nurse, but
she lived, spiritually, on a level above the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   When she met her husband, Ernesto, he spoke no English and
Eloise spoke no Spanish. They helped each other be come bilingual,
and she used the skill to translate for Hospice families who needed
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She refused to turn off the beeper she carried,'' Connie
Miller says. `` `Someone might need me,' she'd say. And someone
always did.''
</P>
<P>
   Eloise had two boys, one 7 and one 13. She had a husband and a
career and a house and a life. A future.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do work in a profession like this, however, you learn
about ap preciating the present because you don't know what will
happen,'' Donna Moffa says.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone who works at Hospice, Moffa and Miller often are
told, ``I could never do what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something people always say,'' Moffa says, ``but the
truth is many of them could do it. This is really the most
wonderful job in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller adds, ``Once this becomes part of your life, once you've
been able to help one family, one person, if only for a little
while, it's as if you can't see yourself doing anything else. I
know that's how Eloise viewed it. I used to joke with her that our
work was like taking out an insurance policy for the next life.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 2 p.m. on Oct. 19, Eloise Delgado was headed east
on In terstate 10, on her way to visit a family in need. It was a
sunny day. Traffic was light. Near Milepost 119, close to the
Jackrabbit exit, something happened to one of the tires on her 1993
Chrysler. A blowout, perhaps. Or the tread simply came off.
</P>

FOX REWORK OF `LIFE' NOT ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(UNDATED) - They are the three words no one in television wants to
hear: 
``Rework the pilot.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some tinkering is to be expected with any pilot, which is, after
all, a one-time ep isode meant to sell a network (and advertis ers)
on a show. By the time the show actually winds up on the air, some
changes usually have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the character of the sister's boy friend needed to be
recast. Perhaps the pro ducers couldn't secure the rights to a
certain song and had to find another one. Or maybe the all-knowing
troll who lives in the basement and serves as a narrator was such a
bad idea that he needed to be cut from the show entirely.
</P>
<P>
   These things happen. But when a pilot that has been in the works
for a while has to be not just fine-tuned but re worked, it smells
like trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case with Time of Your Life, the Jenni fer Love
Hewitt spinoff of Party of Five that premieres Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the first episode, a question arises: If this is
the new, improved version, how bad must the original have been?
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to executive producers Chris Keyser and Amy Lippman,
the Fox Net work decided to pair Life with Ally McBeal instead of
Party of Five, as was originally planned. That's good news, but it
meant re working the show to make it a better fit for the Monday
night lineup.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to people who like to watch television, they should
have made a better show.
</P>
<P>
   Life finds Hewitt's character, Sarah, leav ing Bailey and the
rest of the Party clan be hind in California and heading to New
York City in search of her birth father (she is adopted, and her
mother died a couple of years ago).
</P>
<P>
   Apparently meant to be a sort of valen tine to both Hewitt, who
is also a producer of the show, and NYC, Life instead comes off as
overly fanciful to the point of ridicu lousness. Sure,Rudy Giuliani
has famously cleaned up Times Square and forced New Yorkers to be
more polite, but the Big Ap ple of this show makes Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood look like a housing project.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the producers have made things more realistic than
they originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original pilot is a little bit like a fable about this
city,'' Keyser said this sum mer. ``It has a little bit of a
fabulous tone to it, and we've pulled back on that slightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Extremely slightly. Having seen the first episode, all I can
figure is that the original pilot, which wasn't made available to
crit ics, must have co-starred the Muppets. (The human Muppet,
Rosie O'Donnell, has a cameo in the reworked version.)
</P>
<P>
   Or doesn't everyone who shows up at a strange building at night
in the heart of the city without her baggage (lost, naturally) end
up finding a roommate and friend be fore the sun comes up? By the
time a cou ple of days have passed, Sarah has several friends, a
job and reason to stay in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be in a strange city,'' she says near the end of the
episode, ``with no money and no plan and no one I know and say,
`Bring it on, whatever it is, I'll handle it and I'll figure it out
as I go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well, if everyone's New York experience worked out like
hers, who wouldn't want the same thing?
</P>
<P>
   Just when you think the plot can get no sappier, the situations
no more ridiculous, it happens _ they do. Do events conspire to
allow Hewitt, who has a lower-profile ca reer as a singer, to belt
out not one but two tunes? Of course they do.
</P>
<P>
   Are the songs really New York, New York and It's the End of the
World as We Know It, two songs whose telegraphed messages are so
obvious no one could miss their meaning? Of course they are.
</P>
<P>
   When she finally meets the man she believes is her father, is
the only place she can catch a quiet moment with him in the men's
room as he stands at a urinal? Of course it is.
</P>
<P>
   And so forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played her (Sarah) for a re ally, really long time and I
feel re ally close to her,'' Hewitt said. ``And it's going to be
kind of fun to see what new stuff she gets to expe rience and do,
and how she sort of grows up.''
</P>
<P>
   If Life's first episode is any indi cation, those experiences
will in volve a wicked witch and a yellow-brick road.
</P>
<P>
   Keyser and Lippman said all the right things to TV critics this
sum mer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a show in trouble does not get awarded the best time
slot on the schedule,'' Lippman said.
</P>
<P>
   True enough. Though the way Fox's new shows have performed so
far this season, ``best'' may be a relative term.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing else we can say,'' Keyser said of rumors of
prob lems with the show. ``I mean . . . in some ways this is sort
of an exam ple of, if you ask the question enough times, it becomes
true, you know what I mean? It doesn't mat ter what answer we give.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there's nothing else we can do except to say we love this,
we love the script, we love our cast, we'll show you the episode.
Watch it. If you think it's bad, you'll write that.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider it done. &QL;

PIPE BACTERIA SPELL DOOM FOR FIRE SPRINKLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JON KAMMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - What started five years ago as just a little drip in
the Tempe computer center of a major corporation has grown to a
flood of nationwide concern that fire-sprinkler systems are at risk
of being ruined by bacteria found in drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The pinhole-size leak discovered in May 1994 was one of many
that began turning up in overhead sprinkler pipes at the hub for
worldwide computer operations of AlliedSignal Inc., one of
Arizona's largest private employers.
</P>
<P>
   Colonies of industrious bacteria, generally categorized as
biofilms for the slimy shields they create to protect themselves,
had anchored along the pipe walls and, although not literally
eating the metal, were causing rapid decay.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is an ages-old affliction of countless water, gas,
petroleum and industrial pipe systems, but it hadn't been given
much attention in fire-safety systems until AlliedSignal pursued
the issue _ and an estimated $25 million in replacement costs _ in
federal court lawsuits blaming Phoenix and Tempe, its water
providers.
</P>
<P>
   That sent the nation's fire-safety industry, water utilities,
property insurers, scientists, lawyers and building owners
scrambling to examine sprinkler pipes as never before.
</P>
<P>
   What they have found in some cases is cause for alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Bacterial corrosion of sprinkler pipes, often mild but sometimes
clogging an entire system, is ``very widespread and a very serious
problem,'' said Daniel Pope, whose consulting firm diagnosed the
problem for AlliedSignal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have fire-protection systems designed for 50 to 75 years
of service that in some cases are failing within months of
installation,'' said Pope, a former Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute microbiology professor who named the pipe-destroying
phenomenon MIC, for microbiologically influenced corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, the problem is ``potentially life-threatening''
for anyone who relies on fire sprinklers to work flawlessly, Pope
said from his Bioindustrial Technologies Inc. office near Durango,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   When an electrical fire broke out last year in an Iowa nursing
home, the sprinkler system activated properly, but delivered no
water because every sprinkler head was plugged tight by MIC.
Patients were narrowly evacuated without injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have yet to lose a life to MIC,'' said Tariq Bsharat, the
top technical expert for the National Fire Sprinkler Association,
based in Patterson, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The odds against keeping that record intact are worsening daily.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, a Phoenix corporation that specializes in cleaning
MIC-riddled pipes found that the fire-protection system of a
suburban Chicago bank was so corroded that it, too, would have
failed in an emergency, said Steven Carl, chief executive of
H.E.R.C. Products Inc.
</P>
<P>
   There was one startling difference from the nursing-home case,
though. In Iowa, the pipes had been installed for about 25 years;
the Chicago system was only 2{ years old, Carl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd bet the sprinklers in nearby hotels wouldn't work,
either,'' he said, observing that MIC often shows up in clusters of
buildings served along the same branches of water mains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked at pipes from all over the country, and it's
happening everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Among jobs his company has handled with its patented cleaning
equipment and processes were 10-year-old sprinkler pipes that were
60 percent blocked at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas,
and less-severe corrosion in one of AlliedSignal's more than 100
buildings near Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The problem affects pipes of virtually any composition and is
found with regularity in water mains across the country. But MIC is
only one of many forms of corrosion, experts stress, and it often
is seen only in small concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix and Tempe officials firmly deny there is anything
defective about the cities' water. They point out that it complies
with regulations of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, and argue
that even if it does contain pipe-corroding bacteria, there's no
way to safely and economically purify water to the degree
AlliedSignal seems to be demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say the water systems must meet standards for anything
other than the health of the people who drink it is just a creation
of someone's imagination,'' Tempe City Attorney C. Brad Woodford
said.
</P>
<P>
   AlliedSignal's lawsuits were ``the event that started shining a
light on the whole subject of MIC and sprinkler systems,'' said
professional engineer Roland Huggins, the top technical expert for
the Dallas-based American Fire Sprinkler Association.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins this month headed the first meeting of a
multidisciplinary task force looking for solutions to guide the
National Fire Protection Association in revising fire-sprinkler
standards that are followed nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco lawyer Peter Modlin, aiding in Phoenix's defense,
has argued in court that the litigation amounts to a demand by
AlliedSignal for the city ``to redesign its entire public water
disinfection program.''
</P>
<P>
   Several scientists and engineers agree that water utilities
ultimately may have to resort to costlier treatments and closer
monitoring because simply adding more chlorine creates byproducts
that cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the outcome of the lawsuits, water suppliers
everywhere could be subjected to similar litigation, the costs of
which would largely be borne by taxpayers and ratepayers, lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fire-protection pipes are especially vulnerable to rapid growth
of corrosive bacteria because water sits stagnant in them for long
periods, usually at room temperatures highly conducive to
propagation.
</P>
<P>
   The MIC phenomenon could be widespread in the Phoenix area.
Pope's firm, which conducted numerous pipe inspections and water
tests at AlliedSignal installations in Tempe and Phoenix, said
evidence of MIC also showed up among the few samples taken for
comparison at an Intel building in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suggests that corrosion problems due to deposit formation
and MIC may occur in facilities throughout the Phoenix area
regardless of municipal water supply,'' the company reported. &QL; 
Although fire-sprinkler systems use drinking water, they do not
allow it to flow back into the supply pipes. Even severe outbreaks
of bacterial growth in sprinkler pipes will not contaminate the
rest of a building's water supply.
</P>
<P>
   MIC researchers and water-supply experts emphasize that any
water system is bound to contain a variety of microbes, but there
is no evidence that corrosion-causing bacteria are a direct threat
to human health.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not that type of organisms,'' said Charlotte Smith, an
Orinda, Calif.-based consultant to municipal water systems
nationwide and the head of a committee of the American Water Works
Association.
</P>
<P>
   A possible indirect danger, however, is that the MIC colonies
might provide safe harbor for human disease agents, said Anne
Camper, a researcher at the Center for Biofilm Engineering at
Montana State University in Bozeman.
</P>
<P>
   Camper said the protective layer of slime made by biofilms could
shield other organisms because, in the words of Bill Costerton,
director of the National Science Foundation-supported center, the
membrane is ``phenomenally resistant to anti-bacterial agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ridges of corrosion also can create pockets that
chlorine has a hard time reaching, cities' regular testing of water
quality detects that problem, according to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   As MIC causes millions of dollars of damage to fire-sprinkler
systems across the country, methods of preventing or removing it
are both costly and relatively new.
</P>
<P>
   Once a colony establishes itself, treating the water won't
eliminate the bacteria, consultant Pope said. The pipes must be
cleaned, then refilled with disinfected water.
</P>
<P>
   One defense he recommends is to install an independent treatment
system to ensure that all water entering pipes is free of MIC
bacteria and as devoid as possible of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common forms of MIC turns up when a small amount
of water is run into the system during quarterly testing and the
existing water runs dark and smells like rotten eggs. That hydrogen
sulfide odor is the product of sulfate-reducing bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   System experts say that draining and refilling pipes, often
necessary each time sections are replaced, likely compounds the
problem by providing fresh nutrients, a new oxygen supply and more
bacteria to already entrenched colonies.
</P>
<P>
   The prevalence of MIC is not disputed by sprinkler contractors'
trade groups, ``but the question is: `How often does it become
severe?','' said Bsharat, the expert for the national association.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of members 18 months ago turned up about 30 cases, he
said, and only a handful of new reports have come in since.
</P>
<P>
   Bsharat and spokesmen for the insurance industry emphasized that
fire-sprinkler systems are overwhelmingly reliable and remain the
most effective means of fire protection.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins, his counterpart at the American association, agreed,
but said little data exist on how prevalent the problem might be
because the industry was so late in identifying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all `in-house' in the past,'' Huggins said. ``When a
system got pinholes, the contractor would just change out that
piece of pipe without recognizing the source of the problem. It
would just continue to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Pipe manufacturers are considering protective coatings to keep
microbes from settling in, Bsharat said, but a Teflon-lined pipe is
expensive and plastic linings are easily scratched or gouged.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the vast property-insurance industry, which has the
broadest exposure to the risk of sprinkler failure, has intensified
its own research. Also, a number of industrial or professional
groups are performing tests, sponsoring research or conducting
seminars on the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which homeowners' fire sprinklers are jeopardized
is anyone's guess, industry experts said, considering that even
large commercial installations were blind to MIC until the past few
years. &QL;

BANTAMWEIGHT CHAMPION AYALA CRUISES PAST TOUGH FOE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Paulie Ayala's first world title defense
will not be his last.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting before his hometown fans and fighting against an
opponent who refused to surrender, Ayala scored a unanimous
12-round decision against Saohin Srithai Condo to retain his World
Boxing Association bantamweight title.
</P>
<P>
   In a fight that featured no knockdowns but left Ayala with a
huge mouse under his left eye and the knuckles on his left hand
swollen, Ayala put away the game No. 1-ranked contender from
Thailand last night at Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Judges Oscar Perez of New York had Ayala the winner by 117-111
under the 10-point must system. Jack Woodruff of Dallas and James
Cole of Garland each had Ayala winning 118-110.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very tough fighter,'' said Ayala, who improved to
29-1 with 12 knockouts. ``Look at my left hand. He had a hard head,
a very durable cranium. And he was strong. He was trying to the
very end. But I've been working on my defense and was able to duck
and dodge most of his punches.''
</P>
<P>
   Condo, however, did manage to slip through to land what could
have been a telling punch in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   ``He caught me in the left eyeball with a punch, and it really
bothered me,'' Ayala said. ``Hey, he was the No. 1 contender, a
former kickboxer; that's as tough as they come, bone on bone. Now I
see why everybody was dodging him. I would, too, but it was a
mandatory fight. This fight proved a lot to me, and I'd like to
dedicate it to the people of Fort Worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala earned a career-best $120,000. Condo, who came in having
won 14 consecutive fights and 10 by knockout, earned $40,000.
Condo's record fell to 25-7 with 18 knockouts, and 0-1 in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The challenger was extremely active in the first round, showing
plenty of movement. Ayala snapped off a jab and backed Condo into a
corner. Ayala fired off a combination and as he escaped, Condo
nearly fell. The action returned to the middle of the ring when
Condo shoved Ayala to the canvas. No knockdown was called, and
Condo got a warning from referee Rafael Ramos of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Condo began to flash his right in the second, trying to dictate
the pace with his jab. Condo scored with a short right uppercut
that pushed Ayala into the ropes. His confidence boosted, Condo
continued to press forward, working almost exclusively to the head.
The area below Ayala's left eye began to swell in the last 30
seconds of the round, which closed with the fighters exchanging at
close quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Condo landed a big, roundhouse right to drive Ayala back early
in the third, and Ayala responded with a straight left. The two
countered each other most of the round, before Condo landed his
first meaningful body shot with a right to the midsection. Condo
was attempting to work the body when he walked into a short right
and overhand left combination at the bell.
</P>
<P>
   Condo stuck a slapping jab in Ayala's face at the outset of the
fourth, before a right and left combination by Ayala backed Condo
up momentarily. Working off his jab, Ayala landed a pair of lefts
to the head, and opened up a small cut in the bridge of the nose,
near the left eye.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala got the crowd excited early in the fifth with a short
right and left to the face. It hardly slowed Condo, who held his
ground and tried to work the body. Condo's crouching style made it
difficult for Ayala to go under and work the body, but Condo was
showing less movement than in earlier rounds. Ayala again excited
the crowd with a left hook at the end of the round.
</P>
<P>
   Condo began to bleed from the right cheek early in the sixth,
and Ayala finally was able to land his left under the challenger's
crouch. After Ayala connected with a straight left, Condo walked
into a short Ayala left and then absorbed a straight left. Ayala
began to sharpshoot for Condo's head, which was a ready target.
</P>
<P>
   Condo looked refreshed at the outset of the seventh, and once
again began loading up with his right. He stalked Ayala into a
corner but couldn't connect with either hand. Back in the center of
the ring, the fighters exchanged blocked punches as Ayala looked to
score off the upper. Ayala backed Condo into a corner and began to
unload, landing a left hook that rocked Condo momentarily with
about 10 seconds left in the round.
</P>
<P>
   Condo again began the round with no fear, loading up the right.
A right-left-right stunned Condo, who slowed his forward progress.
Ayala landed a another short left to keep the challenger on his
heels. Ayala landed a short right to the chin off a break and came
back with a left hook. Ayala scored with a right hook and then dug
a double left into Condo's midsection. Condo's punches were now
becoming fewer and less powerful, and by the end of the round he
was pawing at Ayala.
</P>
<P>
   The pace slowed in the ninth, with Condo still in less of an
attack mode. Ayala's jab scored and slowed Condo enough for the
champion to again dig in a couple of lefts to the body. Condo came
back with his right, and initiated an exchange. A welt appeared on
Ayala's left forehead as the round closed.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala scored with a left hook to start the 10th, and later a
short right. Condo tried to set Ayala up for his big right by
flicking his jab, but Ayala closed the gap and pushed Condo against
the ropes. Ayala backed Condo into a corner and with the crowd
howling, tried to finish him. But Condo landed a crisp right to
escape. Ayala started to bleed out of the left nostril with 20
seconds left, but Condo could do no more damage.
</P>
<P>
   The pace slowed considerably at the start of the 11th, the first
of the so-called championship rounds. Condo's punches were now more
wide and wild, and Ayala landed a combination to the head. Condo's
lunging style was now punctuated more than ever, but still awkward
enough that Ayala found it difficult to score cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   Condo again came out with plenty of steam, lunging and trying to
land to open the 12th. Ayala stayed clear with good movement, and
was content to keep clear of the right. Condo connected with a
short right but couldn't land a follow up. Ayala jabbed to keep him
at bay and with 10 seconds left began raising his arms in apparent
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the judges made it official.

ARIZONA AND THE NEW ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   playing with blocks, first-graders at a west Phoenix elementary
school are snapping shots of spheres and cubes with a digital
camera and printing them from the classroom computer.
</P>
<P>
   In south Phoenix, drivers pull out of Swift Transportation's
terminal with keyboards in the cab and global positioning systems
on the roof. They used to check in with the office from truck stop
pay phones.
</P>
<P>
   At DeVry Institute of Technology, 28-year-old Johnathan Dady
just sweated through another batch of final exams. He went back to
school for a bachelor's degree in engineering because mentoring
from his engineer dad and four years of Navy avionics training
weren't enough to snag the cutting-edge jobs he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   These are the faces of the New Economy. It's a jittery,
fast-paced world where the way we do things is changing
dramatically _ and constantly.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is the current surging through it all, but the
implications reach far beyond the halls of Intel, Microsoft and the
latest dot-com Internet wonders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a company that's still trying to run your business
the old way, you will be left behind and probably be inefficient,''
said Tom Rex, research director for Arizona State University's
Center for Business Research. ``If you're an individual, and you
think a high school diploma is enough with no special skills,
you're being left behind.'' &QL; 
GUIDE FOR ARIZONA
</P>
<P>
   To help Arizona prosper in this daunting new landscape, often
compared to the Industrial Revolution, ASU's Morrison Institute for
Public Policy today will release a New Economy guide for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   It details the potential benefits of this evolving economic
world _ higher-paying jobs, rapid growth and better productivity.
</P>
<P>
   And it spells out possible negatives: a non-stop, roller-coaster
ride for workers and businesses and, perhaps most threatening, a
bigger pay gap between skilled and unskilled workers due to the
increasing emphasis on brains vs. brawn and services and offices
over farms and factories.
</P>
<P>
   The institute delved into the topic because the round-the-clock
and round-the-world competition the wired world brings affects
students and senior citizens, laborers and lawyers, big business
and small business, and high-tech and low-tech ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so pervasive,'' said Mary Jo Waits, acting director of
the Morrison Institute. ``To still think we're just talking about a
few sectors of the economy is crazy.'' &QL; 
WHERE ARIZONA STANDS
</P>
<P>
   The report focuses on the tenets of the new economy, rooted in
technology, knowledge, people and competition, and Arizona's
standing in each.
</P>
<P>
   The state ranks pretty high in certain high-tech jobs and use of
the Internet and other technology, and is near the top in
fast-growing companies' share of the job market. But the report
suggests there is much work to be done if Arizona is going to be a
star of this new age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mixed picture,'' Waits said, adding that the state's
relatively high rankings in a couple of recent national surveys on
the New Economy are somewhat misleading. &QL; 
MAJOR WEAKNESSES
</P>
<P>
   Among the major weaknesses cited in the ASU report: Low
education levels and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's young adults, especially those who grew up here, are
less likely than their peers nationally to have either a high
school diploma or a bachelor's degree.
</P>
<P>
   The state also falls behind in investing in students from
kindergarten through college. Arizona's per pupil spending on
elementary and secondary schools was more than 20 percent below the
national average in 1995-96 and hit a 10-year low that school year.
</P>
<P>
   Spending for higher education was more than 20 percent below the
national average.
</P>
<P>
   Schools also are lagging in technology upgrades, such as
classrooms wired for the Internet and technology training and
e-mail accounts for teachers. Arizona ranked eighth among 10
Western states in this category.
</P>
<P>
   Students without proper training, and the businesses counting on
them as future workers, are doomed to fail in the New Economy,
experts say. Even factory workers need to have computer, science
and math skills today.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, the technology was not that sophisticated,''
Rex said. ``You didn't really need to learn much more than how to
do that particular job.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Humble, the first-grade teacher using cones and cylinders
and digital cameras at Richard E. Miller Elementary School, said
she's already prepping her students for careers, something that
used to begin around sixth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the technology,'' she said. ``They're exposed to
it sooner, and it's everywhere in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Humble recently asked her 27 students if they had computers at
home. Only three or four said no. Just a few years ago, barely half
would have said yes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just like overnight, it seems,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To keep up with the kids, Humble, who primarily used her home
computer for word processing, has taken technology classes offered
by the Washington Elementary School District and now teaches some
of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to keep up with the current times,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Humble's district is at the forefront of technology, thanks to a
1996 bond election that included $30.8 million to outfit schools
and teachers with state-of-the-art equipment and training.
</P>
<P>
   A narrow high-tech cluster.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Phoenix area has been billed as the ``Digital
Desert'' and the ``Silicon Desert,'' a sister to California's
successful ``Silicon Valley,'' it is no high-tech hub.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the large high-tech employers are concentrated in one
area, hardware manufacturing. Intel makes computer chips at its
Southeast Phoenix area plants, for example, while Motorola makes
cellular phones and satellite systems.
</P>
<P>
   This is the only ``knowledge-based industry'' in which Arizona
ranks above the national average in terms of the area's share of
such jobs. In contrast, Minnesota is strong in three areas:
computer/electronics, health care technology and financial
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't like we've got the research and development sites and
the brains of the high-tech companies locating in Arizona,'' Waits
said. ``We think we're doing better than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   If Arizona wants to attract a broader base of New Economy
industries, such as software and communications services or
innovation services, it's going to have to change its economic
development approach, the report suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Luring companies in the 21st century won't be just about tax
breaks, low costs and an area's place on a map.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies must locate the brains of their business in a
location that will provide them with a critical mass of
competitors, suppliers and customers, a strong talent pool, unique
institutions and desirable quality of life,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the amenities that cutting-edge companies and their
employers are looking for: top-notch university research;
telecommunications infrastructure; and community meeting places
such as coffee bars, parks and recreation rooms.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of investors.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses can't afford to sit still if they want to get ahead,
or at least keep pace, in the frenzied competition the New Economy
brings.
</P>
<P>
   Swift Transportation founder Jerry Moyes says his customers, for
example, want up-to-the-minute information on their shipments so
they can pinpoint delivery times and prepare for any delays. Swift
responded with a new Internet tracking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a progressive company growing at 20 to 25 percent a year,
we've got to keep on the edge of what's going on,'' Moyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Swift is an established, good-size company with a stellar
financial record and hasn't had any trouble raising money.
</P>
<P>
   But fledgling companies, those that need the money most to get
their ideas off the ground, struggle to find investors in the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local investment dollars to really jump-start the couple
guys in a garage, that's what's fundamentally missing,'' said Drew
Cohen, chief executive officer of NeoPlanet, a rapidly growing
Internet software firm that moved to Phoenix from New York earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, whose investors came from outside the Phoenix area, said
it goes back to the lack of a hub of emerging companies and the
suppliers and services they bring. Venture capitalists like to be
close to companies they invest in so they can keep tabs on their
investments and help entrepreneurs run their business. It's not
worth the effort to set up shop if there aren't enough promising
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cohen is optimistic about Arizona's chances in the New
Economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the opportunity for Phoenix to be one of the lead
cities is there. That's why we came,'' Cohen said. ``It's just the
execution.'' &QL;

BANTAMWEIGHT CHAMPION AYALA CRUISES PAST TOUGH FOE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Condo crumbles. Film at 11.
</P>
<P>
   In front of an adoring, rapping hometown crowd, Paulie Ayala
flexed his championship belt last night.
</P>
<P>
   As is his custom, Ayala plied patience and footwork and, in the
end, solved the lunging thrusts of Saohin Srithai Condo, the
night's international man of mystery.
</P>
<P>
   It was a unanimous decision, not only in the eyes of the judges
but in the hearts of the chanting Will Rogers Coliseum crowd.
</P>
<P>
   For the first defense of his World Boxing Association
bantamweight crown, Ayala was faced with a foe whose very name was
a riddle as recent as two days ago. Upon his arrival from Thailand,
we learned that Condo was really Anupong Srisuk, and that he was
brandishing not only a tough right hand but the name of his
sponsoring real estate company. In Thailand, we were informed, they
do this.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. How would Mike ``Mary Kay'' Tyson sound?
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday or thereabouts, Condo had never been to the
United States. His boxing career, in fact, had spanned 31
professional bouts, 30 of which had been in downtown Bangkok. The
other was fought in Cambodia _ a mere bus ride, presumably.
</P>
<P>
   Without a scouting report, Ayala fought the smart fight. He
probed, he waited, he found his chance.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a Paulie Ayala fan, you don't sit and wait for the
Sammy Sosa home-run blow. Ayala, though, seems confident enough in
his basic boxing skills that he refused to accept the invitation to
brawl that Condo extended to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Condo's style made heavy use of a reach advantage that seemed
larger than the listed inch and a half. But maybe that was because
he was usually stumbling forward, trying to rain lunging right
hands on Ayala's elusive chin.
</P>
<P>
   The chin was there. Somewhere. But Paulie seldom let Condo find
it.
</P>
<P>
   For a guy who had scored a loud upset to snatch the title four
months ago from Johnny Tapia, Ayala looked easily at ease wearing
the championship mantle. The hometown crowd couldn't have hurt, but
here was a champ who arrived with his act together.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear who was the star of this night, Fort Worth's first
boxing title bout in 10 years. On the undercard, junior
middleweight Curtis ``Bull'' Durham of Fort Worth had been a
favorite and fellow local Chris Naya had been resplendent with his
red and gold, full-tasseled sombrero. And Ruben Nevarez of Wichita
Falls had briefly stolen the show by taking the ring for his
lightweight bout while wearing Goofy on the front of his trunks.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Paulie's night. The tables in the lobby sold T-shirts
emblazoned with Ayala's picture. One spot invited people to visit
the Y2K-compliant Paulie _ his Web site at www.paulieayala.com.
</P>
<P>
   The riddle of the night, however, was Condo, or Srisuk, or
whatever the rankings wanted him called.
</P>
<P>
   From his traveling companions, we had learned that Condo had a
background in kick boxing, as many Thai boxers do. We were told
that he had a powerful right hand and would look for the knockout.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other tourist in town, he is still looking. Paulie
isn't on the Mapsco.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Condo's lunging style left him vulnerable. A
more thunderous puncher might have finished him off in the
mid-rounds.
</P>
<P>
   But Ayala's style is more patient, more tactical. When he opened
a nick above Condo's right eye, Ayala was able to peck away for the
kill.

FOX REWORK OF `LIFE' NOT ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(UNDATED) - They are the three words no one in television wants to
hear: 
``Rework the pilot.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some tinkering is to be expected with any pilot, which is, after
all, a one-time ep isode meant to sell a network (and advertis ers)
on a show. By the time the show actually winds up on the air, some
changes usually have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the character of the sister's boy friend needed to be
recast. Perhaps the pro ducers couldn't secure the rights to a
certain song and had to find another one. Or maybe the all-knowing
troll who lives in the basement and serves as a narrator was such a
bad idea that he needed to be cut from the show entirely.
</P>
<P>
   These things happen. But when a pilot that has been in the works
for a while has to be not just fine-tuned but re worked, it smells
like trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case with Time of Your Life, the Jenni fer Love
Hewitt spinoff of Party of Five that premieres Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the first episode, a question arises: If this is
the new, improved version, how bad must the original have been?
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to executive producers Chris Keyser and Amy Lippman,
the Fox Net work decided to pair Life with Ally McBeal instead of
Party of Five, as was originally planned. That's good news, but it
meant re working the show to make it a better fit for the Monday
night lineup.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to people who like to watch television, they should
have made a better show.
</P>
<P>
   Life finds Hewitt's character, Sarah, leav ing Bailey and the
rest of the Party clan be hind in California and heading to New
York City in search of her birth father (she is adopted, and her
mother died a couple of years ago).
</P>
<P>
   Apparently meant to be a sort of valen tine to both Hewitt, who
is also a producer of the show, and NYC, Life instead comes off as
overly fanciful to the point of ridicu lousness. Sure,Rudy Giuliani
has famously cleaned up Times Square and forced New Yorkers to be
more polite, but the Big Ap ple of this show makes Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood look like a housing project.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the producers have made things more realistic than
they originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original pilot is a little bit like a fable about this
city,'' Keyser said this sum mer. ``It has a little bit of a
fabulous tone to it, and we've pulled back on that slightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Extremely slightly. Having seen the first episode, all I can
figure is that the original pilot, which wasn't made available to
crit ics, must have co-starred the Muppets. (The human Muppet,
Rosie O'Donnell, has a cameo in the reworked version.)
</P>
<P>
   Or doesn't everyone who shows up at a strange building at night
in the heart of the city without her baggage (lost, naturally) end
up finding a roommate and friend be fore the sun comes up? By the
time a cou ple of days have passed, Sarah has several friends, a
job and reason to stay in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be in a strange city,'' she says near the end of the
episode, ``with no money and no plan and no one I know and say,
`Bring it on, whatever it is, I'll handle it and I'll figure it out
as I go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well, if everyone's New York experience worked out like
hers, who wouldn't want the same thing?
</P>
<P>
   Just when you think the plot can get no sappier, the situations
no more ridiculous, it happens _ they do. Do events conspire to
allow Hewitt, who has a lower-profile ca reer as a singer, to belt
out not one but two tunes? Of course they do.
</P>
<P>
   Are the songs really New York, New York and It's the End of the
World as We Know It, two songs whose telegraphed messages are so
obvious no one could miss their meaning? Of course they are.
</P>
<P>
   When she finally meets the man she believes is her father, is
the only place she can catch a quiet moment with him in the men's
room as he stands at a urinal? Of course it is.
</P>
<P>
   And so forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played her (Sarah) for a re ally, really long time and I
feel re ally close to her,'' Hewitt said. ``And it's going to be
kind of fun to see what new stuff she gets to expe rience and do,
and how she sort of grows up.''
</P>
<P>
   If Life's first episode is any indi cation, those experiences
will in volve a wicked witch and a yellow-brick road.
</P>
<P>
   Keyser and Lippman said all the right things to TV critics this
sum mer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a show in trouble does not get awarded the best time
slot on the schedule,'' Lippman said.
</P>
<P>
   True enough. Though the way Fox's new shows have performed so
far this season, ``best'' may be a relative term.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing else we can say,'' Keyser said of rumors of
prob lems with the show. ``I mean . . . in some ways this is sort
of an exam ple of, if you ask the question enough times, it becomes
true, you know what I mean? It doesn't mat ter what answer we give.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there's nothing else we can do except to say we love this,
we love the script, we love our cast, we'll show you the episode.
Watch it. If you think it's bad, you'll write that.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider it done. &QL;

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ Turner Field was sold out for a second straight playoff
game Saturday, which should end the ongoing questions about why
Atlanta fans don't show up.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're looking for a no-show count, check the Braves' bat
rack.
</P>
<P>
   The anemic offensive showing that epitomized their performance
in the National League Championship Series won't get it done
against the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves mustered just two hits in a 4-1 loss to Orlando ``El
Duque'' Hernandez and New York in Game 1 of the World Series. The
two hits were the fewest in a World Series game since the Braves
held Cleveland to one hit in Game 6 of the 1995 Series.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's run came on Chipper Jones' first home run in a month.
It seems like it has been at least that long since the Braves
showed any consistency at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   If the trend continues, the Yankees could put the Braves out of
their misery in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez tried to do it by himself Saturday, outdueling Greg
Maddux, who filled in for flu-stricken teammate Tom Glavine. Maddux
had reason to feel sick himself after his excellent performance was
wasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stuff was all right,'' Maddux said. ``But it's not about
pitching good. It's about winning. I pitched just good enough to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-time Cy Young Award winner took a shutout to the eighth
but did not retire a batter in the inning and lost when the Yankees
scored four times to make a winner of Hernandez, who ran his career
postseason record to 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Hernandez should trade ``El Duque'' for ``Senor
Octubre.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He continues to just make you shake your head,'' Yankees
manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   If Torre was shaking his head, Braves manager Bobby Cox was
ready to stick his head in a hole.
</P>
<P>
   Cox has been praised during the postseason for his knack for
pushing all the right buttons. But there isn't much a manager can
do to jump-start an offense when nobody can get on.
</P>
<P>
   Only six Braves reached base Saturday, and Jones was the only
one who advanced beyond first base until the Braves brought the
tying run to the plate against closer Mariano Rivera in the ninth.
Bret Boone's one-out single off Rivera, after a walk, was the
Braves' only other hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our club and the pitching we have, you always have a shot
to make a one-run lead hold up,'' Braves shortstop Walt Weiss said.
``But when you only have one hit going into the ninth inning,
you're very seldom going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves might as well have been playing Twister in the early
going. They could not have been more off balance than they looked
against Hernandez, who struck out eight of the first 11 batters he
faced and had 10 strikeouts in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   To a man, Braves hitters seemed to have trouble picking up the
ball out of Hernandez's high leg kick until Jones' homer in the
fourth inning ended early thoughts of a no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``With no disrespect to the great pitcher that is Greg Maddux, I
knew one run wasn't going to win this game,'' Hernandez said
through an interpreter. ``Regardless of the situation, I had the
utmost faith that our team was going to come through.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees ended Maddux's shutout bid when they loaded the
bases with no outs in the eighth _ using good hitting, a pitcher's
mistake and a defensive breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter's single tied the game and ended Maddux's night, and
Paul O'Neill's two-run single off John Rocker through a drawn-in
infield put the Yankees on top. New York got an insurance run when
pinch hitter Jim Leyritz worked Rocker for a bases-loaded walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have too many opportunities,'' O'Neill said.
``Lefthanders aren't going to make their living off Rocker. He's
too good, and he throws too hard. We got a break. I put the ball in
play, and it found a hole. Breaks are a part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the break goes their way, they turn two right there. But it
went our way and found a hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get a few guys on, something can happen, and it did
tonight. The way our pitching has been all year, if we score a
couple of runs we're going to win. You can't say enough about what
Duque did.''
</P>
<P>
   The big inning was prolonged because of two errors by first
baseman Brian Hunter, who was sent in as a defensive replacement
for Ryan Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a first baseman had made two errors in the
same inning of a World Series game since Frank Torre _ Joe's older
brother _ did it in 1958 while playing for the Milwaukee Braves
against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``No excuses,'' Hunter said. ``I just made two errors. You hate
to make errors any time, especially in a game like this. It makes
it even worse when you consider why I came into the game _ for
defense. I made myself look stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius' third straight hit opened the eighth, and Maddux
then suffered a rare lapse, walking pinch hitter Darryl Strawberry
and showing his frustration with a kick after ball four.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're in a close game and we get an opportunity, we know we
can win a game,'' said Strawberry. ``It's just about confidence.
We've got a very experienced ballclub, and we don't panic, and
that's a very big key for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch's bunt past Maddux was booted by Hunter to load
the bases. Jeter then singled between third and short, tying the
game and bringing on Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bases loaded and the 3-4-5 hitters coming up,'' Rocker
said. ``The odds weren't in my favor.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill's hit between Hunter and Boone made it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't surprise us when we got a little crack,'' Joe Torre
said. ``We've been a very patient ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Relievers Jeff Nelson and Mike Stanton each retired one Brave in
the bottom of the eighth, and Rivera got the final four outs.
Rivera survived a two-on, one-out threat in the ninth by striking
out Brian Jordan on three pitches and getting pinch hitter Greg
Myers on a weak foul pop to Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   ``This loss will be really important if we don't win tomorrow,''
Hunter said. ``We have to leave home with a split.''

HOW TO CONTROL DRUGS: JUST SAY I DON'T KNOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States Olympic Committee has a drug problem. And it's
willing to pay through the nose, in a manner of speaking, to get
rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   At its board of directors meeting in Colorado Springs, Colo.,
this weekend, USOC officials debated a proposal that would, in
effect, get the organization out of the drug-testing business and
turn enforcement over to an independent agency.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the USOC would nearly double its funding _ from $12.6
million every four years to $24 million _ on behalf of drug-testing
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing money at a festering problem is not a novel concept, of
course. Politicians try to do this all the time.
</P>
<P>
   What's hard to grasp in this case is whether the new plan is
rooted in sincere intentions, or it's the USOC's way of hoisting
the white flag.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Olympic world, you see, is convinced that we are
a nation of lawyers. In Johnnie Cochran Jr. we trust. Behind every
positive drug test by a U.S. athlete during the past 12 or so
years, the world is convinced, is an attorney with a briefcase full
of loopholes _ the sample was tampered with, the dog ate the result
sheets, etc.
</P>
<P>
   We are, after all, the land of the free. The words ``due
process,'' a sacred right in this country, don't translate well in
the power-is-power Olympic world.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, the responsibility for spot testing
Olympic athletes and enforcing those findings rests with the USOC
and the various national governing bodies.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with this picture? Connect the dots.
</P>
<P>
   If, as an example, you're the head of U.S. badminton and a
badminton player tests positive for excess testosterone, this is
not good news. The incentive for impartial enforcement could be
compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, an independent, nonprofit organization would
take over all Olympic-related anti-doping matters in the United
States. The number of unannounced drug tests _ the only ones that
really work _ would increase from less than 1,000 to 4,000 per
year.
</P>
<P>
   The new group would forward all appeals to the Court of
Arbitration in Sport, a nonpartisan global panel that has the
blessing of the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   It could work. Until somebody sues the USOC for passing the buck
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is taking place in the same week when President
Clinton's drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, is chairing hearings on
Capitol Hill about the IOC's anti-doping plans. McCaffrey wants the
IOC's hands kept away from any new policies.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose, unfortunately, that it would be too late at this
point to ask the athletes to just say no. Let me naively offer the
viewpoint that most Olympic athletes don't use
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of them always will. ``The Washington Post'' recently
ran a chilling story about Canadian runner Angella Issajenko, a
teammate of Ben Johnson at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Now 40 and
coaching, Issajenko has admitted she took steroids and human growth
hormones and was never caught.
</P>
<P>
   She told a Canadian drug inquiry that she got the drugs from a
California doctor, Robert Kerr. The doctor says he gave
performance-enhancing drugs to 20 athletes who won medals at the
1984 Los Angeles Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The most uncomfortable part of the Issajenko story is that she
doesn't think she did anything wrong. She claims that taking the
drugs ``in reasonable doses'' does not produce harmful side
effects. She sees them as an aid in training.
</P>
<P>
   Issajenko has four children, ranging in age from 6 to 13. Three
of them compete in track and are coached by Charlie Francis, the
same Charlie Francis who advised and coached Ben Johnson in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Spotlight on . . . Ice vice, arch acting and platform
sleepwalking
</P>
<P>
   It didn't make this week's episode of America's Funniest
Comebacks, but Tonya Harding returned to skating competition last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The belle of the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics finished second in
her first professional skating competition since the Nancy Kerrigan
kneecap incident that year. Before a crowd estimated at 3,000 in
Huntington, W.Va., Tonya nailed three triple jumps and dazzled the
judges with her free-skate routine.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports, Harding wore a modest black-and-white
skating outfit, quite unlike the night in Lillehammer when she came
dressed as, well, Dance Hall Gal. Tonya, 28, blew kisses to the
Huntington crowd, bowed graciously and announced that she was
thrilled to finish in second place. (France's Surya Bonaly won.)
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the popularity meter, meanwhile, was Geena
Davis, aspiring archer. The Academy Award-winning actress was
invited by Australian officials to compete as a wild-card entry in
the Sydney Golden Arrow Tournament in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Davis apparently is serious enough about archery and good enough
that her participation at the U.S. Olympic Trials did not draw any
``Garth Brooks, third baseman'' comparisons. Despite being
relatively new to the sport, Davis reached the Trials semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   She won't make the Olympics this time, but give the U.S. archery
federation credit for knowing a publicity bonanza when it arrives
at its doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   The third female in the Olympic news is Houston native Tracy
Bonner, a diver who has been reinstated by FINA, the world aquatic
federation, after testing positive for a banned substance.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner, 26, is considered an odds-on choice to make the U.S.
Olympic team for Sydney in the new medal sport of synchronized
diving. She and partner Kathy Pesek are three-time gold-medal
winners in the U.S. championships.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner's suspension was lifted after the Court of Arbitration in
Sport ruled that the banned substance was prescribed medication
that Bonner took to combat narcolepsy.
</P>
<P>
   (Fill in your own joke about divers with narcolepsy here.)
</P>
<P>
   Quick Hits Trials rescheduled The dates of the U.S. Olympic
Triathlon Trials have been changed to May 27-28 at Las Colinas in
Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Locke, the savvy executive director of USA Triathlon, made
the announcement, explaining that the original dates (May 20-21)
conflicted with the Colonial golf tournament in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Triathlon makes its Olympic debut in Sydney. The triathletes
will swim 1,500 meters, ride bicycles for 40 kilometers (24.8
miles) then run 10 kilometers (6.2 miles). Texan sailing Paul
Foerster of Garland will be sailing for a place on the Olympic team
in the 470 class when the U.S. Trials conclude today at St.
Petersburg Yacht Club in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Foerster is teamed with Bob Merrick of Portsmouth, R.I., and led
the Trials after four races. Foerster won a silver medal in the
Flying Dutchman class at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Hatchell
considered Steve Hatchell, former commissioner of the Big 12
Conference, is among those being considered for the new position of
Chief Executive Officer of the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The new title came about after the USOC underwent a detailed
review of its organizational structure. Departing executive
director Dick Schultz elected not to be a candidate for the
position.
</P>
<P>
   Hatchell reportedly has been prominently recommended to the
executive search firm of SpencerStuart. Super cycling The
Superdrome in Frisco has quickly gained a reputation as one of the
best venues in track cycling.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Trials are scheduled there April 25-29. Johnson
relaxes Baylor ex Michael Johnson says the pressure is off now that
he has added the world 400-meter record to his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can go to Sydney and just concentrate on winning,''
Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   Some interesting flotsam from ``Track and Field News'', the
sport's bible, comes in the wake of Johnson's historic run Aug. 26
in Seville, Spain:
</P>
<P>
   Johnson ran the first 200 meters of the race in 21.3 seconds, an
amazing figure considering that he knew he had 200 more meters to
run. His 200-meter world record is 19.32. Johnson joins Tommie
Smith, Poland's Irena Szewinska and East Germany's Marita Koch as
the only ones to hold the 200 and 400 world records at the same
time. FYI The people who answer the phones in the sports department
would probably like you to clip this and keep it handy:

USC WASTES ANOTHER BIG LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At least USC has made progress. The Trojans needed
just more than one quarter to blow a 21-point lead Saturday. Last
week, it took a full two.
</P>
<P>
   In this quickly disintegrating season, that's known as a baby
step ... backward.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, it would be classified as just another mind-boggling
letdown, as Stanford overcame a three-touchdown deficit to defeat
the Trojans 35-31 in front of 57,494 at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be easy blowing a big lead. But it's even harder
explaining it _ especially on back-to-back weekends. So the Trojans
turned to a higher authority to interpret the latest debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it's out of our hands,'' USC free safety David
Gibson said. ``Someone is glancing down on us. Maybe it's payback
for the '70s. Someone is mad at us upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver R. Jay Soward concurred: ``It just seemed like
some force of nature was saying we will not win no matter how many
points we are up. It's a curse.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not really a hex that is causing USC to lose games, but
something more simple.
</P>
<P>
   Like the offense. And the defense. Plus the special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and it might even be the coaching, although players would
sooner blame the heavens than find that theory plausible.
</P>
<P>
   When you are under .500, things like luck and law of averages
don't really matter. The Trojans (3-4, 1-3) are simply not a very
good team right now. Honestly, they haven't been since they got
back from Hawaii after the season-opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our fault. Nobody's fault but the players,'' offensive
lineman Travis Claridge said. ``It's a tough feeling when you leave
everything on the field and it just wasn't good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost good enough, but not quite. That was the same feeling
last week against Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, USC contributed heavily to its demise. It had some
pretty stats, like quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst's school-record
415-yards passing and tailback Chad Morton's 151 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   But underneath the surface, even those numbers were tainted.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst threw three interceptions and had one returned 30
yards for a touchdown. He also fumbled in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Morton had the costliest turnover of the game. With USC leading
21-7 and facing a second-and-goal at the 10-yard line, he fumbled.
Stanford's Travis Pfeifer recovered at the 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't throw an interception for a touchdown, or fumble on
the 5-yard line,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``Right now, we
can't find the formula to pull us out of the funk we're in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting tired of these. There's not much to say.''
</P>
<P>
   This loss was a little different than the one at Notre Dame.
USC's defense wilted in South Bend because it was forced to be on
the field far too long.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense had no such excuse against the Cardinal. It
singlehandedly wasted the offense's 24 first-half points in about
2{ minutes.
</P>
<P>
   USC took a 24-7 lead with 1:39 remaining in the first half, but
the Cardinal needed just six plays to go 80 yards before
quarterback Todd Husak found DeRonnie Pitts on a 23-yard touchdown
pass to cut the lead to 24-14.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal (5-2, 5-0) required the first 72 seconds of the
second half to go another 80 yards, with Husak's 16-yard touchdown
pass to Dave Davis cutting the lead to 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   It was about this time that everyone started seeing visions of
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like that creeps into your mind,'' Gibson admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, a clear favorite to make its first New Year's Day trip
to Pasadena since 1971, scored another touchdown and led 28-24.
</P>
<P>
   That's a 21-0 blitz, in case you had forgotten. The Trojans
briefly went ahead on Soward's 64-yard TD reception, but Stanford
came back to take a 35-31 lead when Husak scored on a 1-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the play that typifies a bad team.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst found Soward wide-open for what would have been a
70-yard touchdown pass, but the ball bounced in and out and around
Soward's hands before he finally dropped it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the type of season it is. I catch the ball, we win,''
Soward said. ``I take the loss. As a senior, I've got to take the
blame. I think I was too overzealous on the play.''
</P>
<P>
   USC made a vain effort to score at the end, but Van Raaphorst's
fourth-down pass was intercepted by Tim Smith at the 7-yard line as
time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're at a point where we don't know what's
wrong,'' said linebacker Zeke Moreno. ``I could never imagine this,
or thinking about this at the beginning of the season. I don't know
what we can do. Everything we've thought of we've tried.''

BUMBLING BRUINS ROUTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. _ This summer, Oregon State replaced its aging
artificial turf with a new, $1.5 million carpet called AstroTurf
12/2000. It's bright green, it's thick and spongy, and it sits on
an inch of foam rubber.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, UCLA had a soft surface on which to bottom out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing,'' Bruins receiver Freddie Mitchell said
after a 55-7 loss to Oregon State on Saturday in front of 33,427 at
Reser Stadium. ``I don't want to fly back to L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   It was more than embarrassing. It was the Bruins' worst defeat
in 69 years _ since a 52-0 loss to USC in 1930 _ and the most
points they've allowed since a 61-20 loss to Washington in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little lost for words,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most troubling for Toledo was the opponent. This wasn't
USC or Washington or even Michigan or Nebraska. This was Oregon
State _ !ital!last-place Oregon State.!off!
</P>
<P>
   On the surreal scale, this loss rivals UCLA's 66-3 victory over
Texas two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get beat like that, it makes you think we're sorry,''
Bruins tailback Keith Brown said. ``Oregon State wasn't supposed to
be a great team, but they were against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry? Perhaps. Desperate? Definitely. The Bruins (3-5, 1-4)
have lost four of their last five and must defeat Arizona,
Washington and USC to become bowl-eligible. To put that task in
perspective, consider that Washington defeated Oregon State 47-21
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season isn't over yet,'' Brown continued. ``The only time
it's over is when we can't go to a bowl game. As long as we still
have that, we still have a chance. If we lose again, it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's offense was as inept against Oregon State as it was last
week in a 17-0 loss to Cal. The Bruins could not run, could not
block and could not throw. They gained 10 yards in the first
quarter and 210 for the game. They averaged 2.5 yards per rush and
allowed seven sacks. Of their 15 possessions, seven gained zero or
negative yards; only two gained more than 30.
</P>
<P>
   But it's one thing to struggle against Cal, which has the
Pac-10's best defense. It's quite another to sputter against Oregon
State, which had allowed 30 points and 386 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's happened in the last two games,''
offensive coordinator Al Borges said. ``Our production is almost
zero. This is terrible. I have no explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   And after three credible performances, UCLA's defense regressed
to 1998 form. Oregon State's spread offense generated 559 total
yards and broke the game open with three touchdowns in 2:28 late in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Most if the damage came on third down, when the Beavers
exploited UCLA's porous secondary and converted 8-of-9 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mental errors killed us,'' UCLA safety Julius Williams said.
``They destroyed everything we tried to do. People were in thw
wrong places all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers led 7-0 late in the first quarter when they began to
take control. On third-and-8, quarterback Jonathan Smith hit
receiver Imani Percoats for 28 yards across the middle. Three plays
later, Smith found Roddy Tompkins for 23 yards, a touchdown and a
14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to take our shots downfield and spread them out to
get one-on-one matchups,'' Smith said. ``We had some success.''
</P>
<P>
   The first quarter ended with UCLA quarterback Cory Paus on the
bench with an injured left shoulder. Reserve Scott McEwan entered
the game and promptly threw an interception near midfield. The
Beavers needed nine plays to cover 39 yards and take a 21-0 lead.
The drive included _ what else? _ a 24-yard pass on third-and-12.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum appeared to shift with six minutes left in the
half, when Paus returned and directed an 80-yard touchdown drive _
UCLA's first in six quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that jump-started us,'' Toledo said. ``Then we
caved.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State regained control when reserve tailback Antonio
Battle charged around left end and raced 50 yards in nine seconds
for an uncontested touchdown. (Are there any other kind against
UCLA?)
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers followed with a seven-second touchdown. On first
down, Smith found Tompkins, who beat Ryan Roques and Lovell
Houston, for a 47-yard touchdown pass. Oregon State 35, UCLA 7.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence repeated. The Bruins gained four yards on their
ensuing possession, Nate Fikse punted, and OSU scored. It took
longer than seven seconds, but the result was just as humiliating
for UCLA: Smith hit Percoats from 10 yards out. Oregon State 42,
UCLA 7.

EXPERTS WORK TO OUTSMART WILY MICROBES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JON KAMMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Corrosion-causing bacteria, mostly unnamed but grouped generally
by what they eat and secrete, are extraordinarily wily creatures,
scientists have learned in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria are members of a category known as biofilms,
prolific microbes that attach tightly to a surface and fashion a
slimy film overhead that scientists say is unbelievably effective
in keeping disinfectants out.
</P>
<P>
   Given good growing conditions in pipes of virtually any
material, the microbes construct colonies that display ``almost
baroque levels of structural complexity,'' according to Bill
Costerton, director of the Center for Biofilm Engineering at
Montana State University.
</P>
<P>
   By releasing subtle chemical signals, the bacteria trigger
wholesale changes in their own cellular structures, depending on
the duties they perform in building and maintaining colonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a lot smarter than we used to think,'' said Anne
Camper, who researches biofilms in drinking water for the National
Science Foundation-supported center in Bozeman.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria erect pedestal-like nodes that grow into ridges of
hard deposits called tubercles. Meanwhile, the pipe wall becomes
increasingly pitted and, eventually, pinhole leaks develop.
</P>
<P>
   A single community, sometimes containing several kinds of
bacteria working in harmony, can cover entire 10-foot lengths of
pipe, said Daniel Pope, whose consulting company's offices in Texas
and Colorado have worked widely with industry on the problem he
dubbed MIC, for microbiologically influenced corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still have a tough time making the connection between
corrosion and microbes,'' said molecular environmental biologist
Peggy Arps; but now, she is seeing ``at least 20 different types of
organisms'' that cause damage to one or another pipe material.
</P>
<P>
   Although corrosive bacteria have been studied for a century, it
has been little more than a decade since DNA testing started
shedding major light on them, said Arps, a research associate
professor in the Mackay School of Mines at the University of Nevada
at Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Corrosion is an electrochemical process that can be likened to
the operation of a battery, said Peter Fox, associate professor of
engineering at Arizona State University in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny current is produced between the pipe wall where there is
no oxygen and areas where oxygen exists, and the flow of electrons
strips away pipe material atom by atom, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be microorganisms in water,'' Camper and
numerous others emphasized, so instead of eradicating MIC, ``the
best hope is to try and control it.'' &QL;

COMPANY SUING CITIES OVER WATER QUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JON KAMMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AlliedSignal Inc. sued Tempe more than four years ago in U.S.
District Court in Phoenix and followed up the next year with a suit
against Phoenix. Both cases are far from trial.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits do not specify damage amounts, but in claims filed
before going to court, the aerospace company demanded $4.5 million
from Tempe and $20.75 million from Phoenix to pay for replacement
of fire-sprinkler systems in all its facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix case was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Paul G.
Rosenblatt in 1997 on the ground that municipalities are immune
from suits of this nature. The Tempe case, before District Judge
Roslyn O. Silver, was put on hold while the decision was appealed.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a sharply divided three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Francisco revived the Phoenix case, saying
dismissal was premature.
</P>
<P>
   Appellate Judge Warren J. Ferguson's scathing dissent said, ``In
this case, there is not even a hint anyplace that treating water
for human consumption creates an action for damages when the water
which is beneficial to humans is destroying the pipes that carry
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the complaint ``simply silly'' and ``frivolous
litigation,'' he wrote, ``It is this kind of case which fosters the
clamor for tort reform.''
</P>
<P>
   All three judges agreed that Rosenblatt was right in refusing to
order the city to treat water so bacteria wouldn't corrode pipes.
</P>
<P>
   AlliedSignal contends that its corrosion problems stem from the
cities' inadequate disinfection of water supplies. It says the
cities also were negligent for never warning that some types of
bacteria could survive treatment and play havoc with pipes.
</P>
<P>
   The cities' attorneys attack the company's assertion that the
bacteria came from water, rather than any other source, such as
dirt or air entering the pipes during manufacture or installation.
</P>
<P>
   AlliedSignal outside counsel David B. Rosenbaum asserted in
court that a review of Tempe water test records revealed that ``on
numerous occasions, they were supplying water to AlliedSignal's
facilities in Tempe with inadequate chlorine (and) with excessively
high bacteria levels, under their own standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents are not yet on file in court, and AlliedSignal
would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe City Attorney C. Brad Woodford discounted Rosenbaum's
comment as ``just an allegation.'' He and Philip M. Haggerty, chief
assistant city attorney for Phoenix, both emphasized that the
lawsuits say nothing about the purity of the cities' water for
human consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum, of the firm Osborn Maledon in Phoenix, countered that
``at the very same chlorination standards that the city is talking
about, . . . for all the balancing they do, if they do it right,
bacteria will not cause health problems . . . and it won't cause
corrosion to pipes.''
</P>
<P>
   No settlement discussions have been held, the cities' attorneys
said, but AlliedSignal, in the only comment it would make beyond
court filings, signaled a willingness to settle. &QL;

ANOTHER BIZARRE NIGHT FOR TYSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ A disgusted woman who had paid God-knows how much to
see the fight summed it perfectly:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that was a &AMP;%$ waste of time. And, of course, Mike Tyson
made it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   This one, between Tyson and Orlin Norris, wasn't on par with the
ear-biting incident that ended the second fight with Evander
Holyfield. What could be? However, it had that remarkably bizarre
quality we've come to associate with Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   The fight had gone only one round when Tyson landed a left hook
a split second after the bell, Norris fell awkwardly on his back,
wrenched his right knee and couldn't continue.
</P>
<P>
   The fight was ruled a no contest because of what officials
called an ``accidental foul.''
</P>
<P>
   That was that. Mike Tyson's latest comeback fight fizzled almost
before it started before a crowd of 12,081 at the MGM Grand on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The moment Jimmy Lennon Jr. announced the result, a tremendous
chorus of boos reverberated in the spacious indoor arena followed
by angry chants and nasty comments that shouldn't be printed here.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, convinced Norris could continue because he had walked to
his corner apparently with no problem, was himself disgusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have more to (complain) about than I do,'' he said
in a calm moment. ``The reality of the situation is that he
could've got up and continued to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put the heat on him and he didn't want to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The first ... er, only round was largely uneventful.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson (46-3, with 40 knockouts) did some of the things his
trainers had hoped he'd do after a nine-month layoff, fight
relatively patiently, move his head, jab.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he also threw the big bombs we've also come to
associate with Tyson. None landed with any meaning, although it
seemed only a matter of time before one did.
</P>
<P>
   Norris (50-5, 27 KOs) also did what he set out to do: punch on
the move, don't stand in one place too long as Francois Botha did
when Tyson knocked him out in his last fight, in January.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if it might be an interesting fight ... and then it
was over.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Richard Steele, himself no stranger to controversy, had
warned Tyson early in the round about hitting on the break. And
then Tyson did it just as the first three minutes expired, knocking
Norris flat.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it appeared Norris was hurt by the punch but he
quickly got to his feet and went to his corner, where he sat down
on his stool.
</P>
<P>
   Steele then took !ital!two!off! points away from Tyson for the
foul, and it appeared the fight would continue.
</P>
<P>
   However, Norris' knee apparently wouldn't allow it and the fight
was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, perhaps not aware of exactly what transpired, reacted
angrily and was surrounded by his handlers, who calmed him down as
security guards _ ready for anything at a Tyson fight _ quickly
surrounded the ring to keep order.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Goossen, Tyson's promoter, said he was uncertain what would
become of the fighters' purses, $10 million for Tyson, $800,000 for
Norris. The Nevada State Athletic Commission will decide that.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, convinced the world is against him, suspects he'll lose
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired, man. I'm just tired of all the (garbage),'' he
said. ``I don't even know if I want to fight any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary bouts, heavyweight contender David Tua showed
former Canadian champion Shane Sutcliffe why he's considered one of
the most dangerous fighters in the world, ending their scheduled
10-round bout with one left hook at 1:20 of the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Sutcliffe (21-9-1, 12 KOs), who landed awkwardly on his hands
and knees, made it to his feet but referee Jay Nady spared him
further punishment by stopping the mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have respect for the guy (Sutcliffe), but I had no respect
for his power,'' said Tua, a native of Samoa who fights out of New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The referee did a good job stopping the fight. He was
disappointed, but the referee ... didn't want to see him get
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Tua (35-1, 20 KOs) is seeking an opportunity to fight the winner
of the Nov.13 Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis fight but might not be
high on either's list of prospective opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Featherweight contender Augie Sanchez (23-1, 20 KOs) put down
Daniel Jimenez (27-8-1, 14 KOs) twice with body punches and Jiminez
stayed down the second time.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled 10-round bout was stopped at 1:41 of the sixth
round.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan Dokiwari (15-1, 13 KOs) outpointed Agustin Corpus (7-4-2,
seven KOs) in a six-round heavyweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   And undefeated junior welterweight contender Zab Judah had an
usual evening: He fought two three-round exhibitions against
separate fighters.
</P>
<P>
   He dominated both Joaquin Gallardo, whom he dropped, and Manuel
Gomez. &QL;

ATLANTA _ Sometimes you get the flu, and sometimes you just feel
sick.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the New York Yankees' swarming 4-1 win over the
Atlanta Braves to open the World Series on Saturday night, the
question is: Who's feeling worse today?
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine? Or his Braves teammates?
</P>
<P>
   If the Braves were going to win this opener at Turner Field and
blast from the gate with a statement against their nemesis Yankees
counterparts, they needed to take advantage of what was staring
them in the face.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chance. It was a real chance to show the powerful
Yankees just how much of a heart is beating under their jerseys, a
chance to pull out a game in the nerve-rattling late innings.
</P>
<P>
   Championship teams can do those things. They can watch Greg
Maddux step in masterfully for the flu-ridden scheduled starter,
Glavine, and somehow give him just enough support to carry it to
the finish.
</P>
<P>
   Championship teams can see Chipper Jones break out of his 1999
postseason doldrums, slamming a 403-foot home run just inside the
right-field foul pole, and back it up with solid late-inning
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Championship teams can go into the eighth with Maddux still
looking great, ace reliever John Rocker warming in the pen and the
crowd tomahawk-chopping in hopes of squeezing out the big win
against the Yanks, and somehow do just that.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves didn't. They couldn't take advantage of Maddux's
pitching or Chipper's clutch hit.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees starter Orlando Hernandez was pitching beautifully
through the night, but the Braves held the lead. As overwhelming as
he was, Hernandez had to be pulled for a pinch hitter in the eighth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   But just when it seemed the Braves would manage to steal one and
send the Yanks off into the night in frustration, the Braves saw it
vanish in the most unlikely of ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never really hit the ball hard,'' Braves manager Bobby
Cox lamented about the fateful eighth-inning collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, the normally reliable one who throws a mean fastball and
fidgets and squirms like a bad kid in church, spit the bit. The
defense collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of World Series opener the Braves did not need.
If there was a statement made on this night it was only by the
Yankees, who have won nine consecutive World Series games,
including five straight over the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees clearly know how to win these kinds of games no
matter the stakes; the Braves _ perhaps dominant in a league of
their own, the National _ haven't solved the New Yorkers on the
biggest baseball stage of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of game isn't unusual for us,'' said Yankees
outfielder Paul O'Neill, who hit the game-breaking two-run single
off Rocker in the eighth inning. ``We're used to close games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go through enough of them and win enough of them, you
have the confidence that you're going to win them all. If someone
gives us a couple of outs or a couple of runs, we're going to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks did indeed win because the normally steady Braves
flinched. Brian Hunter, a defensive replacement at first base,
committed a pair of errors in the eighth inning; Maddux gave up a
single to begin the rally and then lost what had been masterful
control.
</P>
<P>
   He walked pinch hitter Darryl Strawberry after Scott Brosius'
leadoff single. He left a pitch over the plate against Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the inning, the Braves misplayed a bunt by Chuck
Knoblauch and saw Hunter commit another error with a bad throw.
Rocker came on for Maddux and struggled through 30 pitches, giving
up the decisive two-run single and then adding to the Yanks' total
with a bases-loaded walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get the kind of play we needed,'' Cox said. ``Not
even close.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a meltdown in a game the Braves needed. Now, the Yankees
have gained the home-field advantage and have Andy Pettitte, David
Cone and five-time Cy Young winner Roger Clemens for the next three
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have one hit going into the ninth inning, you're not
going to win many ballgames,'' Braves shortstop Walt Weiss said.
``That's not how we wanted to start off.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering what lies ahead, it was the worst way for the Braves
to start. It could have been a night when the Braves stood tall and
showed the kind of grit and late-inning savvy that can make for a
World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Yankees made the early statement: They are the
champions, and this is why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we got a little crack,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said,
``it didn't surprise me that we opened it up. We made the most of
an opportunity. That's the way this team is.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how champions do it.

YANKEES COME BACK AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA---For seven innings Saturday night in the opener of the
final World Series of the 20th century, the Atlanta Braves seemed
as though they would be immune to the loss of their original
starting pitcher, Tom Glavine, sidelined by influenza.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, considering the flawless manner in which his
replacement, Greg Maddux, was working against the New York Yankees,
it seemed as though the Braves were fortunate Glavine had suffered
such an affliction.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Maddux was in his magical Cy Young Award form,
stifling the Yankees on a mere three hits with his dazzling array
of pitches that had New York's batsmen thoroughly bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Braves had only a 1-0 edge, but it seemed as though
the only hit they would manage against an equally stubborn Orlando
(El Duque) Hernandez---a fourth inning home run by Chipper
Jones---would be enough on a chilly evening when the temperatures
were dipping into the low 40s and Maddux was dispensing another one
of his masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   But these Yankees aren't to be confused with the New York Mets,
or any of those other ball clubs who have been foils for the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   And in the eighth inning, the Yankees would demonstrate
graphically why they've become the most feared team in baseball in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Before you could say Scott Brosius, Darryl Strawberry, Chuck
Knoblauch, Derek Jeter, Paul O'Neill, Jim Leyritz and Brian Hunter,
the Yankees stunned Maddux with a four run eruption that turned out
to be enough for a 4-1 win that also stunned 51,342 Turner Field
partisans.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter?
</P>
<P>
   He plays for the Braves---he was inserted as a defensive
replacement at first base for Ryan Klesko in the eighth---but the
1985 graduate of Paramount High School contributed mightily to the
Yankees' cause with two errors that led to two unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Greg Maddux was as good as he's ever been,'' the
Braves' manager, Bobby Cox, would say afterward. ``The Yankees
really never hit him hard, and almost all their base hits just
found holes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just played `little ball,' and it was enough,'' said the
Yankees' manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius, the Yankees' overlooked third baseman, led off that
eighth with his third straight hit off Maddux. Then Strawberry,
pinch-hitting for Hernandez, walked. Then Hunter butchered
Knoblauch's bunt. Then Jeter singled in the Yankees first run. Then
Maddux exited and O'Neill singled in the next two Yankee runs off
the dreaded John Rocker on a play in which he advanced to second on
Hunter's second miscue.
</P>
<P>
   And then Leyritz, batting for Ricky Ledee, walked to produce
another score that would be more than his team would require.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, the Yankees, as they did against the Texas
Rangers and Boston Red Sox in the recent playoffs, had emerged
victorious on tight pitching---Hernandez would give up only that
homer to Jones and strike out 10 in seven innings---tight defense
and a few well-placed hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an unusual game for us,'' said O'Neill. ``It
seems like we've been in so many of these type of low-scoring games
this season, and we just expect to win them. We've become pretty
used to them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Torre always is preaching to us when the door opens, we
have to take advantage of it---and that's what we did again
tonight,'' said Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   As good as Greg Maddux was---and he was so good that Cox
admitted he didn't even consider replacing him when he faced Jeter
in that eighth inning with no outs and the bases loaded---Hernandez
turned out to be even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy just continues to make you shake your head,'' said
Torre. ``He was sharp right from the get-go tonight. And yet in the
dugout he kept shaking his head after he gave up that home run to
Jones and said, `Mistake! Mistake! Mistake.' The guy makes one bad
pitch all night, and is down on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt all my pitches were working well, but what worked best
was my control,'' said Hernandez through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy gives you only one hit, you know he's pretty
overpowering,'' said the Braves' second baseman Bret Boone, who
fanned twice against Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's pitches were incredible and just so difficult to
hit,'' said the Braves catcher, Eddie Perez, who also went down
swinging twice against Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Maddux delivered the game's first pitch at 8:11
(EST) with the thermometer reading 49 degrees and the wind chill
factor at 34, hundreds of the literati gathered on the field doing
what they always do before World Series proceedings, exchanging
gossip with one another, complaining about the stadium food, giving
their predictions, and offering psychobabble insights on a variety
of subjects ranging from Glavine's sickness to Chuck Knoblauch's
mysterious throwing problems.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has a theory on Knoblauch's weird curse that has
resulted in his committing 26 errors this season, an outrageously
high total for a second baseman who once was a Golden Glove winner
as a member of the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   But the person who possesses the keenest understanding of
Knoblauch's defensive travails is Steve Sax, now a TV analyst for
Fox who experienced similar miseries in the early 1980s when he was
a second baseman for the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The throwing thing is all in Knoblauch's head,'' says Sax.
``Believe me, I know because it happened to me. You just get messed
up, and every time you throw the ball you start thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only way to get over it. And that's to keep practicing
throwing the ball to first base. I did that hour after hour, and
after a while the problem went away and I couldn't wait to throw
the ball to first.''
</P>
<P>
   Blessedly for ol' Chuck, El Duque Hernandez saw to it the Braves
didn't direct any balls in his direction, and Knoblauch didn't even
have a fielding opportunity until the ninth inning when Mariano
Rivera induced Gerald Williams to hit a routine grounder to
Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   This time Knoblauch threw flawlessly to first base.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees did everything flawlessly Saturday night, except for
that one pitching indiscretion that Hernandez committed against
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Maddux pitched just as good as Hernandez,'' groused
Bobby Cox, who didn't hide his displeasure during the game with the
work of the home plate umpire, Randy Marsh. ``We just didn't get
any breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   No one seems to get any breaks these days against these
remarkable Yankees.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LAS VEGAS _ Throw two-time ex-world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson
into the boxing ring, and controversy is certain to follow.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturday night, in his first fight since being released from a
Maryland prison last spring, Tyson uncorked a punch to the head of
challenger Orlin Norris after the bell ending the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate result was an official no-contest that disappointed
the crowd of 12,081 at the MGM Grand Hotel-Casino's Grand Garden
Arena and left Tyson's future in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   But during the postfight news conference, Tyson (46-3) said he
is thinking about retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of all this ,'' Tyson said. ``I really am. I really
don't know if I want to fight anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of all this political . I'm tired, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris, sent tumbling by the punch that landed almost a full
three seconds after the bell, suffered an apparent injury to his
right knee that left the Lubbock native unable to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Seated on a stool in his corner, Norris was examined by ringside
physician Dr. Flip Homansky, who informed referee Richard Steele
that Norris could not continue the bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of an accidental foul after the bell rang,'' ring
announcer Jimmy Lennon Jr. said to the audience afterward, ``the
fight has officially been ruled a no-contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris (50-5) was taken to Valley Hospital for an MRI about 30
minutes after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the arena, he said, ``(Tyson) hit me after the
bell. I just went down wrong on my right knee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he conducted himself,'' said Tyson, ``he should be
ashamed of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't hurt enough that he couldn't keep on fighting. He
could walk back to his corner _ that's how hurt he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele, since working the world title fight between Julio Cesar
Chavez and Meldrick Taylor in 1989, has himself been the center of
some degree of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   He will probably be criticized again after assessing a two-point
penalty to Tyson for the late blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't say if it (the late punch) was deliberate,'' said
Steele. ``I don't know if he could hear the bell or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was supposed to have received $10 million. Dr. James Nave,
executive director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission, said
Tyson's purse will be withheld, pending a full investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Norris was supposed to get $800,000, but he was paid only a
little more than $200,000 because of his manager's share, an IRS
lien and a court order involving a lawsuit against him.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his troubled past and skills that had obviously been
on the wane since he was imprisoned for rape in 1992, Tyson entered
Saturday's 10-round main event needing to record an impressive
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Anything short of that, it was thought, might be the end of his
efforts to again become a world heavyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   How Saturday's result will affect his future is uncertain. There
is no question, however, the outcome meshes perfectly with a
star-crossed path that has been the life of the Catskill, N.Y.,
native.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the last three sordid incidents in boxing with which
Tyson has been involved have occurred at the MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997 at the Grand Garden Arena, Tyson lost by
disqualification to Evander Holyfield when he bit each ear of the
World Boxing Association/International Boxing Federation
heavyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada State Athletic Commission later suspended his boxing
license for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   In the first fight after having the license reinstated, Tyson
took on former IBF champion Frans Botha at the Grand Garden Arena
last January.
</P>
<P>
   Though he won by fifth-round knockout, Tyson wasn't above
controversy. He twisted the arm of Botha during a clinch and, after
the bout, said his action was intended to break the South African's
arm.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, before throwing the ill-fated punch, Tyson looked far
sharper than when he landed a lucky right hand to knock out Botha.
</P>
<P>
   He had Norris backpedaling from the power in his left hook and
straight right hand.
</P>
<P>
   But it was of little consequence because of another
controversial incident.

CHASE LEADS TO MOTHER, CHILD REUNION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Staff Writers Charles F. Bostwick and Ian Hanigan contributed to
this story 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMDALE _ A televised high-desert police pursuit Friday led to
a dramatic series of events Saturday when a 2-year-old boy caught
up in the chase was recognized as a child missing for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Perez, who was found in a sport-utility vehicle abandoned
by his father, the suspect in the chase, was to be reunited with
his mother Saturday at the Los Angeles County sheriff's station in
Palmdale, sheriff's officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bianca Perez, 33, of Las Vegas had not seen her son since he was
allegedly taken by his father during a supervised custody visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in total shock,'' said Perez, a nightclub hostess who
caught the first glimpse of her son on a television news video at
the sheriff's station. ``I can't believe he's so big. He looks like
a 4-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   But after waiting six hours with Jacob's aunt, uncle,
grandmother and 12-year-old sister, Perez was told the meeting
couldn't take place until the boy's identity could be verified at a
procedure that could not take place until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand how they think they're doing better for the
child, but the baby should be with us, rather than passed from home
to home,'' said Perez, who brought with her custody papers and
other documents. In addition, a Nevada Attorney General official
told Los Angeles County officials she has custody. ``We're the best
interest of the child,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The saga began Friday when sheriff's investigators received a
tip that a possible suspect in an armored car guard shooting in
Long Beach was going to be at a car dealership in Palmdale, 55
miles north of Los Angeles. Deputies saw the suspect, Desmond
Michael Mooreland, 33, of Quartz Hill, at the dealership, where he
was picking up a new window for his Chevy Suburban, sheriff's Sgt.
Mike Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   With authorities in pursuit, Mooreland sped off in the Suburban
with Jacob. Mooreland later abandoned the vehicle in the parking
lot of the Antelope Valley Mall, where he was eventually arrested.
Authorities plucked Jacob from the Suburban and placed him into
protective custody.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a relative of Mooreland's saw the pursuit on
television and contacted the suspect's maternal grandmother, who in
turn alerted the boy's uncle, Juan Caraveo of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who had been in Hawaii visiting her mother, didn't learn
of the news until she got off the plane Saturday morning and was
greeted by Caraveo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drove to my house and picked up my daughter and came right
down here,'' Perez said after arriving at the station. ``That's her
Tigger,'' she said, referring to her daughter's nickname for Jacob.
``We were just Winnie-the-Pooh fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez said Jacob _ the subject of a bitter custody battle _
disappeared one year and four months ago during a supervised visit
in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   During the past year, Perez and other family members have
struggled to find the toddler, offering monetary rewards and
working with five missing children agencies.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two weeks ago, the faces of the boy and his
father were emblazoned on mailers distributed in Nevada and
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no clues until Friday's high-speed chase.
Authorities said the boy and his father had been living with
Mooreland's uncle in a mobile home park in Quartz Hill for the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   Residents from all over the Southland ``who recognize the kid
have been calling us and a national missing children's hotline,''
Sgt. Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Mooreland was booked on suspicion of felony evasion and child
endangerment and was being held at the Long Beach jail.
</P>
<P>
   Mooreland and another of three men believed to be responsible
for shooting and critically wounding the armored truck guard during
a robbery in downtown Long Beach were in custody Saturday, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach police spokeswoman Nancy Tabing said authorities
found the 2-year-old boy, whom Mooreland later told police was his
son, inside the abandoned Suburban. She also said a ``significant
amount of cash believed to be part of the loss from the robbery''
was found on Mooreland at the time of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the money from the robbery was used to purchase the
vehicle,'' Tabing said.
</P>
<P>
   Mooreland is being held at the Long Beach Jail on suspicion of
premeditated attempted murder, robbery, child endangerment and
felony evading. In addition, he had been sought on a warrant out of
Las Vegas for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. He is expected
to be arraigned in Long Beach Municipal Court on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach Police Sgt. Steve Filippini said suspect Keenan
Haywood, 26, was arrested in Carson early Wednesday morning, one
day after the shooting that left 24-year-old armored truck guard
Dwight Medrano near death.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are searching for a third suspect, described by
witnesses as a Latino male in his 20s, in connection with the
shooting and robbery Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have yet to determine which of the three robbery
suspects pulled the trigger.

FINAL CHAPTER FOR TYSON?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ No one was raped. No ears were chewed off. No
innocent motorists were roughed up. As atrocities go, Mike Tyson
certainly has perpetrated worse.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
But one still got the feeling, Saturday night in Las Vegas, that
Tyson's bizarre boxing career finally took a blow from which it
will never recover.
</P>
<P>
   Or so we can hope.
</P>
<P>
   A once-great athlete who needed to show enough skill and wit to
prove he is worthy of our attention instead melted down in the ring
for the umpteenth time.
</P>
<P>
   A onetime superstar who needed to prove he remains boxer enough
to warrant a payday instead showed he can't follow the simplest
rules of the fight game.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson sucker-punched Orlin Norris a full second after the bell
to end Round 1 of their heavyweight fight at the MGM Grand Arena,
and it resulted in a ``no-contest'' ruling that perhaps was the
most infuriating episode yet in Tyson's singularly infuriating
career.
</P>
<P>
   Norris was dazed by Tyson's clearly late punch, went down in a
heap, and said he injured his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, television replays appeared to show Norris' knee
wrenching weirdly as it hit the canvas, and perhaps Tyson's shoe as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Norris' corner said he could not go on. The ringside doctor
agreed. After the obligatory Tyson post-fight chaos, which included
half the Las Vegas Police Department climbing in the ring, the
``no-contest'' came down.
</P>
<P>
   Fans were ticked. You could almost smell the slow burn of 12,081
suckers vowing never, ever to be suckered again by the prospect of
a Mike Tyson ``fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness, this one wasn't pay-per-view, but at least a few
of the 12,081 in the arena paid real money to watch this farce.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Tyson blamed someone else. Norris, in this case,
whom Tyson accused of seizing a chance to escape the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put the heat on him, and he didn't want to continue,'' Tyson
said. ``The way he conducted himself, he should be disgraced with
himself. A real fighter fights till he can't fight no more.''
</P>
<P>
   A real fighter knows you don't throw a jab after the bell.
Particularly when the referee is between you and your opponent
trying to break you up.
</P>
<P>
   The simple fact is, had Tyson not reached over referee Richard
Steele and slugged Norris after the bell, the fight would have gone
on.
</P>
<P>
   Norris, a blown-up cruiserweight, was carefully selected by the
Tyson camp because he represented an early-round knockout for an
extremely rusty fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tyson screwed it up. He couldn't even control himself long
enough to knock out the tomato can propped up for him.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson expressed frustration afterward, saying repeatedly how
``tired'' he is with boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to go home,'' Tyson said. ``I'm tired of everyone
and everything. I'm tired. I don't even know if I want to fight
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold that thought, Iron Mike.
</P>
<P>
   We're quite certain we never want to see you fight again.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson already was verging on irrelevant. Because of his various
high crimes and misdemeanors, he was fighting for only the eighth
time in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   A man who once electrified the boxing world already was close to
putting it to sleep. Light ticket demand, no cable deal, limited
media interest.
</P>
<P>
   And that was before Saturday's ridiculous episode.
</P>
<P>
   So did Tyson's fourth comeback end ingloriously, in controversy
and frustration, with fans shouting insults at the former
heavyweight champion of the world.
</P>
<P>
   If we're lucky, we'll never have a chance to do it again.

TYSON LATE PUNCH RESULTS IN NO-DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ No mas. Please.
</P>
<P>
   Enough with Mike Tyson. Enough with bizarre behavior and
pathetic excuses. Enough with bitten ears and nearly broken arms
and blows thrown after the bell. Enough with false macho and what
has become a tired freak show.
</P>
<P>
   Enough is more than enough after Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's deplorable
performance by the former heavyweight champion at the MGM Grand
Garden Arena, where he went three minutes without hitting Orlin
Norris and then blasted him with a short left hand to the face
coming out of a clinch well after the bell had sounded to end the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   The bell tolled and referee Richard Steele was heard to yell,
``Stop punching!'' Apparently to Tyson that meant ``Open fire!''
Which he did.
</P>
<P>
   As the stunned Norris fell to the floor, his right knee buckled
under him and he lay flat on his back. As Norris started to rise,
Tyson stared menacingly at him, a bully on the loose. Steele
immediately deducted two points from Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   When the bell sounded to open the second round, Norris didn't
move and his chief handler, Abel Sanchez, told Steele his fighter
couldn't continue. Tyson stalked to the center of the ring, but
Steele directed him to a neutral corner where he paced like the
caged and frightened animal he has become in the ring since the
night Evander Holyfield first exposed him for what he has become.
</P>
<P>
   After a long discussion between Steele, Nevada State Commission
executive director Marc Ratner, and ringside physician Flip
Homansky, the bout was ruled a no-decision pending further review.
When that was announced, Tyson seemed to spin into a rage, but
promoter Dan Goossen rushed in with Tyson's cornermen and calmed
him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He quit,'' Tyson said as he was walking out of the ring. ``How
do I hit him in the jaw and he hurt his leg?''
</P>
<P>
   Probably because when he hit him it was A) after the bell; B)
coming out of a clinch; C) after Steele had ordered both men to
stop punching and; D) while he was still holding Norris with one
arm. Other than that, there was no reason Norris wouldn't have been
able to defend himself from an opponent who no longer has the
self-control to follow even the most basic rules of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just hit me after the bell and I went down the wrong way on
my right knee,'' Norris said.
</P>
<P>
   At times, boxing can be high drama and great art but not when
Tyson is painting the canvas. In the ring now he is what he once
claimed to be _ a street thug mugging old ladies in elevators after
saying he'd help them carry their groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Unsure of himself when under attack and showing none of the fast
combinations and head movement he had exhibited last week, Tyson
was once again winging wild rights and lefts and landing few of
them until the battle was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Only then was he the fearsome knockout puncher he once was. Only
then, with Norris' hands down and under orders not to punch, did he
unleash a knockout blow. What he has to worry about now is whether
he knocked out Norris or himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission will review the tape on Monday and decide if
the punch was intentionally late,'' commission chairman Elias
Ghanem said.
</P>
<P>
   Ratner announced the commission would hold up Tyson's purse
until then while Norris would be paid immediately, although he
netted well below the $800,000 he had on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   After back taxes, manager's shares, a disputed claim, and
medical expenses were deducted, Norris netted $201,982.20 while
Tyson was slated to net $8,765,935.59 before his own managerial
fees and federal taxes are paid.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday night, Tyson may lose more than that. If the
commission rules he intentionally hit Norris after the bell, he may
lose his boxing license for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early last week it came to light that IBF junior lightweight
contender Diego Corrales's only title belt was being auctioned off
on eBay. Saturday &UR;  &LR; night he picked up a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Corrales made a stunning comeback from early trouble when he
sliced open the side of Roberto Garcia's right eye in the third
round and then followed up by dropping him in the sixth round. He
finished off the champion with a crushing straight right hand
behind a pawing left at :42 of the seventh round.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Garcia (32-1) was a bloody mess. He had been beaten
badly in the sixth round, sent to the floor with just under a
minute to go in the round, and then battered and beaten until he
voluntarily took a knee with 12 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   But not even the minute break was enough of a respite to allow
him to regain his senses, and when Garcia came out for what would
prove to be the last round of his reign, it was obvious his legs
were still unhinged and he was all but defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   Corrales (29-0, 24 KO) realized this and closed ground on the
tottering champion quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Almost the moment Garcia hit the floor, Cortez jumped in and
waved Corrales off.
</P>
<P>
   When Corrales left the ring, he was wearing the IBF belt Garcia
had brought, a belt he will surely guard more closely than the IBA
Continental lightweight title belt that disappeared from his house.

BRUINS FINALLY WIN ONE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ With half a second left on the clock and the
game clearly decided, Bruins defenseman Kyle McLaren gave a little
fist pump and broke into a big smile.
</P>
<P>
   Finally.
</P>
<P>
   It took 10 games, but the Bruins finally made it into the win
column, beating the Sharks, 3-1, Saturday night at San Jose Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, which had matched its worst start in franchise history
with a nine-game winless streak (0-5-4), got strong performances
from goalie John Grahame (31 saves) and forwards Anson Carter and
Jason Allison on the way to the victory.
</P>
<P>
   There's a belief in hockey that the best time to play a club is
their first home game after a long road trip. The home team is
often sluggish and ripe for the picking.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly held true Saturday &UR;  &LR; night as the Sharks, who were
just back from a successful 4-2-0 journey and had the league's best
record, were slow out of the gate and the Bruins took advantage
with a pair of power-play goals in the first period and one in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play any worse or any better than we have in our
last four games,'' said coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it statistic-wise, we had just as many chances
in the other games. The only difference tonight was we found a way
to put it in behind the goaltender and bury our chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a question of time; it was a question of staying
positive with them and reassuring them it would happen someday if
they kept on working.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins went up, 2-0, in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Dave Andreychuk drew the penalty and then set up the
score at 12:36. Andreychuk relayed a pass to Carter, who was
positioned below the right circle. Carter found defenseman Darren
Van Impe in the left circle and Van Impe rocketed a shot that
sailed high into the net past goalie Steve Shields.
</P>
<P>
   Boston received a big boost with less than a second left in the
period when the team cashed in on its second power play. Allison
dished a pass to Joe Thornton, who relayed it to McLaren at the
point. McLaren moved it to left wing Sergei Samsonov in the left
circle and Samsonov gave it back to him with McLaren beating
Shields on a one-timer with just seven-10ths of a second remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long time coming,'' said McLaren. ``We played a pretty
good game tonight and our power play clicked and that's what we
need to win games. We shut down their top line and our goaltending
played great. The key guys got the points we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the second period, Sharks coach Darryl Sutter
pulled Shields in favor of Mike Vernon. Shields began the game with
the best statistics in the league.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle period, the Sharks picked up their game markedly
and outshot Boston, 12-8, but couldn't dent Grahame. Jeff Friesen,
Vincent Damphousse and Owen Nolan, the hottest line in the league,
put some decent pressure on the Bruins _ especially Friesen _ but
didn't score.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins made it a three-goal cushion early in the third
period as Carter picked up his second goal of the season and second
in two games. Again the tally came on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Allison, parked below the left circle, fed the puck to Carter in
the slot and he rapped it past Vernon at 3:07.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks responded at the 12:23 mark, spoiling Grahame's bid
for his first NHL shutout. Center Patrick Marleau, who was taken
with the No. 2 overall pick in the 1997 draft after Thornton was
grabbed at No. 1, made it 3-1 when he shoveled the puck past
Grahame from a bad angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell down funny,'' said Grahame. ``It was a bad goal. He was
on the side and I just fell down and it hit my side and went in.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that little blemish, Grahame was thrilled to celebrate
his first victory in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to know you can do it and be confident about
it,'' said Grahame. ``It's another thing to actually do it and get
that first win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big step for our team. Obviously it's good. It's one of
the best feelings you can have. It being the first time in the best
league in the world, obviously it's a tremendous feeling.''

YANKEES PUT ON A LATE SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
 SERIES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Muzzle John Rocker, the Mouth of the South?
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox already was on record as saying
he'd like his lefthanded closer to ``calm down with the fans''
after Rocker decided he had to not only beat the New York Mets in
the National League Championship Series but also win a war of words
with their followers, whom he referred to as a ``tired act'' when
he wasn't calling them animals.
</P>
<P>
   Having already alienated Queens, Cox wasn't sure he wanted
Rocker to take on the Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Staten
Island, too, in the 95th World Series against New York's other
team, the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But after Game 1 Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, the Braves may no longer have
to worry about abridging Rocker's freedom of speech. The Yankees
stuffed a sock in it, at least temporarily, by rapping Rocker and
stifling the Braves, 4-1, behind Orlando Hernandez, after it
appeared that the Yankees might lose (shades of Floyd Bevens) on a
night that their pitcher threw a one-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one said it was going to be easy,'' Braves second baseman
Bret Boone said after the Yankees scored all of their runs in the
eighth inning, turning three ground-ball hits, two walks, and a
botched bunt into four runs, Derek Jeter driving in the tying run
and Paul O'Neill knocking in two to break the tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been easy all year. We had a tough series against
Houston, a tough series against the Mets, and we're going to have a
tough series against the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were behind, 1-0, after seven innings, the Braves'
only hit a home run by Chipper Jones off El Duque in the fourth.
New York finally stirred in the eighth against Greg Maddux, who to
that point had been composing one of the great pinch-hitting
performances in Series history.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, subbing for a flu-stricken Tom Glavine, had baffled the
Bombers on three singles and had not allowed an advance past second
base. But Scott Brosius, last year's Series MVP in the Yankees'
sweep of San Diego, led off with a ground ball through the left
side, his third hit of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre then sent up Darryl Strawberry to pinch hit
for Hernandez, who had 10 whiffs in seven innings, and Strawberry
worked Maddux for a walk, the third of the night by the Braves'
master craftsman.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees then made the Braves look as fumble-prone as the Red
Sox in the ALCS, capitalizing on two errors by first baseman Brian
Hunter, who had just entered the game for (ahem) defensive
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's first misplay came when he fielded Chuck Knoblauch's
sacrifice bunt, placed perfectly just past the mound, and had the
ball slip out of his throwing hand, allowing Knoblauch to reach
safely and load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to have a sinking feeling,'' Hunter said. ``No outs,
bases loaded, and Jeter coming up. I was hoping that maybe he would
hit a chopper back to Maddux. If we'd gotten an out on the bunt,
maybe we walk Jeter and try to get a double play.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jeter punched a ground ball through the shortstop hole
for a tying single.
</P>
<P>
   That ended Maddux's night. Asked if there was anything he would
have done differently, he said: ``Not really. I thought I pitched
Strawberry pretty good, even though I walked him, and I made a good
pitch to Brosius, and he hit it. The only physical mistake I made
was to Jeter. I wanted to throw it down and away, and it got too
much of the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   A sellout crowd of 51,342 at Turner Field roared as Rocker
emerged from the bullpen and sprinted toward the mound like a
spooked Clydesdale. Waiting at the plate was Paul O'Neill, who in
the face of Rocker fastballs hurtling plateward at speeds of 96
miles an hour, got ahead in the count, 3 and 1, then whacked a
ground ball to right through a drawn-in infield for two runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pitcher's pitch,'' Rocker said. ``I couldn't have
made a better pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You put the ball in play,'' O'Neill said, ``and you hope good
things can happen, and they did tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter cut off right fielder Brian Jordan's throw home and
attempted to nail Jeter at third, but he bounced his throw,
allowing O'Neill to advance to second.
</P>
<P>
   There were still no outs when Rocker issued an intentional walk
to Bernie Williams, reloading the bases. He fanned the next two
batters, Tino Martinez and Jorge Posada, but then faced another
Yankee pinch hitter _ and perhaps the most hated Bomber on
Peachtree Street _ Jim Leyritz.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz was last seen here crushing an inexplicable slider from
another Braves burner, Mark Wohlers, for a three-run home run that
turned the 1996 Series around. No such heroics from The King this
time, but he forced home a fourth run when he looked at a 3-and-2
off-speed pitch from Rocker for ball four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I got a lot of the plate,'' Rocker said of the last
pitch to Leyritz. ``I didn't get beat that bad tonight. I just
didn't get the breaks. Sometimes that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves started a rally of their own in the ninth, bringing
the tying run to the plate when Yankees closer Mariano Rivera gave
up a one-out single to Bret Boone and walked Chipper Jones on four
pitches. But Rivera righted himself quickly, striking out Brian
Jordan and retiring pinch hitter Greg Myers on a weak foul to third
baseman Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   The night, by Southern standards, was near wintry: game-time
temperature of 49 degrees, with a 15-mile-an-hour wind making it
feel like freezing.
</P>
<P>
   But the conditions were ideal for cafe Cubano _ strong, dark,
and rich _ and that's what Hernandez gave the Braves. El Duque, 5-0
in postseason play, struck out eight of the first 11 hitters he
faced before Jones turned on a fastball and launched it just inside
the right-field foul pole with one out in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after I faced (Hernandez) the second time,'' Maddux said,
``I knew we weren't going to score again.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux was right on as the Yankees won their ninth straight in
World Series play since the Braves beat them in the first two games
in New York in '96. They're 8-1 in postseason play this fall.

HERNANDEZ NEW OCTOBER ACE 
</HEADLINE>
 SERIES-HERNANDEZ-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ El Duque did it again Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, throwing seven
innings of one-hit ball in a 4-1 World Series Game 1 victory over
the Braves. He's emerging as the Bob Gibson of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez, a Cuban refugee who is either 30 or 34 years
old, has a career postseason mark of 5-0 with a 1.02 ERA. The
Yankees have won all six of his playoff starts. Compare that with
Greg Maddux _ Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's loser _ who is 10-10 in the
playoffs. And need we remind you that Roger Clemens has won only
two of 11 postseason starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say if these are the best games I have thrown, but
they definitely make me happy and my teammates happy,'' said
Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He continues to just make you shake your head,'' said Yankee
manager Joe Torre. ``He took control early, as did Maddux.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are so good, it's easy to forget they were
threatened once in the middle of the playoffs last year.
</P>
<P>
   It's true. The 125-win ``greatest team of the century'' New York
Yankees trailed Cleveland, two games to one, in the 1998 American
League Championship Series. Things turned around when El Duque went
to the mound at Jacobs Field and beat the Indians with seven
innings of three-hit pitching. It was his first postseason
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Since that Game 4 win, the Yankees have won an astounding 15 of
16 postseason games _ a monstrous streak interrupted only when
Pedro Martinez stuck it to Clemens and the Yankees at Fenway last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It looked for a time like El Duque might be a one-hit loser. The
Yankees trailed, 1-0, when Joe Torre sent Darryl Strawberry up to
hit for Hernandez in the eighth inning. It turned into a four-run
inning for the Yankees, making Hernandez a winner again.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about these Hernandez brothers in October. Two
years ago, Livan Hernandez was Most Valuable Player of the Florida
Marlins' World Series victory over the Indians. At that time, El
Duque was living in poverty in Cuba, unable to find a radio
broadcast of his brother's exploits.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out the side in the first, then did it again in the
third. With his high leg kick and impressive assortment of pitches,
he had the Braves off stride all night long, fanning four of them
twice. He is a worthy descendant of Cuban hurlers Camilo Pascual,
Mike Cuellar, and Luis Tiant _ all World Series veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (Hernandez) and Maddux both threw great,'' said
Braves manager Bobby Cox, who was not happy with the work of plate
umpire Randy Marsh. ``Both pitchers were really throwing the ball
well and it was tough to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez made his only mistake in the fourth. After fanning
Bret Boone to start the inning, Hernandez grooved a fastball to
Chipper Jones. It was simple human error. Yankee catcher Jorge
Posada set up on the outside of the plate but Hernandez came inside
with a fastball and Jones sent it into the third deck in right
field. Hernandez immediately pointed to his own jersey, leaving no
doubt that he was at fault for the homer.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez allowed only one base runner after the home run and
that was a walk to Jones in the seventh. Jones was erased
attempting to steal and the Yanks made Hernandez a winner with four
runs in the eighth.

WHO HAS WEIRDEST FIGHTS? IT'S NO CONTEST  
 PUNCH AFTER BELL ENDS TYSON'S LATEST FARCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ No contest.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   No more, please.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson's wayward path of anarchy continued to leave its
jagged scars on the remains of a proud sport Saturday night in a
fight with no result.
</P>
<P>
   The undisputed champ of nihilism proved again that there is no
end to all that is negative in a bout against Orlin Norris.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be a Tyson comeback.
</P>
<P>
   It was.
</P>
<P>
   A self-proclaimed different man had come back as bad as ever.
</P>
<P>
   With referee Richard Steele standing between the two
heavyweights, Tyson threw a left hand after the bell sounded an end
to the first of a scheduled 10 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Norris went down and apparently hurt his right knee as he fell.
That's how it ended, as boos and plastic cups poured from an angry
crowd of 12,801 at the MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Nevada State Athletic Commission, it was called
``no contest because of an `accidental' foul.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevada withheld Tyson's $10 million purse, pending an
investigation next week, according to Commission executive director
Marc Ratner. Norris was paid a reported $800,000 by Tyson's
promoter Dan Goosen.
</P>
<P>
   If the foul was accidental, why did Steele penalize Tyson by
deducting two points from a possible 10 on the judges' score cards?
</P>
<P>
   There was no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there never are explanations for the craziness that
Tyson (46-3, 40 knockouts) always seems to spawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He quit,'' Tyson yelled at the press section as he headed for
his dressing room. ``How did I hit him in the jaw and he hurt his
leg?''
</P>
<P>
   No explanation.
</P>
<P>
   But there also was no explanation from Tyson as to why he threw
a punch after the bell. Then again, Tyson never has been able to
explain why he bit Evander Holyfield's ears, or why he assaulted
two middle-aged men after a fender-bender in Maryland, or why, why,
who-oh-why.
</P>
<P>
   He always has lived by his own rules without any consideration
of conscience or cost.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Tyson expressed outrage about 30 minutes after the
last echoes of the last boo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody knows that, if you're competitive, you keep on
fighting, even if your leg is fractured,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson vowed there would be no second fight with Norris. But
Norris' contract also includes a clause for a rematch, which was
mentioned by Goosen moments after the latest chapter in the
unabridged, ongoing edition of Tyson trials and tribulations.
Believe it or not, Norris-Tyson II is a possibility for Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   First, of course, Norris will have to recover from his apparent
knee injury. He was taken to Las Vegas' Valley Hospital, where he
was scheduled to undergo a magnetic resonance imaging test.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit me after the bell,'' said Norris, who, according to his
corner, had undergone surgery on his right knee a few years ago.
``I just went down on my knee the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   In another predictable reaction, neither Tyson nor Goosen
believed Norris was hurt at all. Goosen said it was clear from a
replay of the video that Norris walked back to his corner without a
limp after he climbed back to his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must have hurt himself when he sat down on his stool,''
Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   But ring physician Dr. Flip Homansky said Norris wasn't faking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was swelling in the right knee, and it was stiff,'' said
Homansky, who examined Norris after trainer Abel Sanchez said his
fighter could not continue.
</P>
<P>
   Charge and counter-charge, examination and recrimination, and
all the rest would not have been necessary had Tyson not attacked
after a brief armistice had been declared.
</P>
<P>
   But the signs of anarchy were there all along. A couple of weeks
ago, Tyson announced he would bite all over again if necessary. He
didn't bite this time, but the effect was the same. His latest act
left a damaged sport looking a little more chewed up.
</P>
<P>
   Before the opening bell, drums pounded out a heavy, war-like
beat as Tyson marched to the ring dressed in his characteristic
black. The label on his sleeveless, Spartan T-shirt said Tyson
Gear.
</P>
<P>
   It rhymes with fear, which is what any fan of boxing should have
these days. This wasn't a requiem for a heavyweight. It was more
like an epitaph for a sport. &QL;

NO DOUBT ABOUT EL DUQUE'S GREATNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - His life is a puzzle, full of high leg kicks and
side-arm deception. A true international man of mystery.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, he was simply Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
   El Du-KKKKKKKKKK.
</P>
<P>
   You need no further proof. Orlando Hernandez may lie about his
age, prolong and proliferate a lie about his flight for freedom,
act like reporters are inquisitors sent by Castro. But he is a
remarkable big-game pitcher. One of the best ever to take the
mound, and you can look it up.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Braves at Turner Field, Hernandez struck out 10
batters in seven innings. He gave up one hit, a solo home run by
Chipper Jones. He remains undefeated in the postseason, with five
victories in six career starts. And this is how dominant he's been:
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's virtuoso performance, Hernandez's postseason
ERA actually went up. All the way to 1.02.
</P>
<P>
   ``He continues to just make you shake your head,'' Yankees
Manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have been on cruise control for two seasons. But
there was one tenuous moment in the course of this dynasty, a
moment easily forgotten in the avalanche of victories.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's American League Championship Series, the Yankees
trailed the Indians 2 games to 1. Game 4 was in Cleveland. An upset
was in the air. Until Hernandez took the mound, shutting out the
Indians during seven innings. The Yankees have won 15 of 16
postseason games since.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say enough about El Duque tonight,'' the Yankees'
Paul O'Neill said. ``He pitched great. Again.''
</P>
<P>
   What to make of this man with a flair for the big stage and the
half-truth?
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows what happened the day after Christmas in
1997, the moment Hernandez and seven others fled Cuba. Originally,
the story placed Hernandez on a raft. Soon, he was holding an
orphan in one hand and fending off sharks with the other. Hollywood
was interested. A book-and-movie deal was in the works.
</P>
<P>
   That story was later amended. The raft became a boat. The kind
with a motor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't know the size of the boat he came over on,''
Torre said. ``But whatever it was, it's still the fact that he had
to slide out of the country and hide somewhere and then be found.
It's not the way we got to the ballpark, I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest: Hernandez claims he just turned 30. Except ``New
York'' ``Magazine'' unearthed court documents filed in Havana
regarding Hernandez's divorce, papers that say he was born in 1965.
Which makes him 34.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. The man can pitch. And at $1.85 million a season, he
could be the best bargain in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``His confidence is just so high right now,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   So Game 1 goes to the Yankees, a game that was all about
hurling. And not just because Tom Glavine was sick with a violent
flu strain that had his system working in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux, the Braves' surprise starter, was masterful for
most of the night. Hernandez threw 97 pitches, only one of them a
mistake. And if you ever needed proof that the designated hitter
needs to be abolished, this was the game.
</P>
<P>
   After Scott Brosius opened the pivotal eighth inning with a
single, Torre decided to lift Hernandez in favor of pinch-hitter
Darryl Strawberry. The move caught Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox
completely off guard. Cox had no reliever warming up, and
Strawberry coaxed a walk that blew the inning wide open.
</P>
<P>
   A wonderful chess match. Even if it prevented Hernandez from
authoring a complete-game performance, the kind that could've
caught the attention of baseball historians. As it is, the effort
belongs on the second tier of World Series pitching gems. The shelf
right below Don Larsen's perfect game in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   There have been four one-hitters in World Series history, the
last in 1967. Hernandez could've had the fifth. Bob Gibson struck
out 17 in the 1968 World Series. Hernandez could've come close.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw good, I thought,'' a cranky Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Good?
</P>
<P>
   More like a mystery the Braves couldn't solve. A man who was a
nearly pitcher perfect. Again. &QL;

   LAS VEGAS - The payoff at the ring toss booth is a Kewpie doll
or a big teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   But what draws us to the seedy tent at the end of the midway?
The one painted with ornate illustrations of nature's oddities and
curiosities. Freaks. Geeks. Sword swallowers. Siamese twins.
</P>
<P>
   When the carny cries ````Hu''r-ry, ``Hu''r-ry, step right up!''
why do we?
</P>
<P>
   Curiosity. That's all it is.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, that's what Mike Tyson has become. A carnival sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked from his dressing room and into the glare of lights
Saturday night the rap music a pounding beat you could see the
anticipation on the grinning faces in the crowd. Among those at
ringside was actor Verne Troyer who played Dr. Evil's miniature
twin in the new Austin Powers movie. Looking up at Tyson, and down
at Troyer who is 32 inches tall, you thought of Dr. Evil's
admonition to his double.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Mini-Me, we do ``not'' gnaw on our kitty.''
</P>
<P>
   The unspoken question surrounding the ex champ hung above the
ring like the microphone the announcer used to introduce him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighting out of the red corner. . .the youngest man ever to
win the heavyweight title. . .the explosive. . .the one and only. .
.''
</P>
<P>
   What was the glowering figure in a black trunks thinking?
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson's head has more rooms than the MGM Grand Hotel. What,
the audience wondered, will he do ``tonight''?``''
</P>
<P>
   What he did was give boxing which just thought it had run out of
black eyes another one.
</P>
<P>
   What he did was write another sorry chapter to a career in
decline and marked by endless controversy.
</P>
<P>
   What he did was cheat the public, again.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson hit Orlin Norris with a short left to the jaw ``after''
the bell sounded, ending the first round. Norris buckled, landing
on his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Richard Steele penalized Tyson, deducting two points.
</P>
<P>
   Norris returned to his corner. When he said his knee hurt and
couldn't continue the fight, three minutes old, was over, ruled a
``no contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Boos filled the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's $10 million purse is being withheld, pending an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Baddest Man on the Planet is gone. He is mostly a curiosity
now, the lead actor in boxing's theater of the absurd. When it
comes to voyeuristic amusement the former heavyweight champion
isn't all that different from the carnival geek who bites the head
off a live chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in this same ring, Tyson lost his aura of
invincibility. He also lost _ forever _ the respect he once
commanded as a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   That summer night Tyson chewed off a piece of Evander
Holyfield's right ear, then took a bite of the left one. His
behavior was shocking, a low act, even for boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Mills Lane only ``thought'' he had seen everything.
Biting? ``Once is bad enough,'' said Lane, now a black-robed TV
judge. ````Twice'' is dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is a troubled soul. Tormented by demons. He assaulted a
beauty queen. Beat his ex wife. In and out of jail, he has made _
and lost _ millions.
</P>
<P>
   When the Nevada State Boxing Commission suspended him the
sanctioning body said Tyson was a ``disgrace to boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. A sport that sells public humiliation can't be disgraced.
Boxing is incapable of blushing. Tyson disgraced himself.
</P>
<P>
   What will he do next?
</P>
<P>
   What will he say?
</P>
<P>
   After the fight Tyson lay the blame for the fiasco on his
victim. In so many words he called Norris a coward. He said a
``real fighter'' would have continued. Tyson accepted none of the
blame, even though he threw the punch that was ruled an
``accidental'' foul.
</P>
<P>
   What next? What will he do? What will he say? History has taught
he may do, or say anything. At a recent news conference, Tyson
gazed out at his audience. ``I look up,'' he said in a soft flutey
voice that belongs in another body, ``and I possibly see perverts,
pedophiles, freaks and horrible fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   He called reporters ``dysfunctional drunks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I resent that,'' an Associated Press wit shot back, with mock
indignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not dysfunctional.''
</P>
<P>
   No, but boxing is.

LEFT WITH SICK FEELING  
 BRAVES' BATS ALSO SEEM TO HAVE FLU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In what has become an all-too-familiar sight during
World Series games in the 1990s, the Atlanta Braves offense took
the night off again.
</P>
<P>
   Is it really any wonder why the Braves have just one World
Series championship to show for their otherwise fabulous seasons
during this decade?
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees hung around long enough to come back in the
eighth inning and beat the Braves, 4-1, in Game 1 of the World
Series on a crisp Saturday night at Turner Field. The home-field
advantage immediately shifted to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we have to go out there and hit a little better,''
said Atlanta first baseman Ryan Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   Using the simplest of street terms, ``No duh?''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Yankees starter Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez was as
sharp as ever, limiting the Braves to just one hit (a Chipper Jones
solo home run) while pitching seven magnificent innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I hit against him the second time, I knew we weren't
scoring again,'' Atlanta starter Greg Maddux said.
</P>
<P>
   This was a game that once again underscored the Braves'
inability to hit when it matters most, during the World Series.
Maddux, the surprise Atlanta starter after Tom Glavine came down
with a bad case of the flu, entered the game with a career 1.99 ERA
in four previous World Series starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' awe-inspiring trio of Maddux, Glavine and John
Smoltz now have a combined ERA of 2.01 in 19 World Series starts.
Despite those sterling numbers, Atlanta's big three starters have
just an 8-7 record to show for their World Series starts.
</P>
<P>
   What's it all mean? Mostly that Atlanta's offense isn't holding
up its end of the bargain in these Fall Classics.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the fingers have to start being pointed toward
the offense, which managed just one other hit on this evening, a
one-out ninth inning single, against Yankees pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost as though Atlanta's offense becomes lulled into a
false sense of security when one of their big three is on the
mound. It's a team that becomes much too pitching dependent once
the World Series starts.
</P>
<P>
   Once Jones hit his home run, a high arching drive down the right
field line in the fourth inning which also became the first World
Series home run ever hit at Turner Field, it was almost as though
Braves hitters said, ``All right Mad Dog (Maddux's nickname),
there's your run. Now go get 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a game the Braves clearly let get away. They were six
outs from assuming a lead in the World Series when Maddux ran out
of magic and the Yankees bats came to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, pitching in a one run World Series game is mentally
tough, but not physically,'' Maddux said. ``If we win four more
games, then this one will be no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux was definitely cruising along, holding a 1-0 lead, until
he hit some speed bumps in the eighth. He gave up a leadoff single
to last year's World Series MVP, Scott Brosius, before committing
what might have been his biggest mistake of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux walked pinch-hitter Darryl Strawberry, who entered the
game batting just .162 (6 for 37) against the four-time Cy Young
Award winner.
</P>
<P>
   An error then loaded the bases and Maddux, trying to waste a
pitch with an 0-2 count, didn't throw it poorly enough before Derek
Jeter lined a single to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's excitable closer, John Rocker, then gave up a two-run
single to Paul O'Neill, walked two of the next four batters and
finished the inning with the Braves trailing 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing unusual about a Maddux beating you 1-0,''
Yankees Manager Joe Torre said. ``It didn't surprise us once we got
a little crack there we were able to open it up. We've been a
patient ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's lineup, top to bottom, is not that intimidating. What
makes the Braves so difficult to beat is their pitching staff. But
when the offense isn't scoring, let alone hitting, it becomes a
much easier task to handle Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been tough to score in the post-season,'' Atlanta
shortstop Walt Weiss said. ``The ones who usually get here are here
because of pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   The clubs that win here, though, also mix in some offense, even
if it's a little, as evidenced by New York's six hits. &QL;

2ND-YEAR CENTER SENT DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - At least he got to see his wife and kids for a week.
</P>
<P>
   But second-year center  &UR; Daniel Briere is headed back to the
minor leagues on Monday after officially being reassigned to the
Springfield Falcons on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny needs to get his ice time, and he can get that now in
Springfield,'' assistant general manager  &UR; Taylor Burke said.
``Hopefully, he can go there and dominate like he did two years
ago, which I'm sure he will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes didn't need to free up a spot on the roster. But
with
 &UR; Jeremy Roenick returning to the lineup Saturday after serving a
five-game suspension, the little ice time Briere was getting would
just melt away that much quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Briere, who started in the minors only a week after his second
child was born here in the Valley, was scoreless in five games with
the Coyotes. He was not available for comment, but he was expecting
the move. &QL; 
Moving up &QL; 
Left wing  &UR; Keith Tkachuk is two points shy of moving into third
place on the franchise's all-time scoring list. His third-period
assist Saturday night gave him 516, two behind  &UR; Paul MacLean.  &UR; Dale
Hawerchuk is the club's career leader with 929 points, followed by
 &UR; Thomas  &UR; Steen with 817.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk also is 12 penalty minutes shy of tying  &UR; Laurie Boschman
for the most in franchise history. Boschman ended his career with
the Winnipeg Jets with 1,338 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night in Edmonton, Tkachuk will move into sixth place
on the team's all-time games-played list, tying  &UR; Ron Wilson, now an
assistant coach in Springfield, who appeared in 536 games for the
Jets from 1979 to 1988. &QL; 
The Green light &QL; 
Center  &UR; Travis Green's point-scoring streak stopped at six games
and his goal-scoring streak, tied for the NHL high, ended at five
games.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's been quite a ride for the Coyotes newcomer, who says
he's ``just trying to fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you're contributing, it's awesome,'' Green said.
``Winning is still the bottom line, but when you're winning and
contributing, it makes it even better. Like I've said, the puck
just seems to be jumping into the net right now.'' &QL; 
Getting untracked &QL; 
Defenseman  &UR; Teppo Numminen finally got his offense going. After
registering only one point _ an assist _ in his first seven games,
the ``Repo Man'' had three setups during the Coyotes' 6-3 win over
Los Angeles Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Bob Francis wants his blueliners to jump into the play
whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I play against the other teams' top lines, I have to be
smart. I can't always think offense all the time. It's still
defense first,'' Numminen said. &QL;

DUCKS DELIVER KICK IN TEETH TO ROSE BOWL HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. - Arizona spent most of Saturday night flirting
with disaster, and the two finally left Arizona Stadium
hand-in-hand, whispering sweet lovelies in each other's ears.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a mistake and the Wildcats probably made it in their 44-41
loss to Oregon in front of 55,251.
</P>
<P>
   It's a loss that will haunt the Wildcats (5-3, 2-2) for some
time, because it probably eliminates them from Rose Bowl
contention.
</P>
<P>
   Those hopes ended about 11 p.m., when Oregon's Josh Frankel made
a 32-yard field goal with 1:04 left to give the Ducks (4-3, 2-2)
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had one last shot. Keith Smith barely missed receiver
Dennis Northcutt on a touchdown pass, forcing the Wildcats to try a
45-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McDonald, who had made just 1 of 9 field goals this season,
missed wide left with two seconds left. In contrast, Frankel,
playing because of starter Nathan Villegas' knee injury, made four
field goals Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats had more than 500 yards of offense (553) for the
fourth straight game, setting a school record. That's of no solace
now. The Wildcats know they started losing this game shortly after
kickoff at 7:24 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a mistake to be made, the Wildcats came up with
creative ways to do it. They gave up a safety on the first play of
the game and fumbled on the third. They missed an extra point and
drew numerous penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Their ``coverage'' teams never lived up to the title. Oregon had
207 yards in kickoff returns, a record for an Arizona opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon running back Reuben Droughns carried 45 times, a school
record, for 202 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that if Reuben ran that uch, we would have a good
chance,'' Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti said. ``We started to wear
them down in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, Arizona nearly won the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, who trailed, 21-7, in the first half, took a 34-27
lead early in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona could never contain the Ducks, who came back behind
the arm of backup quarterback Joey Harrington. He hit Tony Hartley
with a 36-yard touchdown pass that tied the game at 34 with 13:58
to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks later fumbled, giving Arizona possession at the Oregon
30. The Ducks stuffed Arizona on two plays, forcing a third-and-13.
</P>
<P>
   But running back Trung Canidate took a simple pass in the flat,
spun away from a defender and went 33 yards for the touchdown. The
extra point gave Arizona a 41-34 lead with 9:07 left.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected Oregon to be done, and the Ducks weren't.
Another long kickoff return gave them possession at their own 45. A
long run by Droughns and a 28-yard pass from Harrington to Hartley
set up a 3-yard touchdown run by Droughns, tying the game at 41
with 6:08 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats' problems arrived early and stayed late. On their
third offensive play, Northcutt set a Pac-10 record by catching a
pass in his 38th straight game. Then he fumbled the ball away to
the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats' special teams were awful and the defense looked
helpless early in the game trying to stop Droughns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they trailed the Ducks just 24-21 at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The second half started nearly as badly for the Wildcats. Their
first drive ended when Smith was sacked, and the second one came to
an abrupt stop when Smith was intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon started its first two drives of the half at Arizona's 35
and 25, but thanks to Arizona's defense, the Ducks came away with
just three points.
</P>
<P>
   They blocked a field goal on the first possession and limited
the Ducks to a 31-yard field goal on the second. Oregon led, 27-21,
but it could have been much worse for UA.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Arizona seemed prepared to regain the lead but
messed that up, too. Canidate took a pitchout and scored on a
60-yard run, tying the game at 27, with 7:06 left in the third
quarter. But McDonald missed his fourth extra point of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon threatened again on its next series, but cornerback David
Laudermilk came up with an interception at the Arizona 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats survived in the first half thanks to three big
offensive plays. Quarterback Ortege Jenkins scored on a 65-yard
run. Smith set up another touchdown with a 49-yard run. And
Northcutt took a reverse 80 yards for another score.

ANOTHER BIZARRE NIGHT FOR TYSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ A disgusted woman who had paid God-knows how much to
see the fight summed it perfectly:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that was a &AMP;%$ waste of time. And, of course, Mike Tyson
made it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   This one, between Tyson and Orlin Norris, wasn't on par with the
ear-biting incident that ended his second fight with Evander
Holyfield. What could be? However, it had that remarkably bizarre
quality we've come to associate with Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   The fight had gone only one round when Tyson landed a left hook
about a second or maybe two after the bell, Norris fell awkwardly
on his back, wrenched his right knee and said he couldn't continue.
</P>
<P>
   It was ruled a no contest because of what referee Richard Steele
called an ``accidental foul'' before the end of four rounds.
</P>
<P>
   That was that.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's latest comeback fight fizzled almost before it started
before a incredulous crowd of 12,081 at the MGM Grand on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The moment Jimmy Lennon Jr. announced the result, a tremendous
chorus of boos reverberated in the spacious indoor arena followed
by angry chants and nasty comments that shouldn't be printed here.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, convinced Norris could continue because he had walked to
his corner with little or no problem, was himself disgusted and
threatened to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired,'' said Tyson, whose $10 million purse was withheld
by the Nevada State Athletic Commission, while Norris received his
$800,000. ``I don't even want to fight no more, I'm tired of this
(garbage). I gave my best, I just came to give a good show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just tired of this, I'm just tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was serious about quitting, he said: ``I really
want to.''
</P>
<P>
   The first... er, only round was largely uneventful.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson (46-3, with 40 knockouts) did some of the things his
trainers had hoped he'd do after a nine-month layoff because of a
three-month stint in prison _ fight relatively patiently, move his
head, jab.
</P>
<P>
   He also threw the big bombs we've also come to associate with
him. Not one hit its mark, although it seemed only a matter of time
before one did.
</P>
<P>
   Norris (50-5, 27 KOs) also did what he set out to do: punch on
the move, don't stand in one place too long as Francois Botha did
when Tyson knocked him out in his last fight, in January.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if it might be an interesting fight. And then it
was over.
</P>
<P>
   Steele, himself no stranger to controversy, had warned Tyson
about hitting on the break. And then Tyson _ who said he didn't
hear the bell _ did it again moments after the first three minutes
expired, knocking Norris flat.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it appeared Norris was hurt by the punch, but he
quickly got to his feet and went to his corner, where he sat down
on his stool. If he had injured his knee, it wasn't immediately
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Steele then informed Tyson he took two points away from him for
the foul and it appeared the fight would continue.
</P>
<P>
   However, Norris and/or his handlers said the knee wouldn't allow
it and the fight was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, perhaps not aware of exactly what transpired, reacted
angrily and was surrounded by his handlers, who calmed him down as
security guards _ ready for anything at a Tyson fight _ quickly
surrounded the ring to keep order.
</P>
<P>
   In so many words, Tyson called Norris a coward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have more to (complain) about than I do,'' he said
in a calm moment. ``The reality of the situation is that he
could've got up and continued to fight. I put the heat on him and
he didn't want to continue. I heard he would come to fight. But the
way he conducted himself, he should feel bad about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``A real fighter fights until he can't fight no more,'' he
continued. ``Against Buster Douglas, I could've quit. Against
Evander Holyfield (in the first fight), I could've quit. I took my
beating like a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Norris, who was taken to a local hospital and unavailable
for comment, really hurt?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Flip Homansky, the ring doctor, said Norris told him after
he sat on his stool for several minutes that he felt pain and
stiffness. Homansky said the knee had begun to swell.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the fact Norris appeared to walk to his corner
with what he said was only a slight limp is consistent with
subsequent pain and swelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes time for the swelling to occur, then the pain comes
afterward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Ratner, executive director of the Athletic Commission, said
Tyson's purse was withheld pending review of the fight on Monday. A
commission meeting to address the situation will follow. The issue
is whether the foul was intentional or accidental.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was called an accidental foul,'' Ratner said. ``We just
want to look at the films, we want to make sure exactly what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   And what might be next for Tyson?
</P>
<P>
   Said Dan Goossen, Tyson's promoter: ``We just want to get past
this. Then we'll talk about what we want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary bouts, heavyweight contender David Tua showed
former Canadian champion Shane Sutcliffe why he's considered one of
the most dangerous fighters in the world, ending their scheduled
10-round bout with one left hook at 1:20 of the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Sutcliffe (21-9-1, 12 KOs), who landed awkwardly on his hands
and knees, made it to his feet but referee Jay Nady spared him
further punishment by stopping the mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have respect for the guy (Sutcliffe), but I had no respect
for his power,'' said Tua, a native of Samoa who fights out of New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The referee did a good job stopping the fight. He was
disappointed, but the referee ... didn't want to see him get
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Tua (35-1, 20 KOs) is seeking an opportunity to fight the winner
of the Nov. 13 Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis fight but might not
be high on either's list of prospective opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Featherweight contender Augie Sanchez (23-1, 20 KOs) put down
Daniel Jimenez (27-8-1, 14 KOs) twice with body punches and Jiminez
stayed down the second time.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled 10-round bout was stopped at 1:41 of the sixth
round.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan Dokiwari (15-1, 13 KOs) outpointed Agustin Corpus (7-4-2,
seven KOs) in a six-round heavyweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   And undefeated junior welterweight contender Zab Judah had an
usual evening: He fought two three-round exhibitions against
separate fighters.
</P>
<P>
   He dominated both Joaquin Gallardo, whom he dropped, and Manuel
Gomez.

 &HT;    Millennium concerns without weight, professor says
 &HT;    By Laylan Copelin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Admit it.
</P>
<P>
   As you chuckle at TV reports of survivalists packing off to
their desert bunkers with shotgun shells and rations, you are
contemplating how much cash to withdraw from the ATM in late
December and whether you need a couple of extra frozen pizzas to
get through the New Year's Day football games.
</P>
<P>
   After all, surely the end of civilization as we know it won't
mean the end of football, too. Then you hit the remote, drift off
to sleep in your recliner and forget any doomsday thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas history Professor Howard Miller understands
your ambivalence. After at least three years of public
hand-wringing about a computer bug, Miller suspects as many
Americans are as Y2K complacent as they are compliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a long time for the American attention span,'' says
Miller, an award-winning teacher whose research includes pre-Civil
War history and American religion. ``We don't do attention span
well. I sense we're getting millennium fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller sees the intersection of secular society's Y2K fears with
America's religious history of expecting the apocalypse: the
ultimate triumph of Christian good over evil in a final judgment
and the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Although Miller dreads another millennium list almost as much as
the apocalypse, we offer a list gleaned from his 75-minute lecture
to a university audience last week. If you're still not sure what
to think of the passing of another 1,000 years, here's everything
you need to know about the millennium in the Ultimate Millennium
List:
</P>
<P>
   10. The math is wrong. In the mid-sixth century, a monk named
Dionysius Exiguus, or Dennis the Short (seriously), created a
chronology of human history for a pope. It became the calendar for
Western Civilization, counting down time before Jesus Christ's
birth (B.C.) and then counting each year from the birth (A.D.).
Only problem is, Miller says, most historians believe Dennis the
Short missed Christ's birth by at least four years. ``The
millennium was 1996,'' says Miller gleefully. ``We missed it!''
</P>
<P>
   9. The math is wrong, Part II. Dennis the Short had no concept
of zero in his calendar. He called the first year after Jesus's
birth 1, not 0. So by Jesus' first birthday, the world was entering
its second year. Since then, the centuries ended in '00 as did the
first millennium, 1000 A.D. The second millennium _ 2,000 years
after the birth of Jesus _ actually ends more than a year from now,
Dec. 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   8. Pop culture rules. Despite the mathematical glitches, Miller
expects us to party like it's 1999. In his 1981 hit, The Artist
Formerly Known as Prince opted for a Jan. 1, 2000, beginning for
the millennium. Miller says pop culture _ and the news media that
celebrates it _ has fallen in line. He blames our fascination with
automobiles and their odometers: ``No intellectual explanation
about Dennis the Short's mistake is going to win out over the
fascination of seeing all of those nines turn into zeros.'' The
most notable exception in pop culture is Arthur C. Clarke's
futuristic movie _ ``2001: A Space Odyssey.'' It was made in 1968,
ancient history by pop standards.
</P>
<P>
   7. Pop culture rules, Part II. Hollywood already has had its say
on the subject. In the summer of 1998, ``Deep Impact'' and
``Armageddon'' made hundreds of millions of dollars with
end-of-the-world themes. ``For good or ill, folks, these two summer
flicks may be all we get in the way of marking the millennium,''
Miller says.
</P>
<P>
   6. An apocalypse is hard to predict. Since Jesus ascended into
heaven, Miller says Christians have been waiting for the Second
Coming when Christ is to judge the world. In the early 11th
century, a monk named Radulfus Glabor, or Ralph the Bald (another
monk-nomer), sensed a quickening in the religious life of western
Europe and believed there was an increasing number of floods,
earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says the church had paid little attention to the passing
of the first millennium, but Ralph speculated that the Second
Coming might come in 1033 _ the millennium of Christ's death. It
didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 19th century America, evangelist William Miller
predicted Jesus would return Oct. 22, 1843. As many as 50,000
Americans sold their earthly goods to prepare. When the Second
Coming didn't occur, many believers fell away in disbelief. Others,
however, accepted Miller's explanations for the failed prophecy and
founded the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Miller says a young evangelist, Billy Graham, made
his reputation by focusing on the imminent return of Jesus. In
1968, a best seller, ``The Late Great Planet Earth'' by Hal
Lindsey, resurrected interest in apocalyptic language and thinking.
Miller says a basic fact of apocalyptic tradition is, ``It has over
the centuries been impervious to repeated failure of prophecy.''
</P>
<P>
   5. The Chinese think it's the Year of the Rabbit. Not everyone
counts time by Dennis the Short's calender and there are several
billion non-Christians who are not expecting a second visit from
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   4. Our ancestors really didn't pay much attention to the passing
of centuries. Miller says the Catholic Church took little note of
the passing of the First Millennium: ``There were no church-wide
observances, no predictions that the world would come to the end.
In fact, the Pope took very little notice at all until the
millennial year was upon him.''
</P>
<P>
   In America, the first record of someone celebrating the turn of
a century, was on Jan. 1, 1701, Miller says. Judge Samuel Sewall of
Boston hired four trumpet players to blast in the 18th century in
the town square. About the same time, Americans began celebrating
their own birthdays. It was the French, at the end of the 19th
century, who raised thinking about the passage of time to a
movement. For about a decade, French intellectuals debated the
nature of changes in western Civilization as Jan. 1, 1901
approached. (The French elite remained fastidious about a century
actually having 100 years.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Thank God for Y2K. Before we modernists get too smug about
Dennis the Short's bad math, it should be remembered that a group
of Dennis the Menaces who created the first computers were a couple
of digits short. They programed their inventions to count the year
2000 as 00 _ or is that 1900? Without the Y2K debate, Miller
speculates that we only would take a bemused, detached notice of
the millennium's passing. Not now.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 12:00 midnight on Dec. 31, 1999, something real is going to
happen,'' Miller says. ``The clocks in those computers are going
either to turn over or they are not. And I bet you most of us are
going to be awake to see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller says society's response will teach us more about
ourselves than just the turning of a millennium would have.
</P>
<P>
   2. Panic is possible. Miller says he fears less that the
computers won't work than that the news media will. Looking for the
next big story, the news media may focus too much on any glitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K will then become a story that feeds on itself,'' Miller
says.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe that Americans can't panic easily. Miller points
to Orson Welles' 1938 radio broadcast of ``The War of the Worlds.''
Thousands sought refuge in cellars, jammed highways and tied up
telephone lines when they wrongly thought the dramatic program was
real news coverage of a Martian invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mass panic in a society tied together as firmly as we are
could get real messy real quick,'' Miller says.
</P>
<P>
   1. Stop the presses. In the end, all we may have are these lists
of the greatest this and the greatest that of the past 1,000 years.
If the computers work, the millennium may be poured out as quickly
as flat champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting bored with it,'' Millers insists.
</P>
<P>
   But he can't resist telling his audience of a cable channel's
designation of ``Person of the Millennium'' out of 100 nominees.
According to A&AMP;E, the Biography Channel, it's Johann Gutenberg, a
German printer who reputedly was the first European to print with
movable type.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares?'' challenges Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, professor, Gutenberg is a no-brainer. Have you ever tried
to do a list without a printing press?

   Part Two of a six-part investigative series by The Dayton Daily
News on the the recent rise in military air crashes and their
causes. The Daily News found that the U.S. military routinely sends
planes and helicopters in the air that it knows are plagued with
deadly safety problems. The series is based in part on
never-before-seen information from three databases from the Army,
Navy and Air Force safety centers.

   CRASH-METAL _ A type of metal is in the middle of an
investigation involving a series of crashes of the Army's CH47
Chinook helicopter. The story came to light when a whistle-blower,
working at a former factory in Springfield, Ohio, found flaws in a
metal used to construct gears that power the helicopter's huge
rotor blades. Investigators now suspect that seven crashes may be
linked to the metal. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News) MOVED

   MISS-MILLENNIUM _ AUSTIN, Texas _ We missed the millennium, UT
Prof Howard Miller reminds us. Historians differ on when Christ was
born, but the most generally accepted date, historian Miller says
is minus-4 BC. That means we should have celebrated in 1996. Or in
2001. Anyway, Dec. 31, 1999 is definitely not the dawn of a new
millennium. But Miller, who has made a study of such things, says
that popular culture has taken a hold of this and that, along with
the Y2K computer bug and religious-based jitters about the end of
the millennium, has everyone in this tizzy. A step-back look at
what is about to befall us. (Copelin, Austin American-Statesman)

 &HT;    Ham operators dwindling
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There's a worldwide shortage of hams.
</P>
<P>
   Not those canned pork products, and not theater bugs, but rather
those amateur radio enthusiasts who, during emergencies, are often
the only links to ravaged areas.
</P>
<P>
   Augie Schwab has seen his friends, one by one, set aside their
radio equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of ham equipment sitting around not being
used,'' said the 77-year-old ham enthusiast, who lives near Boynton
Beach. He said one son dabbled in ham radio three decades ago but
none of his children or grandchildren is interested now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not replenishing'' the ranks of ham operators, Schwab
said.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely culprit: the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage was brought home in September when Hurricane Floyd
threatened South Florida. A local volunteer group comprised of area
ham clubs that normally staffs storm shelters didn't have enough
operators to go around. Ham radio operators become crucial when
telephone lines go down, providing links between shelters and
administration and emergency operations centers. Radio Amateur
Civil Emergency Service, which uses the acronym RACES, coordinates
with emergency managers before hurricane season to staff shelters.
</P>
<P>
   County officials, police and paramedics rely on ham radio
operators at shelters when telephone lines are swamped or go down.
They also can become the only links to Caribbean islands hit by
storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly concerned about it,'' Palm Beach County
Emergency Manager Bill O'Brien said of the shortage. ``The hams are
basically the last-ditch communications with the shelters.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergency operations center is offering to let RACES leaders
use Palm Beach County equipment to train ham operators so they can
qualify as volunteers, O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton blames the overall drop in the numbers of ham operators
on demographics and technology.
</P>
<P>
   First, the hobby of amateur radios dates back several decades,
and the median age of hobbyists is over 50, so many of its
enthusiasts are getting older or have died, Hamilton said. Also,
many of those retirees had lived in mobile homes, so they planned
on being the first to evacuate and were the first to volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hamilton said, many have moved into retirement villages or
even nursing homes and probably would stay. Younger people joining
the hobby often must balance demands of career and family, he said.
And younger retirees _ along with the general population _ are now
moving away from ham radio, once the only way to talk to people
around the world for free, and toward its successor: the Internet,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ham radio is the original information superhighway, the
original World Wide Web,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Hagy, spokeswoman for the Amateur Radio Relay League,
isn't ready to blame it all on the Internet. But she did say that
membership in the group, which dates back to 1914, has steadily
risen each year to an all-time high of 175,000 in January 1997, but
then dropped to the 163,000 it is now. That's about the same time
when the Internet exploded into popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Hagy believes hams still love the challenge of amateur radio
that the Internet can't provide _ ``being able to throw a wire up
in your back yard and not know who you're going to reach and how
far you're going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   She believes a greater factor is that there are more hobbies and
distractions today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many different things to interest people,'' Hagy
said from the organization's headquarters near Hartford, Conn.
``There's a million different groups and organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Augie Schwab is convinced the Internet is responsible. Many of
his friends ``have minimized their activity on ham radio and
maximized their activity on the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The native of New York's Long Island, who ran an import business
until he retired and moved to Florida in 1989, was a radio operator
in World War II in Africa and built his first ham radio in 1955. He
is Indian Springs' hurricane emergency coordinator and still enjoys
reaching fellow hams around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it will ever die out together,'' Schwab said.
``I just think there will be fewer hams worldwide.''-

roughly as many political causes is making a concerted effort to

 &HT;    COLLEGE PRESIDENTS TOLD TO REVAMP TEACHER TRAINING
 &HT;    275&AMP;adds
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ College presidents should put their own houses in
order by improving or eliminating their teacher education programs,
according to a new report from the influential American Council on
Education.
</P>
<P>
   More public school students, especially in big cities, would be
taught by highly qualified teachers within five to 10 years if the
council's plan is widely adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public expects colleges and universities to prepare
teachers who are knowledgeable about what they teach and proficient
in how they teach,'' says the report, to be mailed Monday to the
presidents of some 1,800 colleges and universities who belong to
the council. ``College presidents must take the lead in fulfilling
this expectation,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
   Many post-secondary institutions see teacher education as
profitable, but marginal programs ``to be treated with benign
neglect,'' the report said. It warned that the reputation of an
institution will suffer unless its teacher education program is
either ``moved to the center _ or moved out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The report is right on target,'' said Sandra Feldman,
president of the American Federation of Teachers. ``The reforms it
calls for are long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   Education Secretary Richard Riley, who summoned dozens of
college presidents to Washington last month to nudge them into
taking a bigger role in public school reforms, said he hopes they
will implement the new report.
</P>
<P>
   The report was prepared by the council's Task Force on Teacher
Education. Dominated by college presidents and chancellors, the
36-member task force also included a sprinkling of academic
leaders, school superintendents and state education officials.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional adds follow)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The task force was blunt in spelling out signs that the teacher
preparation at the council's colleges and universities isn't up to
snuff:
</P>
<P>
   _ Too many teachers aren't competent to teach their assigned
subjects or to apply technology to teaching.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most education departments operate on their own, without
academic quality control. They don't seek outside review or
accreditation and don't get supervision from their parent
institution or cooperation from its other departments, such as
those within colleges of arts and sciences.
</P>
<P>
   _ Too many teacher education programs aren't coordinated with
the community colleges that feed in many of their applicants, or
with the school systems in which their graduates will work.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most education majors who become middle or high school
teachers have only average academic records, and those who become
elementary teachers have poorer academic records than their peers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only two-thirds of education graduates go immediately into
teaching, and half of all new teachers leave the profession within
five years.
</P>
<P>
   The report placed part of the blame on public schools. The
schools, it found, offer low teacher salaries, hire uncertified
teachers and assign unqualified teachers to more than half the math
and science classes in middle and high schools. It also criticized
federal government for not spending more on research into how to
better teach teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But the vast bulk of the report called for the college
presidents to clean up their own school's problems.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the presidents were advised to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mandate a campus-wide review of the quality of students,
faculty, courses and accountability of their teacher education
program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Obtain public, independent appraisals of their teacher
education program at regular intervals from a national accrediting
body or an outside ``board of visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Require the arts and science faculty and the education faculty
to coordinate their curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   _ Craft agreements that mesh their education courses with those
at other colleges and universities, because most of today's
students transfer schools at least once.
</P>
<P>
   _ Create programs to support, monitor and mentor their recent
graduates, and strengthen professional development programs for
experienced teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report tracks what we've been doing and saying'' at the
nation's largest teacher union, said spokeswoman Kathleen Lyons at
the National Education Association. But, she said, ``the one thing
that's missing is any reference to NCATE.''
</P>
<P>
   NCATE, the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher
Education, is an established organization whose supporters include
the NEA. It accredits nearly half of the nation's 1,200 schools of
teacher education.
</P>
<P>
   Most don't seek accreditation, but a few dozen are considering
accreditation by a new rival group in which teachers would have
less of a say.

DESPITE THE INTERNET, DIRECT-MAIL MARKETERS GROW EVEN MORE
PROLIFIC
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Md., Ill.)  (nk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``check'' is in the mail. So too are the ``important
national survey,'' the ``Priority Express Gram'' and other
``time-sensitive material'' that is ``personal and confidential''
as well as ``extremely urgent.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the phrase ``You've got mail'' evokes images of
virtual correspondence, the old-fashioned, ink-and-paper
counterpart _ replete with the plethora of puffery quoted above _
is alive and well as marketers keep waging war on consumers'
mailboxes.
</P>
<P>
   The barrage of letters, catalogs and brochures that typifies the
advertising medium known as direct mail continues unabated,
peddling everything from magazines and computers to apparel and
political candidates. Alive and well? That's an understatement _
and something you rarely find in direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, direct mail, still widely dismissed with the sobriquet
``junk mail,'' is proliferating faster than it did before the
Internet, climbing to 44 percent of all pieces of mail handled last
year by the post office from 41 percent a decade ago and 32 percent
in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming an information-loaded world and there's a
minimal amount of attention span,'' said Barbara Weckstein
Kaplowitz, editor of The DeLay Letter in Potomac, Md., a
publication that covers the direct marketing industry. ``But direct
mail is still working for many marketers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Direct Marketing Association, the industry's
trade organization, direct mail generated $421.2 million in sales
last year, an increase of 8 percent from $390 million in 1997 _ and
a gain of 62 percent from $260.2 million as recently as 1992. The
average compound annual growth rate of direct mail, at 8.4 percent
from 1992 through 1997, is projected to accelerate to 8.6 percent
from 1997 through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``If direct mailers go back to people who asked two years ago to
be removed from their lists and say, `We have something new; would
you like to hear about it?,' those are the best responders,'' Ms.
Kaplowitz said. ``They realize they miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most consumers, weary of the battle of the bulging mailbox _ and
disgusted with materials they deem misleading from companies trying
to sell magazine subscriptions _ might say they would miss getting
direct mail the way they would miss getting bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me started!,'' warned Bob Bulmash, founder and
president of Private Citizen Inc., in Naperville, Ill., an
organization that fights what he considers the considerable
excesses of direct mailers and telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junk mail is not going to slow down,'' Bulmash asserted. ``As
long as a marketing channel is there, it will continue to be
abused.''
</P>
<P>
   Those in the industry would take issue with that castigation.
Direct mail was once ``pretty intrusive,'' acknowledged Howard
Draft, chairman and chief executive at Draft Worldwide in Chicago,
the world's largest direct marketing agency. ``But now we're trying
to understand what a consumer's needs are and create an
invitational approach.''
</P>
<P>
   His agency, a unit of the  &UR; Interpublic Group  &LR; of Companies,
creates direct marketing campaigns for giant advertisers like
American Express, Compaq Computer, General Motors and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, direct mail seeks to communicate with consumers
who have bought a product in the first place,'' Draft said, ``to
build loyalty to encourage future purchases.'' That approach, meant
to keep the most profitable customers and minimize or even shed the
less lucrative ones, is a departure from the industry's onetime
ploy of blanketing consumers with mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of mass mailings, which used to be the rule, has
become the exception,'' said Ian Baer, recently named president of
the Chicago office of Rapp Collins Worldwide, the agency owned by
 &UR; Omnicom Group &LR;  that handles direct marketing assignments for a
client roster that includes the online retail operations of Barnes
&AMP; Noble, Pfizer, the U.S. Navy and Western Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans receive more unsolicited mail than any other people
in the world,'' Baer said. ``They're jaded. They lack the time and
patience and inclination to go through mail they didn't ask for.
</P>
<P>
   ``So to get them to open a piece of mail, we have to take our
efforts to a whole new level of relevancy,'' he added, ``because
with all the clutter, people will focus only on what they consider
most relevant to them.''
</P>
<P>
   To make direct mail more relevant _ and thus more effective _
advertisers and agencies are intensifying their efforts to
customize the pitches they send consumers. The aim: to deliver
pleas as personalized and tailored as possible to appeal to the
intended recipients and minimize the anger generated by receiving
unwanted, unnecessary communication.
</P>
<P>
   That is, needless to say, also the goal of Internet marketing,
which many experts describe as an updated, high-technology version
of direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common phrase we're hearing is that the Internet is
`direct marketing on steroids,''' said H. Robert Wientzen,
president and chief executive of the Direct Marketing Association,
which is based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet allows targeting in a more efficient way,'' he
added, ``but ink on paper still provides a sensory experience and
still does a good job.
</P>

   ``The secret is to build a relationship by providing people with
relevant information,'' said Wientzen, who is in Toronto this week
at the association's 82nd annual conference and exhibition, which
15,000 people are expected to attend. ``The fact we're growing at
more than twice the rate of retail sales says the consumer
appreciates the efficiency and convenience of shopping at a
distance.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The computer technology that makes the Internet possible is also
helping direct marketers in their quest for the grail of relevancy
by making it easier than ever to compile extensive information
about consumers before any mail is sent.
</P>
<P>
   ```Data mining' is the term _ collecting, over time, information
that allows you to figure out what people want and like and do,''
Wientzen said. ``Our path in the information age is finding the
ability to market to niches, which was never economically feasible
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The data miners gather their information from the consumers
themselves, poring over records of what was already bought and
ordered: how recently, how frequently, how much was spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch what happens when you can accurately match an e-mail
address to a street address,'' said Ms. Kaplowitz, the newsletter
editor. ``They'll know not only how you act in the mail but how you
act online.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And direct mailers comb through data from outside sources like
mailing lists, postal records, government agencies and other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're doing is using information we have on our customers,
with overlays of demographic or psychographic information, to
enhance our knowledge of them and market back to them,'' said Draft
of Draft Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data bases are being used to target customers who really
have a need for a product,'' he added. ``What brings results today
is the unique selling proposition you're making to make the
consumer want this product.''
</P>
<P>
   Baer at Rapp Collins offered an example for a client, Western
Union, which differentiates campaigns aimed at Spanish-speaking
customers based on their countries of origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dominican-Americans are more established, often
second-generation, sending money to relatives back home,'' Baer
said, ``while Colombian-Americans are more likely to be
first-generation, sending money back to their families and then
going back themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates complain that data mining is more
insidious, the marketing equivalent of strip mining.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to fight back,'' Bulmash of Private Citizen said,
offering these tactics: ``Keep your name and phone number off all
documents, as best you can. Don't fill out sweepstakes cards. Don't
subscribe to magazines; buy them on the newsstand. Don't list your
address in the phone book.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers seeking to have their names removed from mailing lists
can do so by sending their names, home addresses and signatures to:
Mail Preference Service, Direct Marketing Association, P.O. Box
9008, Farmingdale, N.Y. 11735-9008. (Yes, you must use the mail to
reduce the mail; about 3.4 million people have registered to date.)
</P>
<P>
   The association, sensitive to the rising tide of complaints, has
strengthened its privacy policies, with stipulations called the
Privacy Promise to American Consumers taking effect July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all industries, we do have shady operators who push the
line too far,'' said Weintzen, adding: ``We don't want to lose the
trust of the American people. If people don't like what you do,
they don't buy from you.''
</P>
<P>
   The new policies did not impress Bulmash, who dismissed them as
toothless because they involve the industry regulating itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dog says, `I'll be good,' but he's not going to hit himself
with a stick if he's bad,'' Bulmash said. ``You've got to teach him
to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Other protests are being heard from the advertising research
industry, which is furious about a venerable direct mail gimmick:
cloaking a pitch as a survey, pretending that the purpose of a
letter is to seek opinions rather than sell a product or raise
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sham, it's dishonest and it does the survey-research
business a tremendous disservice,'' said Jim Spaeth, president of
the Advertising Research Foundation in New York. ``Refusals to
participate in legitimate surveys have been rising slowly and this
certainly is a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drives me crazy is sometimes these are organizations I'm
a member of and believe in,'' he added, referring to the
fund-raisers that sell under the guise of research. The foundation
even has a name for such trickery, ``frugging''; there's also
``sugging,'' for selling under the guise of research.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There's one consolation for consumers tired of make-believe
surveys, envelopes festooned with starbursts and addressed with
simulated handwriting and letters with underlined sentences and a
``P.S.'' at the end that looks to be an afterthought but isn't.
Those gimmicks are likely to begin fading away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we put material out there, that's the client's
brand in the home,'' said Draft of Draft Worldwide. ``You will not
see the kind of clients we work with allow us to negatively affect
the work they're doing in their general brand advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starbursts, underlining, the `P.S.' _ those don't affect
results that much,'' he added. ``If you come up with the big idea,
the big offer, that's what drives business.''

SCHEDULING WOES END FOR `N.Y.P.D. BLUE' 
WRESTLING IS MAKING UPN A COMPETITOR  
 TIME PLANS TO BREAK ITS NEWS-ONLY SHELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under pressure from the news media, fans and the outspoken
executive producer Steven Bochco, ABC Entertainment executives had
to make an almost Solomonic decision about whether the perennial
hit ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' should be knocked from its longtime slot on
Tuesday at 10 p.m. in favor of a promising new drama, the
touchy-feely ``Once and Again.'' They came up with what all sides
described as the best possible solution to the scheduling problem.
</P>
<P>
   Stu Bloomberg, the chairman of ABC Entertainment, announced on
Friday that, starting in January, ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' would be back
on Tuesday at 10, and `'Once and Again,'' which had played there
this fall, would move to Mondays at 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' was supposed to move back in November, but ABC
had considered moving it elsewhere to keep ``Once and Again'' on
Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg said, ``It just took some time to find the smartest
possible schedule.'' He noted that pushing ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' back
to a January start date meant the series would be able to run for
the rest of the television season without repeats. The show has
never repeated well.
</P>
<P>
   Bochco also pointed out that ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' now would face
repeats on other networks in March and April. Without repeats and
facing weaker competition, ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' stands an excellent
chance of scoring an improved overall rating for the season. ``It
may be a blessing in disguise,'' Bochco said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he made it clear that he had been extremely unhappy about
ABC's considering a move for his show.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg said ABC had only been concerned about fashioning the
best possible schedule and he denied that ABC's wrestling with the
decision had anything to do with a desire to protect ``Once and
Again'' because the network's parent company, Walt Disney, had an
ownership stake in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Bochco, however, said, ``I can't believe that wasn't a factor,''
adding that he understood the nature of the television business
today demands that companies try to protect shows in which they
have a financial interest.

   Wrestling Is Making UPN a Competitor
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' may have been the most talked about, most publicized
and most debated new show of the television season, but when put in
the ring against a bunch of big, sweaty wrestlers, the new Fox
comedy has found itself slammed into submission.
</P>
<P>
   As it has so many times before, a wrestling program has defied
all expectations and proved to be a potent draw for young men. And
it has happened on the fledgling network, UPN, which was widely
being written off last year at this time as the one network too
many for the broadcasting industry.
</P>
<P>
   UPN's ``Smackdown,'' a weekly two-hour extravaganza of
wrestling, has so buried the new, heavily promoted Fox comedy that
it might soon be retitled ``In-Action.'' Last Thursday,
``Smackdown'' had its best rating ever, finishing third among six
networks, while ``Action'' fell to a level usually reserved for the
shows that do not make it on WB or UPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action,'' the comedy about a mean-spirited, high-strung
Hollywood producer, came in sixth and dead last among the six
networks on Thursday nights at 9 p.m. to 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened to ``Action'' would seem to be directly
related to how successful ``Smackdown'' has been for UPN. Fox, a
unit of the News Corp., consciously scheduled the comedy where it
did because last year the network had enormous success running
male-oriented specials like ``World's Scariest Police Chases.''
</P>
<P>
   But wrestling has spoiled all those plans. While UPN has been
recording increases in that time slot of 755 percent among male
teen-agers and 375 percent among men between the ages of 18 and 34,
Fox has seen its ratings drop every week. ``Family Guy'' was yanked
from the air after just two weeks, and ``Action'' was left to fight
alone, with two episodes (one a repeat) facing off against
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale, according to Fox executives, was that ``Action''
appealed to a more sophisticated audience than wrestling. Perhaps
so, but since when did Fox aim for the PBS audience?
</P>
<P>
   Now Fox executives have announced they will pull the comedy for
November, a ratings sweep month when the numbers are even more
important for the networks and their affiliated stations. It will
be back in December.

   Time Plans to Break Its News-Only Shell &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The future of the weekly news magazine may not lie in, well,
reporting weekly news. Beginning next Monday, in five special
issues whose theme is the future, Time magazine will publish a
serialized novel by Caleb Carr, a writer of historical thrillers.
Bertelsmann's Random House is currently negotiating with Carr to
publish the book in the fall of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Isaacson, Time's managing editor, and James Kelly, the
deputy managing editor, said they were fans of Carr's novels, both
of which _ ``The Alienist'' and ``The Angel of Darkness'' _ have
been set in the past. ``Walter and I decided it would be really
cool for a novelist to write a fiction series for us, just like in
Dickens' day, but about the future,'' Kelly said. He said that
Time, a Time Warner unit, had published excerpts from fiction
before, but had never published an entire novel in serial form.
</P>
<P>
   David Abrahamson, a professor of media studies at Northwestern
University's Medill School of Journalism, said he could not
remember the last time a weekly news magazine had published
serialized fiction. ``You'd have to go back two or three decades,
and you'd have to be somewhat generous in your definition of a news
weekly,'' Abrahamson said. ``You'd have to include things like Look
or Life or The Saturday Evening Post.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone of Carr's novel is decidedly more Raymond Chandler
than, say, Margaret Carlson, Time's political columnist. The first
chapter introduces the aggrieved widow of a media titan: ``From the
first it was obvious that she was deeply upset, and I tried to be
as gentle as possible as I led her to a chair. She asked in a
hushed tone if I was indeed Dr. Gideon Wolfe; assured that I was,
she informed me that she was Mrs. Vera Price, and I recalled
instantly that she was the wife of a certain John Price, who'd been
one of the theme-park industry's leading special-effects wizards
until he'd been murdered outside his New York apartment building a
few days earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr said he did not expect ``New Yorker-style'' literary
fiction to appear in Time.
</P>
<P>
   But with the proliferation of news on television and the
Internet, Carr said, ``news itself is now so immediately available
and disposable that if you are a news weekly, to stay vital and
exciting you need to add elements that can't necessarily be found
anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, `` What's nice about fiction is that it is keeping the
lines clear. You're not publishing speculation, or a mix of fact
and fiction. You just say, `We're going to publish fiction as a way
of drawing readers to the magazine.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Given people's attention spans and the amount of time they can
devote, I think it's appropriate for installment fiction to make a
return right now,'' Carr said. ``And there are a lot of people who
are too smart or too grown-up to read comic books, but who don't
want to pick up a 500-page novel in an airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said it was premature to predict whether Time would
publish more serialized fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's wait and see Chapter Two,'' he said.

<P>
   FRANKFURT AN DER ODER, Germany _ Four years ago, Gabriela
Mendling came here to Germany's ``Far East.'' She trawled streets
with names like Salvador Allende and Karl Marx in search of a home.
A physiotherapist, she searched vainly for a job. She observed, she
listened, in growing amazement. Finally she decided to write _ and
the storm broke.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, she was the most hated ``Wessi,'' or westerner, in
town. Her car was sprayed with paint. Her husband's Mercedes was
scratched. Her son was taunted at school. Threatening phone calls
poured in. ``A simple-minded racist,'' says Henry-Martin Klemt, a
local writer. For Peter Edelmann, the deputy mayor, ``She is a
liar.''
</P>
<P>
   The source of Ms. Mendling's notoriety is a book called
``Neuland'' (``New Land''), published this summer. Its subtitle is
``Very Simple Stories''; it is scarcely profound. But its daily
chronicle of the difficulties of a west German woman in adapting to
the formerly Communist east does bring the problems of German unity
down to basics.
</P>
<P>
   Such basics include lasagne _ poked at suspiciously by
``Ossis,'' or easterners, clearly new to the dish Ms. Mendling has
prepared. And Christmas carols: There are none at the ``Christmas
Gala'' in the city hall. And attitudes: Ms. Mendling finds she is
treated with contempt for seeking a job as a ``Wessi'' while so
many ``Ossis'' are unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   When the Berlin Wall came down a decade ago, east German
demonstrators quickly adjusted their chant from ``We are the
people'' to ``We are one people.'' The cry had a ring to it but, as
Ms. Mendling has found, it was an illusion. While the economies of
east and west have moved closer, a psychological gulf has remained
_ even widened.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 percent of west Germans have never traveled to the
former east, recent surveys suggest. At the same time, ``ostalgie''
_ nostalgia for the old East Germany _ has spread among the former
citizens of what was probably the most spied-on state in history,
with its 6 million state security files for 17 million inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   The nostalgia is rarely so acute as to involve a desire for the
return of Germany's little police state, but equally it is seldom
entirely absent.
</P>
<P>
   Memory, of course, is selective and what is remembered now is
this: There were jobs for everyone, even if they did not amount to
much, and time for friendships, and a sense of solidarity, of
community, of a life beyond ``me.'' Even the Communist bicycles
(when available) were more solid, some say. And the free day-care
centers were wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   As for the state security service, or Stasi, with its 125 miles
of stacked-up files and its informers in just about every family,
it has gone, as completely as the ``Anti-Fascist Protective
Rampart,'' or Wall. So it is natural enough to dwell on the
aggressiveness of the ``elbow society'' in the west, rather than
the oppression of east German society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always felt I was the focus of every disappointment
with the west, right down to the better wheelbarrows they say they
had before,'' said Ms. Mendling, a clear-eyed woman seemingly far
too mild to have emerged as the ogre on the Oder. ``From the start
I was a foreigner, and intolerance of foreigners in the east is
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   That intolerance, expressed in the rise of far-right fringe
movements, appears rooted in a deep frustration. Unlike Poles or
Hungarians, East Germans were not able to reshape a post-Communist
state themselves. Rather, their country was taken over by West
Germany _ ``a second Anschluss,'' as Gunter Grass, the author, put
it, recalling the annexation of Austria by Nazi troops in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   That formulation is an extreme one; no army marched into East
Berlin and there is nothing inherently sinister about a united
Germany. But the takeover _of industry, of education, of the
welfare system _ was sweeping, leaving many east Germans today with
the sense that whatever was good about their society was tossed out
with the bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of a `third way', of a better socialist society,
got lost in all Helmut Kohl's euphoria about blooming landscapes in
the east,'' said Elmar Braehler, a professor at Leipzig University.
``Well, the blooms came late if at all, and many east Germans
simply found themselves feeling inferior in an unfamiliar system.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mendling, aged 39, decided to pack her bags and move from
the Ruhr town of Wuppertal in the west after her husband, a
gynecologist, was offered a top job at the hospital in this eastern
town in 1995. Her great-grandmother had hailed from Prussia; the
eastern part of Germany held a strong appeal for her.
</P>
<P>
   But as the experiences of her fictional alter-ego, Frau Hitzig,
illustrate, the reception on the Polish border, in a town with few
other ``Wessis,'' is scarcely heartwarming. The director of one
physiotherapy center obliges her to take a course ``so you will
adapt to our collective''; even then she does not get a job.
</P>
<P>
   As a ``Wessi'' in a town with an 18.6 percent unemployment rate,
she soon concludes that she should not expect work. After all, as
she is repeatedly told, an electronics plant that once provided
state-of-the-art components to communist Bulgaria has been closed
with the loss of almost 8,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The book hammers away at people with funny accents _ they all
say ``ick'' instead of ``ich'' (pronounced ``ISCH'') for ``I'' and
pronounce ``g'' as if it were ``j'' _ and at the funny things they
seem to do, like half-fixing a toilet before leaving a bucket to
get by with until the repair is completed three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Frau Hitzig tries to get involved in the community.
Preparing a party, she goes to buy wine, but finds only sweet
Bulgarian or Hungarian plonk and is met with incredulity when she
requests a dry French wine. ``You're the first customer to ask for
it,'' says a shopkeeper who apparently hopes she will also be the
last.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A pre-Christmas party for spouses of doctors at her husband's
hospital turns into a fiasco. Until the last moment, invitations
for a meal at a pizzeria are not answered. Then nobody seems to
know what to order _ until Frau Hitzig asks for a vegetarian pizza
and all the guests, sheeplike, follow suit as if vegetarian pizza
were the new official doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   When conversation does strike up at last, it turns unpleasant as
one woman, a doctor herself, says she could never bring herself to
harass privately insured patients to pay their bills as ``they do
in the west without batting an eye.'' Frau Hitzig cannot restrain
herself: ``Do you really think everyone in the west is an
unscrupulous exploiter?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mendling says everything related in the book is true.
Indeed, it began as a series of letters relating her experiences to
a friend in Wuppertal. ``When I realized Ossis and Wessis were
growing further apart, I had to illustrate that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The book, published with a modest first-print run of 1,500
copies, caused little stir until two local writers _ Hans-Joachim
Nauschutz and Klemt _ came across it and were outraged. Nauschutz
called for a boycott of the book, and Klemt published a poem in a
local paper parodying Ms. Mendling's view of the primitive
``Ossi''.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a strange hard Eastman,'' the poem begins. ``I smoke on
the toilet, I eat with a hammer and sickle and drive a convertible
made from a Russian tank and an old MiG. I am a strange hard
Eastman, I have a dirty look.''
</P>
<P>
   It continues: ``I am a strange hard Eastman. I wear a bear skin
and play the balalaika until the first morning light. Then I go
hunting for Wessis, and if you come close to me _ I am a strange
hard Eastman _ you'll die in the Taiga.''
</P>
<P>
   After the poem appeared, the anti-Mendling campaign began in
earnest. Her 12-year-old son was regularly mocked at school as a
``Wessi-idiot.'' Neighbors refused to look at her.
</P>
<P>
   A pamphlet was circulated at her husband's hospital advertising
``a basic course on the use of knives and forks for beginners
offered by the wonderful Gabriela Mendling (specially imported from
the West).''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Klemt said the problem with the book was that it was stupid and
racist. ``To treat another culture as intrinsically inferior to
yours is a form of racism,'' he argued. ``She speaks high German,
and everyone else speaks slang. She eats right, and everyone else
eats wrong. She dresses well, and everyone else looks like an
idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   What Ms. Mendling failed to grasp or illustrate, he continued,
were the roots of the attitudes in a place like Frankfurt an der
Oder. Of course, jobs had been lost. But what was lost was more
than jobs because in East Germany employment also brought free
theater tickets, a vacation spot, social events _ indeed the entire
framework of the socialist good life.
</P>
<P>
   So people feel lost, faced suddenly with responsibilities they
were not educated to assume; exposed to newcomers jetting in to buy
up things or run them before jetting out again for the weekend;
unable to orient themselves in a society based on risk and
achievement rather than security and conformity.
</P>
<P>
   ``And people with narrow horizons who cannot solve their
problems look for their Jew, or their Turk _ or their Wessi,''
Klemt said. ``That is stupidity, and Ms. Mendling has been a victim
of it in these attacks on her family. I am against these attacks,
of course, but I also loathe her dumb superiority.''
</P>
<P>
   The furor over the book, featured recently on German television,
has boosted sales, and it is now in its fifth printing. Ms.
Mendling, who used the pseudonym of Luise Endlich for ``Neuland,''
says the spraying of her car and the taunting of her son only
confirmed that ``this is a place with many primitive attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   The author intends to stay to see if this town on the Oder will
change and whether the new buildings now sprouting are accompanied
``by the more critical changes in people's heads.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps part of Germany's problem is that the changes
westerners expect are not necessarily those that easterners want.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not against unity,'' Klemt said, ``but the cost was high.
I still have the dream of a new solution, a different way, with
social justice. Today I have freedom and a nice apartment, but I
work too much, sleep too little, and feel that a slower life is
more in tune with our basic human instincts.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Now and then my father would walk me down Market Street and
Church Street to visit his mother's home, either to show me off
like some chub or pike he had caught on one of his fishing
expeditions or, more likely, to let me watch his four sisters and
four brothers lying around reading books, oblivious of the workaday
world but kept going by the beef sandwiches his mother plied them
with all day. I was 8, perhaps, and they, he said, were shiftless.
</P>
<P>
   Myself, I thought they were rather splendid, content to spend
the day getting from one chapter to the next. (They read slowly,
sometimes in a murmur.) They read adventure and romances, nothing
heavy, though my father had read some Conrad and Dickens. But he,
in his way, a one-eyed war veteran, was more imposing than they
were, since every book was a continual out-of-focus effort. He
preferred books he had read before. Coming from this print-hungry
family, he had joined the Army to escape, and he now surveyed them
all with his most sardonic military air: This was what he had been
mutilated for, defending against the German hordes.
</P>
<P>
   I linger on this ritual because later, in my undergraduate days,
I discovered the Castle of Indolence and at once recognized it as 7
Church Row, where so long as you read, you were exempt from menial
chores. From my father's siblings I gleaned the seeds of the
contemplative life, the craving for a dream that shut the rest of
the world out, the importance of the waterfall of images in my own
head. Feeling at least as different from others as my father did
with his wobbling gait and watery eye, I knew that lolling about
and listening to my own mind, or to it in the act of engaging
another's, I was creating the foundation for _ what?
</P>
<P>
   I wrote short stories about New Zealand fighter pilots who
always survived against the Hun in the sun, as my model Cobber Cain
had not. Those early stories have not survived either, but I recall
installing in them, strangely enough, some echoes of my aunts' and
uncles' literary indolence. The pilots felt at peace in the high
altitudes, even when floating down by parachute after losing a
dogfight. It was wartime after all, and a young nascent writer was
bound to gather his dominant images from what, besides spent
rounds, buzzed around him.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense I had reproduced my father's margin of peace or ivory
tower. Even while firing his Vickers machine gun or ducking
shrapnel, he had calmed himself by murmuring the high-pitched
orisons of monks heard I knew not where. (Gregorian chant, I
guessed.)
</P>
<P>
   It took me a long time, until my second novel, many years after
my boyhood visits to Church Row, to realize that the indolence, the
dream, the unconnectedness that seemed my heritage from my father's
family, was the foundry where the novelist's work gets done, at
least started; where unbidden trouvailles sprout up like pewits
from a marsh, and structures lumber into view to support several
chapters later on.
</P>
<P>
   All I learned was that you had to give in to it, surrender even,
reserving no moral or rational right to inspect the yield. I, who
have always been able to sit for hours watching the sea or even the
plains (from a high window in some Ramada), have managed to come up
with grateful names for this fecund hinterland, most recently ``the
invisible riviera of the visible world.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not, some 20 novels later, quite a matter of switching on
the spell, the tumult, the dream. I have to sit there at the
keyboard and wait until the fantastic cavalcade of gorgeous brutes
begins to come past my inward eye, and my evolution in their
presence renews, my ransacking and extrapolating them begins. The
blood pressure rises. The world disappears only to re-emerge from
the kaleidoscope of tease. I feel lucky, on gentle terms with the
Furies who goad me to be myself.
</P>
<P>
   So the actual prose, a few phrases apart that simply swoop in,
could not be more Apollonian, coldly designed; but what it evinces
sometimes has a potent, mythic, even barbaric quality that makes me
grope for such a word as anthropological. Quite recently, as I
busied myself with what some would think an un-American activity,
the novella, this one ``about'' Hitler as a failing/ failed art
student in Vienna, some renegade piece of my mind began intoning
anti-Hitler doggerel over the rhythms and patterns of the main
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   My novella attempts to explore the gentle impulse that led to
gross, despotic violence and is serious, ironic, caustic stuff. The
stanzas that came to mind were different, yet served no doubt as
disdainful counterpoint. Perhaps Brecht would have understood this
twitch of alienation effect:
</P>
<P>
   (Begin italics)
</P>
<P>
   There was a young man from Vienna
</P>
<P>
   Who washed out his body with senna.
</P>
<P>
   He came out so thin,
</P>
<P>
   They sheathed him in tin,
</P>
<P>
   And now use him as an antenna.
</P>
<P>
   (End italics)
</P>
<P>
   The other bits of doggerel are different. All will make their
way into the final text, worked in by a surreptitious hand. I base
my decision on my feeling that the fable's manger is sometimes at
least as interesting as the fable itself.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme I have two-thirds done of a 3,000-page
novel conceived in defiance and written in joy. I have discussed
this monster with only two people: an American publisher who
without boning up can discourse on Hermann Broch's ``Death of
Virgil,'' and my French publisher. The first blinked not and said
only, ``If you do it in paperback, the back will break.'' The
second said: ``Why not? Look at Proust. You do. Eh bien.''
</P>
<P>
   I write daily on a Smith Corona SL 580 from midnight to 2,
mostly to the sounds of classical music, no doubt a throwback to my
mother's constant pianoforte cocooning me from the first, even in
the womb. I respond best to piano music, so there must be something
in my theory.
</P>
<P>
   I had never realized that, say, 350 mornings times three pages
approximates 1,000. It doesn't feel like much effort or much prose.
If you have spent years delivering a weekly essay, as I did, this
is more or less the way your mind works. I have always been able to
sense the rhythm of the next five sentences and sometimes, so as
not to lose it, chant it out in pseudo-language. If I felt like a
freak as a child, imagine how much of a freak I feel now.
</P>
<P>
   I should have heeded my mother and learned to play the piano,
learned to read music. I suppose I have always felt an unpaid debt
to her, a loving obeisance not made, in putting words in place of
notes, to the woman who taught me grammar at her knee and indeed
initiated me, for so long as I would listen, to the ingenuities of
theory and harmony. I took what I needed from both sides of the
family, never to complain. I am, by proxy, a product of the
trenches and the Royal College of Music, vintage of Hubert Parry. I
stay up long enough, usually, to correct what I've written, and on
occasion to carve it up, then go to bed with that elated shiver of
tasteful butchery well done.
</P>
<P>
   If there is nowadays a backlash against fiction for not dealing
with ``the real world,'' such poppycock, then I deduce it's a
backlash against imagination, which puts before the mind what was
not there before. If we ever lose our awe before this complex
emanation from the personality, then we will indeed be ready for
the machine age, the hegemony of incessant data and dumbed-down
reading.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't just say the potent word style and leave it at
that; it's just the key to not becoming anonymous. I know some
writers who, maybe out of misplaced craving for uniformity (such as
children like), want to write the same immigrant or primitive
English. Perhaps they feel more noticeable because each has the
heft of many clones. They aspire to an art of no mistakes, a low
aspiration. The truth to this awkward dilemma must be existential,
with the stylists surging up in the universe and thus defining
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   I once published an essay in defense of purple prose, since then
much anthologized as a report from Cockaigne or Samarkand. In fact
I was defending only the best purple, only the most lexically
adroit style, reserving my fiercest applause for prose in which the
simplest, most articulate combination of simple words most often
appeared. Amid the abundance of the physical universe, it seems
niggardly to write humdrum.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the writer cannot always burn with a hard gemlike
flame or a white heat, but it should be possible to be a chubby
hot-water bottle, rendering maximum attentiveness in the most
enterprising sentences. This is what I try for anyway, remembering
I have learned self-assertion from Sartre, the enigma from De
Quincey, from Beckett the performative erudite voice of the chronic
emeritus, from Proust the art of never beginning, from Thomas Mann
ironic solidity, and from Carlyle the luxuriant bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   I have a porous vision, into which anything can get, and I
welcome all invaders, knowing the world is richer by far than a
wall of identical shoe boxes, whose mildewed aura defeats what's
creative.
</P>
<P>
   Why in earlier novels I have turned to historical figures _ Jack
the Ripper; Claus von Stauffenberg, who tried to kill Hitler with a
briefcase bomb; Lord Byron's doctor; Klaus Barbie, and others _ I
can only say that ready-mades confer an enormous amount of creative
freedom. Mixing real ghosts with imaginary ones thickens the total
illusion and perhaps gives full vent to the notion that people
``get to know celebrities.'' They get to guess or swallow
propaganda, but that is all.
</P>
<P>
   It is the mind that attracts us, whether of the serial killer,
the dictator, the paragon or the flawed genius. When Elizabethan
poets filched personages from myth, they called it ``the matter of
Greece and Rome.'' Ideal to pillage so as to have windup bathtub
toys among us. The opera about Lizzie Borden has much the same
effect.
</P>
<P>
   These are incidentals, however. The novel form to which I have
devoted so much time, and still attempt, is no mere story (favored
word of newscasters), nor dialogue among scene settings, nor
anything ``well made,'' nor a page turner, so called, but a
visionary plunge into what cannot be kept out of the mind, a
``tale'' its vehicle, that vision its tenor. If we have not yet
learned this from Broch and Proust, Lowry and Frame, Joyce and
Woolf, Lezama Lima and Roa Bastos, we have not learned much at all.
Fiction is an attempt to control and accept the world, perhaps a
reminder to all readers, and therefore on the side of life, that
those who bite the bullet need not eat the gun.

<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM was once as closely linked to personal computers as Kleenex
is to tissue. But no more.
</P>
<P>
   The company's market share has fallen behind those of Compaq and
Dell, and it has not made a profit on PC's in at least four years.
Indeed, IBM's PC unit lost nearly $1 billion last year and $311
million so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner Jr. even declared in the company's
annual report that ``the PC era is over'' because computing power
was moving onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, IBM announced a tactical retreat on the PC front,
saying it would pull its desktop computers off store shelves and
let customers buy them only over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   All this raises a bigger question: Should it get out of the PC
business altogether? IBM certainly does have other business lines
that are profitable and growing, like software, semiconductors and
computer services. And it is pursuing these even at the risk of
humiliating its own PC unit.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, IBM agreed to sell its rival Dell access to
its most advanced technology and its 130,000 service technicians.
With those deals calling for $22 billion in revenue, analysts have
asked whether IBM would be better off ceding the PC business and
focusing on areas where it has been more successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have argued that they should withdraw from both consumer and
commercial desktop PC's,'' said Steven Milunovich of Merrill Lynch.
``It's a business they haven't figured out.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Thomas, the executive in charge of IBM's personal
systems group, says the company now does have the business figured
out. In fact, it has been figuring quite hard over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you lose close to a billion dollars, you have to ask
a lot of hard questions,'' Thomas acknowledged in a recent
interview at corporate headquarters in Armonk, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   After an elaborate study, the company concluded that personal
computers would likely remain a tough market with thin margins at
best. Yet the study concluded that the customers who used IBM's
most profitable products also bought lots of personal computers,
and that abandoning PC's would thus create an opportunity for
another company to establish a relationship to steal the good
business.
</P>
<P>
   So Thomas has developed a new strategy that essentially treats
personal computers the way a convenience store has sold milk: a
high-volume, low-margin item meant to bring customers in the door
in the hope that they will grab a candy bar and a bag of chips on
the way out.
</P>
<P>
   To make this approach work, IBM has decided to emphasize selling
directly to customers, rather than relying on dealers. Selling
directly, as Dell does, is cheaper, and more important, it creates
the opportunity to add on other products.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a consumer bought an IBM Aptiva desktop in a
retail store, it was the retailer who decided which monitor and
printer to offer. On IBM's Web site, by contrast, the company can
push its own products. For businesses, the plan is much the same:
to offer PC's with other IBM services like leasing from the IBM
Credit Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the PC unit, with the backing of Gerstner, is
trying to get the other IBM units to return the favor and push its
products to their customers. Most notably, David Thomas and Samuel
Palmisano, then the head of IBM Global Services, concocted a plan
called Blue on Blue that was meant to get more services customers
to also buy IBM PC's. This was hardly an easy change for the
services unit, which for nearly a decade has competed against
independent companies like Electronic Data Systems by asserting it
was agnostic about what brand of hardware a client chose to use.
</P>
<P>
   For IBM, the motive for the change is clear. Thomas figures that
at best, IBM can make 3 cents in profit for every $1 in revenue on
the sale of a desktop PC. But by adding services, software,
financing and other extras, the company can tack on a further 50
cents in revenue and 9 cents in profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, the profit has been on the system unit itself,''
Thomas said. ``The next big battle is all things beyond the box.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM's strategy echoes the moves by other PC makers to deal with
the competitive price pressures by finding other, more profitable
products to sell along with the computers. Gateway has long offered
lease financing and Internet service bundled with its computers for
one monthly payment. Compaq put buttons on its keyboards to channel
users to Web sites that pay for the traffic. And Hewlett-Packard
bundles its computers with its printers, making the most money on
the ink-refill cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to tell whether IBM's strategy will restore its
PC unit to its onetime glory. But there are some early signs that
things are getting better. Over all, the unit's sales, flat for
three years, jumped by 34 percent so far this year to $11.2
billion. In the third quarter, the PC unit's loss was down to $69
million from $122 million a year earlier. Nearly all of that loss,
IBM says, was due to the home PC area it is pulling back from. (And
mainframe computers, not PC's, are the villain in the decline in
profit that IBM warned of last week, as the windfall from corporate
investments in Year 2000 readiness comes to an end.)
</P>
<P>
   Aside from desktop computer sales in the United States, IBM's
financial results from PC's have been better. Thomas says the
company has consistently made good money on PC's in Asia, even
selling through retail stores. And profit margins are much higher
for its Thinkpad notebook computers and Netfinity servers for
Windows NT, two areas where customers are willing to pay higher
prices for IBM's technology.
</P>
<P>
   Yet desktops still make up two-thirds of the company's PC
volume, and Thomas has sharply cut prices in order to win business,
especially from big companies that buy lots of other things from
IBM.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we decided to put our desktop PC's up for bid every
month because we were trying to squeeze the last drop of blood from
the suppliers,'' said George D. Kunkel, the head of PC operations
for PNC Bank in Pittsburgh. ``IBM won most of the time, and I think
that's part of the reason they lost more than $900 million last
year.'' More recently, PNC signed a one-year deal with IBM, but
only because it promised to maintain the low pricing.
</P>
<P>
   PNC still buys its IBM personal computers through a reseller,
but as with its consumer business, IBM is trying to shift its
corporate customers to buying direct. Already, 10 percent of IBM's
sales are direct to customers. By next year, Thomas hopes that 20
to 30 percent of IBM's sales will be direct, and ultimately as much
as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, which faces many of the same problems as IBM, alienated
dealers by announcing it would start selling directly last year. So
IBM has been quieter as it set about to do the same thing, in part
because the plan had some growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to buy my father an IBM system because I like their
displays,'' said Kevin McCarthy, an analyst who follows IBM for
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``I finally got them on the
telephone, and I knew more than the salesman did. It was so
frustrating that I hung up and called Dell.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its traditional sales prowess, Dell has some new
arrows in its quiver, thanks to its technology and services deals
with IBM
</P>
<P>
   Those deals have challenged IBM's PC group to find new ways to
compete. ``Skip the middleman _ `Be Direct' with IBM,'' was one
pitch suggested in a letter the company sent to its sales force,
playing on Dell's advertising slogan.
</P>
<P>
   IBM points out that Dell has agreed to buy only three of the 60
services related to personal computers that it offers. And it does
seem to have gotten some early success with the Blue on Blue
program of selling PC's to services clients. But that is largely
because the company is offering customers even more discounts when
they buy a total package.
</P>
<P>
   For example, last Thursday, IBM Global Services presented two
bids to a national retailer that wanted someone to maintain a
network of servers at each of its 2,700 stores. IBM's basic price
was $1,500 per server per year for any brand of hardware. But if
the customer bought IBM Netfinity servers, the price for the server
would fall to $1,200. Global Services can absorb the discount
because its own costs are lower when customers use IBM hardware,
said Tom Conway, head of IBM's PC services unit. Support costs are
lower because the company knows its own machines better, and
maintenance is faster because it has supplies of spare parts all
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   And just to make sure that it gets the word out on these deals,
IBM changed the compensation for its sales force, so someone in the
services unit will get a bonus for selling hardware, and vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strings of the pocketbook affect behavior,'' said Conway.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be working. Last year, before the Blue on Blue
program, IBM services customers bought $500 million in IBM personal
computers. So far this year, PC sales to services customers have
doubled to $1 billion, 10 percent of the PC group's total revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these gains, Roger Kay, an analyst with the
International Data Corp., argues that customers and investors
should be skeptical about how long Thomas' plan will last.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM has come out repeatedly with very strong strategy
statements, championed by a strong executive, only to have it all
change when the next executive comes in,'' he said. ``Compare them
to Dell, which has been making the same strategy statement for 18
quarters.''

A SLEEPER MOVIE AWAKENED BY A HUNGRY AUDIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The stylish couple getting their midmorning caffeine
blast on the sunbaked terrace of a Sunset Strip coffeehouse look
like any of the other black-clad power types in designer
sunglasses, cell phones resting on the table, giving every
impression of being in the middle of a lucrative deal that would
make other power types sick with envy if they only knew.
</P>
<P>
   Except in this case, it's true.
</P>
<P>
   ``And no one is more surprised than me,'' said Matt Crouch,
seated next to his wife, Laurie.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch is producer of ``The Omega Code,'' a $7.2 million
thriller starring Michael York, Casper Van Dien and Catherine
Oxenburg that blindsided Hollywood a week ago by sneaking under the
radar to earn $2.4 million during its opening weekend in only 305
theaters around the country, despite a national marketing budget of
only $600,000 and a smattering of reviews that were, well, not
particularly kind. The film took in an average of $7,869 a theater,
the highest for any of that weekend's films and a figure called
``eye-popping'' by The Hollywood Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Several studio executives said last week that the film had
caught them by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard of it until I saw it on the weekend box-office
list,'' said one production company executive. ``I thought, `What
the heck is this?' And I called some people up, and they didn't
know either.''
</P>
<P>
   What has drawn Hollywood's attention is not merely that yet
another little-heralded movie, a la ``Blair Witch Project,'' has
used an aggressively targeted grass-roots marketing campaign to
catapult into an apparent hit, but that the movie's core target
audience is the Christian right, known for its antagonism to movies
and to much of mainstream popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my belief,'' Crouch said, ``that there are millions of
people out there, we don't really know how many _ call them church
people, call them right-wing Christians, call them whatever you
want _ who are hungry for entertainment and who would love to go to
the movies. But they feel there are no movies being made for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Crouch is the son of Paul Crouch, a well-known preacher in
Orange County, Calif., and the operator of the Trinity Broadcasting
Network, a cable company geared toward the charismatic and
Pentecostal wings of the Christian right, with hundreds of outlets
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Omega Code'' is about an apocalyptic battle between good
and evil that draws its inspiration from prophecies in the Book of
Revelations, grafting onto them a standard-issue plot with a hero,
a villain and a pretty girl. The idea, Crouch said, was to make an
intense, traditional Hollywood thriller that would appeal initially
to conservative Christian audiences, but without being so
overbearing as to scare away those who do not normally tune into a
right-wing Christian message.
</P>
<P>
   With a marketing budget that allowed for only minimal newspaper
advertising and no billboards or television outside of the frequent
mention of the movie on his father's cable network, Crouch and
Providence Entertainment, a small San Fernando Valley company that
is distributing the film, were forced to rely on preachers and
conservative Christians from around the country to spread the word.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we were able to do was to utilize the loyalty of TBN
viewers,'' said Michael Harpster, vice president for marketing at
Providence. ``We had 2,000 local volunteers around the country _ I
mean volunteers _ who were instrumental in driving this film,
putting up posters in churches, organizing church groups, just
getting the word out.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page from ``The Blair Witch'' book, the Internet was
also heavily used. An ``Omega Code'' Web site (www.omegacode.com)
has been receiving 12,000 e-mails a day in recent weeks, Crouch
said, and Internet chat rooms devoted to religious topics have been
inundated with chatter about the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am stunned with the Internet,'' Harpster said. ``One of the
things they did on the TBN Web page is they let people download
posters of the movie and a scriptural guide. One day we got 500,000
hits and 150,000 people downloaded that stuff. I mean, we had
people printing them out at home and then taking them to Kinko's
and having copies run off so they could plaster them all over their
town.''
</P>
<P>
   Several theater chains allowed Providence to sell tickets up to
a month in advance. ``We had pastors showing up to buy tickets for
their entire congregation,'' Harpster said. ``We've had busloads of
church people unloading outside the theaters. One businessman in
Oklahoma bought 1,000 tickets for all of his employees. A chain of
Christian bookstores bought hundreds of tickets for each of its
stores.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie remained on 305 screens in its second week, but will
expand this coming weekend to 30 more cities, then a bit more the
next weekend until by the end of November it is to be on 450
screens, Harpster said. Initially the movie was booked into those
cities where TBN's viewership was highest _ in the South, the West
and the Midwest _ in hopes that it could capture that core audience
and then gradually expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried initially to stay very closely in the TBN
footprints,'' Harpster said. ``We know where their people are and
in niche marketing like this you naturally have to go hunting where
the ducks are. I mean, you don't open a black film in Minneapolis
because, hey, there's nothing there.''
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen is whether ``The Omega Code'' can
sustain its opening-week pace or turns out to be what Crouch calls
a ``church-bus bubble'' that pops once the church buses stop
arriving at the cinemas.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people in Hollywood are wondering the same thing,
because if there is a huge conservative Christian audience for
films _ anything like the audience that sustains hundreds of
Christian bookstores around the country _ and that audience can be
reached cheaply, then there might be a future for more movies like
``The Omega Code,'' maybe even better ones. It's still too early to
say for sure, several executives said last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have proven that there is a niche for these movies,''
said Nancy Utley, president for marketing at Fox Searchlight.
``What remains to be seen is how large the niche is.''

</P>
<P>
   Crouch had been the head of Trinity Films, a subsidiary of his
father's cable empire, but broke away several years ago to form his
own company, Gener8Xion Entertainment. He said he was eager to make
movies that were not necessarily directed only at TBN's core
audience _ ``preaching to the choir,'' as he puts it _ but were
aimed at attracting a wider audience, making the choir bigger.
``TBN preaches to people 24 hours a day, but there is a whole lost
group of people out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he began to knock on the doors of every movie executive. ``I
did the game,'' he said. ``I met with every potential funding
source, like an idiot, beating my head against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when he had the script for ``The Omega Code'' and doors
kept slamming in his face, he decided to take it back to his father
at TBN and was a little surprised when TBN Films agreed to make it
with him. Still, money was tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason the movie opened in 305 theaters,'' Crouch said,
``is that we only had enough money for 305 prints.'' And they got
that money, Ms. Crouch said, by mortgaging their house in the
Hollywood Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Now it seems to be paying off. Crouch said that since the movie
opened he has been interviewed by three television networks, two
wire services, The Times of London, Time magazine and The New
Yorker. He shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a headline on the front page of USA Today that said
`Omega-mania,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Omega-mania!'' Ms. Crouch repeated, bursting into delighted
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I'm trying to tell people,'' Crouch said, ``is
that I appreciate the way newspapers are coining phrases, but what
I personally feel that I'm really good at is identifying a market
of people who for years had wanted to embrace Hollywood but
couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, he spends his time trying to figure out how best
to capitalize on the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want this to be just a flash in the pan,'' he said.
``I want it to be the beginning of something.''

REVISED BANKING LEGISLATION RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT PRIVACY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ala.)  (jw) 
 By JERI CLAUSING    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Congress votes as expected this week to overhaul the nation's
Depression-era banking laws, it will be doing more than paving the
way for the creation of one-stop financial supermarkets. It will
also be offering companies unprecedented opportunities to amass and
share reams of private data about their customers.
</P>
<P>
   The data-swapping opportunities, the bill's backers said, are
necessary for companies to be able to provide the integrated
financial services that the legislation aims to make possible.
</P>
<P>
   But in an age in which personal data have become an invaluable
marketing resource, consumer and privacy advocates fear that the
new law will give banks and insurance companies an unchecked
advantage over their customers. Financial institutions will be able
to share not only information on their customers' incomes,
investments, possessions and credit ratings, but also detailed
summations about where they go to dinner, where they buy their
lovers' presents and what medical expenses they have paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the privacy protections that were put into the bill
are a sham,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., who was on the
conference committee that negotiated the compromise last week. He
said he would refuse to sign the conference report that moves to
the full Congress where it is expected to be endorsed this week,
because ``it ignores a basic right for American people that I
believe shouldn't be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charlotte Birch, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers
Association, said that the ability to share basic information about
customers' financial activities was a major requirement of the
banking overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point is to be able to offer integrated financial
services to customers,'' she said. ``To provide that sort of
integrated customer service, be it through common account
statements, ease of loan applications, whatever, that kind of
information sharing between affiliates is a convenience for
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, she said, financial institutions would have incentives
to protect their customers' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is a bank's relationship with its customer is
built on trust,'' she said. ``The industry can't afford to come
down on this issue any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Birch said that the bill also required financial
institutions to establish comprehensive privacy policies and to
notify customers of those policies once a year.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over privacy protections in the compromise banking
bill was created by a tension that is increasingly moving to the
forefront of policy debates: how to balance the convenience that
new technologies offer consumers and businesses with the threat of
unprecedented intrusions into personal privacy.
</P>
<P>
   And how well that balance was struck remains the source of
fierce contention between the banking lobby and consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the compromise financial services bill that was
tentatively endorsed by Congress and the White House last week
appears to offer consumers more privacy protections than current
law. It would require, for the first time, that banks in most cases
let their customers know if they are selling their personal
information to third parties. The bill would also require the banks
to remove an individual's data from such marketing lists if the
customer so requested.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the information that the new digital-age conglomerates
would be able to share unchecked among themselves that has consumer
and privacy advocates concerned.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time ever, the legislation would allow insurance
companies, brokerage houses, banks and credit card companies to
merge under one roof, enabling them to share with one another all
of the personal and financial information they have about each of
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate leaders negotiating the compromise rejected
attempts to require that affiliated companies first get a
customer's permission before sharing that information.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted customers to be able to authorize the sharing of
information each and every time,'' said Ms. Birch, spokeswoman for
the banking group. ``It's just not practical and it would have the
effect of no information sharing whatsoever. In which case, just as
you are taking down legal barriers you are putting up new ones.''
</P>
<P>
   But the resulting compromise, privacy and consumer advocates
said, has left customers with little control over how their
sensitive personal information is used.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Torres, legislative director for the Consumers Union,
which was part of a diverse coalition of groups pushing for the
stronger privacy protections, said the long-term implications of
the bill were that ``banks can really use this this information to
manipulate their customers.'' He said that banks increasingly made
their profits from products and services rather than interest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't your fathers' banks. These are banks now in the
business of selling you things. How can you trust them if they have
all this information on you?''
</P>
<P>
   Torres said consumer groups were also concerned about the
implications for so-called digital redlining _ in which banks or
insurance companies could create a profile of a customer's credit
or insurance risk based on combined records of a person's banking,
insurance, credit card and brokerage transactions, and then use
that information to judge the person too risky a candidate to
receive a loan or line of credit.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, he said, if a consumer's bank and health
insurance company are affiliated, a loan officer might be able to
punch a button and see if the customer had any lingering health
problems before deciding whether to award a mortgage and at what
rate.
</P>
<P>
   And the bank would be under no obligation to tell the consumer
what personal data were used in deciding terms of a loan. Nor would
they be required to let the consumer check that information for
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might go in for a loan, and I might go in for the same
loan and get charged different fees, based on this information in
the black box _ a box that you have no access to,'' Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So in a nutshell, the privacy protections are anything but
private,'' he said. ``They aren't worth the paper they are printed
on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, if the legislation is adopted in its current form,
consumer privacy in practice will depend on how the financial
institutions choose to approach the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two points of view,'' said David Komansky, chairman and
chief executive of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``As an individual and
consumer, I think that I am entitled to certain privacies. The
things that concern me are health records as they apply to
mortgages applications, for example _ I want to have those
protections.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``As a business person, having the option to
`data-mine' investment traits of clients can position us to be able
to more efficiently market our products. It's an important
advantage and something I value.''

 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Friedman, the senior executive producer of CBS' new
``Early Show,'' which joins the network morning show competition
next week, was rather gleeful. He noted that ratings for the
longtime morning leader, NBC's ``Today,'' showed small signs of
slippage last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be using that in booking guests,'' Friedman said.
``We're going to tell people that `Today' is already showing signs
of erosion, and if you're tired of the `Today' show's arrogance in
the way they book guests, get on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the first of what promises to be innumerable salvos in
what Friedman calls ``the morning wars.'' Nowhere will the
infighting be more ferocious than in the behind-the-scenes daily
struggle to book the best guests on ``Early Show,'' ``Today'' or
ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   The bookings will be crucial because all three morning shows are
expected to follow basically the same format: male and female
co-anchors, hard news early, entertainment features and cooking
segments late. With the addition of CBS' new studio overlooking the
entrance to Central Park at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue, the three
shows will even display a similar window-on-Manhattan look. So,
executives with all three networks said, the three shows may depend
more than ever on distinguishing themselves by the guests they
bring on.
</P>
<P>
   Booking guests on the morning shows has long been a business of
horse trading and deal making, with shows often offering stars and
other valued guests some tangible benefit _ like multipart
appearances _ in exchange for getting the guest first.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a game of leverage. The total ratings dominance of
``Today'' over the last five years has changed the rules of the
game: ``Today'' has come to expect a certain advantage in booking
guests. Jeff Zucker, the show's executive producer, has declared
that his show is out of the deal business and will henceforth
depend only on its superior ratings position _ and of course, the
appeal of its hosts, Katie Couric and Matt Lauer _ to lure the best
guests.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman is sounding a call to any star representative who might
be just a bit fed up with the ``Today'' position as he takes on the
challenge of trying to build a successful morning show on CBS for
the first time behind Bryant Gumbel, the former longtime ``Today''
host, and the newcomer Jane Clayson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Today' show is quite particular about whom it puts on,''
he said. ``They do not take the co-star of movies. They do not take
somebody in a small movie that a studio may be pushing because they
won't make deals. People will start coming to me because they want
a contest. They really would like a show to challenge `Today' so
they can have some leverage. Jeff has all the leverage now.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Ross, the executive producer of ``Good Morning
America,'' said much the same thing: ``The publicists are delighted
that they have somewhere else to go besides NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zucker said he was not worried. ``If we've proved anything
in the last five years it's that clearly we like to win, and we
expect to win,'' he said.

   One reason for the welcoming of alternatives to ``Today'' is
that show's frank willingness to use the leverage of its big
ratings edge. ``I fully admit to being intense and competitive,''
Zucker said. ``Of course we want to capitalize on our strength.
You'd be derelict if you did anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Zucker has engaged in some high-profile showdowns with
representatives of guests and is not shy about threatening to cut
off future bookings when he feels, as he put it, ``somebody isn't
straight with me.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, when George Stephanopoulos was making the rounds
earlier this year with his book about his White House years, Zucker
felt the publisher, Sarah Crichton of Little, Brown, had broken an
agreement by booking him on CBS the same day he was on ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   Zucker exploded, telling Ms. Crichton he would never book
another of her authors again. That situation was resolved after
Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS News, intervened.
</P>
<P>
   But a more enduring standoff has arisen over a booking
contretemps between ``Today'' and Pat Kingsley, one of the most
powerful publicity agents in Hollywood and a partner in the firm
PMK. The incident involved a Kingsley client, the actress Calista
Flockhart, who was touring to promote her movie ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream.'' Ms. Kingsley pulled Ms. Flockhart from ``Today''
after the show refused to accede to Ms. Flockhart's request not to
ask questions about her weight.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker reacted by canceling interviews with that movie's
co-stars, Kevin Kline and Stanley Tucci.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Today'' show then accused Ms. Kingsley of retaliating by
reneging on a deal the show had with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman
for interviews about their movie ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' Ms. Kingsley
says there never was a deal and that ``Good Morning America''
simply came up with a better offer: five days of interviews as
opposed to three. Ms. Ross backed that version, saying the actors
``wanted to be on with Diane Sawyer because they know she's a great
interviewer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' executives said Ms. Kingsley was trying to rewrite the
facts and that they had backing from other PMK executives to prove
it.
</P>
<P>
   The result of the dispute was what both parties described as an
extremely heated phone conversation between Zucker and Ms.
Kingsley, which ended with Zucker telling her that her personal
clients would be banned from ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kingsley said in an interview that she really does not have
personal clients; Zucker said ``Today'' knows who they are. The
fallout so far has included Chevy Chase, a Kingsley client who was
about the only former ``Saturday Night Live'' star not on ``Today''
the week before the 25th anniversary special of that show, and
Jodie Foster, who is still not booked on ``Today'' for her upcoming
movie ``Anna and the King.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' executives said that the movie's studio, Fox, has
pleaded that Ms. Foster be allowed on the show as long as Ms.
Kingsley has nothing to do with it, and they are now considering
whether the show will book the actress with that condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to be a bully,'' Zucker said. ``But I'm very
serious about this.''
</P>
<P>
   The booking game is indeed very serious. Both Ms. Ross and
Friedman now say they, too, will refuse to take guests _ other than
figures in the news _ after they have previously appeared on
another morning show.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ross said she was far less concerned about missing out on
guests than what she called ``incidents where the booking wars are
serious and dangerous.'' The example she cited involved a product
recall. She said Ann Brown, the chairman of the federal Consumer
Products Safety Commission, despite her status as a public
official, had an exclusive agreement to appear regularly on
``Today,'' where she was announcing the recall.
</P>
<P>
   What made this booking decision dangerous? Because, said Ms.
Ross, ``Good Morning America'' could not announce the recall at the
same time and give the widest possible distribution of the news.
Ms. Ross said she complained in Washington of the unfairness of
this arrangement and since has received some redress.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown even appeared on ``Good Morning America'' last week,
though Ms. Ross pointed out that the product recall she was
announcing was for dishwashers, some of which were manufactured by
General Electric, NBC's parent. ``I really don't know why Ms. Brown
became available to us on this particular product,'' Ms. Ross said,
leaving little doubt that she believed that NBC wanted to avoid
reporting negatively on its parent company.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives strenuously denied that they passed on Mn
because of the GE connection and said they had reported the recall
on the show's news segments.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Begala, a spokeswoman for the Consumer Products Safety
Commission, said Ms. Brown never had an exclusive arrangement with
``Today,'' but had come to prefer that show principally because of
its higher ratings and because it had been supportive after a
previous ``Good Morning America'' producer had decided he did not
want Ms. Brown on.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the sidelines watching the sniping, Friedman said he
hoped to take advantage of whatever ill feelings had built up among
guests booked and unbooked by the other two shows in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling people, if you help us now when we need help, we
have long memories,'' Friedman said. ``I'm there to help everybody.
I'm just this benevolent guy who's going to go in there and say:
Help me out.''
</P>
<P>
   But benevolence and booking really don't have much to do with
each other in morning television. Friedman made of point of adding,
``Of course, for those who don't help us out, we have long memories
too.''

MAN SENTENCED IN ISRAEL TO 24 YEARS FOR MARYLAND MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ Saying nothing and showing no emotion as he
stood before three Tel Aviv district judges and a gallery packed
with television crews, Samuel Sheinbein was sentenced to 24 years
in prison here Sunday for the murder of a neighborhood acquaintance
in Maryland in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The prison term, negotiated earlier in a plea bargain between
Israeli prosecutors and Sheinbein's lawyer, has already been
denounced as too lenient by Maryland prosecutors. But it was said
by lawyers here Sunday to be the harshest ever imposed in Israel
for a crime committed by a minor.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old Maryland native will be eligible for parole in
14 years, the prosecutor said Sunday. Within four years, a review
board could also begin authorizing furloughs from jail of up to
four days at a time, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   The judges noted that there were few precedents for Sheinbein's
peculiar and politically charged case, which began when he fled
here after the murder two years ago to avail himself of the
protection he would enjoy as a citizen of Israel _ a country he had
never visited, but where both his parents were born.
</P>
<P>
   Under Israeli law, Sheinbein had full citizenship rights here.
And, under a law in effect at the time, no Israeli citizen could be
extradited on murder charges if the potential sentence abroad was
more severe than that which could legally be imposed in Israel. In
Maryland, Sheinbein could have faced a verdict of life without
parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with a defendant who forced himself upon the
Israeli judicial system,'' said Judge Uri Goren, the president of
the three-judge Tel Aviv district court panel, reading from its
19-page sentencing report. Sheinbein did not visibly react to the
recitation of the charges to which he had earlier confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the back of the small courtroom, Sheinbein's parents
appeared numbed but relieved that the three-judge panel did not
reject the recommended plea in favor of a more severe sentence, as
Maryland prosecutors and others had publicly urged.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sheinbein, crying silently, and her husband listened to
Goren methodically detail the strangulation and subsequent
dismemberment by electric saw of Alfredo Tello, said to have been a
friend of Samuel Sheinbein and his accomplice, Aron Needle, who
later committed suicide in a Maryland jail cell. The ``shocking
acts of desecration of the deceased's body ... show us to what
depths the defendant sank and how inhuman he became,'' Goren said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge pointedly noted that it was Sheinbein's father who had
urged and assisted his flight to Israel, and that prosecutors here
had relied heavily on his father's admission to a Maryland grand
jury that Samuel Sheinbein had admitted to the strangulation in
conversations with him and with his brother. The Sheinbeins refused
to respond to reporters' questions, and left quickly when the
sentencing was over.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the brief proceedings Sunday, the judges, prosecutor
and even the defendant's lawyer displayed a seemingly visceral
distaste for the case, for Sheinbein himself, and for the
since-amended extradition law that effectively made it impossible
for Israel to deport Sheinbein to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Acidly rejecting one defense argument for the plea bargain _
that avoiding a trial would save the courts time and money _ the
judges noted that ``it was in the hands of the defendant in the
first place to avoid the entire procedure here in Israel, had he
not escaped here and had he been willing to face proper justice for
his acts in the right and proper place, i.e., in the state of
Maryland.''
</P>
<P>
   But the judges accepted the recommended sentence of 24 years,
pointing to punishments imposed in other murders by minors in
Israel and the inherent uncertainty about the penalty Sheinbein
would have received had he stood trial in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sheinbein was represented by David Libay, a former justice
minister, who said he had opposed the extradition ban that had
protected his client and ``welcomed'' the Parliament's decision
this year to change the law to preclude future such cases. But he
fought efforts to return Sheinbein to Maryland because ``the law is
the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court imposed on the defendant in this case one of the
most harsh and severe punishments that has ever been imposed on a
minor convicted of murder in Israel,'' Libay said after the
sentencing Sunday. The court acceptance of the plea agreement
``shows that we have all done our best to act in a very reasonable
and responsible way in dealing with this very troubling case,'' he
said.

`THE PREDICTORS': IN CHAOTIC MARKETS, FANTASTIC RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Readers of an entertaining earlier book by Thomas A. Bass, ``The
Eudaemonic Pie'' (1985), will recall how from 1976 until 1981 a
group of California physicists worked to break the banks at Las
Vegas by predicting the outcome of the game of roulette. They
designed miniature computers that fit inside their shoes, walked
into a casino, punched into their computers the Newtonian numbers
that govern roulette, and started placing winning bets.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that was just the beginning of their adventures in
forecasting. In his lively new book, ``The Predictors,'' Bass
reports how the two leaders of Eudaemonic Enterprises, Doyne Farmer
and Norman Packard, set about finding more complex things to
predict than the eventual resting place of a metal ball bouncing
around a rotating wheel.
</P>
<P>
   As pioneers in the arcane science of chaos theory, Farmer and
Packard saw possibilities of exploiting chaos as a predictive tool.
What you could do, it had been discovered, was send a probe into a
turbulent system, like two gases flowing next to each other, in
which coherent patterns called fractals could tell you about the
system in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   And what phenomenon would they model this time out? Not a
dripping faucet, a measles epidemic or smoke rising from a
cigarette in an ashtray, all of which are potential subjects of
chaos theory. No, instead the physicists would study what was in a
sense an extension of roulette, the behavior of financial markets,
which Bass, with his vivid introductory description of the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, makes seem the very paradigm of turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   By discovering the order within disorder of the markets, nice
money could be made, Bass asserts. ``How much money?'' he asks.
Take an initial $100 million investment, ``leverage it by a factor
of 5, secure a 30 percent return, collect 25 percent of this as a
fee for your services, and pocket a cool $37 million a year in
profit.'' He adds: ``This is a nice balance sheet for Year One.
After that, real money.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Predictors'' Bass describes how the two chaos
theoreticians tried to achieve these results; how they set up shop
in Santa Fe, N.M., and hired a scruffy band of Ph.D.s to think and
write software for them; how they sought out financial advisers and
investors, eventually contracting with powerful Swiss Bank Corp.
(not gnomes of Zurich but behemoths of Basel); and how they went
about decoding and modeling the commodities, currency and equities
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Bass has good narrative fun contrasting the loose-jointed
working style of the Prediction Company, as it came to be called,
with the Masters of the Universe who ended up financing the
project.
</P>
<P>
   He lavishes some of the richest prose on the scenery surrounding
the project's computer-crammed shop and on the local rituals in
which the predictors partook, like Fiesta and the burning of
Zozobra, also known as Old Man Gloom, a 40-foot puppet erected on a
hill nearby.
</P>
<P>
   More edifying, however, is Bass' use of his narrative to teach
readers about chaos theory as it relates to economics, about the
increasingly recondite instruments of investment in the age of
derivatives and, perhaps most important, about the evolution of
financial markets toward automation.
</P>
<P>
   As the Prediction Company approaches success, creating software
that models not only all markets but also all the world's stocks,
at least the ones traded with some frequency, you wonder
increasingly what the effect on those markets will be.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the company's employees wondered too, asking if ``to
make money this way is to be a parasite upon the financial system
rather than to serve it,'' as one person put it. ``Furthermore,''
he added, ``it is pretty clear that the only way to make money
consistently with such a technique is to keep it secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Packard's answer to these concerns was that ``finding
predictable structure and trading on it makes the markets more
efficient.'' He continued: ``Such trades reduce the overall
volatility of the markets, and thus the risk to participants is
reduced. The profits that go to the successful predictor are like a
fee that the markets pay for the service of making them more
efficient and less risky.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's response was even more to the point. ``Making
predictions is fundamental to financial markets,'' he said. ``If
people didn't think prices were going to change, they wouldn't
trade. Price setting can be rational only insofar as the
predictions that drive it are sensible. By making predictions and
trading on them, we are indirectly helping society set its goals,
even if we're also trying to make a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Did the Prediction Company succeed? Although the answer is a
matter of public record, it will not be repeated here, out of
respect for Bass' energetic, serpentine narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, his story serves as a useful device for
describing the increasing abstractness of contemporary finances,
where markets derive from markets that in turn derive from derived
markets. (Some passages of ``The Predictors'' read like Greek in
their abstruseness, although Bass rarely uses terminology without
coming back to it and defining it further along.)
</P>
<P>
   But certainly you have doubts about the success of the venture,
given the recent growing volume of voices arguing that markets are
patternless and therefore unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the Prediction Company jokingly considered taking
as its motto Lux Solis Ex Cucumero, meaning Sunlight From Cucumbers
and referring to the academy in ``Gulliver's Travels'' where the
academicians engaged in such an absurd project of extraction have
to be protected from falling off cliffs or doing themselves other
bodily harm.
</P>
<P>
   Reading ``The Predictors,'' you often feel that the computers
Bass' heroes try to get light from might just as well be cucumbers
hidden in their shoes. That they could eventually make money by
reading the madness of crowds bidding up the price of tulip bulbs
seems equally unlikely, until Bass gets through explaining in this
instructive and amusing book.

<P>
   LONDON _ As an undergraduate studying philosophy at Cambridge,
Michael Frayn always attended his supervisor's lectures, an
academic experience so excruciating that after a few weeks he was
the only student there.
</P>
<P>
   One day he decided to stay in bed. ``At about 10 past 9 there
was a tap on the door, and it was my supervisor,'' he recalled the
other day. ``Since I was visibly not doing anything else, I had to
get up and get dressed. Thereafter, he would collect me on the way
to the lecture, and I remained his entire audience for the rest of
the term.''
</P>
<P>
   Frayn _ playwright, author, essayist, translator of Russian _
seems just as polite now as he was then, pouring tea in his airy
study in Camden Town in north London and talking about himself in
the manner of someone who revels in his work, not his biography.
</P>
<P>
   He has done a lot of talking about himself lately, in the United
States and Germany as well as Britain, as he promotes his latest
novel, ``Headlong'' (Metropolitan Books/Henry Holt).
</P>
<P>
   He certainly knows the drill. Years ago he wrote a dead-on
parody of a newspaper profile, featuring a supremely inarticulate
actor who plays the front legs of movie monsters and is interviewed
by a reporter with ``a lot of space to fill.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Would you like a drink?' he asks, with simple, unforced
generosity,'' Frayn wrote. ``You watch him as he mixes it, and see
not the dreamer of `The Horror Crypt' but the practical man who
could have carved out a career for himself as a chemist or a soda
jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, though, the gentle and slyly funny Frayn, who at 66
is tall and lanky with white hair on the sides of his head and
almost none on top, is certainly far too well-mannered to boast
about the highly irregular double success he is enjoying.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, not only does he have a hit play on the West End,
``Copenhagen,'' about a deadly serious subject, but ``Headlong,'' a
wickedly clever novel with elements of the famous Frayn farce, is a
narrow favorite to win this year's Booker Prize, to be awarded
Monday night at a fancy ceremony in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``With nearly everybody you think that they're primarily a
novelist or primarily a playwright, but Michael's genuinely,
equally both,'' said Blake Morrison, the writer and critic. ``And
there are two sides to him, in both the theater and fiction. On the
one hand he has a real taste for farce, but he's also a very
serious-minded man, with an almost dry academic temperament and a
slightly professorial look about him.''
</P>
<P>
   In both these works, Frayn has thrown himself into real-life
intellectual disputes that can be dazzlingly abstruse.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Copenhagen'' Frayn investigates the unreliability of
memory, the ambiguity of human motives and the conflicting
loyalties of scientists in wartime by imagining what happened at
the famous, never-explained meeting in 1941 between Werner
Heisenberg, the father of the German nuclear program, and Niels
Bohr, the half-Jewish Danish physicist who had been Heisenberg's
mentor before the war.
</P>
<P>
   The play, which opened at the National Theater and moved to the
West End in February, is set to open on Broadway in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have found it exhilaratingly erudite without wearing its
ideas too heavily. ``This extraordinary play _ at once a historical
detective story, a lecture in morality and a lesson in advanced
nuclear physics _ shows that Michael Frayn, at his best, can blend
bogglingly cerebral material with the skill of a theatrical master
craftsman,'' wrote Nick Curtis in The Evening Standard of London.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ``Headlong'' reads at times like a romp, albeit one
that poses moral and intellectual questions. An account of an
undisciplined, impecunious academic's growing attachment to his
theory that a picture in the house of an unsophisticated country
neighbor is in fact a missing Bruegel masterpiece, ``Headlong'' too
has drawn almost universally good reviews, with critics praising
its ability to work on several levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the novel has elements of thriller and elements of
farce, it also offers an anatomization of moral disintegration,''
said Caroline Moore, writing in The Sunday Telegraph of London.
``This, I should add hastily, is never grim, never merely
moralizing, far less dull: It is, indeed, horribly gripping.''
</P>
<P>
   Frayn, who is probably best known in the United States for his
farce ``Noises Off,'' became addicted to Bruegel-related issues
about three years ago, he said, when he was in Vienna, Austria, and
wandered, as he often does, into the Bruegel room at the
Kunsthistorisches Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There I was, once again, looking once again at `The Hunters in
the Snow' and the two pictures next to it,'' he said. ``It's a
terrible admission because it makes me sound completely stupid, but
I'd never noticed before that they were part of a series.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign said that the pictures were part of a series of six,
illustrating times of the year, and that three were in Vienna, one
was in Prague, Czech Republic, one was at the Metropolitan Museum
of Art in New York, and one was ... missing. ``And even as I looked
at the notice, I thought, supposing you found that missing
picture?'' Frayn said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Clay, who thinks in ``Headlong'' that he has found the
missing picture, is motivated by a shifting mixture of greed,
altruism, deceit and guilt. As he immerses himself in Bruegel
arcana in an effort to determine whether the picture he has spotted
at his neighbor Tony Churt's house is in fact the lost masterpiece,
he becomes enmeshed in a complicated plot to extricate the picture
from Tony without telling him why.
</P>
<P>
   Despite protesting that he is basically lazy _ ``My idea is
always to do as little research as possible on anything,'' he said
_ Frayn became just as obsessed as Martin. ``I discovered, as
Martin discovers, that everything about Bruegel is vastly more
complicated than that notice suggested.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, scholars don't even agree on how many
pictures were in the series, what months they actually represent or
whether the sixth picture was ever painted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more research I did, the plainer it became that there was
almost no documentation at all about Bruegel,'' Frayn said.
``Everything is theory or conjecture,'' he added. ``He's a very
ambiguous figure, and as soon as you find something ambiguous and
mysterious, it seizes your imagination.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ambiguity and mystery lie, too, at the core of ``Copenhagen,'' a
play in which Frayn wrestles with two of his favorite subjects, the
philosophical implications of quantum mechanics and the mysteries
of human motivation.
</P>
<P>
   When he read an account of Heisenberg's murky trip to
Copenhagen, Denmark, in ``Heisenberg's War: The Secret History of
the German Bomb'' (Knopf, 1993), by the American author Thomas
Powers, Frayn said, he was struck by the incident's theatrical
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The tantalizing puzzle at the center of ``Copenhagen'' is that
no one knows exactly what happened at the meeting. Frayn begins the
play by struggling to make sense of a seminal moment in the lives
of the protagonists, who are long dead, and examining possible
scenarios. Was Heisenberg asking Bohr to join him in ensuring that
neither the Nazis nor the Allies would produce an atomic bomb? Was
he trying to recruit Bohr to the German side?
</P>
<P>
   All these underlie an even larger question: Was Heisenberg's
failure to develop a bomb for Germany a deliberate act intended to
thwart a war effort he abhorred, or the result of his own
scientific missteps?
</P>
<P>
   Although historians have deeply held positions on all sides of
these points, Frayn says he tried to be evenhanded, making the
point that Heisenberg's major contribution to science, the
Uncertainty Principle, applies just as much to understanding human
intentions as it does to measuring the physical world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you can't locate _ why people do or don't do
things,'' he said. ``What I'm saying in `Copenhagen' is that there
isn't an objective truth about people's motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Frayn's career has had its ups and downs. At Cambridge he edited
a literary magazine and wrote the script for one of the annual
shows of Footlights, the university's revue club, but then he
suffered the rare indignity of the production's failing to transfer
to the West End.
</P>
<P>
   He then joined The Manchester Guardian, writing articles for the
newspaper about things like ``the last clog maker in Bolton,'' he
said, and Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's trip to the Soviet
Union, before making his name with a Thurberesque humor column for
The Guardian and then for The Observer of London.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote novels (``Headlong'' is his ninth), and after
recovering from his Footlights disappointment, turned increasingly
to writing plays. After a series of theatrical successes, with
``Noises Off,'' ``Benefactors'' and ``Wild Honey,'' Frayn's
translation of Chekhov's first play, he went through an unhappy
patch when his next two plays flopped.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, sales of his novels were so anemic that when
``Headlong'' was put up for auction, some publishers declined to
bid.

   Frayn is not sure how to characterize himself _ ``I'm a novelist
when I'm working on a novel and a playwright when I'm working on a
play,'' he says _ but both guises present their own sets of
anxieties. When the opening of ``Copenhagen'' was put off until the
theater he wanted became available, Frayn said, ``I kept worrying
every week that someone else was going to come up with a play about
Heisenberg's visit to Copenhagen.''
</P>
<P>
   And before ``Headlong,'' ``I was just waiting for somebody to
discover that Bruegel painting and completely shoot down my
novel,'' Frayn said. ``I hope they do discover it, but not until
we've got the paperbacks out.''

DIGITAL COMMERCE: INTERNET ECONOMY GROWS ON PLANS, NOT PRODUCTS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The desire to cash out big is not a new motivating force in the
technology industry. But what is striking about today's Internet
economy is how much of that money lust is focused on selling
business plans for their own sake, rather than planning viable
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   This trend may have already sown the seeds of its own demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it `the millennial pause,''' said Richard Miller, a
veteran Silicon Valley strategist and investor who is distressed at
the frenetic coupling of people with half-baked ideas and those
with an overabundance of money to finance them. ``It's the
industry's saturnalia.''
</P>
<P>
   In ancient Rome, the seven-day festival honoring the god Saturn
took place at the end of each year. Its ostensible purpose was to
pause long enough to resynchronize the lunar and solar calendars.
But in fact, it was a lengthy debauch during which Romans
enthusiastically engaged in all manner of licentious and excessive
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   What one considers licentious in the networked economy is a
matter of personal taste, of course. But excessive _ that is
something everyone apparently agrees on these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``MBAs aren't going to class anymore; they're taking two-year
sabbaticals to write business plans,'' said Ann Winblad of Hummer
Winblad Venture Partners in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Her firm has reviewed as many as 1,000 business plans in a
single month, and looks at 5,000 to 7,000 of them a year.
``Business school has become business-plan school,'' she said.
``Students go there, find a team and start creating a company.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, precious few are the next Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming flood of plans are ``products for Wall Street,
not real businesses,'' said Yogen Dalal, a general partner with the
Mayfield Fund venture firm in Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunities we're seeing today are a real
disappointment,'' agreed William Davidow, a 20-year veteran of the
venture game and a general partner at Mohr, Davidow Ventures in
Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many companies being founded today don't even have a single
product,'' Davidow added. ``I know a guy on the board of a company
where the engineering manager was quitting. The company was public,
but the product hadn't shipped yet. The engineer had already vested
1 percent of his stock, and had done the same thing at four
companies in a row. He never completed a single project in any of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah, so one company hired the wrong guy. OK, so maybe
four companies hired the wrong guy. Cry me a river, right? Who is
really hurt?
</P>
<P>
   In a market flooded with easy money and profit taking, victims
are hard to find. But as Wall Street and individual investors
continue their process of reality checking the true worth of
Internet companies, some industry executives believe that the
flakiness of the work force is only one reason to believe that the
entire Internet economy is becoming a giant Ponzi scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the description appears to fit. In today's well-known
Internet ``business'' model, the equation is that some venture
capitalists are willing to give, say, $1 for a dot-com's 75 cents
of value.
</P>
<P>
   A dot-com's first round of venture money might be $1 million. A
second round could be $10 million. The final, pre-IPO investment
might be $30 million _ then it goes to the public market to be
valued at $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable example of overvaluation is Blue Mountain Arts, the
greeting-card Web site with a $1 billion valuation, 10 million
users and virtually no revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Just as ``every success sows the seeds of its own destruction,''
said Davidow, the very interconnectedness of the Internet, which
created such incredible opportunity, has also created the massive
instability in the economy that it has spawned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet creates vast amounts of `near-money,''' he said.
``Near-money tends to be things that can be translated into money
very quickly. Where it used to be that it was very expensive to
sell stocks, for example, and it took time to sell them, what the
Internet has changed is that stocks are now near-money _ you can
sell them very quickly; they're extremely liquid.''
</P>
<P>
   This change, Davidow asserted, is one of the reasons Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is concerned about the
tremendous overvaluation of the stock market. ``All these
institutions had physical constraints on the speed at which money
moved through the system,'' he said. ``When that constraint is
gone, stock equals money, and the method that you once used to
control the money supply is gone, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the ability of entrepreneurs and investors to
pull cash out of companies quickly and with impunity may soon begin
to crumple those Internet businesses that can no longer get free
money from investors or the public markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies have voracious, unsustainable cash
requirements,'' Davidow said. ``And their business models are based
on cash being available. It's not a even a Ponzi scheme, because
there's nothing downstream to pay off the investors.''
</P>
<P>
   And by nature of their interconnections _ Internet businesses
are nothing if not linked to each other, by their swapping of
advertising ``revenue,'' their reliance on each other to drive each
other's businesses, their critical need for cash to acquire
customers _ a few crumpled companies could quickly turn into a big
tumble for the successful businesses in the networked economy.
</P>
<P>
   As one investor put it, ``The point is that they will pull down
the good companies with them.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the millennial pause. &QL;

E-COMMERCE REPORT: SOME PRODUCT REVIEWS ON WEB BRING ADVICE FROM
ANYONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traditionally, advice on consumer purchasing decisions has been
the province of print publications like Consumer Reports, PC
Magazine or Car and Driver. While many of these publications have
moved their content online, the growth of the Web has empowered
another source of buying advice: the neighbor, cousin or uncle who
just bought a particular item and is more than willing to share an
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Internet retailers and some publishers have already capitalized
on this instinct by allowing users to post opinions about products
the companies sell or review. But a handful of companies are hoping
to take the age-old effectiveness of word-of-mouth recommendations
one step further, by creating independent Web sites that give
common folks and bona fide experts a forum for their opinions and
users a way to rate the pundits. While some of these sites are
charging users for qualified help, most are looking for more
creative ways to balance their books and keep users coming to the
site.
</P>
<P>
   The company that has generated the most recent buzz around this
idea is Epinions, which was started in the summer by several
well-known Silicon Valley venture capitalists. It is not the first
company to provide users with opinions on what to buy, but it has
been a force behind some changes in how these sites approach their
business.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of the Epinions service, for instance, is that
it both rewards and rates product reviewers, in hopes of giving
them enough incentive to provide useful opinions. Anyone can sign
up to give advice on products that fit into the site's 12
categories, and prospective shoppers can browse through the reviews
and rate them on a scale from ``not useful'' to ``very useful.'' To
build credibility _ and eliminate suspicions that they are merely
company shills in disguise _ advisers can build a page on the site
with photos and personal information.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff is aimed at both the reviewer's wallet and ego.
Reviewers earn royalties of from one to three dollars for every 10
times their review is read by an Epinions member, and their picture
might be featured on the front page of the site if their reviews
are widely read.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nirav Tolia, a company co-founder, the site relies
on a so-called ``web of trust'' in which users, reviewers and
advisers tend over time to be matched up with people whose opinions
they have come to trust. ``It mimics the way word-of-mouth works in
the real world,'' Tolia said.
</P>
<P>
   When word-of-mouth recommendations result in a sale, Epinions
earns an undisclosed referral fee from merchants who pay to have
links displayed in areas where their product categories are
discussed. Epinions also earns money by displaying banner
advertisements on its pages, and can charge higher advertising
rates than general information sites _ between $30 and $70 for
every thousand banner ads displayed _ since advertisers know they
are reaching buyers more qualified than the general surfing public.
</P>
<P>
   Tolia said the company also earned money by licensing its
service to other e-commerce sites like Lycos, which included the
Epinions service in the new Lycoshop. ``It's hard to find people
who've actually walked the same path you're walking when you're
looking for a product,'' said Jeff Bennett, vice president for
e-commerce at Lycos. ``Epinions is very good when it comes to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, like Productopia.com and Deja.com, have offered
recommendations from users for months, building expansive archives
of reviews across hundreds of categories of goods. But those sites
do not compensate contributors for their opinions _ at least not
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Phillips, Deja.com's chief executive, said the company
planned to use both a rating and a reward system for reviewers in
the near future. The reward system ``could involve ego
gratification,'' he said, rather than financial incentives.
``There's a way to do both successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Neal, Productopia's chief executive, said his company had
no plans to compensate consumers who post reviews, since it already
pays professional product reviewers to post recommendations on its
site. ``We'd rather have people doing it for the normal reasons
they post on message boards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One question about the business model of these sites is whether
the quality of the user reviews is enough to attract a lot of
visitors on an ongoing basis. Phillips, of Deja.com, acknowledged
that the responses can be mixed, but said the current quality of
reviews on his site ``is pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly get some three-word reviews that are insipid,''
he said, ``but anyone who's put any effort into it usually has
something worthwhile to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is objectivity. These sites purport to be more
objective than retailers that offer user opinions. But some
question whether sites that accept commissions, referral fees or
advertising can deliver worthwhile information, even if it is
provided by individuals with no vested interest in the products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since these sites derive revenue from transactions that result
from people responding to an opinion, it ultimately raises a
question of bias,'' said Andrew Bartels, an e-commerce analyst with
Giga Information Group, a consulting firm. Unscrupulous sites could
prominently display reviews that favor certain products, for
instance, and gain higher transaction fees for those products. ``It
could be that the only way to get true, unbiased opinions is for
users to pay for it,'' Bartels said.
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips, of Deja.com, disagrees. ``I don't buy that
argument,'' he said. ``We have no incentive to do anything except
try to make this valuable for consumers. The primary relationships
we have are with marketers who sell all of the products across a
category, so we don't do any better on one product versus
another.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one company is betting that consumers are willing to
pay for advice, although the services offered generally do not
focus on purchase decisions. Exp.com, introduced last month,
enables consumers to buy advice and services on topics ranging from
career planning and tax shelters to what type of roses to plant.
According to Mark Benning, the company's president, the site allows
users to rate the performance of its advisers, and takes a 20
percent cut of whatever the advisers charge.
</P>
<P>
   The service is unusual in that users contact the expert with a
specific question or request, and negotiate a fee before the advice
is given. ``So they get a much more personalized response,''
Benning said.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen, however, whether the arrangement will pay
off for those who offer their services for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Walworth, for instance, is a horticulture consultant and
columnist in Idaho who joined Exp.com in the late summer. She said
demand has been light, even though she often charges as little as
$5 for a short consultation _ and sometimes gives flower-buying
advice for free. ``Let's be real here: At that rate, I'm not going
to Europe any time soon,'' she said. ``But I got into this business
to help people.''
</P>
<P>
   Exp.com's motives, on the other hand, are decidedly more
profit-minded. Benning said he was optimistic that the company
could operate in the black, given what he has seen so far. ``We've
done thousands of transactions in just a month,'' he said. ``We're
pretty pleased with that.'' &QL;

NEW MUSIC-TRIVIA SHOW ENCOURAGES WEB AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EVELYN ELLISON TWITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the media industry's latest attempt to attain true
convergence of television and the Internet, MTV plans to start a
music-trivia game show in which viewers can play along by logging
onto MTV's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The program, ``Web Riot,'' has its debut late next month, but
MTV plans to begin ramping up promotion for it Monday and to let
potential players begin downloading the requisite PC software from
the MTV.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   As MTV prepares for the program's premiere on Nov. 29, media
executives _ particularly advertisers _ will be waiting for MTV to
prove that the time for convergence has finally arrived _ even if
the estimated 44 percent of American households with Internet
access is still far below the nearly 80 percent that subscribe to
cable or satellite television services that carry MTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can give us a good indication of the realities of
multitasking,'' said Bill Cella, executive vice president for
broadcasting and programming with the advertising firm of
McCann-Erickson Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Some 23 percent of U.S. households have a television and
personal computer in the same room, according to a survey of 1,166
households released in June 1999 by Paul Kagan Associates, a media
research and consulting firm. The survey was conducted with
Showtime Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   During the half-hour program each weekday afternoon, up to
25,000 ``Web Riot'' viewers, watching both their television and
personal computer screens, will be able to play along with four
on-air contestants.
</P>
<P>
   MTV will show clips from music videos and then multiple-choice
questions on television. Participants at home will use the numbers
on their computer keyboard to log their answers.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the game, the show will scroll the player
nicknames of the top 10 online contestants across the television,
and they will win prizes.
</P>
<P>
   MTV, a division of Viacom Inc., considers itself well positioned
to test this approach to convergence because of the demographic
profile of its audience: people 12 to 34 years old. (For legal
reasons, MTV is requiring viewers to be at least 13 years old to
play.)
</P>
<P>
   MTV's research indicates that 51 percent of its audience members
between 12 and 24 years old have Internet access, compared with 43
percent of the general public in that age group, and that many of
the networks' viewers often watch the cable channel while surfing
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two experiences seem to live comfortably together in
their lives,'' said Judy McGrath, president of MTV. ``So this is
the first time we're going to really try to shake that notion and
see if it's true in a very real way.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV is not the only company trying to make convergence work.
Since September, angling for a different demographic segment, Walt
Disney Company's ABC and ESPN networks have been offering Enhanced
TV, an online complement to the networks' coverage of National
Football League games. While watching the televised game on ESPN or
ABC, a viewer can also log onto the ESPN.com, ABC.com or NFL.com
Web sites for various forms of audience participation.
</P>
<P>
   One feature allows fans to predict the ball handler before each
live play from scrimmage. Players can compare their scores with
those of others nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Web Riot'' is successful, it could spur other television
game shows to create interactive components. ABC, for example, is
already exploring online options for its hit quiz show ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire?,'' said Jonathan Leess, vice president of
enhanced television at Buena Vista Internet Group, Disney's
Internet division.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   MTV has been dabbling in convergent programming for more than
three years. The discontinued ``Yak Live,'' for example, allowed
viewers to chat online about videos as they played on television
and scrolled their conversations across the TV screen. Last May,
the network held a charity auction that was conducted on the Ebay
Web site but was coordinated with televised programming.
</P>
<P>
   MTV plans to place ``Web RIOT'' at 5 p.m. on weekdays, right
after the network's popular ``Total Request Live,'' a daily
countdown of the top videos as chosen by viewers who have voted by
telephone and on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The host for the new show will be Ahmet Zappa, who in the past
has been co-host for ``MTV Live'' and USA Network's ``Happy Hour''
with his brother, Dweezil Zappa.
</P>
<P>
   MTV's technology partner is Spiderdance Inc., an Internet media
company that creates mass-participation online programming, to
synchronize answers on television and computer screens. No special
software, beyond a standard Web browser, is required.
</P>
<P>
   If it catches on, combining television programming with an
Internet component, holds various implications. Advertisers, for
example, might benefit from the apparent ease of pushing consumers
to Internet links where they can register their interest or
immediately buy a product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It presents the product in a seamless manner,'' said Kristian
Magel, vice president for national broadcasting at Dewitt Media
Inc., who advised the automaker BMW to buy a banner ad on ESPN's
online program during ``Sunday Night Football.'' With an online ad
costing less than 1 percent of a television spot, Magel said, the
thinking was ``why not just do it?''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, Web interaction gives television programmers and
their advertisers a wealth of information about viewers who
participate, including how long and how often they visit the site,
whether they click on ads and whether they make purchases online.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great boons of interactive media is that marketers
can learn a lot more about their customers than they ever could
before,'' said Aram Sinnreich, an analyst with Jupiter
Communications, a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   MTV says it intends to collect only the first names, ages and
e-mail addresses of contestants, but will also gather the addresses
and phone numbers of the prize winners.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to the privacy implications, the company does not plan
to sell this information to outsiders, said Rick Holzman, vice
president for programming and promotion at MTV Interactive Online.
</P>
<P>
   ```Web Riot' is just another way to get people to interact with
our brands in a meaningful way,'' he said.

<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ It was not yet 8:30 on a Saturday morning,
but as soon as Kara Beverly climbed aboard Amtrak train No. 84 in
Washington, she had Ralph Ellison's ``Invisible Man'' open on her
lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long is this train, eight hours?'' wondered Ms. Beverly, a
17-year-old senior at Elizabeth Seton High School in Prince Georges
County, Md. ``Great. I can finish this book and write my essay.''
Then she scanned the seats in the car reserved by Brown University
for this special recruitment trip to its campus here. ``Are there
any chemistry people here?'' she asked no one in particular.
</P>
<P>
   There were, indeed, plenty of thick chemistry textbooks tucked
inside the backpacks that crowded the overhead bins. Physics, too.
And calculus. It was a train full of students balancing Advanced
Placement courses with responsibilities for the National Honor
Society, teen-agers who had scored 1300 (out of a possible 1600) on
their SATs but were retaking them this fall in hopes of even higher
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   There was another thing that stood out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' marveled Joe Williams, as he boarded the train in New
Carrollton, Md. ``Everybody's black.''
</P>
<P>
   In the increasingly competitive environment of applying to elite
colleges, the still small number of high-achieving African-American
students are among the most coveted _ wooed with free trips to
campuses, personal attention from administrators and alumni, and a
bevy of scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   The battles over affirmative action that have led many
institutions to back away from giving preferences to minority
applicants have intensified these recruiting efforts as colleges
seek ways to keep their campuses racially mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top minority students are recruited like rock stars,
they're really courted,'' said Esther Hugo, coordinator of
multicultural affairs for the National Association of College
Admissions Counselors. ``They are treated in a way they were never
treated before.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 100 students hopping aboard this train as it trudged up
the East Coast for a weekend of getting-to-know-you programs called
the Black Experience at Brown, the free ticket is flattering and
flirtatious, part of a courtship that began during junior year and
will stretch into spring.
</P>
<P>
   Some had already been eyeing the institution for its open
curriculum or eight-year medical program, while others had never
even considered it until the invitation arrived. Many aboard the
train will be the first in their families to attend a selective
college, and said that the chance to see what Ivy League life was
like, to camp in dormitories and tromp through late-night parties,
was an invaluable opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But as the foliage outside the windows grew more colorful, it
became clear that the trek north, in itself, was a key part of the
experience. A few students recognized one another _ from last
month's free plane trip to Washington University in St. Louis, or
last summer's minority student program at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology _ yet it was the camaraderie among total
strangers that was striking.
</P>
<P>
   They traded calculators and compact discs, mixing talk of
homework and hip-hop, exulting in the rare experience of being
together for who they are: smart, overachieving and black. Talk of
race was blatant and honest, as young people who had never met
before shared the same language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only black male in all of my classes,'' said Taylor
Keitt, 17, a football player at Central High School in Philadelphia
who was counting on scholarships for academics, not athletics.
``It's good to see so many of us trying to set ourselves high.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of qualified blacks out there,'' Taylor added
with a nod toward the affirmative-action debate. ``You don't have
to lower standards, just go and find them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like having to choose at all,'' Chantel Lee, 17, who
has one white parent and one black, said to another light-skinned
girl, Elizabeth Todd of Silver Spring, Md. ``I am what I am.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm not `other,''' added Elizabeth, referring to a racial
category on forms.
</P>
<P>
   The search for these youngsters begins with the first round of
standardized tests, when alongside the overall list of National
Merit Scholars come targeted lists of black and Hispanic students
with high scores. Those are the ones that Brown, and other schools
with similar programs, singles out for special perks like this
trip.
</P>
<P>
   The students hail from fancy private schools like Hotchkiss and
Spence and from magnet public schools, like Stuyvesant in New York
and Eleanor Roosevelt in suburban Washington. Few are from
low-performing inner-city public high schools where the vast
majority of black Americans attend school. Most are from working-
or middle-class families and are worried far more about financial
aid than about getting admitted.
</P>
<P>
   While Ivy League schools offer financial aid based only on need,
historically black colleges, state universities with honors
programs, and other select institutions also flood these students'
mailboxes with information about special scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Humphries, the president of Florida Agricultural and
Mechanical University, has personally flown to visit individual
applicants in his quest to lure more of these students than Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started her 10th-grade year,'' said Laura Nichols of
Manassas, Va., as she dropped her daughter, Tiffany, at Union
Station in Washington to catch the train. ``We get phone calls all
the time, maybe six or seven a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Admissions officers say students are much more likely to apply
to, and eventually attend, campuses they have visited. Ms. Hugo,
currently the outreach counselor at Santa Monica College, recalled
that when she worked at Westchester High School in Los Angeles, a
student who had already decided to go to a local women's college
nonetheless accepted free plane tickets to several campuses,
including Carleton College in Minnesota, which spends about $20,000
a year subsidizing visits by minority students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her why she took the trips,'' Ms. Hugo said. ``She
said, `Well, it's free travel, free food, so I thought I'd try it
out.''' The young woman ended up at Carleton (Ms. Hugo helped raise
money to buy her a winter wardrobe).
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose student body is about 7 percent black, started its
program nine years ago. Over the last five years, 75 percent of
those who attended the weekend and applied for admission were
accepted, compared with 32 percent of black applicants overall.

</P>
<P>
   On this year's train, there were students like Etsub Berhanu of
Silver Spring, Md., who is putting the finishing touches on her
application for early admission to Brown, due Nov. 1. ``I've
written it all, I just have to fit this in,'' Etsub explained,
referring to the present trip. ``I'm going to talk about how this
experience has helped me want to go to Brown. I hope it does.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Shaun Koiner, who attends a Roman Catholic
school in Washington and had already visited 22 campuses (after 15,
he said, they started to blur together); a certain campus in
Providence was not exactly prominent on his list.
</P>
<P>
   Two black Brown seniors trolled the train to answer questions.
Are there black engineering students? Do they have classes in
Capoeira, a Brazilian martial art? Is it colder than New York?
How's the food? (``Remember, it's known for its health,'' one
student said unconvincingly. ``There's salt and pepper on every
table,'' offered the other.) One girl wanted to meet the track
coach, another was interested in singing. Why did you decide to go
to Brown, they asked over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of pressure,'' said Maya Martin, who lives in
Philadelphia, and spent the train ride being distracted from her
book, Aldous Huxley's ``Brave New World,'' by friendly boys.
``They're really depending on me to get a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Leah Tucker, Maya's seat mate, said she felt guilty because her
parents had already paid for her tuition at Philadelphia's
Germantown Friends School. ``If I get in everywhere that I apply,''
she asked rhetorically, ``do I have to go where I get a merit
scholarship?''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the weekend, the students were to be entertained by
various cultural groups on campus, invited to parties at a black
sorority and at Harambee House, a dorm where black students gather,
and to a discussion of the ``racial and sexual politics'' of ``He
Got Game,'' a Spike Lee movie. Brown's minority community was out
in force, putting on its best face, and the nervous high school
seniors were struggling to see where they would fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to visit Yale _ I was planning on applying early _ the
diversity just wasn't there,'' said Diana Bradshaw, who goes to New
Rochelle High School in New York state. ``If they have a minority
weekend, you know they care.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic
Council, assistant to the president for economic policy and
legendary workaholic, was alternating between Diet Coke and coffee
at 10 p.m. last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He was trying to reflect on his life, at the behest of a
reporter, but the final negotiations on legislation to overhaul the
nation's financial services industry were playing out on Capitol
Hill, and Sperling was in the thick of it. So periodically an
assistant would come to the door to announce an important phone
call from Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers or the like,
requiring Sperling to retreat, take the call, return and then try
to slip back into cosmic mode.
</P>
<P>
   For example, why has he endured, when so many of the other
Clinton whiz kids have not?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you ask, what keeps somebody here, it really is that
knowledge that you may never have the opportunity to have this kind
of impact again in your life,'' he said, somewhat wistfully. ``And
that you have a chance, at times, to do good things for people who
may not have the power to be at the table.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Wall Street bill, Sperling was fighting to
preserve lending rules for the disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   He worried, a moment later, about sounding self-important; in
reality, as he reminisced about the great economic battles of the
Clinton years, he sounded like one of the last true believers. Most
of the rest of the Clinton believers are gone now _ feeling burned
out or betrayed or simply ready for something new. Sperling is
enmeshed in his seventh season of budgetary combat.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling's job, previously held by Robert Rubin and Laura
D'Andrea Tyson, puts him in the center of the administration's
economic agenda; he brings a deeply political background to it. In
addition to his key role in last week's banking negotiations,
Sperling is a prime strategist on the administration's latest
Social Security move, to try to shore up the program with projected
federal budget surpluses and _ not coincidentally _ prevent the
Republicans from seizing the political high ground.
</P>
<P>
   In the first Clinton administration, Sperling was deputy
director of the National Economic Council, and in the trenches for
the epic budget battles of 1993 and 1995. He was economic policy
director for the Clinton campaign in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   One of the advantages of his longevity, he says, is his
relationship with the president. ``You know where his policy vision
and his heart is,'' Sperling said. ``And he knows you know where
his policy vision and his heart is.'' Part of that, he said, is
simply being there from the beginning, understanding how things
happened.
</P>
<P>
   He is 40 now, much better dressed than he used to be, and no
longer carrying the perennial air of a grad student the day after
an all-nighter. He has his workaholic tendencies under better
control, he suggests. ``Definitely have eased up some, but it's
still at times too much.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``W'' magazine recently declared the never-married
Sperling ``one of the hottest catches on the Washington social
scene'' and ``an unusually likable policy wonk.'' (This caused no
end of amusement at the White House, including a ``Dating
Game''-style introduction by one of his colleagues in the press
briefing room one day: ``He loves tennis, rapid GDP growth and
romantic midnight walks on West Executive Drive.'')
</P>
<P>
   Sperling also recently betrayed a touch of midlife crisis,
deciding to go bungee-jumping in the gorge where it was invented
while on a presidential visit to New Zealand. ``It was a personal,
conquer-your-fears challenge by a person who's seriously afraid of
heights,'' he said. The president was amused, Sperling said. ``My
mother, who had rearranged vacations in the past so we didn't have
to drive on high mountain roads, was completely mystified,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Sperling is still the same passionately political policy
wonk that he was in 1988, when he was happily spinning campaign
reporters about the virtues of the college loan program proposed by
Michael Dukakis, then the Democratic nominee for president. When
asked about his best moments in the White House, Sperling tended
toward budgets, like the passage of the 1993 agreement, ``the sense
that after all the campaign battling over the budget, you'd been
part of a team that had actually done something significant, in
terms of deficit reduction, in terms of the earned income tax
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked his worst moment, he cited 1995, when the Republicans
had just taken over Congress: ``the fear that very important
protections in Medicaid, the earned income tax credit and food
stamps would be undermined on your watch.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of four children of a lawyer and a teacher, Sperling grew up
in Ann Arbor, Mich., went to the University of Minnesota on a
tennis scholarship, received his law degree from Yale and attended
Wharton Business School. He was one of a generation of young
Democrats who came of age during the Reagan years, and yearned to
bring their party back to power with policies that broadened its
appeal, particularly an economic message that could embrace both
strong private sector growth and strong federal spending on social
policy.
</P>
<P>
   He was a policy aide in the Dukakis campaign and an economic
advisor to former Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York before joining the
Clinton campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As the interview was ending late Thursday night, Sperling
returned one last time to the question about his best moments in
the White House. What it came down to, he said, was ``that special
sense of camaraderie that you feel with certain people, when you
have a mission and a cause you believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   There seemed to be a lot of ghosts in the room, from Robert
Rubin to George Stephanopoulos. Earlier, Sperling acknowledged that
he missed them.

NEW INDONESIAN PRESIDENT TO INCLUDE SUHARTO ALLIES IN CABINET 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Map is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In his first speech since surprisingly
winning office last week, President Abdurrahman Wahid conceded
Sunday that he would have to include members of President Suharto's
discredited administration in the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling to the island of Bali, where supporters of his rival,
Megawati Suharnoputri, erupted in violence after he defeated her
for the presidency, he also declared that the unity of this
disparate and sprawling island nation was so important that he and
Ms. Suharnoputri would take charge of putting down pro-independence
rebellions in three regions.
</P>
<P>
   The blunt admission that Wahid's Cabinet will include members of
the party once led by Suharto, who was forced from office in May
1998 after 32 years in power, was the clearest indication yet from
Wahid that he snatched the presidency from Ms. Megawati with votes
from the Suharto party, Golkar. The party was left without a
candidate in the presidential race last week after Suharto's much
criticized successor, B.J. Habibie, withdrew at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``To attain the presidency, I have to make compromises,'' he
said, speaking to academics and businessmen at a conference in
Bali. ``But please be assured that although they will be included
in the Cabinet, I will make it that they should follow our code: to
follow the current government's interests in honesty, frankness
and, most important, our economic development.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had asked his new vice president., Mrs. Megawati, to
be in charge of efforts to deal with the violent conflicts in
Ambon, in the Spice Islands, and in Irian Jaya, the scene of a
separatist rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would personally handle the Islamic separatist
rebellion in the Sumatran province of Aceh, where he commands
respect as a Muslim leader. That rebellion, which could encourage
similar movements elsewhere, is seen as the most dangerous threat
to Indonesia's national unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will also concentrate on making Indonesia unified again,''
he said. ``Look at Ambon. The Christians and the Muslims massacre
each other. It's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Wahid said that the key to prosperity and social
peace was an improved economy and that the two key words for an
improved economy were ``foreign investment.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks, delivered in English, were unscripted and did not
appear to be an attempt to outline a complete agenda for his
government. But they confirmed early assessments that he would seek
to repair the widening schisms in society and to put together a
broad-based governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In separate remarks to local residents, he hinted at more open
human rights policies, saying he has demanded an investigation of a
police rampage on the day of his election in which officers
vandalized parts of a hospital in a search for wounded protesters.
</P>
<P>
   At the conference, he said some of his ideas for reforms _
including a more independent judicial system and greater autonomy
for regional governments _were aimed at least in part at attracting
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will concentrate on economic development for Indonesia,'' he
said. ``Many of the problems of the past were because of mistakes
in policy; we didn't stress the need to increase incomes for the
people.'' He said many Indonesians subsisted on ``inhuman
incomes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said renewed economic growth would help to overcome problems
of continuing civil unrest, corruption and discontent in the armed
forces.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In part because of the political crisis that has paralyzed it
for months, Indonesia remains in a deep economic slump even as
other Asian nations are showing early signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Before the regional crisis struck Indonesia two years ago, the
country had experienced more than a decade of some of the world's
most impressive economic growth. That was the primary achievement
of Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid returned to a theme he emphasized in his brief inaugural
address after his election on Wednesday: that Indonesia demands
greater respect from foreign nations, which have criticized its
economic policies, human rights record and handling of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, our honor as a nation, our independence, was
attacked in a brutal way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He signaled a broad reorientation of Indonesian foreign policy
toward closer relations with its regional neighbors, saying he
planned soon to visit 12 Asian countries, including China, Japan
and India.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in what seemed to reflect a personal agenda, he said, ``I
regret that I cannot to go Israel at this time, but I hope in the
future I will go there.'' He said he hoped that Indonesia, the
world's most populous Muslim country, would open economic ties with
Israel, although, he added, ``I don't think I will open diplomatic
ties.
</P>
<P>
   His insistence on improving relations with Israel, which he has
visited in the past, reflected his tolerant brand of Islam and was
certain to arouse strong opposition among some Muslims in this
nation of more than 200 million people.

SELECTIVE ROAD-SHOW REVIEWS ON IPO OFFERINGS UNDER REVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the two weeks before they issue stock to the public, company
executives often make an exhausting round of meetings across the
country, sometimes the world _ in what is called a road show.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers with billions of dollars at their disposal get a
chance to speak face to face to the people to whom they plan to
entrust some of that money. And in question-and-answer sessions,
they can see how well a chief executive knows the business and how
he performs in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   But this longtime practice of giving sophisticated investors a
preview, and sometimes useful nuggets of information beyond the
public documents, is being challenged now that Webvan, an online
grocer, has postponed its initial stock offering. Webvan was forced
to delay its plans a few weeks ago after a reporter for
TheStreet.com listened by telephone to a road-show presentation and
reported the company had made significant statements not included
in its public filings.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is on the radar screen of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. In remarks last week, the SEC's chairman, Arthur
Levitt, said that road shows should not be forums for providing a
different look at a company than what is in its prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate is part of a larger issue: the unequal disclosure
of material information. In his remarks, Levitt stepped up an
attack on selective disclosure, a practice in which companies brief
some analysts about financial data, like earnings details, before
the public release. He urged companies to let all investors take
part in conference calls about important information.
</P>
<P>
   In the Webvan episode, the fact that it involved an Internet
company and Internet reporter is almost incidental. And yet the
Internet does figure into the rising debate over who should be
invited to these road-show meetings and what material should be
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   After all, online trading is encouraging more and more people to
take an active role in their stock-market investments. And use of
the Internet allows the distribution of financial information to be
quicker and wider than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, only so many people could fit into a conference room
for a road-show meeting. And even a telephone conference call, it
could be argued, might become too expensive and disruptive if a
large number of individuals were to chime in. But these days,
so-called Webcasting technology can enable anyone with an Internet
connection to listen in on a conference call, if the company wants
to make it public _ as many Internet-savvy companies have begun to
do with their quarterly-earnings calls to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of initial public offerings, securities law does not
preclude individuals from taking part in road shows. But it does
make far-flung participation virtually prohibitive, because SEC
rules permit more liberal discussion of a company in person than
they do when communication is by radio, television, phone or the
Internet. Companies that have filed for a public stock offering
must publish all information material to their business in public
documents. But they may clarify or elaborate in oral
communications. As a former SEC official put it, the companies add
``melody to the lyrics'' of the prospectus in the road show.
</P>
<P>
   Written communication is limited to what appears in the
prospectus _ hence the term ``quiet period'' to refer to the time
just before a new stock offering. And yet, some companies have
successfully appealed to the commission to let them broadcast their
road-show presentations by phone and on a limited basis over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Congress gave the commission broad power to change the rules
three years ago, and the SEC is now proposing that companies have
the same latitude in broadcast communications that they have in
oral communication during the so-called quiet period.The proposals
are part of a controversial overhaul of rules governing new stock
offerings, which has been opened to public comment. The proposals
would not require such public access, but would allow it.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the current system say that opening road shows to
everyone could cause chief executives to clam up, for fear that
their comments may lead to shareholder lawsuits. This new wariness,
this argument goes, might be a subtle but key impediment to new
companies' ability to raise capital.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the debate pits an information-age drive to give all
investors equal access against many companies' desire to conduct
private forums with the sophisticated investors who dominate the
financial markets. ``What we're seeing is a collision between the
traditional idea of a quiet period and the pressure being put on
the system by technology,'' said William R. McLucas of the
Washington law firm of Wilmer Cutler &AMP; Pickering, a former SEC
enforcement director.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of more openness say individuals should have a chance
to perform exactly the same sniff test on a new stock that big
investors do.
</P>
<P>
   David L. Menlow, editor of the newsletter IPO Frontline, said
television interviews with chief executives after a company comes
out of its quite period, appearances that can often move stock
prices, are a clear indication that investors do place importance
on how a company's leader looks and sounds. And that, Menlow said,
is evidence they could gather earlier if they had access to the
road show.
</P>
<P>
   Menlow says it is not unusual for companies, as Webvan did, to
offer nuggets of information that could prove useful to any
investor. ``Why should the institutions have the advantage?'' he
said. ``I'm incensed the investment banking community has gone
unchallenged. It and the SEC have exercised complete control and
kept out the media and small investors.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of opening up the road show say the prospect
raises two practical considerations. First, individual investors
listening to the meetings may not have the sophistication to
distinguish salesmanship from salient material. In the prospectus,
the risks of the venture are completely laid out, but they
typically are not spelled out in a road show. This, in turn, leads
to the concern about the possible proliferation of lawsuits. If
investors feel misled during a road show by an executive's
implication, wink, nod, or other suggestion of success, and the
stock plummets, plaintiffs' lawyers could get plenty of extra work.
</P>
<P>
   That is why big investors tend to worry that opening up a road
show would force executives to stick to the script of the
prospectus, and hinder the ability of institutions to get the
information they need to make investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred R. Berkeley, president of the Nasdaq market, who says he
has attended several hundred road shows, generally favors broader
access. But he said any change had to be incremental, adding, ``My
concern is that the demand for mouths to open will actually have
the effect of causing mouths to close.''

`JURASSIC PARK' AUTHOR TO GET BOX OFFICE PERCENTAGE FOR NEXT FILM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Viacom's Paramount Pictures studio has made an
unusual deal with author Michael Crichton for his newest novel.
Instead of collecting millions of dollars by selling the rights to
the studio, Crichton has opted to take a sizable percentage of the
box office receipts.
</P>
<P>
   While film stars and top directors have, at times, signed such
deals, studio executives said they could not recall a similar deal
with a novelist.
</P>
<P>
   The book is ``Timeline,'' to be published soon by Alfred A.
Knopf, a unit of Bertelsmann. Galleys for the novel have circulated
for several weeks among Hollywood studios, which mostly passed on
the novel. The story involves an architect, a historian and a
medievalist who travel back in time and are in danger of being
stuck in the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   Crichton's manager, AMG Entertainment, whose owner, Michael
Ovitz, shaped the deal, also stipulated that another client,
Richard Donner, who directed the ``Lethal Weapon'' series, make the
film.
</P>
<P>
   Together the two, as well as Lauren Shuler-Donner, the producer
and Donner's wife, may share about 15 percent of the ``first dollar
gross,'' or initial box office receipts, for the movie, studio
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely how much the team will receive _ and earn _ was left
unclear. Some people involved in the arrangement said the
percentage might be higher. But studio executives said that once
Crichton and the Donners earned their customary fees _ Donner earns
as much as $10 million a film _ the box office percentage would
drop.
</P>
<P>
   Crichton has a generally strong, though not entirely successful,
track record in Hollywood. ``Jurassic Park'' and ``Disclosure''
were made into successful films. His last novel, ``Air Frame,''
about an imperiled female aerospace worker investigating a
cover-up, was sold more than two years ago for about $9 million to
Walt Disney Co., one of the highest sums ever paid for a novel. But
the project, after several scripts, seems to be foundering, studio
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   To top directors and stars, earning a hefty percentage of the
box office can turn into a financial bonanza. Tom Hanks and Steven
Spielberg, for example, received relatively little money at the
start of making ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which was seen as a
commercially risky film. But the movie has been a worldwide
success. Hanks earned $30 million or more, while Spielberg brought
home at minimum $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, but on a far smaller scale, the stars and director of
``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' earned millions of dollars each
when the film proved highly successful.

   LONDON _ Sitting pensive in his wood-paneled office here, Graham
Wallace dismissed the constant whispers among investors and
analysts around London's financial district _ the rumors that his
far-flung global telecommunications company Cable and Wireless is
ripe for a takeover and ready to sell out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no interest in that,'' Wallace said, blithely waving
his hand. ``Sure I get calls every day. And I tell all of them the
same thing. I say that we have a completely viable stand-alone
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he paused, hedging his words and almost daring his
rivals to make a hostile bid. ``If those guys want to do different
things in the marketplace,'' Wallace continued, ``then that's their
affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Since February, when he was promoted to the top job at Cable and
Wireless after Richard Brown left to become chief of Electronic
Data Systems in the United States, Wallace has been busily trying
to put his company's house in order.
</P>
<P>
   But meanwhile, the broader telecommunications industry has been
going through a whirlwind of merger-and-acquisition activity in the
United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom is in the midst of buying Sprint in the largest
acquisition in history. Mannesmann, Germany's fast-growing
engineering and telecommunications group, just announced it was
buying Orange PLC, Britain's third-largest mobile phone operator.
Global Crossing, the Bermuda-based upstart acquired Britain's Racal
Telecommunications two weeks ago. And France Telecom said it would
acquire 60 percent of the E-Plus wireless telephone network from
two major German utility companies, Veba and RWE.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, seeming to sit on the sidelines, has been
Cable and Wireless, the century-old British telecommunications
concern with a scattering of motley interests all over the world.
No wonder investment bankers here are quietly eyeing the company
and making lists of possible partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are probably the perennial favorite to be taken over or
broken up, but so far no one has bit,'' said Patrick Steiner, a
telecommunications analyst at Chase in London. ``Their varied
collection of assets makes it hard for a single buyer to justify
buying them.''
</P>
<P>
   That perception has plagued Cable and Wireless for years, not
only in terms of a potential acquisition, but even in terms of
assigning a value to the company. Cable and Wireless has major
holdings in at least 10 countries _ the largest being its stake in
Hong Kong Telecom, which remains a major question mark in the minds
of potential investors because it is partially owned by China's
state telephone company, China Telecom. The company also has its
own network in Britain and throughout parts of Europe, along with a
major Internet backbone in the United States that it acquired from
MCI last year.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of a company with a global presence might sound
appealing to a telecommunications firm looking to expand its
worldwide network, but Cable and Wireless' holdings are almost too
worldwide. ``For a European player, they may have no interest in
Japan; the same goes for a Japanese player who has no interest in
Europe,'' Steiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace has been doing some major house-cleaning himself in
recent months as he tries to reposition the company away from its
consumer businesses toward a focus strictly on business customers,
which tends to be a market with higher profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   The most noteworthy divestiture was its sale in late July of the
consumer business of Cable and Wireless Communications, including
its telephone, cable and Internet properties, to NTL Inc. for $13.2
billion. And then about two weeks later it sold its 50 percent
stake in the British mobile telephone provider One 2 One for $5.78
billion, to Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   [On Sunday, Cable and Wireless said that it would sell its
holdings in Bezeq Ltd., Israel's state-controlled phone company, to
a local investor for $630 million.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to create shareholder value,'' Wallace said. ``The
business market is simply a better business. We lose nothing and
gain everything by making these sales. When we're finished we will
be the new-age telco.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts tend to think the strategy is on the right course,
though some believe the company must either acquire another company
or be acquired if it has any chance of being a major player in an
industry that continues to consolidate. At the very least, analysts
said, Cable and Wireless may need an alliance or partnership in
order to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts interviewed for this article spoke on the
condition of anonymity, because almost every major bank in London
is either doing some sort of work for Cable and Wireless or is
representing a competitor. ``They don't have enough cash to do a
big, big deal,'' one said. ``But by all means they've got to do
something sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the possible suitors for Cable and Wireless, many analysts
see Deutsche Telekom as a likely candidate because its other
options have begun to dwindle as many of Europe's major
telecommunications companies have already been gobbled up.
``Deutche Telekom may just decide to do a major transaction because
it wants to,'' Steiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Other interested parties, analysts and investment bankers said,
could be MCI Worldcom, which is eager for a worldwide presence.
``MCI is busy doing the Sprint deal,'' another analyst observed.
``But when they finish, CW could be their next target.''
</P>
<P>
   Among British telecommunications companies, the mobile phone
player Vodaphone Airtouch, which already has an alliance with Cable
and Wireless, could be a front-runner to acquire the company as a
way to gain access to a worldwide land-line network. Analysts and
investment bankers also point out that, at least in Britain, the
companies could get regulatory approval because they operate
different businesses. British Telecommunications is also frequently
mentioned, but many analysts see major regulatory hurdles to such a
merger, because the two companies have overlapping and competing
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, at least, Wallace insists on sticking to his
go-it-alone script.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm skeptical about alliances,'' he said. ``Give me stunning
example of a partnership in the telecom world, and I give you a
long list that haven't worked.''

   FALLING FROM THE SKY
</P>
<P>
   Part Two of a six-part investigative series by The Dayton Daily
News on the the recent rise in military air crashes and their
causes. The Daily News found that the U.S. military routinely sends
planes and helicopters in the air that it knows are plagued with
deadly safety problems. The series is based in part on
never-before-seen information from three databases from the Army,
Navy and Air Force safety centers.
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-METAL _ A type of metal is in the middle of an
investigation involving a series of crashes of the Army's CH47
Chinook helicopter. The story came to light when a whistle-blower,
working at a former factory in Springfield, Ohio, found flaws in a
metal used to construct gears that power the helicopter's huge
rotor blades. Investigators now suspect that seven crashes may be
linked to the metal. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-ROUTE _ ATLANTA _ An intercontinental shift in the illegal
drug business is having ripple effects along Interstate 20 in metro
Atlanta. Police say they are seizing more drugs than ever on the
east-west route, which originates near the Mexican border and gives
smugglers a straight shot out of Texas. (Farber, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   MISS-MILLENNIUM _ AUSTIN, Texas _ We missed the millennium, UT
Prof Howard Miller reminds us. Historians differ on when Christ was
born, but the most generally accepted date, historian Miller says
is minus-4 BC. That means we should have celebrated in 1996. Or in
2001. Anyway, Dec. 31, 1999 is definitely not the dawn of a new
millennium. But Miller, who has made a study of such things, says
that popular culture has taken a hold of this and that, along with
the Y2K computer bug and religious-based jitters about the end of
the millennium, has everyone in this tizzy. A step-back look at
what is about to befall us. (Copelin, Austin American-Statesman)

   HAM-SHORTAGE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There's a worldwide
shortage of hams. Not those canned pork products, and not theater
bugs, but rather those amateur radio enthusiasts who, during

Palm Beach Post) MOVED

   TEACHER-TRAINING _ WASHINGTON _ In a report from the American
Council on Education, college and university presidents say they

Secretary Richard Riley and comes less than a week after NCATE, the
organization that accredits teacher education departments, also
announces tougher tests for teacher licensing. (Mollison, Cox News

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In early 1994, Brett Roby wore something special
to work at SPECO, a now-defunct factory in Springfield that
produced military aircraft parts for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   He wore a wire.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Defense investigators planted the hidden
microphone underneath Roby's clothes after he raised questions
about the safety of American soldiers flying on the CH-47D Chinook,
the U.S. Army's chief transport helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Roby, an inspector at the Springfield factory, had warned that
the metal used to make gears for the helicopter contained a common
but potentially dangerous flaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raising a lot of hell about the possibility that we had
a material that was unstable,'' said Roby, a former Dayton resident
now living in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   A team of federal investigators in Washington, D.C., and Dayton
and Roby's private attorneys in Cincinnati now suspect four
accidents that killed seven people may be linked to gears made with
the metal. Records, released after being kept under seal for years
by a federal court, show investigators also have tried to link at
least three other crashes that killed 13 people to the gears.
</P>
<P>
   And in August, more than five years after Roby went to federal
investigators, armies worldwide grounded hundreds of Chinooks after
a British Royal Air Force maintenance facility in Scotland found
grinding cracks in gear parts made with the same metal.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army initially grounded its entire fleet of 466
CH-47Ds, the most Chinooks ever put down at one time.
</P>
<P>
   The metal, Vasco X2M, was first used on helicopter gears by
Boeing, which patented a process to heat-treat the metal. Vasco was
used on gears that power the eight 25-foot rotor blades on the
Chinook, the first production aircraft to fly using the metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Boeing invented this and had the patent rights and was
trying to make a market for this material, (Boeing was) trying to
use the Chinook as a guinea pig to show that this material could be
used in aircraft applications,'' said Roby's attorney, James B.
Helmer, Jr., of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the failures of Vasco-made gears in the
CH-47D helicopters illustrates one of the most significant
anomalies in military aviation: Private aircraft companies are
allowed to help _ relied on heavily in many cases _ determine the
official causes of military aviation accidents, even though the
same companies can face up to hundreds of millions of dollars in
civil judgments and penalties that may hinge on what the official
causes of the accidents are determined to be.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, as Boeing was faced with lawsuits questioning the
safety of its products, it was allowed to examine evidence and play
other key roles in helping the Army decide if those same products
were endangering the lives of American service personnel.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, Roby filed a lawsuit against Boeing in federal
court in Cincinnati under the federal False Claims Act. The act
encourages government whistle-blowers and other citizens to report
government contractor fraud by offering a reward _ in the Roby case
up to 25 percent of what the government recovers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that Boeing, the world's largest aircraft
manufacturer, violated federal and common law because it ``sold, or
caused to be sold,'' defective helicopter gears to the Army. The
Justice Department has joined Roby in the legal action, and the
government is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars from Boeing
for the cost of destroyed or damaged helicopters and replacing
gears in existing helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   SPECO was one of four companies that made gears or gear parts
using Vasco for the CH-47D. Boeing also contracted with Litton
Precision Gears of Chicago, now Boeing Precision Gears, which used
SKF Industries of Philadelphia and MRC Bearings of Jamestown, N.Y.,
to manufacture bearings for the gears.
</P>
<P>
   Although Roby's lawsuit deals only with SPECO-made gears, the
investigation has expanded to include accidents involving aircraft
with gears made at Litton. In addition, faulty gear parts machined
at MRC are linked to the current groundings.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Army and Boeing defended Vasco.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Vasco is manufactured according to specifications and
made into gears correctly, the Army has verified that it is safe
for use in the helicopters,'' a prepared statement from the Army
says.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials deny that any Litton-made gears were linked to
crashes. They acknowledged that some SPECO gears and gear parts
machined at MRC were faulty, but they blamed the problem on human
error, not on Vasco.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, manufacturers produce faulty gears, Boeing
officials said, but inspections are supposed to identify bad gears.
Both SPECO and MRC failed to identify the problem gear parts
through inspections, the officials said, and that caused the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the problems) should have been caught,'' said Boeing
attorney Mitchell S. Ettinger of Washington, D.C., during an
interview at a Boeing's corporate office in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   John Bozogan, vice president of quality assurance and
engineering for MRC Bearings, said the company performed
inspections exactly as it was told by Boeing. But, he added: ``At
the time, Boeing was modifying the inspection requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the grinding cracks that led to the current
grounding, Bozogan said: ``We are concerned that we did not find
them.''
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAM PROMPTS SEARCH FOR STRONGER GEARS
</P>
<P>
   Following Vietnam, the military decided it needed gears that
would continue working even after a helicopter lost oil from battle
damage or mechanical problems. The military contracted with a
number of companies, and Boeing began experimenting with Vasco, a
metal invented by another company and used to make tools.
</P>
<P>
   The outer portion of aircraft gears, the case, is supposed to be
very hard, but the core needs to be softer. Vasco could maintain
its tool-steel hardness even under high temperatures and without
oil, but it was unsuitable for the inside or core.
</P>
<P>
   So Boeing changed the composition of the metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a new process,'' Ettinger said.
</P>
<P>
   SPECO, once one of the nation's leading gear manufacturers,
first used Vasco for aircraft gears in the early 1970s, when it
contracted with Boeing to produce gears for a huge military
transport helicopter prototype.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to remember that was a development program, and part
of the program was to develop Vasco,'' said Tom Stevens, who worked
at SPECO for 30 years and left as manager of contracts when the
company went out of business in 1996. ``Vasco was supposed to be a
material that provided extra strength and extra wear-capability
under high temperature conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   But the program to build the huge helicopter was canceled, and
the prototype never flew.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the 1970s, Litton used Vasco to make gears for another
Boeing military helicopter prototype. Although that prototype flew,
it was never put into production because Boeing lost the
competition to what eventually became the Blackhawk helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report from a 1977 NASA-sponsored test at the Army
Research Laboratory in Cleveland found that the teeth of gears made
with Vasco fractured during heat treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The apparent sensitivity of the modified Vasco . . . casts
doubts on the practicality of using this material at the present
time beyond laboratory and prototype testing,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing stressed that the 1977 report was preliminary and that
the test used by NASA was flawed. In a subsequent report in 1980,
NASA engineers modified their earlier conclusion, finding that
problems could be eliminated but only under a ``closely followed
and controlled'' treatment process.
</P>
<P>
   The CH-47 Chinook, first used by the Army in 1962, weighs 10
tons and stands as high as a two-story building. The helicopter can
carry up to 36 soldiers and crewmembers.
</P>
<P>
   When the program to build the huge transport helicopter was
canceled, the Army moved to upgrade its existing transport
helicopter, the Chinook, creating a D model. Boeing was selected
for the Chinook upgrade and Vasco was used for many of the gears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that Vasco was a difficult material to
process,'' said SPECO's Stevens. ``Processing Vasco required
operations not required for other material.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, five years after the first NASA test, Litton detected
grinding cracks in some of the gears, according to an October 1982
memo from Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The first crash involving the D model came less than three years
after the Boeing memo.
</P>
<P>
   On April 21, 1985, Chief Warrant Officer Alexander Brazalovich
was aboard a CH-47D Chinook on his way to a classified mission with
an unusually heavy load of fuel and personnel. Ten minutes after
landing in Honduras, as the helicopter refueled, Brazalovich knew
there was trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard an explosion, and the aircraft started rocking left to
right,'' he recalled during an interview. ``I hit my shoulders on
the side of the wall. The next thing I know I am on the ground. I
was pulled out of the aircraft because I was covered with debris.''
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter was destroyed, but the crew escaped with no major
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   An Army report found that two gear parts made of Vasco broke
into eight pieces each, and Boeing identified what it believed were
``grinding cracks'' on one of the Litton-made gears. The Army
report found that the gear problems did not cause the accident, but
the service ordered better inspections to identify cracks in gears.
</P>
<P>
   Brazalovich, who had access to the Army's secret conclusions and
findings, said the Army blamed the accident on a bolt that came
loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The official explanation didn't match what the maintenance
people thought,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, on July 11, 1985, Boeing test pilot Albert
L. Freisner, 48, an Ohio State University graduate, and three other
crew members took one of the first CH-47D models for a test flight
from the company's plant in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   A month before the flight, during an inspection of all gears on
all CH 47Ds, a Vasco gear on the helicopter was rejected because of
what Boeing inspectors believed was a manufacturing defect
unrelated to the metal quality.
</P>
<P>
   At 5,000 feet over New Jersey, Freisner heard a loud explosion
coming from the rear of the helicopter, where many of the gears and
transmission are located. Smoke filled the cockpit. Freisner
parachuted to safety, but two other crew members were killed, one
hit by a rotor blade as he tried to parachute.
</P>
<P>
   Roby's attorneys and federal investigators now suspect the 1985
New Jersey crash was linked to Vasco gears manufactured by Litton
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials said the New Jersey crash was caused by a
transmission problem, not a gear problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no proof it was a gear failure,'' said Ettinger,
Boeing's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   15 DIE IN TWO HELICOPTER CRASHES
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, SPECO began making Vasco gears for Boeing at its
70-acre parts factory in Springfield, which once employed as many
as 2,200 people.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, on Feb. 25, 1988, a CH-47D from Fort Sill,
Okla., was flying at 3,000 feet near Chico, Texas, northwest of
Dallas, when the crew heard a popping sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there was a loud bang,'' Sgt. First Class Frank Prather
told investigators. ``Immediately after the loud bang, the aft,
right side of the aircraft was engulfed in flames.''
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter slammed into the ground at more than 130 mph. Of
the 19 people on board, 10 were killed and at least six others
suffered permanent injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Patricio lost both of his hands in the fire, and his face
and much of the rest of his body were severely burned. He filed a
lawsuit against Boeing in 1989, and won a settlement for an
undisclosed amount, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to look at myself,'' Patricio said during an
interview earlier this year at his business in Seattle. ``At one
time, I broke down. I didn't have any hands. I had to depend on
people . . . to feed me.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way I was going to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   The military never determined the exact cause of the 1988 crash.
Army investigators noted that problems found on a gear were
``interpreted differently by several engineers and investigators,''
but the Army said those problems did not cause the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials said the Texas crash had nothing to do with
gear failure. Investigators involved in the current Justice
Department probe disagree over whether the crash could have been
caused by the Vasco gears.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months later, on Dec. 8, 1988, Chief Warrant Officer Randall
B. Potter was piloting a CH-47D over Honduras when witnesses heard
a loud bang, followed by what appeared to be smoke coming from the
rear of the helicopter. As with the Texas crash, the bang was
followed by a much louder explosion and fire.
</P>
<P>
   The burning helicopter crashed, killing all five crew members.
</P>
<P>
   The Army at first suspected a high-intensity radio transmission
could have caused the accident but later ruled it out.
</P>
<P>
   The Army offered a reward to people in Honduras to locate
helicopter parts, and someone brought in a Vasco gear part, which
federal investigators suspect may be linked to the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Miami attorney Bob Parks represented the families of the three
dead airmen in a lawsuit against Boeing. The company settled the
case, he said, but he couldn't recall the amount.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials acknowledged that a gear, made of Vasco and
manufactured at Litton, failed, but they don't know what caused the
gear to fail. They also said the gear failure itself did not cause
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something acted on that gear and caused it to fail,'' Ettinger
said.
</P>
<P>
   CRASH DEATHS ALARM CONGRESS
</P>
<P>
   The 1988 Texas crash alarmed Congress, and a team of
investigators was dispatched to study aviation safety in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that something was occurring because the birds
were falling out of the sky,'' said Leo Sullivan, one of four U.S.
General Accounting Office employees loaned to a Congressional
committee for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Congress held hearings in 1990, the Chinook had been
the subject of 84 safety messages: Five requiring immediate
groundings of all aircraft, 11 indicating a ``hazardous condition''
that may or may not result in groundings and 30 requiring mandatory
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The team of Congressional investigators, in a report entitled,
``Let the Flyer Beware,'' found that the Army was ``occasionally
slow to react to serious aircraft problems, tending to wait until
disaster strikes before addressing them.'' Often, even when the
Army does address a problem, the report says, it is a ``Band-Aid
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the hearings nor the yearlong investigation by the team
of investigators dispatched by Congress identified Vasco or the
gears made from it as a common link in the accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Concerning the 1985 New Jersey crash, Gen. Donald R. Williamson,
who headed the Army Aviation System Command, said during the 1990
hearings that the accident was caused by an ``improperly assembled
transmission,'' and he also noted that control rods on the
helicopters needed fire protective coatings. The Army, he said,
started a ``paint application program'' to prevent the problem from
happening again.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the 1988 Honduras accident, Gen. Williamson told
Congress, was linked to a gear that had failed ``due to unknown
causes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence available indicates a one-time isolated event
that will not reoccur and that the fleet is operating under safe
conditions,'' the general assured Congress.
</P>
<P>
   As the Army assured Congress the CH-47D was safe, commanders
prepared to ground the helicopter for the seventh time in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   `I HEARD A LOUD BANG'
</P>
<P>
   On July 24, 1990, two months after General Williamson tried to
reassure Congress that the Chinooks were safe, Lt. Nancy A. Schulz
was flying a CH-47D at night over Fort Campbell, Ky., a
15,760-pound concrete block dangling from a line attached to the
helicopter cargo hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a loud bang, and the aircraft started shaking real
bad,'' Schulz told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Suspecting the concrete block might be the problem, Schulz
pushed the cargo release button. But the power was gone, and the
helicopter began to turn upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were flying through the air upside down,'' Schulz said in a
deposition for a lawsuit filed against Boeing by the family of one
of the crewmembers. ``The forward portion of the cockpit was all
gone. There was no wind screen. There were no instruments. . . . I
closed my eyes and just pulled my legs together in as tight as I
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the helicopter crashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing I really recall is crawling from the
aircraft,'' Schultz said in the deposition. ``And I saw. . .a crew
member at the time at the nose of the aircraft screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the five people on board were killed. Schultz and
another crew member escaped with only injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The family of the instructor pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Dale.
W. Tate, sued Boeing, claiming the cargo hook was defective. The
court dismissed the case in 1995, but Tate's attorney, Brian
Alexander of New York, is trying to get the civil case reopened
because, in light of the current federal investigation, he suspects
the cause could be linked to Vasco gears, not to the cargo hook.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said he wanted to get the gears, but he learned Boeing
took them. Boeing officials said they purchased the gears, along
with other wreckage, from the Army, and Boeing is currently using
the wreckage for aircraft training in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and Roby's attorneys also are interested
in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tate crash sequence is, in many respects, similar to the
crash sequence of other Chinooks,''says a request by the Justice
Department to get records from Tate's civil case.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials said they have no records showing what happened
to the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The federal court in Cincinnati has ordered Boeing to allow the
Justice Department to inspect certain gears from the wreckage. The
court, however, has sided with Boeing in denying the Justice
Department access to records from Tate's civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials said the Army blamed the Kentucky crash on
pilot error, not problems with the Vasco gears.
</P>
<P>
   BAD GEARS FOUND AFTER SAUDI CRASH
</P>
<P>
   One month after the Kentucky crash, on Aug. 23, 1990, Brett
Roby, then a newly hired quality assurance inspector at SPECO,
officially requested that all grinding on Vasco gears be stopped, a
request that effectively blocked production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had people coming to my desk asking me what the hell I was
doing,'' said Roby, who had been at SPECO only six months when he
issued the order. ``You got to understand, I created a huge
bottleneck in the production process, something the culture of this
facility doesn't tolerate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of stuff that makes a guy wake up at night and
sweat when you're working on these parts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under strong pressure from several officials at SPECO, which was
years behind schedule, Roby said, he agreed to lift his order to
stop work.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, on Jan. 11, 1991, during Operation Desert Storm,
Chief Warrant Officer Robert D. Gardner, a Vietnam veteran, was
flying a CH 47D carrying 18 crew members and passengers over Saudi
Arabia when he noticed an engine caution light.
</P>
<P>
   As the helicopter was 15 to 20 feet above the ground, smoke
poured from an area near an engine, and as the forward wheels
touched the sand, the rear of the helicopter exploded.
</P>
<P>
   As the passengers and crew escaped with their lives _ some
crawled through broken windows _ the ammunition inside exploded,
and fire destroyed the helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The Army and Boeing blamed the crash on manufacturing defects in
a SPECO-made gear. Following the crash, the Army, with the help of
Boeing, inspected its fleet of CH-47Ds with SPECO gears.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 360 gears inspected, 20 were identified as having similar
problems and replaced.
</P>
<P>
   `THE WHOLE AIRCRAFT SHUDDERED'
</P>
<P>
   On June 24, 1993, Donald Defenbaugh was flying one of the
CH-47Ds that had cleared an inspection after the Saudi Arabia
crash. Defenbaugh, a civilian Army employee, recalled that everyone
thought the inspections solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the basic understanding in the military: That all the
bad ones had been replaced,'' said Defenbaugh. ``The whole aviation
community thought it was solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenbaugh was giving an Army Reserve pilot a test flight over
Maryland with four people on board when smoke started pouring from
the engine. Then the gears exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were only 20 feet off the ground when it happened,'' he
said. ``The whole aircraft shuddered in an unusual vibration.''
</P>
<P>
   He made an emergency landing, and, though the aircraft suffered
substantial damage, no one was injured. About a third of one of the
helicopter's gears broke off, Defenbaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Defenbaugh said the Army never made him aware of the problems
with the CH-47Ds, and he recalled that the Army treated his
accident as an isolated incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my feeling at the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing blamed the Maryland crash on a mistake by a SPECO worker
trying to remove a sharp edge from a gear surface.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Maryland accident, the Army grounded its fleet of
CH 47Ds just long enough to check similar gears in other
helicopters. Following the inspection, three more gears were
replaced, but Boeing said in court documents that the three gears
were replaced ``for other reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Roby said he requested more tests on the gears. It
was then, Roby said, he became aware of tests done years earlier
showing that Vasco had flaws making the metal susceptible to
cracking. The flaws were called continuous innergranular carbide
networking (CICN), a problem similar to a crack on a piece of wood
or plastic that can cause splitting or cracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let my managers know we had this condition,'' Roby said.
``We cut it (more gears) up and found the same thing. We had three
out of three that were bad. I was starting to get nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in 1993, Roby said, he was asked by two high-ranking SPECO
officials to stop testing gears. Not long after that, in January
1994, Roby contacted the Defense Criminal Investigative Service
(DCIS) office in Dayton, a civilian agency empowered to investigate
fraud, waste and abuse in the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I didn't think it (CH-47D testing) was being
handled properly,'' Roby said.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1994, the Department of Defense inspector general
issued a ``Notification of Defective Transmission Gears''
concerning the CH-47D. The notification, which outlined the
investigation by the Dayton DCIS office, advised military and
civilian authorities to take ``any action deemed appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what action was taken in response to the notification, the
Army said in a written response, ``The U.S. Army continued to fly
the CH-47s.'' The notification, the Army said, was eventually
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   In the records Boeing filed with the federal court in
Cincinnati, the company says the existence of carbide networking in
VASCO ``was fully disclosed to the Army in 1993.'' In 1994, the
court records say, the Army begin its own analysis of carbide
networking in Vasco.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Boeing says, the Army concluded that carbide networking
identified by SPECO did ``not present a safety hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials called Roby's claims ``unsupported
allegations,'' and they said no gear failures can be linked to
Vasco.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of Vasco gears in service today
manufactured by SPECO and Litton, and the CH-47 fleet has
collectively flown in excess of 600,000 flight hours without mishap
due to material deficiencies,'' Boeing wrote in a prepared response
to the Dayton Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   `I HAD A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY'
</P>
<P>
   Three months after Roby went to the Defense Criminal
Investigative Service, he was laid off from SPECO. Although other
employees were also laid off, Roby said he felt his layoff was
connected to his complaints about Vasco.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called it a management reorganization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On May 22, 1995, Roby filed his lawsuit in federal court in
Cincinnati against The Boeing Company Boeing Co. under the False
Claims Act.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, a test conducted at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base for the Justice Department found ``continuous carbide
networking...at numerous locations'' on one part of the gear. But
Boeing said the test found nothing that could have contributed to a
gear failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department intervened in Roby's lawsuit in April
1997.
</P>
<P>
   In February of this year, workers at a British Royal Air Force
maintenance center in Scotland found cracks on a gear part, an RAF
spokesman said. The part, which is made of Vasco, holds bearings in
a gear assembly, or raceway on which the bearings move.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a Boeing representative on site (in Scotland),'' the
RAF spokesman said. ``It was brought to his attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The RAF grounded its Chinooks, called Mark 2s by the RAF, on
Aug. 7 or 8, the RAF spokesman said. The U.S. Army grounded its
fleet on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We determined the risk to be very high,'' said Mark J. Jeude
of the Army's Aviation-Engineering Directorate.
</P>
<P>
   Documents filed in federal court in Cincinnati show that in
1991, eight years before the current groundings, Boeing ordered
examinations for cracks on bearing raceways. Ettinger, Boeing's
attorney, said the 1991 examination concerned a ``different
anomaly'' than what caused the current groundings, and the earlier
examination was closed in 1994, after Boeing decided there was ``no
cause for concern.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 27, the Army returned half its Chinook fleet to duty but
restricted them to 80 percent engine power.
</P>
<P>
   SPECO, which closed in 1996 and filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy, was
a defendant in Roby's lawsuit but settled in 1997, agreeing to pay
$20 million to the government and $332,017 to Roby and his
attorneys. No money has been paid out because of the pending
bankruptcy case, and Roby's attorneys expect that, at best, they
will recover only a fraction of the amount.
</P>
<P>
   Litton was purchased by Boeing and is now called Boeing
Precision Gears, currently the sole manufacturer of the CH-47
gears.
</P>
<P>
   Under the False Claims Act, the contractor can be forced to pay
the government three times the amount lost due to fraud, and an
additional $5,000 to $10,000 for each false claim. Roby is alleging
240 false claims, and his attorneys estimate that the government is
seeking hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Trial on his lawsuit is expected to begin sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect a settlement,'' Helmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Roby, who is currently unemployed and living off Social Security
for a spine disease, said he doesn't regret what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boils down to this: I had a moral responsibility,'' he
said. ``I got to shave in the morning. I think they knew they had a
problem with the processing of the metal.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A team of federal investigators suspect that four CH47D Chinook
helicopter accidents that killed seven people may be linked to
faulty gears manufactured in Chicago and at a now-defunct factory
in Springfield, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Records, released after being kept under seal for years by a
federal court, show investigators also have tried to link at least
three other crashes that killed 13 people to the gears. The
helicopters had gears made with a metal that investigators from the
Justice Department suspect may contain a potentially deadly flaw.
</P>
<P>
   In August, armies worldwide grounded hundreds of Chinooks after
a British Royal Air Force maintenance facility in Scotland found
grinding cracks in gear parts made with the same metal.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army initially grounded its entire fleet of 466
CH-47Ds, the most Chinooks ever put down at one time.
</P>
<P>
   The metal, Vasco X2M, is used on gears that power the eight
25-foot rotor blades on the Chinook. Vasco was first used on
helicopter gears by Boeing, which patented a process to heat-treat
the metal. Boeing contracted with SPECO Corp. of Springfield, now
in bankruptcy, and Litton Precision Gears of Chicago, now Boeing
Precision Gears, to manufacture the gears.
</P>
<P>
   Litton used SKF Industries of Philadelphia and MRC Bearings of
Jamestown, N.Y., to manufacture bearings for the gears. It is those
bearings that triggered the current groundings.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department began investigating after an Brett Roby,
inspector at SPECO, warned of cracks in gears made with Vasco. Roby
eventually lost his job in a management reorganization, and filed a
lawsuit in May 1995 against Boeing in federal court in Cincinnati
under the federal False Claims Act. The act encourages government
whistleblowers and other citizens to report government contractor
fraud by offering a reward _ in the Roby case up to 25 percent of
what the government recovers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that Boeing, the world's largest aircraft
manufacturer, violated federal and common law because it ``sold, or
caused to be sold,'' defective helicopter gears to the Army.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department intervened in Roby's lawsuit in April
1997. Although Roby's lawsuit deals only with SPECO-made gears, the
investigation has expanded to include accidents involving aircraft
with gears made at Litton.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Army and Boeing defended Vasco.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Vasco is manufactured according to specifications and
made into gears correctly, the Army has verified that it is safe
for use in the helicopters,'' a prepared statement from the Army
says.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials deny that any Litton-made gears were linked to
crashes. They acknowledged that some SPECO gears and gear parts
machined at MRC were faulty, but they blamed the problem on human
error, not on Vasco.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, manufacturers produce faulty gears, Boeing
officials said, but inspections are supposed to identify bad gears.
Both SPECO and MRC failed to identify the problem gear parts
through inspections, the officials said, and that caused the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the problems) should have been caught,'' said Boeing
attorney Mitchell S. Ettinger of Washington, D.C., during an
interview at a Boeing's corporate office in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   John Bozogan, vice president of quality assurance and
engineering for MRC Bearings, said the company performed
inspections exactly as it was told by Boeing. But, he added: ``At
the time, Boeing was modifying the inspection requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the grinding cracks that led to the current
grounding, Bozogan said: ``We are concerned that we did not find
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The first crash involving the CH-47D came in 1985, in Honduras.
The helicopter was destroyed but the crew escaped with no injuries.
An Army report found that two gear parts made of Vasco broke into
eight pieces each, and Boeing identified what it believed were
``grinding cracks'' on one of the Litton-made gears. The Army
report found that the gear problems did not cause the accident, but
the service ordered better inspections to identify cracks in gears.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, on July 11, 1985, a Boeing test pilot and
three other crew members took one of the first CH-47D models for a
test flight from the company's plant in Pennsylvania. At 5,000 feet
over New Jersey, the pilot heard a loud explosion coming from the
rear of the helicopter, and smoke filled the cockpit. He parachuted
to safety, but two other crew members were killed, one hit by a
rotor blade as he tried to parachute.
</P>
<P>
   Roby's attorneys and federal investigators suspect the 1985 New
Jersey crash was linked to Vasco gears manufactured by Litton in
Chicago. However, Boeing officials said the New Jersey crash was
caused by a transmission problem, not a gear problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no proof it was a gear failure,'' said Ettinger,
Boeing's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   A CH-47D crashed near Chico, Texas, northwest of Dallas in
February 1988, killing 10 people and permanently injuring six
others. Paul Patricio lost both of his hands in the fire, and his
face and much of the rest of his body were severely burned. He
filed a lawsuit against Boeing in 1989, and won a settlement for an
undisclosed amount, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The military never determined the exact cause of the 1988 crash.
Army investigators noted that problems found on a gear were
``interpreted differently by several engineers and investigators,''
but the Army said those problems did not cause the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials said the Texas crash had nothing to do with
gear failure, and investigators involved in the ongoing Justice
Department probe disagree over whether the crash could have been
caused by the Vasco gears.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months later, on Dec. 8, 1988, all five crewmembers died
when another CH-47D crashed in Honduras. Federal investigators
suspect a Vasco gear was responsible for the crash, and Boeing
officials acknowledge that a gear did fail. However, they said the
gear failure itself did not cause the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something acted on that gear and caused it to fail,'' Ettinger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing settled a lawsuit filed by the families of the three dead
airmen, according to their attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Congress held hearings into the Chinook crashes in 1990, but two
months later a Chinook flying at night over Fort Campbell, Ky.,
lost power and crashed, killing three of the five people on board.
The family of the instructor pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Dale. W.
Tate, sued Boeing, claiming the cargo hook was defective. The court
dismissed the case in 1995, but Tate's attorney, Brian Alexander of
New York, is trying to get the civil case reopened because, in
light of the current federal investigation, he suspects the cause
could be linked to Vasco gears, not to the cargo hook.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and Roby's attorneys also are interested
in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tate crash sequence is, in many respects, similar to the
crash sequence of other Chinooks,''says a request by the Justice
Department to get records from Tate's civil case.
</P>
<P>
   The federal court in Cincinnati has ordered Boeing to allow the
Justice Department to inspect certain gears from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Two more CH-47D crashes occurred in the early 1990s: on Jan. 11,
1991, in Saudi Arabia during Desert Storm, and June 24, 1993, in
Maryland. Both helicopters had gears manufactured at SPECO.
</P>
<P>
   There were no deaths in either accident, although some
passengers and crew members escaped the burning helicopter in Saudi
Arabia by climbing through broken windows. Both the Army and SPECO
blamed the crash on manufacturing defects in a SPECO-made gear, and
vowed to step up inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also acknowledged that a gear was to blame in the
Maryland accident, but said it was due to human error: A SPECO
worker, they say, made a mistake trying to remove a sharp edge from
a gear surface.
</P>
<P>
   Roby, who now lives in Arkansas, once stopped the production
line at SPECO because of what he said were structural flaws in the
metal used to construct the gears.
</P>
<P>
   According to Roby, two high-ranking SPECO officials asked him to
stop testing gears in 1993. He then contacted the Defense Criminal
Investigative Service (DCIS) office in Dayton, a civilian agency
empowered to investigate fraud, waste and abuse in the Department
of Defense. Three months later, he was laid off.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department later joined as a plaintiff in the
Roby lawsuit, which is pending.
</P>
<P>
   In February of this year, workers at a British Royal Air Force
maintenance center in Scotland found cracks on a gear part, an RAF
spokesman said. The part, which is made of Vasco, holds bearings in
a gear assembly, or raceway on which the bearings move.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a Boeing representative on site (in Scotland),'' the
RAF spokesman said. ``It was brought to his attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The RAF grounded its Chinooks, called Mark 2s by the RAF, on
Aug. 7 or 8, the RAF spokesman said. The U.S. Army grounded its
fleet on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We determined the risk to be very high,'' said Mark J. Jeude
of the Army's Aviation-Engineering Directorate.

LABOR SECRETARY WARNS WORLD NEEDS TO DO BETTER ON WORKER RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman has a simple
message for workers in Seattle: a strong export economy and worker
rights are not mutually exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Herman defended the Clinton administration's
work on behalf of labor rights, but also acknowledged that its main
labor proposal to the World Trade Organization is ``not exactly
revolutionary'' and warned that if the world's trade ministers
don't do a better job recognizing worker rights, the world's
economies risk ``a race to the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman will make several appearances in Seattle Monday, the
latest in a parade of Clinton administration officials courting key
Washington state constituencies with concerns about the WTO, which
meets in Seattle Nov. 30 to Dec. 3. The agriculture and
transportation secretaries, as well as the Environmental Protection
Agency administrator, have also visited.
</P>
<P>
   While in Seattle, Herman plans to speak at a luncheon and a town
hall meeting, to visit a Boeing worker retraining program jointly
run by the company and its machinists union, and to meet privately
with about 20 top Washington state labor union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``My overall message for labor members is ... that we understand
that the benefits of trade are clear, but the disruption and the
dislocation are painfully concentrated and we can't ignore them,''
she said. ``That means, in my view, that we have to begin to ...
have a dialogue in this country and internationally about what are
the rules of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman said she is not worried about the contentious crowds that
have greeted some Clinton administration officials carrying the
pro-trade message to Seattle, and said she understands why the
labor movement is planning a massive protest Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not surprised at all,'' she said. ``I am very much aware
that there is anxiety and concern on the part of many workers
today. ... The fact of the matter is, this is a very dynamic
economy we have, and in this dynamic economy, you have a lot of job
gains, but you also have job loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman said the administration has a ``basic principle'' as it
tries to integrate labor and trade policy _ to find ``what is it
going to take to ensure the continued competitiveness of the United
States as a country, that we continue to have open markets, but
that we recognize that we must bring workers along in this new
equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman defended the Clinton administration's record on labor
issues, saying that the president has repeatedly pushed the cause
of workers before international organizations. And she said
Clinton's push for a WTO working group on trade and labor _ the
administration's major labor-related proposal for the Seattle
meeting _ is an important first step toward integrating labor
concerns with trade policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we begin somewhere,'' she said. ``We can
no longer sit on our hands simply because we don't have the support
of the entire world. ... To me, it is a process, a process that
starts with raising awareness, engaging international partners on
this issue, and being committed to a different course of action.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the proposal for a WTO working group on labor is ``not
exactly revolutionary,'' and said ``if reasonable people understand
what the request is, then I am hopeful'' the request will be
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Herman cited her work to pass an international child labor
convention, which she said took two years of hard negotiations, as
evidence of how difficult it is to move international organizations
to respond to labor issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't begin to agree on fundamentals, such as the
elimination of the most abusive forms of child labor, then we
really are not ready to march forward into the future,'' she said.
``This can not be about a race to the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the world's countries are already engaged in such
a race, she said, ``I don't believe that we are engaged in the race
to the bottom, but I believe that if we don't take these issues
very seriously, that we will be.''
</P>
<P>
   King County Labor Council Executive Secretary Ron Judd, one of
the labor officials who will be meeting with Herman Monday, said he
plans to push the administration to do more to force international
rules that are more ``worker friendly.'' He said he expects even
workers whose jobs are dependent on experts, such as Boeing
machinists and Port longshoremen, to be demonstrating at the WTO to
raise that concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``These workers understand that the only way for their standard
of living not to be eroded in the long term is to give workers in
other countries the right to organize,'' he said. ``We are trying
to be protectionist. We are trying to protect workers in this
country and all other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd said the WTO and the Clinton administration need to push as
hard to protect worker rights as they do to protect international
property rights. He said the administration should push for
sanctions against countries that violate core labor standards, such
as prohibitions against child labor and a right to collective
bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the right to protect a patent on a CD, you ought
to have the right to protect children from being forced to go to
work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO was created to develop a rules-based system of
trading, and we believe you need that,'' he said. ``We just believe
the rules as presently written and applied don't work for workers,
the environment, or local communities.''

BUDGET SURPLUS MAY GO TOWARD CUTTING NATIONAL DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For all the political bloodshed over President
Clinton's spending proposals and attempts by Republicans to cut
taxes, the standoff this year over budget policy has led the two
parties into a third choice _ to slash the national debt _ that
could have equally enormous political and economic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Such a momentous decision, made almost by default as each side
blocked the others' proposals for allocating projected federal
budget surpluses, has consequences that are sure to eclipse in
importance the outcome of the current sparring over financing for
education, across-the-board spending cuts and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the magnitude of the decision, it was made without an
explicit vote or even a full debate in Congress and the country.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were trillions of dollars in projected surpluses
on the table in a town that has never had trouble parceling out
money, the two sides essentially battled each other to a draw on
what to do with it. There was no big tax cut. There was no big
surge in government spending. There was no expansion of Medicare,
and no agreement on how to shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Yet gridlock in this case meant that the surplus was left more
or less intact. And because of the way the government's finances
work, running a surplus means that the excess revenues flowing into
Washington will automatically go to paying down the debt that the
nation ran up during decades of deficit spending, and to doing so
at a pace that would have been considered fantasy even a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Should the government stick to the course it is setting out on,
it could eliminate the most important component of the debt, the
$3.6 trillion in Treasury bonds owned by the public, within 10 or
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   While the approach was never put to a vote or even fully debated
in Congress, it yielded an outcome that most economists, including
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, consider to be
extremely positive for the economy over the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the publicly held debt would put downward pressure on
interest rates and free up capital for private enterprise to use in
building new factories or developing new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   It would reduce the government's interest expense, and increase
the government's capacity to borrow in the future if it needs cash
for looming problems like the projected shortfall in Social
Security's reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying down debt in large amounts is a truly momentous and
entirely salutary decision,'' said Carol Cox Wait, president of the
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog
group. ``It is the one thing we can do in the short term to put us
in a much better position to do with the problems we face in the
long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Debt reduction was basically a fallback position for both
parties, embraced by them in its own right only after Clinton
blocked the Republican effort to cut taxes and Republicans stymied
calls by Democrats for higher government spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither party had debt reduction as its priority, but it ended
up being the common denominator they could agree on through
gridlock,'' said Van Doorn Ooms, research director for the
Committee for Economic Development, a business-funded research
group.
</P>
<P>
   Yet politicians of all stripes quickly found that debt
reduction, which they had long considered arcane and difficult to
sell to voters as an accomplishment, had a political appeal far
greater than they had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would return to the White House from speeches and tell
aides that he had been unexpectedly interrupted by applause when he
mentioned debt reduction. At town hall meetings, constituents would
tell their members of Congress that if a family were to receive a
financial windfall, it should go to cleaning up credit-card bills,
not to spending on a new car or a vacation _ and that government
should have the same attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a metaphor the American people instantly understand,''
said Rep. John Spratt of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the
House Budget Committee. ``The American people get debt reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the consensus behind debt reduction in Washington remains
somewhat tenuous, and neither party sees continued gridlock as a
long-term strategy, particularly since Washington has only deferred
long-term problems like the solvency of Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative Republicans maintain that tax cuts would help
the economy more than debt reduction would. Some liberal Democrats
say higher spending in areas like education and health care would
be the best way to invest the surplus in the nation's future. If
divided government gave way to a situation in which one party
controlled both the White House and Congress, support for debt
reduction might dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, changing economic circumstances could lead to one
party or both reassessing their commitment to debt reduction as the
first fiscal priority.
</P>
<P>
   Should the economy turn down, both parties would likely support
some form of tax cut as a stimulus to recovery, and there could be
backing as well for increased spending, especially on social
welfare programs like unemployment insurance, job training and
assistance to families with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debt reduction isn't everything,'' said Robert Bixby,
executive director of the Concord Coalition, a fiscal policy group.
``It happens to be a very good and responsible thing to do at this
point in our nation's demographic and economic history, but in
other economic times it might not be true.''
</P>
<P>
   But especially given that both Clinton and Republican leaders in
Congress have pledged not to spend any of the portion of the
surplus generated by excess Social Security payroll tax revenues _
a promise that could bring swift political retribution if broken by
either side _ the fiscal debate in coming years seems likely to be
biased toward debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taboo against spending Social Security trust-fund
surpluses probably will be a continuing reality for some years to
come,'' Ms. Wait said.
</P>
<P>
   The national debt began surging in the early 1980s as Washington
began running huge annual deficits, forcing the Treasury to borrow
to make up the difference between tax revenues and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Debt held by the public went from $710 billion, or 26.1 percent
of gross domestic product, in 1980 to a peak of $3.77 trillion, or
47.2 percent of GDP, in 1997. Surpluses in the last two years have
allowed the government to reduce the debt to $3.6 trillion, or
about 40 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
   National debt can also be defined to include money the
government owes to itself, primarily in the form of promises to pay
future Social Security benefits. By that measure, the debt, now
about $5.6 trillion, will continue to grow for the foreseeable
future as the population ages and commitments to retirees continue
to mount.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, it was the political power of Social
Security that brought debt reduction to the top of the fiscal
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton started the process when he called in his 1998 State of
the Union address for the surplus to be left untouched until the
two parties had agreed on a plan to strengthen Social Security's
financial condition before the retirement of the vast baby-boom
generation.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy, which proved successful, was to block Republicans
on their signature issue by framing the fiscal choice before the
country as between saving Social Security and having a big tax cut.
At the time, White House aides said, debt reduction was considered
a nice byproduct of the strategy, but not the main goal.
</P>
<P>
   But by early this year, with the size of the projected surpluses
growing almost by the month, pressure was growing in both parties
to do something with the fiscal windfall. So Clinton set out a new
framework, saying that 63 percent of the total budget surplus over
the next 15 years should be used directly or indirectly for Social
Security, with the rest going to a variety of other programs, from
the military to education.
</P>
<P>
   Late last winter, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the
Senate Budget Committee, saw a way to trump the White House. He
pointed out that Clinton's proposal would allow the government to
spend some of the portion of the surplus being generated by Social
Security, a practice the government had engaged in for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici put forward a budget framework that allowed Republicans
to claim that they would not spend any of the Social Security
surplus, which amounts to roughly $2 trillion of the $3 trillion
total surplus over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans like Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of
the House Budget Committee, were reluctant at first, fearing that
the plan would limit their ability to press for an immediate tax
cut. But they eventually went along with Domenici's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, particularly in the House, were reluctant to sign on
to a program of austerity at a time of fiscal plenty. But by early
summer, Clinton had agreed that he too would leave the Social
Security surplus untouched, and most Democrats in Congress, not
wanting to cede the high ground as protectors of the New Deal
social-welfare legacy, reluctantly went along.
</P>
<P>
   The effect was a bipartisan consensus to allocate two-thirds of
the total surplus to debt reduction, a decision reached before
either party had fully thought through the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the two parties have been grappling with how to turn
their pledge into policy, starting with a budget for the fiscal
year that began on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   It is still not clear that the two parties will be able to
completely make good on their promise. Republicans in Congress have
had to resort to all manner of budget gimmicks to pass spending
bills that leave the Social Security surplus untouched for this
year, and they are counting on spending cuts that Clinton has
already made clear are unacceptable to him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed a tax hike on cigarettes as an alternative
to spending Social Security money, but there is little support for
the idea in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they miss their goal of leaving the Social Security
money alone, it would not be by much in the context of a $1.8
trillion budget and a projected total surplus for the new fiscal
year of $160 billion. In any case, spending some of the retirement
system's money would have little or no direct effect on Social
Security's long-term financial condition.

HOW TO PUT YOUR FINGER ON A GREAT MEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can you identify the most important aid to cooking excellence?
Nope, it's not the Cuisinart, the automatic bread maker, the
electric spice grinder or the industrial-size Mixmaster.
</P>
<P>
   You own one. You got it free. About the only maintenance
required is an occasional washup with soap and water.
</P>
<P>
   As any professional chef will say, the one essential to quality
control in the kitchen is the index finger.
</P>
<P>
   No, no, not the middle finger. That big digit can get you in a
whole lot of trouble, especially in Seattle, where road rage has
created a growth industry for insult specialists and kick-boxing
instructors.
</P>
<P>
   The index finger is the one next to your thumb. It's the finger
that chefs stick into a pot of simmering spaghetti sauce before
exclaiming, ``Dang, that's hot and, wow, that's tasty!''
</P>
<P>
   If they don't say, ``Wow, that's tasty,'' the sauce needs more
salt and a smidgen more oregano. But they wouldn't know this if
they hadn't stuck a finger into the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, you could use a tasting spoon. But chefs are busy
people and sometimes have to taste test garlic soup, chocolate
mousse and anchovy sauce in rapid-fire progression.
</P>
<P>
   They use an index finger (when the health inspectors aren't
looking) and after a few months in the profession they don't even
feel any pain when they stir-cook cheese fondue with the
indispensable digit.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there are exceptions to every rule. When you are
mixing up high explosives or the culinary equivalent _ like Thai
curries _ more than an educated finger is required. A foolproof
(and boom-proof) recipe is required.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor to Seattle, Nareerat Srisawat, has some excellent Thai
recipes, but she had a tough time selling them to her staff when
she owned and operated a restaurant in Thailand. Her background
also includes stints as an executive secretary, a merchandising
manager for a large luxury hotel and a facilitator in international
trade. And at one time she worked in Seattle for Thai Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Her restaurant experience was a continual frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thai chefs don't use recipes,'' says Nareerat, more commonly
known as ``Toy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They throw in some of this, some of that and then they
taste,'' she elaborated. ``Poor customer. If chief cook takes day
off, everything changes.''
</P>
<P>
   She took the logical remedial action, posting recipes on the
kitchen wall, and ordering the cooks to follow the instructions to
the letter.
</P>
<P>
   But to a Thai chef, a posted recipe is an insult to his or her
culinary expertise.
</P>
<P>
   `` `You must follow this recipe,' I tell them. They just look at
me. When I walk out of kitchen, they throw something else in the
pot. It is a big problem in Thai restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   The tasting finger is apparently not used to fine-tune the
cooking in Thailand. It is the accelerator, the brake and the
left-turn signal for the chef at the controls of the stove.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all else fails, read instructions,'' is North American
advice. When all else fails in Thailand, the chef throws away the
instructions, adds more curry sauce and tastes.
</P>
<P>
   If he is lucky, it might taste as good as this.
</P>
<P>
   Five Fingers Beef Skewers
</P>
<P>
   2 and one-half pounds sirloin steak
</P>
<P>
   5 teaspoons red chili flakes
</P>
<P>
   5 thin slices fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   10 cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half teaspoons curry powder
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cup oyster sauce
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup teriyaki sauce
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   Dump the chili flakes, ginger, garlic and curry powder into a
blender or processor. Lean on the button until you have a paste.
Mix this muck with the oyster and teriyaki sauces. Stir in the oil.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the sirloin into thin strips. Pour the sauce over all, moosh
around with all of your fingers, then cover and refrigerate 4 hours
or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Soak bamboo skewers in water for at least an hour. Then pierce
pieces of meat with the point of the stick three or four times as
you thread it onto each skewer.
</P>
<P>
   Cook briefly on a hot barbecue fire or under an oven broiler,
turning once. Don't overcook. The inside of the meat should be
pink.
</P>
<P>
   Thai Noodles
</P>
<P>
   1 pound Asian noodles
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon canola oil
</P>
<P>
   6 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons red curry paste
</P>
<P>
   1 pound lean pork or chicken
</P>
<P>
   1 large carrot, peeled and cut matchstick size
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Asian fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   5 green onions, chopped, including green tops
</P>
<P>
   One quarter cup fresh cilantro leaves
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup chopped peanuts
</P>
<P>
   We used buckwheat noodles, but you can substitute Hokkien or
Shanghai noodles. Cook according to package instructions in
boiling, salted water. If you refuse to read the instructions,
you're not going to get a job in Toy's kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The red curry paste and Asian fish sauce can now be found in any
large American supermarket or _ probably at less cost _ in one of
the area's many Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   When noodles are done, drain, add a tablespoon of oil to keep
them from sticking, and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok or large skillet. Add the garlic
and curry paste and stir-cook 1 minute. Add the pork or chicken,
which has been cut into thin strips, and cook 2 to 3 minutes, until
meat is no longer red.
</P>
<P>
   Add the carrot, fish sauce and brown sugar and half the green
onions and bring to a boil. Stir in the noodles and when everything
is hot, plop the ingredients of the pan into a serving platter and
scatter the remaining green onions, the cilantro and the peanuts
over the top. Serves four as a main dish.

   &UR; FREEDOM OF CONVERSATION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A delegation of writers _ including  &UR; Judy Blume &LR; , &UR; Chang-rae &LR; 
 &UR; Lee &LR;  and  &UR; Herbert Gold &LR;  _ in Washington last week for the PEN
/Faulkner Awards paid a call on Supreme Court Justice  &UR; Clarence &LR; 
 &UR; Thomas &LR; . Two members of the delegation,  &UR; Calvin Trillin &LR;  and
 &UR; Edward Albee &LR; , had bowed out because the invitation had suggested
that ``confrontational questions'' would be inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to make a big deal out of this,'' said Trillin.
``I just didn't want to go.'' He said his decision wasn't political
but that he didn't like restrictions being placed on his
conversation. Playwright Albee said he didn't want to honor Thomas
with his presence.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had turned down invitations in previous years, and agreed
only after being informed that he would be the only justice to have
refused meeting with a PEN/Faulkner delegation. Washington Post
reporters were barred; an attempt to keep out any writers who
considered themselves journalists fell apart when more than half
raised their hands when they were asked. They all said they
wouldn't write about the meeting, though.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas told the writers that he doesn't read novels and reads
only one part of only one newspaper: the sports section of the New
York Post. ``He said, `My opinions really don't matter because I
just follow the law, so it doesn't make any difference what my
opinions are,''' said Gold.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEROES AND OTHERS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Benson Ford Jr. &LR; , great-grandson of anti-Semitic auto tycoon
 &UR; Henry Ford &LR; , has bought a 500-year-old Torah written in secret in
</P>
<P>
   Spain or Portugal and donated it to a Jewish congregation near
Detroit. The restoration of the Torah was a gift to his wife,
 &UR; Frances &LR; , to whom he was married on July 11 by Rabbi  &UR; Daniel &LR; 
 &UR; Schwartz  &LR; of that congregation.
</P>
<P>
   - The Indiana Department of Natural Resources says it will cite
University of Indiana basketball coach  &UR; Bobby Knight  &LR; for not
reporting his accidental shooting of a hunting companion earlier
this month. DNR warden  &UR; Gerald Carow &LR;  said Knight is ``feeling
bad'' about the accident.
</P>
<P>
   - Dinah's Garden Hotel in Palo Alto is about to unveil an &UR; FDR &LR; 
Memorial Suite, with at least one fitting tribute to the disabled
president: a steam room with wheelchair access.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Howard Stern  &LR; and his wife,  &UR; Alison &LR; , have separated after 21
years of marriage. Spokesman  &UR; Dan Klores  &LR; said the separation ``is
amicable,'' a phrase Stern would probably poke fun at if he were
describing someone else's situation. The Sterns, both 45, have
three daughters, 16, 12 and 6.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Elton John &LR;  and  &UR; B.B. King &LR;  performed at the wedding in
Australia this weekend of  &UR; James Packer &LR; , 32-year-old heir to a
media fortune, and model  &UR; Jodie Meares &LR; . John's fee was estimated
at $800,000; the total wedding bill was said be $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Byron Schiffman  &LR; and  &UR; Alison Owings  &LR; were intrigued by the
description, in a recent newspaper notice, of Gordon-Biersch's
Oktoberfest parties, where the staff would be wearing
``leiderhosen,'' which means ``unfortunate pants.'' Too bad they're
not ``liederhosen,'' writes Owings, which would have been ``singing
pants.'' Lederhosen, leather pants, are traditional for the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOME TEAM WINNERS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Since we don't have a long hot summer,  &UR; Wendy Nankeville &LR;  admits
that naming a dish from San Francisco the Long Hot Summertime Salad
was a bit sneaky, but never mind, it worked. ``The Long Hot
Summer'' was the first movie in which  &UR; Joanne Woodward  &LR; and  &UR; Paul &LR; 
 &UR; Newman &LR;  co-starred, and Nankeville, office manager at the San
Francisco Food Bank, won $10,000 for that organization in a
Newman's Own/Good Housekeeping recipe contest in New York last
week.
</P>
<P>
   And singing sisters  &UR; Kelly &LR;  and  &UR; Kamille Rudisill &LR;  of the School
of the Arts High School were chosen New Stars of the Week on Pax
TV's ``Destination Stardom'' on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   And  &UR; Jonathan &LR;  and  &UR; Hillary Reinis &LR; , producers of Dame Edna
Everage's ``The Royal Tour,'' are exulting in New York reviews of
the show _ ``Sit back and let the magnificent Dame take charge,''
wrote  &UR; Vincent Canby  &LR; of the New York Times _ which opened there
last week.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm into it in terms of the psychology and drama, as an
entertainment, but politically I think it's absurd _ a vicious
embarrassment between two people who couldn't deserve each other
more.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  -  &LR; Actor and comedian &UR; Richard Belzer &LR;  on a possible New York
senatorial race between &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR;  and &UR; Rudolph Giuliani &LR; ,
quoted in the Washington Post.

NEW BOOKS ON FERRETING OUT PATENT DATA AND LIMITS OF INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Along with the proliferation of new patents, it seems, comes a
proliferation of new patents books.
</P>
<P>
   The one with perhaps the best shot at the business best-seller
list is ``Rembrandts in the Attic,'' to be published next month by
Harvard Business School Press. The title comes from a term commonly
used to describe potentially lucrative patents that sit collecting
dust in a company's file cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   The authors, Kevin G. Rivette and David Kline, emphasize the
strategic importance of intellectual property by giving example
upon example in which patents (or their lack) have been crucial to
the fortunes of such companies as Texas Instruments and Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   They urge companies to follow the example of Xerox, which was
smart enough to learn from its legendary failure to patent a
graphical user interface that later became the basis for Apple's
Macintosh and Microsoft's Windows operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   G. Richard Thoman, the current chief executive of Xerox, was
hired in part for his intellectual property savvy, Rivette and
Kline write. By contrast, they say, ``most businesses today still
concentrate patent responsibilities in the legal department _ the
one group in the company, ironically, that is specifically  &UR; not
 &LR; trained to make business decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   At its core, this book is a how-to manual for ferreting out
valuable information from huge patent data bases that are now
easily accessible on line (indeed, this is the essence of a new
business, Aurigin Systems, which Rivette recently co-founded). And
to think that only a few years ago, one had to clip patent
abstracts out of the Official Patent Gazette and hand-collate them
to analyze patent trends or figure out what the competition was up
to. This is no longer true. ``New electronic patent data bases,
combined with automated data-mining and visualization tools, have
reduced the time needed for intellectual property analysis from
months to just hours,'' the authors write.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious use of such patent analysis is to help a
company get stronger patents to protect its new or existing
products. But, as Rivette and Kline point out, this information can
be used for more than simply protecting one's latest widget. Using
what the authors call ``patent mapping,'' a company can more
efficiently build a thicket of patents around a competitor's
products. Or a company can determine which of its own patents are
frequently cited as ``prior art'' in other inventors' patent
applications _ and thereby identify patents for which they might
want to try to extract licensing fees from other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Similar analysis can yield potential buyers for a company or
even help poach hot engineering talent from other companies.
</P>
<P>
   So who in the technology sector has been particularly smart
about intellectual property? The answer, according to the authors,
is Dell Computer, &UR;  &LR; which patented the manufacturing, distribution
and marketing methods used in its build-to-order computer sales
system.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of Seth Shulman's ``Owning the Future'' (Houghton
Mifflin) is also intellectual property. But its gloom-and-doom
outlook stands in sharp contrast to the gold-digging enthusiasm of
``Rembrandts in the Attic.'' Indeed, Rivette and Kline, a bit
defensively, devote several pages to critiquing Shulman's book,
which was publishedr this year and which argues that, unless
society curtails intellectual property rights, we will see
``nothing less than an uncontrolled stampede to auction off our
technological and cultural heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivette and Kline contend that Shulman's book contains errors
and misrepresentations. Alas, they are right. Some of the
information in ``Owning the Future'' is either old or simply
incorrect or, more worrisome, sometimes used misleadingly to
bolster the author's arguments.
</P>
<P>
   But while Rivette and Kline are trained on the relatively narrow
question of how to squeeze as much value as possible out of a
patent portfolio, Shulman does attempt to wrestle with issues that
hold great societal import. Should companies be able to stake
commercial claims on the natural processes of the human body? Will
the stampede to the Patent Office by software inventors and online
businesses result in a legal gridlock of the industry? These are
important questions, which few people aside from Shulman are
raising.

MCCAIN'S TOUGHEST FIGHT FOR GOP NOMINATION COULD BE AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Texas, Mich.)  (Eds: 2nd take to be filed by 7 p.m.) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Even as Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., enjoys a wave of
friendly publicity in his quest for the Republican presidential
nomination, he is struggling to prevent his great ambition from
collapsing in the most unlikely of places: His home state of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The state's most popular politician, Gov. Jane Dee Hull, has
defied political custom and endorsed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
instead of the home-state favorite. The reason, according to people
close to Mrs. Hull and McCain, is the senator's dismissive
treatment of her.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain easily won election to the Senate three times, his
temperament and sometimes prickly personality _ which rarely
surfaces in public _ may complicate his climb to the nomination.
Mrs. Hull's rebuff means that McCain may have to devote precious
resources to compete on his own turf, the first primary contest in
the West. And a struggle there could draw attention to a side of
the senator that remains largely out of view but which has
alienated other politicians, including those back home who know him
best.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hull described her relations with McCain as ``not
particularly warm.'' Pretending to hold a telephone receiver
several inches from her ear, Mrs. Hull explained in an interview
last week how she reacts to McCain's occasional eruptions at her.
``You've got to hold it out there for a while, and let him calm
down,'' she said. ``We all have our faults, and it's something that
John has to keep control of.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant Woods, a former Arizona attorney general who was McCain's
first administrative assistant when he was elected to Congress in
1982, admitted that McCain had been ``heavy-handed'' with Mrs.
Hull. ``People come away with great respect and admiration for
him,'' he said. ``But it's kind of ridiculous to gloss over big
flaws and pretend they don't exist. John McCain likes being the
maverick but does not tolerate mavericks well. Gov. Hull was not
willing to be told how to do her job.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's victory in the state's presidential primary four months
from now is by no means assured; polls show he is in a tight
competition with Bush. By throwing her political organization
behind Bush, Mrs. Hull could cut into McCain's home-state base of
support. Sensing his vulnerability, Bush and Steve Forbes, his
other main rival, each plan to pump millions of dollars into the
state to try to topple him.
</P>
<P>
   While Arizona sends only a handful of delegates to the party's
nominating convention, the primary here, set for Feb. 22, is an
important test for McCain, the senior senator from the state that
gave Barry Goldwater to the Republican Party. The contest comes
only two weeks before the pivotal primaries on March 7 in
California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   But far beyond Arizona, Mrs. Hull's spurning of McCain stands as
a telling example of how, despite his reputation as a war hero who
dares to speak his mind, the senator's personal style rankles many
politicians. Several people deeply involved in state politics said
the very attributes that many voters admire _ stubborn to the point
of rude, temperamental and cocksure in his maverick military way _
work against him with other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Already, advisers to Bush have seized on Mrs. Hull's endorsement
as evidence that McCain has flaws that may make him a
less-than-ideal presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is a very good one-man performance,'' said Gov. John
Engler of Michigan, the Bush campaign's liaison to governors.
``It's not as clear how effective he is as part of a team.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, Engler said, has made ``judgments in a negative way
about Jane and her abilities _ she wasn't his person.'' He added,
``Sometimes a leader needs to reach out a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hull insisted that her decision to back Bush was not
anti-McCain but pro-Bush. But she made clear she was rankled by the
senator's treatment of her.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether McCain ever forgave her when, as a state
legislator, she endorsed another candidate for Congress in 1982,
Mrs. Hull said, ``John has a long memory.'' And asked whether it
was true that McCain aggressively encouraged Mrs. Hull to fire or
demote her chief of staff, Rick Collins, the governor turned to
Collins and made light of the episode. ``Did he actually want me to
fire you?'' she asked, ``or just boil you in oil?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was fire,'' Collins replied with a smile.
``It was, `Just kill him!'''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain, in an interview, denied the accusations
and called them ``just bizarre.'' Asked if he ever tried to get
Mrs. Hull to punish or demote Collins, he said, ``I will take a
polygraph. I've never retaliated against anybody because that is
not my view of the way you go through life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're good friends,'' he said of his relationship with the
governor. ``I've never had a harsh word with her to my knowledge. I
endorsed her and campaigned with her in the last election.'' Told
of Mrs. Hull's comments about him, McCain said, ``Maybe something
has chilled since election night.''

   Thomas told the writers that he doesn't read novels and reads
only one part of only one newspaper: the sports section of the New

</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Benson Ford Jr. &LR; , great-grandson of anti-Semitic auto tycoon
 &UR; Henry Ford &LR; , has bought a 500-year-old Torah written in secret in
</P>
<P>
   Spain or Portugal and donated it to a Jewish congregation near
Detroit. The restoration of the Torah was a gift to his wife,
 &UR; Frances &LR; , to whom he was married on July 11 by Rabbi  &UR; Daniel &LR; 
 &UR; Schwartz  &LR; of that congregation.

<P>
   - The Indiana Department of Natural Resources says it will cite
University of Indiana basketball coach  &UR; Bobby Knight  &LR; for not
reporting his accidental shooting of a hunting companion earlier
this month. DNR warden  &UR; Gerald Carow &LR;  said Knight is ``feeling
bad'' about the accident.
</P>
<P>
   - Dinah's Garden Hotel in Palo Alto is about to unveil an &UR; FDR &LR; 
Memorial Suite, with at least one fitting tribute to the disabled
president: a steam room with wheelchair access.

<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Howard Stern  &LR; and his wife,  &UR; Alison &LR; , have separated after 21
years of marriage. Spokesman  &UR; Dan Klores  &LR; said the separation ``is
amicable,'' a phrase Stern would probably poke fun at if he were
describing someone else's situation. The Sterns, both 45, have
three daughters, 16, 12 and 6.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Elton John &LR;  and  &UR; B.B. King &LR;  performed at the wedding in
Australia this weekend of  &UR; James Packer &LR; , 32-year-old heir to a
media fortune, and model  &UR; Jodie Meares &LR; . John's fee was estimated
at $800,000; the total wedding bill was said be $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Byron Schiffman  &LR; and  &UR; Alison Owings  &LR; were intrigued by the
description, in a recent newspaper notice, of Gordon-Biersch's
Oktoberfest parties, where the staff would be wearing
``leiderhosen,'' which means ``unfortunate pants.'' Too bad they're
not ``liederhosen,'' writes Owings, which would have been ``singing
pants.'' Lederhosen, leather pants, are traditional for the
occasion.

<P>
   Since we don't have a long hot summer,  &UR; Wendy Nankeville &LR;  admits
that naming a dish from San Francisco the Long Hot Summertime Salad
was a bit sneaky, but never mind, it worked. ``The Long Hot
Summer'' was the first movie in which  &UR; Joanne Woodward  &LR; and  &UR; Paul &LR;

`TIME OF YOUR LIFE': AN INNOCENT ABROAD IN NEW YORK, FRESH FROM
FRISCO

<P>
   What is all this fuss about Jennifer Love Hewitt? Apparently she
became the beloved of teen-agers everywhere, playing Sarah,
girlfriend of the troubled but cute Bailey Salinger (Scott Wolf),
on Fox's hit drama ``Party of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a few months ago some Audrey Hepburn fans were horrified to
learn that she would be playing Hepburn in a forthcoming television
film. (Of course, having anyone play Hepburn seems sacrilege to a
lot of us. Julia Ormond's career still hasn't recovered from her
re-creation of Hepburn's character in the remake of ``Sabrina.'')
In comparison, Ms. Hewitt's starring in her own series, a ``Party
of Five'' spinoff, seems a relatively low-risk career move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time of Your Life,'' which has its premiere on Fox Monday
night, maintains the appealing romanticized realism of its parent
series. (If you'd watched them forever, do you think you would ever
have seen Ann Marie or Mary Richards, Sarah's
young-single-woman-in-the-city forebears, take off her bra while a
new guy watched appreciatively? That happens in the third episode
of ``Time of Your Life.'' Felicity, of course, is another story.)
The new series makes something of a case for the appeal of Ms.
Hewitt's post-modern vulnerability, an innocence that seems
dangerous when plopped down in Manhattan after hours.
</P>
<P>
   The show also does a good job of capturing the infinite
possibility facing a 20-year-old who has just moved to New York. In
Sarah's case the move began as a short trip to locate and encounter
her biological father. (Sarah was adopted and her biological mother
is dead.) Back on ``Party of Five,'' back in San Francisco, Sarah
assured Bailey that it was only a five-day trip and that she'd be
back in a flash. But viewers knew better.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah ends up, in an unlikely turn of events, living in the East
Village apartment that her mother lived in around the time Sarah
was born (January 1979). Her roommate, Romy, is a starving actress
who's ready to pack it in and go back home to her parents until a
couple of promising things happen to her.
</P>
<P>
   For Sarah there's a good-looking, sensitive guy (Johnathon
Schaech), a guitarist good enough to have played with Beck on the
scene. And he gets to be the one to inform Sarah that moving to New
York can be the beginning of a whole new life, if she wants it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be whoever you want to be, from here on out,'' he
explains, with the requisite Manhattan skyline at night twinkling
behind him. ``Invent yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Like lots of young people in the city, Sarah learns fast. When
she arrives, she strikes up a conversation with a stranger at the
airport luggage carousel, telling him her situation (which is
conveniently the spinoff's back story). He promptly suggests they
go to a hotel for ``sexual adventures.''
</P>
<P>
   A day or two later, when she meets the man she believes to be
her father _ and he turns out to be black and gay _ she coolly asks
if perhaps 20 or so years ago he had questioned or been uncertain
of his sexual identity. He hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   So Sarah continues her search. She drinks too much, gets
arrested for jumping a subway turnstile (well, the token booth was
closed; what were she and her friends to do?), sneaks into a
black-tie benefit at Lincoln Center by pretending to be with the
band and finally checks her e-mail, which gives her a hint of the
bad news from Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   When the judge pegs her as ``a sorority girl from the suburbs,''
one thing becomes clear: she does not want to be, she says, ``the
Marcia Brady of the new millennium.'' Future episodes are expected
to depict her fight against that kind of predictable niceness.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell has a cameo in Monday night's episode as the
receptionist of a theater impresario who may be Sarah's real
father. She's adorably obnoxious.

<P>
   With each passing day, Ruslan Aushev, the president of the tiny
enclave of Ingushetia in Russia's Northern Caucasus, is becoming
more and more desperate with what he calls the ``imperial
thinking'' in Moscow and Russia's prosecution of war in neighboring
Chechnya, which has sent almost 170,000 refugees fleeing into his
impoverished republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't understand one thing,'' he said of the leaders in
Moscow. `'Even if we stamp out the bandits, dunk them, destroy them
_ and here too I have my doubts _ what will happen after that? Who
will come and run the Chechen republic?
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why we have to say clearly and succinctly, what is the
goal that the federal center has set for itself,'' he said in an
interview. ``That goal is known only to a few people and no one
else.''
</P>
<P>
   From his palatial premises in Magas, a cluster of glistening new
office buildings that form the new capital of Ingushetia, Aushev, a
former battalion commander in the Soviet army and a decorated
veteran of the Afghan war, who prefers military fatigues to suits,
tries to sway the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he was on the phone to Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev, arguing that the Russian military had neither the legal
nor moral right to usurp his authority as Ingushetia's elected
leader.
</P>
<P>
   He lost that argument, just as he has so far failed to persuade
Moscow authorities to resume a dialogue with Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov. Aushev said Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
was ``categorically'' against any such meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The war is close here _ so close that on Thursday evening, at
about 6:30 p.m., residents say they could literally hear it.
According to Aushev, people here reported what sounded like
low-flying planes or missiles heading eastward. Moments later, four
explosions went off in Grozny, the Chechen capital, where according
to Chechen officials, more than 100 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the way to fight terrorism,'' said Aushev in an
interview in his office with The New York Times and Radio Liberty.
``There are other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he added: ``They should stop their imperial thinking. It
is imperial thinking that prevents the Russian leadership from
having a policy in the Caucasus.''
</P>
<P>
   The military campaign, he said, is cutting off chances for a
political region that has spent the last eight years slipping from
war to unruly peace and now to war again.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a month now, Ingushetia has had to cope with wave
upon wave of Chechen refugees, anxious and terrified families who
have clambered into cars, vans, buses and trucks, fleeing bombing
attacks by Russian federal forces.
</P>
<P>
   The various and diverse nationalities of the North Caucasus live
at close quarters. Ingushetia is itself a recently created region
that fought a bitter war with another neighbor, North Ossetia, over
disputed territory in the early 1990s. Grozny is only about 40
miles away from Magas, on the outskirts of Nazran, Ingushetia's
main city.
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times, the Chechens and Ingushes lived uneasily
together in one nominally autonomous republic. Since the Soviet
Union broke up in 1991, the Caucasus region has been a maze of
bloody conflict, most notably in Chechnya, where Russian forces
battled rebels who sought independence for two years before
withdrawing in 1996 and leaving the breakaway region's status in
official limbo until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   That uneasy peace dissolved in August, when Chechen guerrillas
became Russia's public enemy No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Russian government, Islamic militants based in
Chechnya not only carried out armed raids last August against
Dagestan, the Russian republic to Chechnya's east, but are also
responsible for bombing attacks, which killed almost 300 people in
Moscow and other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, as Russian military vehicles lined the main
highway between Nazran and Grozny, the flow of Chechen refugees _
mainly women and children _was virtually stopped by order of
Russian military commanders. Even before blocking the only highway
out of Grozny, the Russians had set up a gauntlet of checkpoints
and roadblocks designed to filter out guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   With Russian forces now occupying Chechnya's northern tier, the
first glimmer of a national debate has opened up in Russia over
where the war should go from here.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military commanders have not ruled out the possibility
of an assault on Grozny, although many experts and a few
politicians predict that if Russian troops move deeper into
Chechnya, they will get bogged down in a hopeless war, where winter
and a mountainous terrain will give the advantage to well-armed
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ` &UR; ` &LR; There will be no quick, decisive victory,'' said Aushev.
``According to my information, there are about 26,000 guerrillas
all armed to the teeth, and now, after the explosions in Grozny,
there will be even more.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here in Ingushetia, where the tide of refugees is overwhelming
the region's meagre resources, and straining the hospitality of
local families, Aushev says Moscow has to demonstrate that its war
is against Chechen guerrillas and not against the Chechen people.
</P>
<P>
   The same case is made, more passionately, by the refugees
themselves. ``What have we done to the Russians to deserve this?''
said one woman from Grozny, leaping out of her family's van as it
stalled in a mile long traffic jam at the border with Ingushetia
border on Friday. ` &UR; ` &LR; Tell us why this is happening to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other leaders in the region, Aushev has accounts to settle
with the Chechen bandit groups blamed for a wave of kidnappings and
violence that in the last two years has spread into Ingushetia. He
is also critical of the Chechen leader, Maskhadov, for letting the
situation inside Chechnya reel out of control after 1996, and for
failing to prevent or condemn the armed raids into Dagestan last
August.
</P>
<P>
   But Aushev said the real cause for the latest conflict was in
Moscow, where Russian political leaders are engaged in a bitter
power struggle in the runup to December's parliamentary elections,
and next summer's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in the Caucasus during the 1990s has always been
in the hands of forces which at any time, can be put into play,''
he said. ``Whoever solves the problems here becomes a hero of the
Russian federation, his ratings will go up, and he will have a big
chance to become president.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a former KGB officer and former head of Russia's security
forces, was named prime minister in August, days after federal
forces made their first stand against the Chechen guerrillas in
Dagestan. Since launching the military campaign against men
routinely branded terrorists by Russian officials and media, his
approval ratings have soared.
</P>
<P>
   According to Aushev, the conflict in Dagestan was one that had
long been foreseen by leaders in the region, and yet no preventive
measures were taken by federal forces to protect Dagestan from
attack.

`WONDERS OF THE AFRICAN WORLD': EXPLORING BLACK KINGDOMS OF
ANTIQUITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(ms) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Roots'' meets Kenneth Clark's ``Civilization'' as Henry Louis
Gates Jr., the prolific scholar, turns tour guide in a six-hour
series with the unscholarly title of ``Wonders of the African
World.'' Like other black Americans, he has been drawn to the
history of civilizations created and ruled by blacks in Africa
centuries before Europeans decided the continent was dark.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Afro-American Studies at Harvard University
makes a cheerfully informal companion on a journey that visits a
dozen countries where blacks made their mark. Monday night's
opening hour finds Gates _ he's the fellow in the Harvard shirt _
traveling from Egypt into Sudan, one of the world's less-frequented
tourist destinations. There he and the researchers he interviews at
sandy sites tell of Nubia, where, they say, for a thousand years,
from the rise of Greece through the fall of Rome, black kingdoms
flourished.
</P>
<P>
   There he sees the pyramids where generations of Nubian kings and
queens are buried (Sudan has more pyramids than Egypt), the remains
of Nubia's 4,000-year-old first capital and the descendants of an
ancient people.
</P>
<P>
   Present-day Nubians, he reports, are friendly, and so is their
visitor, whether he is buying a dozen oranges in a marketplace,
dressing up in white to be the guest of honor at a wedding, helping
to push a car out of a sand drift, climbing rocks on a rope or
allowing himself to be buried naked in the sand, reputed to have
healthful properties. ``I feel like a mummy,'' he says, but we
don't learn whether the treatment helped his arthritic hip.
</P>
<P>
   He is impressed by wall drawings showing that the earliest
pharaohs were black, but is distressed by the coming of huge
hydroelectric dams that are obliterating the evidence of a precious
history, along with the villages that today's Nubians call or
called home. (When villagers welcome the dams, he suspects that
they may be speaking more for the benefit of lurking government
security types than from their hearts.)
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the descriptions of African accomplishments
have a wishful quality, Gates' credentials and personality inspire
confidence as he proceeds on his odyssey into South Africa,
Zimbabwe, Mali and Ethiopia. In Ghana, Benin and Tanzania, centers
of the 19th-century slave trade, he finds evidence of the fate of
the many Africans who served rather than ruled, a painful contrast
to the glories that he reports were Nubia.

REPORT ASKS COLLEGES TO PUT MORE RESOURCES INTO EDUCATING
TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the nation struggles to train more than 2.5 million new
teachers over the next decade, college and university presidents
must pay more attention and devote increasing resources to their
schools of education, a leading higher-education group argues in an
unusual report scheduled for release Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The clarion call by the American Council on Education, the
country's largest association of colleges and universities,
presents a harsh critique of the current stable of teachers. It
says that more than half of the nation's 7th- through 12th-graders
were recently taught physical science by unqualified teachers, and
that only one in five teachers feels prepared to integrate
technology into the classroom. It also expresses concern that
elementary school teachers, when they were students, typically took
less challenging courses and performed less well on standardized
tests than their peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That many students in America _ often those most in need of
excellent teachers _ are taught by unqualified teachers is a
reprehensible form of publicly sanctioned malpractice,'' the
38-page report says. ``Just as no person should receive medical
care from a person who is not qualified or reliably certified as a
health care professional, no student should face an unqualified or
uncertified teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, titled ``To Touch the Future'' _ a line taken from
Christa McAuliffe, the teacher killed in the explosion of the
Challenger space shuttle in 1986 _ proposes that an outside agency
audit all 1,300 teacher-education programs in the country,
oversight that is required now for medical and law schools. Fewer
than half these programs receive such independent accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the 36-member task force urges college presidents
to place the education of teachers at the top of their agendas. The
report, which is scheduled to land on the desks of the leaders of
America's 3,500 institutions of higher education on Monday, calls
teacher training the responsibility of the entire university.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most colleges and universities, and for most presidents,
the education of teachers has not been on their personal radar
screens,'' Stanley O. Ikenberry, the council's president, said in
an interview. ``It either ought to be in the center of the
institutional mission or they should move it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the nation's two largest teachers' unions and the
head of an association of teachers colleges all agreed that teacher
education has for too long been neglected by many universities, and
they praised the report despite its criticism of their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what they're saying is that teacher education has not
been good, and I think they're right,'' said Sandra Feldman,
president of the American Federation of Teachers. ``Teaching is
hard. We haven't had that kind of rigor in most teacher-education
programs at all.''
</P>
<P>
   David Imig, chief executive of the American Association of
Colleges for Teacher Education, said his members might be skittish
about outside auditors but would appreciate the call for a
campuswide approach to their work.
</P>
<P>
   The task force points out that teachers are poorly paid and
often work under difficult conditions, particularly compared with
workers who have similar educational backgrounds. But the report
focuses on training, rather than on the systemic problems that
repel some high-quality candidates from the profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you blame education schools for the quality of the
teaching force? No, they don't bear all the blame,'' said Arthur
Levine, president of Teachers College at Columbia University and a
member of the task force. ``Could they make it better? Absolutely.
But education schools can't do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The report raises more questions than it answers about how to
train effective teachers. It calls for additional research on such
questions, noting that the nation spends $300 billion a year on
public education but that the federal government devoted only $300
million to educational research in 1999. The report suggests a $3
billion research budget.

   NEW ORLEANS _ In the end, all the campaign embarrassments and
miscues had little if any effect on Gov. Mike Foster's bid for a
second term. He proved himself to be one of the state's most
popular Republican officeholders in years and won going away in
Saturday's election, brushing off 10 challengers.
</P>
<P>
   A reform-minded conservative from Cajun country with a disarming
good-ol'-boy patter, Foster had concentrated during his first term
on three of Louisiana's most bothersome problems: a struggling
economy, inferior public schools and tort laws that made the state
one of the most litigious in the country. That concentration paid
off. Foster captured more than 60 percent of the vote, twice as
much as his nearest challenger, Rep. William J. Jefferson, a
Democrat from New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   No other challenger got more than 3 percent of the vote on a day
when turnout was estimated at about 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We there,'' Foster declared in his best bayou-country accent
as he claimed victory at a late-night rally in Lafayette on
Saturday. ``So I'll be back in the office on Monday, ready to pick
up again running this state like a well-managed business,
continuing the good work that we've started. I told you all I'd get
us off the bad list of states and onto the good list, and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while during the campaign, it seemed that Foster himself
might make a list of candidates who embarrass themselves.
</P>
<P>
   First, he was forced to acknowledge that in 1995, during his
first run for governor, he secretly bought a list of campaign
contributors and supporters from David Duke, the former Ku Klux
Klan leader, for $150,000. Then the state Ethics Board fined him
$20,000 for not reporting the purchase as a campaign expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   Next, a federal grand jury began looking into the purchase,
reportedly to determine whether Duke paid taxes on the $150,000 and
whether the money bought a promise from Duke, still something of a
political power in the state, not to run for governor (the governor
adamantly denies any quid pro quo).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was the incident in which Foster found out that a
private detective was checking up on him, possibly for another
candidate. He sent for the detective and, after warning him that it
was not wise to ``mess'' with a governor, urged him to become a
``double agent,'' apparently without success.
</P>
<P>
   Politics can be like that here. One school of thought is that
voters who eat nothing bland do not want their politics bland,
either. Whatever the case, there was no evidence on Saturday that
they held any of it against the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, who had hoped to become the first black candidate to
win a statewide race here since Reconstruction, did not dwell much
on the governor's miscues and embarrassments during the campaign.
Rather, he focused on Foster's boasts about improving the state's
economy, schools and legal climate, arguing that they were mostly
self-serving fiction. Despite the progress the state has made, he
contended, too may poor people and too many students still are
being left behind.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the end, Jefferson, who has served five terms in the House,
carried almost all of the black electorate _ about 30 percent of
the entire vote _ but got very little of the white vote, proof that
while Louisiana is very much a state unto itself, it is still in
the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   For further proof of that, Ed Renwick, director of the Loyola
University Institute of Politics in New Orleans and one of the
state's leading political analysts, cited the fate of a proposal on
Saturday's ballot that called for giving tax breaks to people who
renovate blighted housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal affected only property in New Orleans, where
there is a great deal of blighted housing,'' Renwick said. ``But
the proposal required approval by a statewide vote. New Orleans is
about two-thirds black. The state as a whole is about two-thirds
white. The proposal was defeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson did not mention the race issue in conceding defeat
late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did our best, kept the faith,'' he told a rally of
disappointed supporters. ``It's been a joyous journey. We tried to
make people understand there is a better way. I've had some ups and
downs in my life. Tonight has been a down. Now we'll have to wait
for another day.''
</P>
<P>
   When that day comes, some of Jefferson's friends say, he may run
for mayor of New Orleans.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The predominance of jet stream winds from the northwest across
the nation will lead to unusually dry and tranquil weather for much
of the week. While a series of fast-moving, but weak disturbances
will skirt across the northern third of the country, they will only
bring clouds and shifting winds as the moisture supply from the
Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean is sealed off by high pressure
covering the southeastern third of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The day will begin with record chill over parts of the Southeast
as the first frost ends the growing season in many sections of the
Piedmont plateau. Even northern Florida will notice readings in the
30s in rural locations. Abundant sunshine will raise temperatures
30 degrees above the gelid values at daybreak, but still not
reaching seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   Persistent clouds over New England and the central Appalachians
will slowly break allowing a few hours of sunshine in many interior
places during the afternoon. The winds will be noticeably lighter.
An active breeze will continue tonight along the Northeast Coast
and this will help keep temperatures from falling much.
</P>
<P>
   Low pressure over Lake Superior will cause gusty winds and
broken clouds over the northern half of the Great Lakes. A few
showers may dampen northern Michigan. High pressure building south
from Saskatchewan will merge with a milder fair weather system over
the Rockies. Warm air will move northward into the Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Northwest Coast will become unsettled with thickening
clouds and a little rain arriving during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TRANQUIL OCTOBER
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 15 airports in the United States that report hourly
weather observations were noting any precipitation early on Sunday
afternoon. This means that better than 98% of the over 1,000
weather stations were dry and nearly 70% of those had mainly sunny
skies. October is known as the tranquil weather month since the jet
stream which dips into the nation can leave a large ridge of high
pressure in its wake as it retreats. Indeed, high pressure will
stretch from the Carolinas to California on Monday and there may
only be a handful of sites that report any precipitation. &QL;

   Here are Anne Stephenson's New &AMP; Notable reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``GODFORSAKEN SEA'' &QL; 
By Derek Lundy (Algonquin, $22.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The open ocean might look tranquil on any given day, but smart
sailors never forget what Herman Melville called ``the tiger heart
that pants beneath it.'' There have been many adventure-at-sea
books released over the last two years, but we hope you haven't had
your fill because this one is terrific. In Lundy's prologue, he
describes the deep fear that came to him during his first trip
across the open sea in a small sailboat, with just his wife along.
Their goal was to reach the Virgin Islands, but in his heart Lundy
knew that they would make it ``only if the ocean let us through.''
He admits that some of that fear lingers even today when he goes to
sea in a small boat, which makes the subject of his book seem
logical: the Vendee Globe round-the-world race, an astonishing
competition in which participants sail alone for 27,000 miles, more
than half of it through the most dangerous waters in the world (the
Southern Ocean), sometimes taking as long as five months to finish.
Lundy focuses on the 1996-97 race, in which 16 skippers _ 14 men
and two women _ faced severe storms and life-threatening
conditions. One disappeared altogether, and several were rescued
from the freezing water after their boats ran into trouble. The
most dramatic rescue was that of Raphael Dinelli, whose boat
capsized, then righted itself briefly before it went down (a
freezing Dinelli lashed himself to the awash deck, then jumped into
a life raft minutes before the boat sank). His only hope of rescue
from the icy water was Pete Goss, a British competitor who was
caught in the same storm 160 miles downwind. When race authorities
contacted him, Goss immediately abandoned the race and battled for
30 hours through ferocious conditions to reach Dinelli, without
even knowing if he was still alive (yes, but barely). This tale of
heroism, not to mention superb sailing, has a sweet ending: Dinelli
lived, and he and Goss became close friends. If you couldn't get
through Sebastian Junger's ``The Perfect Storm,'' try this one.
It's wonderfully written by someone who knows what it's like to be
alone in a wilderness of wind and waves. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``ETHEL &AMP; ERNEST'' &QL; 
By Raymond Briggs (Knopf, $21) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   See those people on the cover? You know them. They are Ethel and
Ernest, but you know them by other names. That's what makes this
book so enchanting. It's possible to read it in one sitting,
because it is _ don't panic, please _ a comic strip. Raymond Briggs
is a British illustrator of children's books (``The Snowman,''
``Father Christmas''). He is also the son of Ethel and Ernest
Briggs. Here he imagines his parents' lives from the moment they
first saw each other in 1928 (she was a maid, he was about to
become a milkman) to their deaths nearly 50 years later. Their
conversations over the years reflect world events, from the rise of
Adolph Hitler to the invention of television. They also reflect
things that are not so common today but that we remember in so many
people who are now gone _ modesty, simplicity, an appreciation for
what one has and a stoic acceptance of the troubles life delivers
to one's door. This is Briggs' love letter to his parents. It's not
overly sentimental, just real and wistful and true. Enjoy. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE BOOK ON THE BOOKSHELF'' By Henry Petroski (Knopf, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Petroski (``The Evolution of Useful Things'') is an engineer who
has carved a rather charming literary niche for himself by paying
minute attention to objects that don't seem to deserve it. Pencils.
Paper clips. Zippers. In keeping with that tradition, we read the
title of this book and thought that it might be about the physical
properties of books _ spines, paper, type. We were wrong. It's
about the physical properties of bookshelves. Think about it:
Books. Bookshelves. As subjects go, one suffers by comparison.
Petroski, however, is undeterred. He studies the function and
history of shelves because, he says, ``looking afresh at and
thinking anew about the bookshelf, like looking or thinking from
scratch about anything found or made, brings its own rewards, not
the least of which are fresh new ways of encountering and
experiencing the world.'' We preferred the view from Anne Fadiman's
delightful ``Ex Libris,'' in which the shelves are pretty but the
books get equal time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``DIEGO RIVERA'' &QL; 
By Pete Hamill (Abrams, $49.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Pete Hamill traveled by bus from New York to Mexico
City to study art under the GI Bill. He was 21 and, he says, ``in a
daily state of exhilaration.'' He sought out the work of the great
Mexican painters and found in the canvases of Jose Clemente Orozco
and Rufino Tamayo a reason to alter his plans _ within a year, he
had lost his nerve and decided to become a writer, too overwhelmed
by the Mexican artists to paint pictures of his own. But what of
Diego Rivera, the great Mexican muralist? The young Hamill found
him to be ``clenched and stiff . . . hopelessly dated, someone out
of the 1930s.'' Thirty years later, when Hamill visited an exhibit
in Mexico City that celebrated the 100th anniversary of Rivera's
birth, his interest was reborn. For the first time, he says, he
could see what a great painter Rivera had been. This handsome and
engaging book, with photographs and reproductions of Rivera's work,
is both a biography and an analysis of the painter's art and its
effect on an entire country. ``The daughter of an industrialist and
the son of a farmer could look at the work of Diego Rivera and
recognize Mexico,'' says Hamill. ``He is like some great writers,
from Charles Dickens to William Faulkner to Gabriel Garcia Marquez:
the insistence on the value of the local leads to the universal.'' &QL;

 PHOENIX: election night.''   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Elizabeth Dole's withdrawal from the race last week, McCain
is certain to draw even more attention. Even McCain's backers say
that, inevitably, the public is likely to see a less appealing side
of the senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``With any personality trait there's always a good side and a
bad side,'' said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., co-chairman of the McCain
campaign. ``Obviously, somebody with his kind of intensity could in
certain situations upset people. But to some extent, as long as he
controls that strong-willed personality it is a positive factor in
terms of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has made some enemies in Washington. In an example of the
hostility toward him _ as well as to some of his proposals _ three
of McCain's Republican colleagues grilled him for hours about his
campaign finance proposal in an unusually personal and vituperative
display on the Senate floor the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by Mrs. Hull's backing, Bush, who campaigned here
last week, said he intended to spend more than $2 million to
compete in Arizona. Last week, he appointed the governor's son,
Michael Hull, as his state campaign manager. Forbes, the wealthy
publisher who won the primary here in 1996, also plans an
aggressive effort.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of McCain in the state Legislature sought
unsuccessfully to delay the date of the primary so it would not be
as crucial in the primary calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a Hobson's choice,'' said Jay Smith, who was a media
strategist for McCain's Senate campaigns and also a consultant to
Mrs. Hull. ``He's got to spend money to win. He can't lose Arizona.
But then he won't have anything left.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Minnaugh, chairman of the Arizona Republican Party,
said, ``If you don't win your state it's not Doomsday, but it's
harder to convince people in other states to vote for you. Bush
doesn't have to win the state. He just has to be in there close.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Mrs. Hull and McCain said the senator pleaded with the
governor to delay her endorsement because it came the same week he
announced his own candidacy. She said it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very, very, very calm conversation,'' Mrs. Hull
recalled of their talk. ``There was no yelling. He did ask if I
could delay it.'' Mrs. Hull said she told him the schedule was
already set.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe McCain's reaction, the governor said, ``Warm?
No. Clipped. But for John, that's warm.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hull, 64, was elevated from secretary of state in late 1997
after Gov. Fife Symington was convicted of fraud. She was elected
in her own right last year.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Phoenix, where he was stumping with Mrs.
Hull, Bush spoke respectfully of his rival, even as he made a
pointed reference to how he traveled here to hold a fund-raiser for
the senator's re-election last year. (Mrs. Hull said she first
heard Bush speak at that McCain fund-raiser.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Arizona are going to appreciate the fact that I
treat Sen. John McCain with respect,'' Bush said. ``I like him as a
person. He and I are friends. I actually came and helped him in his
Senate race.'' Insisting that he wanted to win Arizona, not
embarrass the home-state candidate, Bush said, ``I'm not in the
business of humiliating people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did his best to pull Mrs. Hull his way. He held
fund-raisers for her last year. Mrs. Hull said she never asked
McCain to hold a fund-raiser for her.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that although Mrs. Hull's decision was ``obviously a
disappointment,'' he still had the support of most elected
Republicans in his state. He insisted that he will not have to
spend as much money as Bush or Forbes because he is already so well
known in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see me buying ads,'' he said. ``If I do well in New
Hampshire and South Carolina, we will have no difficulty in our
home state.'' Dismissing surveys that show him to be in a tight
struggle with Bush, McCain said, ``Most polls in Arizona are really
bogus.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Merrill, a professor of mass communication at Arizona
State University who was McCain's pollster in his 1982
congressional race, disagreed, saying, ``If McCain's people don't
spend money and Bush's people spend 2 to 3 million bucks, then the
endorsement could make the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's two top political advisers in Arizona, Wes Gullett and
Jeff Groscost, the state House speaker, offered no apologies for
the senator's manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rough-and-tumble world,'' Gullett said.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost put it this way: ``In Arizona, politics is a blood
sport. If you're not wearing some Band-Aids you're not playing. And
quite frankly, my office has had tourniquets on before.''

camouflage around a striking new feature of federal fiscal policy:
most of the prospective surpluses are going to go to paying off the

huge repercussions. Indeed, it's the most fundamental development
in fiscal policy of the past decade, dramatically reshaping
economic policy with hardly any explicit and substantive debate. By

   QUIET, PLEASE: TEST IN PROGRESS
</P>
<P>
   It has been three months since IBM and major record labels began
the experiment: selling albums over high-speed Internet cable
modems in 1,000 households in metropolitan San Diego. But efforts
to assess the music test's progress, have met the sound of silence.
The companies have effectively imposed a publicity blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Max Martens, a spokesman for the project, which is called Album
Direct, said the participating companies did not want the news
media to influence the buying patterns of the San Diego consumers _
or to even know who the consumers were.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like sequestering a jury,'' Martens said. ``We don't want
to taint the very perceptions we're trying to evaluate.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts and competitors posit a different courtroom
analogy: mistrial. There are rumblings in the industry that the
project simply is not living up to the organizers' vision of a
21st-century music delivery method that protects copyrights. And
since the effort began in June, the participating record companies,
including the industry giants Universal and BMG, have begun
pursuing technologies other than the IBM system.
</P>
<P>
   What IBM has said is that the trial lets record companies sell
albums directly to consumer's homes over high-speed Internet lines.
After paying for and downloading music, the consumers can transfer
the songs from their computer to compact disks using so-called CD
burner technology, effectively creating their own home-grown CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, IBM and Album Direct officials are not saying much.
It will be at least the end of the year before they share
information about the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a tight-lipped, shifty-eyed type of thing,'' Martens
said. ``It's just not time to share yet.''

   THE PC INDUSTRY SHOWS STRONG GROWTH
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer industry is continuing to show significant
global growth, with third-quarter shipments of machines increasing
by 23.2 percent over the comparable quarter last year, according to
a Dataquest report to be issued on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dataquest, a market research company based in San Jose, Calif.,
cited strong growth in all regions of the world and lower prices as
the foundation of the continued surge in computer shipments, which
totaled 28.5 million in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer remained the world's largest PC maker with a
12.8 percent market share, although that figure was down from 13.4
percent last year. Compaq shipped 3.65 million computers during the
quarter, according to Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast Dell Computer, the No. 2 PC company, whose sales
have grown along with the rise of Internet commerce, expanded its
market share from 8.2 percent to 10.8 percent, shipping 3.07
million computers during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the two leaders were three other computer makers based in
the United States: IBM., Hewlett-Packard and Gateway. Dataquest
analysts said that companies like Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and IBM,
which have typically sold to customers indirectly, had experienced
slower growth than those like Dell specializing in direct sales
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Compaq's global leadership position, it dropped behind
Dell in sales of machines within the United States. That was a
milestone for Dell, according to Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   For the third quarter, Dell's domestic market share rose to 17.1
percent, up from 13.4 percent a year earlier _ a growth rate of
56.5 percent. Compaq's domestic shipments, meanwhile, rose only
24.9 percent, as its United States market share edged up to 15.3
percent, from 15 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, IBM's overall market share sank to 7.6 percent, from
8.4 percent in last year's third quarter. Last week, the company
announced that it was exiting the retail market and in the future
would sell its personal computers via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Dataquest said that the quarter was unusual because of the rise
of computer memory prices, a trend whose impact had been felt most
directly by Dell, but also by many of the other computer makers, in
terms of lower profits margins.
</P>
<P>
   Dataquest said that Gateway's new partnership with America
Online, announced last week, was an example of a shift to a
``next-generation PC economic model,'' which would shift the
emphasis in competition beyond high inventory turnover.

   AN E-COMMERCE SITE FOR E-COMMERCE VENDORS
</P>
<P>
   Electronic commerce is made possible by advanced communications
services and equipment. So it is noteworthy that many of the
companies that sell those services and equipment don't rely more
heavily on e-commerce themselves. But Telezoo.com, a Web site that
began operating earlier this year, is meant to change that.
</P>
<P>
   Telezoo's main asset is a data base of nearly 20,000
communications products and services from about 300 vendors and
communications carriers. At least as important as the data base's
breadth is its format.
</P>
<P>
   Telezoo's users _ generally information technology professionals
_ are able to submit their technical requirements for a given
product and then see a list of items that might meet their needs.
Or, a potential customer can submit a request for proposals from
carriers or equipment makers. Users have been logging into Telezoo
from various countries, including Egypt, Malaysia, Germany and
Singapore _ although the biggest contract handled on the site so
far has been a $55 million deal to supply communications equipment
to a Florida company. Elias Shams, the site's co-founder, who calls
himself ``chief zookeeper,'' said the site intended to charge
vendors fixed fees for listing their products and also a percentage
of the value of deals consummated through the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to find a product when it comes to telecom, which is such
a complex industry, is a three to five months average trying to
find a switch, a router or a service,'' Shams said. ``Even after
you spend that time, 30 to 40 percent of the time you might make
the wrong decisions because you're under a lot of stress, you have
to meet deadlines. At Telezoo, as a network engineer, you say,
`Give me a router, these are my requirements' and then _ zoom,
voila, you're shown an apples-to-apples comparison and put in touch
with someone at the vendor.''

 WASHINGTON: to mount.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than anything else, it was the political power of Social
Security that brought debt reduction to the top of the fiscal
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton started the process when he called in his 1998 State of
the Union address for the surplus to be left untouched until the
two parties had agreed on a plan to strengthen Social Security's
financial condition before the retirement of the vast baby-boom
generation.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy, which proved successful, was to block Republicans
on their signature issue by framing the fiscal choice before the
country as between saving Social Security and having a big tax cut.
At the time, White House aides said, debt reduction was considered
a nice byproduct of the strategy, but not the main goal.
</P>
<P>
   But by early this year, with the size of the projected surpluses
growing almost by the month, pressure was growing in both parties
to do something with the fiscal windfall. So Clinton set out a new
framework, saying that 63 percent of the total budget surplus over
the next 15 years should be used directly or indirectly for Social
Security, with the rest going to a variety of other programs, from
the military to education.
</P>
<P>
   Late last winter, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the
Senate Budget Committee, saw a way to trump the White House. He
pointed out that Clinton's proposal would allow the government to
spend some of the portion of the surplus being generated by Social
Security, a practice the government had engaged in for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici put forward a budget framework that allowed Republicans
to claim that they would not spend any of the Social Security
surplus, which amounts to roughly $2 trillion of the $3 trillion
total surplus over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans like Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of
the House Budget Committee, were reluctant at first, fearing that
the plan would limit their ability to press for an immediate tax
cut. But they eventually went along with Domenici's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, particularly in the House, were reluctant to sign on
to a program of austerity at a time of fiscal plenty. But by early
summer, Clinton had agreed that he too would leave the Social
Security surplus untouched, and most Democrats in Congress, not
wanting to cede the high ground as protectors of the New Deal
social-welfare legacy, reluctantly went along.
</P>
<P>
   The effect was a bipartisan consensus to allocate two-thirds of
the total surplus to debt reduction, a decision reached before
either party had fully thought through the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the two parties have been grappling with how to turn
their pledge into policy, starting with a budget for the fiscal
year that began on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   It is still not clear that the two parties will be able to
completely make good on their promise. Republicans in Congress have
had to resort to all manner of budget gimmicks to pass spending
bills that leave the Social Security surplus untouched for this
year, and they are counting on spending cuts that Clinton has
already made clear are unacceptable to him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed a tax hike on cigarettes as an alternative
to spending Social Security money, but there is little support for
the idea in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they miss their goal of leaving the Social Security
money alone, it would not be by much in the context of a $1.8
trillion budget and a projected total surplus for the new fiscal
year of $160 billion. In any case, spending some of the retirement
system's money would have little or no direct effect on Social
Security's long-term financial condition.

EXIT POLLS SHOW VOTERS REJECT PARTY OF PERON FOR ARGENTINE
PRESIDENCY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Buenos Aires Mayor Fernando de la Rua,
a somber centrist who campaigned pledging to clean up government
graft and breathe oxygen into a sluggish economy, appeared to win a
landslide victory in presidential elections Sunday, ending a decade
of rule under the flamboyant and unpredictable Carlos Saul Menem.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua's victory, forecast by exit polls on local television,
was widely expected, but significant for breaking the domination of
the populist party founded by Juan Domingo Peron, for decades the
most prominent politician in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers honking their horns loudly thronged the streets of
Buenos Aires Sunday evening, heralding what they hoped would be a
new era.
</P>
<P>
   Under Menem, the Justicialist party veered off its traditional
populist course and toward free market policies, creating a potent
coalition between the working class and an emerging upper middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   But the last year of deepening recession and a wide variety of
government scandals soured many Argentines toward Menem's rule,
busting the new coalition and leading to de la Rua's easy victory.
The capital's mayor appeared to coast through the campaign,
refusing to debate his leading opponent, Buenos Aires Gov. Eduardo
Duhalde, or to divulge many details of his policies.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial polls broadcast on local television stations
indicated that de la Rua, candidate of the center-left Alianza
coalition, had won 50.4 percent of all votes, enough to avoid a
second-round runoff. Total official results including counts from
small towns in the pampas and frigid Andean corners of Patagonia
were not expected until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in a distant second was Duhalde, the 58-year-old
candidate of Menem's party, who won 34.5 percent of the vote.
Domingo Cavallo, a former economy minister running on a
conservative third-party ticket, won 11.3 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes after polls closed, all major Argentine networks
declared de la Rua the winner, and his supporters poured into the
streets dancing across Buenos Aires' main thoroughfare, the Avenida
9 de Julio. Duhalde would not concede defeat early in the evening,
although several leaders in his party acknowledged that he had no
hope of winning.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua, an author of several law books and a lover of
gardening and golf, promised during the campaign to slice an
expanding budget deficit that he said would lower interest rates
and attract foreign investment. He pledged to grant incentives to
small and medium-sized business as a way to decrease the 14.5
percent unemployment rate, as well as narrow the gap between rich
and poor that has grown in recent years as the Menem government
sold off government agencies and enacted a slew of deregulatory
measures.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he would crack down on tax evasion and government
corruption, suggesting that at least some top officials in the
Menem administration could go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua, however, repeatedly promised during the campaign not
to touch the cornerstone of Menem's economic policy: pegging the
value of the Argentine peso one-to-one to the dollar, a policy that
ended a long history of hyperinflation and economic instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole country has high expectations,'' said de la Rua, 62,
wearing his usual blue blazer and ascot to his polling place in the
upper-class Buenos Aires neighborhood of Barrio Norte. In his
signature deadpan style, he added, ``I guess my life is going to
change a little tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   After voting, de la Rua talked amiably with reporters about the
recent baptism of a new grandson and predicted an orderly
transition. But he also made a special appeal to Menem to avoid any
costly last-minute pork-barrel projects leading up to the Dec. 10
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   As mayor of Buenos Aires, de la Rua was not known for any major
initiatives. But he put the city budget in the black, lengthened
the subway system, widened public health services and improved
services for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Duhalde managed to block Menem's attempts to contest a
constitutional ban against running for a third consecutive term,
but he never managed to unite and fire up his party. He veered
between distancing himself from Menem and embracing the successes
of the last decade, especially the end of hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   The election appears to mark the first time that the party of
Peron will lose power by popular mandate and not by military coup,
breaking an almost uninterrupted string of election victories that
gave it a domineering position in Argentina politics over the last
two generations.
</P>
<P>
   Its devastating defeat could have repercussions for years to
come, with what remains the country's largest political force going
through a probable power struggle to decide whether it returns to
its traditional left-wing direction or merely fine-tune Menem's
free market policies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, many analysts predict that de la Rua will not be a
forceful president. He will govern by leading an alliance of the
centrist Radical Party and the more liberal Frepaso Party, a group
that broke away from Menem's party in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties, joined in the Alianza, appear to have picked up
a few seats in the lower house of Congress but they will not have a
working majority. Menem's Justicialists will continue to control
the Senate through at least the 2001 elections, and also to
dominate the Supreme Court and most of the provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a government that will have to negotiate, a big
break from the way Menem was able to govern,'' said Mariano
Grondona, a columnist for the Buenos Aires daily La Nacion. ``It's
the end of the era of the `caudillo,''' he added, referring to the
Spanish term for the traditional ``strongman.''
</P>
<P>
   As voters went to the polls at an elementary school on Avenida
Eva Peron in the lower-middle class neighborhood of Parque
Chacabuco, they appeared in the mood to reject Menem even though he
was not on the ballot himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two teen-age daughters and they are going crazy trying
to find work,'' said Nilda Savastano, a 52-year-old social worker.
``This used to be a middle class neighborhood until Menem, who
brought stability for the rich and the politicians but not for the
rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 24 million people voted in what was the fourth
presidential election since civilians replaced a military
dictatorship in 1983. There were reports of only minor
irregularities and no violence, underscoring the political
stability that has replaced what once seemed like chronic
turbulence.

TYSON FORCED TO WAIT AS PANEL REVIEWS FIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Mike Tyson's boxing fate and $10 million purse are
in the hands of the Nevada State Athletic Commission until it can
determine whether he intentionally threw a late punch Saturday
night that caught Orlin Norris on the jaw and caused him to fall in
an awkward manner and injure his right knee. Norris could not
continue, and the bout was ruled no-contest because it was stopped
on an accidental foul.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Richard Steele, who ruled that the punch was accidental,
deducted 2 points from Tyson's total at the end of the round. Dr.
Flip Homansky examined Norris' knee in his corner before the second
round began and determined that it was injured. Homansky said there
was swelling and stiffness.
</P>
<P>
   Norris left the ring with an ice pack on his knee and was later
taken to Valley Hospital for a magnetic resonance imaging test.
Homansky told The Associated Press on Sunday that the test revealed
that Norris had dislocated his kneecap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MRI clearly shows the path his kneecap took when he went
to the ground,'' Homansky said. ``When he stood up it popped back
in. There's no way he could have continued. He very well might need
surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada commission, said
the five-member commission would review a tape of the fight on
Monday. Later in the week, the panel will determine whether Tyson's
purse should be forfeited and whether any other sanctions should be
imposed against the former two-time heavyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada commission restored Tyson's boxing license last
October after the fighter went through a battery of psychological
tests and the commission was convinced that he would not again do
anything outrageous in the ring. Tyson's license had been revoked
because he bit the ear of Evander Holyfield during a bout on June
29, 1997. Tyson was disqualified and was fined $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson and his promoter, Dan Goossen of America Presents, thought
Norris was faking the injury. ``It would be one thing if he limped
over to his corner or had to be dragged over there,'' Goossen said.
``But he didn't. He walked over there. He looked more hurt after he
sat down. As far as I'm concerned he had the ability to go back out
there and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson agreed with that statement. ``He could have got up and
continued,'' Tyson said of Norris. ``I put that heat on him and he
didn't want to continue. I was hearing all this stuff _ he's a
tough guy, he's not going to lay down, he's not like everybody
else, he's going to come to fight, he's a good boxer. I don't care
what you say about me, good or bad, you've got to have heart to get
in the ring with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he conducted himself, he should feel bad about
himself, he should feel disgraced. Real fighters fight until they
can't fight no more. When I fought Buster Douglas, I could have
quit that fight. When I fought Holyfield that first fight I could
have quit that fight. I took my beating like a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson said he did not hear the bell, even though it sounded five
times. His punch came about two seconds after the bell. When the
bell sounded for the start of the second round Tyson came out, but
Norris did not move from his corner. Norris' trainer, Abel Sanchez,
and one of his managers, Sterling McPherson, were telling Norris to
stay put and to not continue to fight. At one point, Tyson had to
be restrained by Goossen and his trainer, Tommy Brooks. The fans
booed Norris for not continuing, and they booed him when he left
the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Norris received his $800,000 purse, but the Internal Revenue
Service took $135,000 for back taxes and $266,667 went into escrow
because Norris' former promoter, Frank Warren, has sued Norris,
alleging that the boxer broke a promotional contract with Warren.
Warren says he is due one-third of Norris' purse. Goossen said they
would try to make a rematch of Tyson-Norris for Dec. 11, provided
that Norris has recovered from his knee injury. Norris first
injured his knee in a fight against Bert Cooper on Feb. 17, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   At Saturday's postfight news conference, which neither Norris
nor anyone from his corner attended, Tyson sounded frustrated and
didn't appear to want to get anywhere near a ring any time soon.
''I'm tired of all this stuff,'' Tyson said. ``I don't want to even
fight no more. I'm tired. I'm just tired.''

RIGHT-WING PARTY LEADS IN SWISS ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   GENEVA _ Switzerland's most right-wing political party surged to
stunning gains on Sunday in the country's parliamentary elections,
apparently capturing the largest share of the vote nationwide and
raising fears that this middle-of-the-road country is following its
neighbor Austria into political conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Televised exit polls from the nationwide elections showed the
Swiss People's Party captured some 23 percent of the votes cast for
Switzerland's lower house, up from 15 percent in the last elections
in 1995. If the trend holds, the People's Party, an anti-immigrant,
anti-tax and anti-European Union group dominated by outspoken
industrialist Christoph Blocher, could remake Switzerland's staid
political map.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-election polls had predicted that Blocher's party, which is
centered in the German-speaking portion of Switzerland, would
overtake the left-leaning Social Democrats and the two center-right
parties to become Switzerland's pre-eminent political party.
</P>
<P>
   But the size of its victory appeared to stun the political
establishment. Final results are not expected until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss elections came two weeks after Joerg Haider led his
far-right Freedom Party into second place in Austria's national
election, endangering his country's coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the success of Switzerland's ardent nationalists
threatens this country's so-called ``magic formula'' _ the
governing coalition of the country's four political parties which
has balanced regional interests and its four language groups _
French, Italian, German and Romansch _ since 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed on Swiss television, Blocher said the party would
demand a second seat on the seven-member Swiss federal council, the
Cabinet-like body that runs the country. Until now, his party had
one seat, with the remaining slots shared among the Social
Democrats, the centrist Christian Democrats and the free-market
Radical Party, all of which appeared to lose support on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Blocher's demand could mean that traditional Swiss consensus
politics will unravel into polarization and confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   If projections hold, the People's Party could gain some 17 seats
in the 200-member lower house. Predictions for the 46-member upper
house were not yet in. ``This is a real surge to the right,''
Claude Longchamp, director of a major political polling group, said
on Swiss television. The Social Democrats were the big losers, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   The jump in the nationalists' popularity is credited to Blocher,
a controversial millionaire businessman who heads the party's
Zurich section. Like Haider, who opposes immigration and says he
puts Austrians first, Blocher has campaigned on an anti-European
platform, opposing membership in the United Nations _ whose
European headquarters is in Geneva _ and the European Union and in
favor of maintaining traditional Swiss neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   He discounted comparisons with Haider, whose past praise of Nazi
employment policy and Waffen SS members as men of character has
made his popularity in Austria a cause of major concern abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same,'' Blocher insisted. ``We are for an open
Switzerland, but not for attachment to any international
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Controversy however erupted around Blocher last week with
publication of a March 1997 letter he wrote to the author of a book
called ``The Decline of Swiss Freedom.'' The author, Juergen Graf,
has repeatedly denied that millions of Jews died in Nazi Germany's
gas chambers. Blocher insisted that he was merely praising the
title and had not read the book itself.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, polls indicated, Blocher made gains even in the
French-speaking part of Switzerland, which is traditionally seen as
more outward-looking than the German-speaking areas in the center
and east of the country.

<P>
   Although record unemployment of over 7 percent has been dropping
in the past two years and Switzerland continues to have a high
standard of living, the vote appeared to reflect concern over jobs
and swelling immigration, particularly from Kosovo, the Yugoslav
province over which NATO went to war last spring.
</P>
<P>
   With the Balkan wars, Switzerland experienced its biggest influx
of refugees since World War II, registering more asylum seekers per
person than any other European country. However, a great number of
Kosovars have returned to their province now that U.N.
administration has replaced what the Kosovo Albanian majority
viewed as the oppressive rule of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Blocher attributed his gains to clear policies, not
``wishy-washy'' statements, in his interview.

HOPES, CONFIDENCE AMONG THE MISSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As he lost the game, UCLA coach Bob Toledo also
lost his team. The Bruins, as they existed two weeks ago, have
disappeared. Their confidence has vanished, their best players are
hurt, and the tiny senior class seems helpless to stop the descent.
</P>
<P>
   Only USC and fading bowl hopes separate the Bruins (3-5, 1-4)
from throwing in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the towel couldn't be any worse than UCLA was
Saturday in a 55-7 loss to last-place Oregon State. Wait, check
that. The Beavers were in last place before the game. Now, UCLA is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have confidence in the team,'' senior tailback Keith
Brown said. ``But I don't know where that level is for a lot of
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   First, the logistics. The Bruins must defeat Arizona, Washington
and USC to become bowl-eligible. There's no guarantee UCLA gets a
bid at 6-5, but it seems reasonable given the Hawaii bowls'
reliance on TV ratings. The problem, of course, is winning games.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive captain Pete Holland ruled out a players-only meeting,
saying that would be a sign of panic. Another good week of practice
isn't enough, and don't even think about a quarterback change. The
coaches are committed to freshman Cory Paus _ as they should be _
and he's only the sore throat, not the infection.
</P>
<P>
   What can be done? First, the drawing board is about to get busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go back and evaluate every player and every
scheme,'' coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the players were demoralized, Toledo added: ``We'll
find out Monday. We're hurting pretty bad. It's no fun to work hard
and get embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, some tweaking is required _ here's one vote for
throwing more on first down early in the game _ but it's too late
to change the offense or revamp the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the systems aren't the problem. The Bruins are using
the same offense that averaged 40 points a game in 1997-98, but
instead of seniors there are freshmen and sophomores. The defensive
problems result from personnel _ or lack thereof in the secondary _
not strategy.
</P>
<P>
   If they can't change tactics, can they change talent? Not
really. Most teams in this predicament would bench upperclassmen
who aren't performing and give younger players a chance. But the
Bruins are using their young players. Of the 60 players in uniform
Saturday, there were 12 seniors and eight walk-ons.
</P>
<P>
   If healthy, sophomore tailback DeShaun Foster would be playing
ahead of Brown, a senior, and junior Jermaine Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   All the able-bodied receivers are playing.
</P>
<P>
   There are two seniors among 10 offensive linemen (Matt Phelan
and Jim Ghezzi) and both are reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Holland is the only senior in the defensive-line rotation.
Gifted freshman end Sean Phillips and rookie linebacker Marcus
Reese are getting all the snaps they can handle.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Lovell Houston's insertion into the lineup _ he replaced
fifth-year senior Eric Whitfield _ completed the youth movement in
the secondary. The only healthy underclassman not in the rotation
is safety Jason Stephens, who lost his starting job earlier in the
year because of poor play.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins can't change their strategy and they can't change
their lineup. All they can do is change their minds.

<P>
   VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico _ As his windshield wipers beat against a
relentless gray rain, Eduardo Gomez pulled his car up to the edge
of a swampy lagoon littered with plastic bottles and broken chairs.
He gestured toward a cluster of houses that stood, dark and silent,
in the middle of the waters. ``My house is in there,'' Gomez, 52, a
taxi driver, said mournfully.
</P>
<P>
   The last time he had seen his living room was on Sept. 16, when
one of the several rivers that course around this delta city rose
up and filled his ground floor and four inches of the upstairs. His
losses include his refrigerator, stove, television, living room
sofa and dining room table, most of the fruits of a lifetime of
work.
</P>
<P>
   But Gomez does not regard himself as the victim of an act of God
or the wrath of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dams _ that's what caused it,'' he said. ``They
miscalculated the water in the dams.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Gomez, many residents of Villahermosa (pronounced BEE-ya
er-MO-sa), capital of the Gulf state of Tabasco, are convinced that
the monthlong floods that turned their streets into canals and
their suburbs into marinas were caused by a demon of human origin
that they have loathed and battled for years: the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, like its neighbor to the north, is a federation of
states, 31 in all, with distinctive regional identities. Just as
Americans have grown suspicious of the goings-on inside the
Beltway, many Mexicans in the provinces harbor an abiding distrust
of the national authorities in Mexico City, known here simply as
``el centro,'' the center.
</P>
<P>
   It happens that the flow of water on the Grijalva and Carrizal
Rivers, which wind around Villahermosa, is governed by a
hydroelectric system of four dams located far upstream. They are
run by the National Water Commission, a federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Tabasco, along with most of central Mexico, has
been drenched in recent weeks with rainfalls heavier than any seen
since the country has kept records.
</P>
<P>
   Many flood victims here contend that the flooding is the result
of decisions by the National Water Commission to deluge them in
September by opening the dams' floodgates without telling anyone
and to continue to pump huge amounts of water through the dams'
turbines. Residents say the hidden purpose was to maintain a supply
of electricity to industries in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The citizens of Tabasco also have a theory for why President
Ernesto Zedillo and his officials would not mind drowning their
state. Roberto Madrazo Pintado, a much-liked politician who stepped
down as governor in June, is running hard to win the governing
party's nomination as its presidential candidate for elections next
year. His main opponent, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, is believed to
be Zedillo's choice for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Residents have reason to be upset. Neighborhoods all around the
edge of Villahermosa, both poor districts and upscale communities,
have been immersed for nearly five weeks. As people moved out of
their homes, snakes and crocodiles moved in. More than 186,000
people in the state lost their homes and 24,000 people are living
in shelters.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The 1,300 inmates of the overcrowded men's state prison were
forced to retreat to the roof, fleeing cells filled with two feet
of fetid wash. Their relatives have had to wade chest-deep in mire
to bring them what food they can.
</P>
<P>
   (On Friday the prisoners rioted for the fourth time since the
jail was flooded. Prison officials said that nine inmates were
killed in attacks by other inmates, and that 350 were moved to
jails in other states.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The release of water from the federal dams does have something
to do with the high waters around Villahermosa. The engineers who
run the dams say that the heavy rains have filled the dams to
capacity and they are in danger of rupturing. The engineers said
that they never opened any floodgates in September. But they did
continue to pump water through the turbines rather than close them
down, as some officials in Villahermosa demanded. They say it had
nothing to do with supplying electricity to other states.
</P>
<P>
   (At 2 a.m. on Saturday, engineers opened four of the eight
floodgates of the Penitas Dam, the one farthest downstream of the
four dams on the Grijalva River. It was the first time the gates
had been opened since the dam was built in 1987, officials said,
and they warned that the water around Villahermosa would rise one
and a half feet. Thousands of residents fled lowland homes while
army troops rushed to finish sandbag barricades along the
riverbank.)
</P>
<P>
   But the increased flow from the dams does not explain why the
waters sat and stagnated around Villahermosa instead of draining
away, as they did in past hurricanes and floods.
</P>
<P>
   In this decade several Tabasco governors, including Madrazo,
built ambitious highways, housing projects and shopping malls by
filling in waterways around the city that were crucial to the
rivers' drainage. Silvia Whizar, an ecologist from Tabasco, said
the state government mapped key drainage areas in 1987 and
prohibited development in them. But Madrazo, among other state
leaders, ignored the bans.
</P>
<P>
   In the drive to lay blame, nasty accusations have flown between
state and federal officials. On Oct. 10 a local foundation that is
in charge of raising money for Madrazo's presidential campaign told
Zedillo in an open letter, ``The perception of the majority in this
state'' is that the opening of the dams ``was designed and carried
out for political reasons and in bad faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo retorted by rebuking Madrazo for politicizing a natural
disaster. The interior minister, Diodoro Carrasco, said Madrazo and
his allies in Tabasco had shown ``a total lack of ethics.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pro-Madrazo lawmakers in Tabasco have kept up their attacks on
the federal government. ``What they are telling us is that we can't
be right,'' said Manuel Andrade Diaz, the leader of the state
Congress, who is also Madrazo's campaign manager for the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are saying that the officials who manage Mexico's water
are federal, so they must be right. That's what our people do not
accept: that kind of arrogance.''

CANADA'S TIES TO THE QUEEN GROW LIVELIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ In 1942, with Japanese troops occupying Hong Kong, a
well-dressed Chinese family stood quietly on a dock waiting to
board a ship for evacuation to Canada, a country then legally
closed to Chinese immigration. A colonial inspector skeptically
eyed the family, including 3-year-old Adrienne Poy, and then
announced loudly that they did not look like Canadians to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were first turned away, because they were Chinese,''
Prime Minister Jean Chretien recounted in early October in a speech
broadcast nationwide from Canada's gilded Senate chamber. Behind
him, on a throne of scarlet velour and Canadian oak, sat Adrienne,
now grown up and about to become governor general, the personal
representative of Queen Elizabeth II to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The fairy-tale rise of Adrienne Clarkson, 60, from wartime
refugee to the nation's first immigrant governor general has
captivated Canada, created a storm of controversy, and pumped fresh
blood into monarchism in Canada. This new attention to the monarchy
comes as Australia, which Canada often uses as a benchmark,
prepares to vote Nov. 6 in a referendum on whether to break with
the British crown and become a republic.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Canada's prime minister has appointed a bland
retired politician as governor general. Although largely
ceremonial, the post does carry the authority to fire the prime
minister in time of crisis, a confrontation that has not occurred
since 1926.
</P>
<P>
   But with Madame Clarkson, as she likes to be addressed,
Canadians suddenly have a media savvy woman with intellectual
gravitas _ a skilled communicator familiar to virtually every
household from Newfoundland to British Columbia. From 1963 until a
few months ago, generations of Canadians grew up watching Adrienne
Clarkson on public television _ book reviewer, investigative
reporter, foreign correspondent, and cultural program hostess.
</P>
<P>
   She became such a television icon that one comedian lampooned
her familiar introduction line, announcing imperiously, ``I'm
Adrienne Clarkson _ and you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows Adrienne Clarkson, she's been on TV, for the
CBC, for years,'' said David Giles, a cell phone repairman here.
``She's something new and exciting and fresh. The others were old
and stodgy.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Asian to become the queen's representative here, she
has also attracted some thinly veiled racist thunderbolts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This appointment degrades Her Majesty, the office of governor
general, and Canada as a whole,'' Kenneth Lieblich, a leader of the
Monarchist League of Canada, wrote to a newspaper from greater
Vancouver, a region with a population that is 20 percent Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Of a woman who has written three novels, headed the nation's
largest publishing company, served for five years as a diplomat in
Paris, been host on an estimated 3,500 public television shows, and
most recently headed the Canadian Museum of Civilization, he
sniffed, ``Her qualifications are mediocre at best, and her loyalty
to the crown is unknown and untested.''
</P>
<P>
   Others complained that she and her husband, John Ralston Saul,
were leftists opposed to free trade with the United States and
devoted to affirmative action for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Clarkson emerged as a spokesperson for cultural and
economic nationalism and the left in general,'' The National Post
said in an editorial titled, ``A governor general for half the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, this conservative newspaper went after her
husband, a 52-year-old author and philosopher. ``Like so many
left-wing intellectuals, Ralston Saul appears to see the world from
a book-lined cave without windows,'' an editorialist wrote. ``The
shadows that dance on his cranial wall are not Plato's imperfect
representations of `ideal' reality, but projections of capitalist
ghosts and goblins.''
</P>
<P>
   Then reporters rummaged through the couple's personal life,
discovering that after 15 years of living together they hastily
married this summer, when they learned she was in the running to
become the queen's representative. Digging further, they discovered
that she feuded with her Toronto neighbors and was so estranged
from her two adult daughters that she did not list them in her
official biographies.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been given a scandalous, rocky ride in the press,''
Margaret Atwood, the novelist and a friend, complained. ``She has
had some press that I would consider basically sexist and racist.''
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere between the Sept. 8 appointment and the Oct. 7
installation, Canadians began to be fascinated by their governor
general designate.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, let's recap,'' a reader wrote The Globe and Mail last
week. ``She has an ex-spouse who doesn't want to talk about her,
daughters who are uninterested in her achievements and seem to
prefer their stepmother. She fights with her neighbors and she gets
married to keep up appearances with the queen. It looks as if the
prime minister has chosen a perfect royal representative!''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By the time the new governor general walked into parliament past
the clicking heels of the Princess Patricia's Light Infantry last
week, The National Post published a poll that showed 83 percent of
adults surveyed called her appointment ``good'' or ``very good.''
In contrast, only one quarter could name her predecessor, Romeo
LeBlanc, a former member of parliament for the governing Liberal
Party.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate chamber, as she alternated smoothly between
British-accented English and Parisian-accented French, her words
did not always match the velvet and ermine decor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not arrive as part of a regular immigration
procedure,'' she said, looking fondly at her 92-year-old father,
seated in a place of honor. Recalling how the family won a waiver
to a Canadian law barring Chinese immigrants, she added, ``There
was no such thing for a Chinese family at that time in Canadian
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling her family's move to Canada's capital, in 1942, she
said: ``The city of Ottawa, then, was small and white _ like most
of Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   She was eager to learn French, she recalled, but was barred from
enrolling at a local public French school because she was
Protestant and the school was controlled by Catholics. Her journey
to become a Canadian was eased by a series of Ontario ``public
school teachers, though, she said, who treated me only as bright _
not bright yellow.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech soon evolved into an eloquent ode to ``the Canadian
dream,'' peppered with citations from a dozen Canadian writers,
ranging from Samuel de Champlain, the 17th-century French explorer,
to Leonard Cohen, the contemporary song writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not see ourselves as a small country of 30 million
people, floundering in a large land mass,'' she said, lecturing
Canadians about their frequent lack of national pride and
self-confidence. ``We are among the healthiest, best-educated
people in the world, with great natural riches.''
</P>
<P>
   The smoke from a 21-gun artillery salute was still in the air
and the new governor general's horse-drawn landau was clip-clopping
from Parliament Hill to Rideau Hall when Canadian reporters started
to rave about someone they usually ignore: the representative of
the queen.
</P>
<P>
   At the 79-acre estate, the governor general was greeted by aides
addressing her as ``Your Excellency.'' In an interview in a
high-ceilinged drawing room of the 1838 vice-regal palace, she
serenely dismissed the press uproar of last month.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing her new, nonpartisan, representative-of-the-queen hat,
the former television interviewer deftly ducked controversial
subjects like Canada's detention this summer of about 600
immigrants who arrived without passports in boats from China.
</P>
<P>
   But according to a friend, she was secretly pleased by one
newspaper cartoon last month. In the cartoon, a Mountie sternly
looks down at a huddled boatload of illegal Chinese immigrants,
then warns a fellow Mountie to be careful because ``one of them
could be a future governor general.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Denouncing Patrick Buchanan as a ``Hitler lover,''
Donald Trump announced Sunday he was resigning his Republican
registration in advance of a possible challenge to Buchanan in his
expected quest for the Reform Party presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very great possibility that I will run,'' said Trump,
the real estate and casino millionaire. He timed his announcement
for the eve of Buchanan's speech on Monday in which he is expected
to quit the Republican Party and aim his presidential campaign for
the Reform nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan brushed aside Trump's charges of anti-Semitism as he
courted Reform Party officials at a reception here Sunday in
advance of his expected announcement of a party crossover. ``To get
in a slanging match with someone is not why I'm doing this,'' he
told reporters outside the Westin Fairfax Hotel. ``We don't run
negative campaigns. I'm not in this because I dislike other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump is considered by Buchanan supporters as a straw man
fronting for the wing of the Reform Party aligned with Gov. Jesse
Ventura of Minnesota, a faction that is opposed to a Buchanan
candidacy. But Trump insisted that his own decision to quit the
Republican Party was rooted in philosophical differences with the
party, not political gamesmanship or his appetite for personal
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe the Republicans are just too crazy right,''
he said when he disclosed that he would register with the
Independence Party, the New York version of the Reform Party. He
said he would begin meeting with Reform Party officials in the next
few months and make a final decision by March about whether to run.
</P>
<P>
   Trump, who has never been a political candidate, clearly timed
his announcement to target Buchanan, acidly denouncing him on the
NBC News program ``Meet the Press'' as the candidate of the
``really staunch right wacko vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, he's a Hitler lover,'' Trump said, alluding to the
recent controversy over Buchanan's view that in World War II Hitler
had initially presented no serious threat to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he's an anti-Semite,'' Trump said, raising an
accusation Buchanan has repeatedly denied in his career as a White
House strategist and talk show polemicist. ``He doesn't like the
blacks, he doesn't like the gays,'' Trump continued. ``It's just
incredible that anybody could embrace this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan responded that he would not be pulled into ``the old
name-calling and nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a pretty good mood,'' he said, preparing to retool his
chronic presidential quest.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he might fare against a millionaire opponent, Buchanan
said, ``I don't believe the Reform Party nomination can be bought
and I don't believe the presidency can be bought.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Choate, Buchanan's chief supporter in the Reform Party,
added, ``That sort of hate politics has no place in the Reform
party.'' Earlier, Choate rebuffed the Trump charges on the CBS News
program ``Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened here is a degree of pundit bigotry about Pat
Buchanan,'' Choate declared, saying there was no evidence in
Buchanan's writings of the charges. ``So they concoct, make up
positions, and then attack him on that.''
</P>
<P>
   But former Sen. Warren Rudman, the national co-chairman of the
Republican presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
countered on the television program that Buchanan had become
increasingly offensive. ``Many people are starting to believe that
if he is not an anti-Semite, he certainly is doing a wonderful
imitation,'' Rudman declared.
</P>
<P>
   While denouncing Buchanan, Trump sent conflicting signals about
his own possible candidacy. ``It's something I'm very, very serious
about,'' he insisted on ``Meet the Press.'' But he soon added, ``I
would only do this if I felt I could win the election.''
Historically, third-party presidential candidates fail.
</P>
<P>
   At the Reform reception, party officials offered a mixed
assessment of a Trump candidacy, with several doubting Trump was
serious. ``We don't need name-calling,'' said Beverly Kidder, a
party member from New Jersey. She added: ``His treatment of women _
his wives, plural _ is notorious. If I were Ivana I would have
gotten a better deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his tabloid image as a womanizer, Trump said on
``Meet the Press,'' ``If I think that's going to be a great
impediment, I'm not going to bother.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's anticipated switch and how it might damage the
Republican ticket was the talk of the Sunday political TV programs.
Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition, estimated on
``Face the Nation'' that Buchanan had ``discredited himself
tremendously'' but could do serious damage to both major parties if
he picked a pro-labor running mate like James Hoffa Jr., the
teamsters chief.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman argued that the GOP was well rid of Buchanan whom he
described as a ``total hypocrite'' who had little in common with
Reform Party views but was after the $13 million in federal
campaign money the nomination offered.
</P>
<P>
   Choate said Buchanan could easily weather a Trump challenge on
the merits. But he allowed that Trump would ``make a good
candidate'' because of name recognition and personal wealth. ``I
think he'd be very effective,'' Choate said as the Reform officials
awaited Buchanan's announcement.

NORTHRIDGE IN HUNT FOR BIG SKY TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some might have thought it was finished a month
ago, but the Cal State Northridge football team is a threat in the
Big Sky Conference.
</P>
<P>
   OK, a three-point win over disappointing Montana State doesn't
mean CSUN students should start partying in the intersection of
Devonshire and Lindley.
</P>
<P>
   But winning a tough road game, at any level, in any conference,
means respect. Walloping Sacramento State at home two weeks ago was
quaint, but beating Montana State in the Bobcats' homecoming game
was a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors (4-3, 3-2) are supposed to win at North Campus
Stadium, where they are 3-0 this season. Until Saturday's 24-21 win
over the host Bobcats, they hadn't won a conference road game since
beating Weber State 26-10 on Halloween last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually don't lose at home,'' CSUN quarterback Marcus Brady
said Saturday, ``so (people) figured, `They got their win at
home.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now CSUN has a chance at the Big Sky title. The Matadors, tied
for second place, are favored to beat Weber State at home this
week. If that happens, Northridge _ picked to finish eighth by the
conference's coaches in July _ goes to Big Sky co-leader Portland
State (6-2, 5-1) Nov.6 with two Big Sky losses.
</P>
<P>
   Montana (6-1, 5-1) has a tie-breaking advantage over CSUN
because the Grizzlies beat the Matadors. So does Eastern Washington
(4-4, 3-2), because the Eagles also beat CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   Montana plays at Montana State in the season finale in one of
the nation's most bitter rivalries. If the Bobcats can pull off the
upset, and if CSUN can upset Portland State and beat Northern
Arizona at home Nov.20 ... but that's a lot of ifs.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the team hasn't been so wrong in closing every practice by
yelling in unison: ``Big Sky champs!''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the defense is leading the way. Despite allowing
two fourth-quarter touchdowns Saturday, it must be satisfying for
the Matadors' coaching staff winning a game with only 24 points.
Since giving up 48 in the Montana loss Oct.9, the Matadors have
allowed a combined 35 points in the winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it has to do with the confidence built up last
week,'' CSUN interim head coach Jeff Kearin said Saturday,
referring to the clampdown of Sacramento State. ``We can play good
defensive football.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana State, which trailed 24-0 before rallying, was
demoralized. About 10,000 fans came to see the Bobcats win, and
homecoming is serious business in Eastern Montana. Doug Fullerton,
the Big Sky Commissioner, passed on attending Montana-Eastern
Washington to come to Bozeman; Fullerton was the athletic director
at MSU for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Hysell, Montana State head coach and an MSU graduate, put
his face in his hands several times in his short postgame press
conference. ``That's all I've got guys,'' he said at the end,
before walking away.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN has a chance for a winning season, and a possible
conference title, in the same season it suffered a 71-14 loss to
mediocre Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors, unlike Hysell on Saturday, still have something
left.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Senior center Julio Alcala missed his first game of the
season with ankle and back soreness. Alcala sprained his left ankle
against Sacramento State and didn't practice last week.

CLINTON TO ATTACK DRUG INDUSTRY ON MEDICARE PLAN  
(EXCLUSIVE)
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is opening a new attack on the
drug industry, saying that drug companies are charging too much and
have grossly misrepresented his proposal to offer drug coverage to
all Medicare beneficiaries, White House officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The political offensive, echoing Clinton's harsh criticism of
the industry in 1993, is set to begin on Monday in a speech that
will set the stage for an election-year fight over Medicare drug
benefits. Democratic candidates for Congress and the White House
say they will press the issue because they see it as a way to
underline their differences with Republicans on a pocketbook issue
vital to millions of voters.
</P>
<P>
   White House documents, written to buttress Clinton's case,
criticize the pharmaceutical industry on the ground that it is
running a ``multimillion-dollar scare campaign'' of advertisements
to kill his proposal. In addition, White House officials said,
Clinton will observe that prescription drug prices are often higher
in the United States than in other advanced industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Sunday, Joel Johnson, a senior adviser to the
president, said: ``We have reluctantly concluded that the
pharmaceutical industry has chosen the path of confrontation rather
than cooperation. The president extended an olive branch to the
industry. They snapped it off. Their ad campaign is evidence of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they welcomed the opportunity to take
on a politically powerful, well-financed industry. If Clinton
secures Medicare coverage of prescription drugs, they said, he will
cement his legacy in health policy.
</P>
<P>
   And even if he tries in vain, they say, the fight may help
Democrats regain control of the House of Representatives while
aiding the campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Drug company executives defended their prices as fair and their
advertising as accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Holmer, president of the industry's main trade association,
the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said:
``Drug discovery is a very high-risk enterprise. On the average, it
costs $500 million to get one new medicine to market over 12 to 15
years. In 1999, the pharmaceutical industry is investing $24
billion in research and development. This represents 20 percent of
sales revenues, the highest percentage of any industry in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's attack comes just as the drug industry is
encouraging Medicare beneficiaries to write Congress in opposition
to the president's plan. Republican leaders of the House and the
Senate have already said that no new prescription-drug benefit will
pass this year, but that they will consider it next year.
</P>
<P>
   The industry and its allies, operating through an organization
called Citizens for Better Medicare, are circulating the suggested
text of letters to Congress. The letters say, for example: ``I hope
you will oppose the Clinton plan'' and ``The White House plan is
basically a government takeover of the prescription medicine
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies say they support the goal of providing drug
coverage to the elderly, but fear that Democratic proposals could
lead to federal price controls, which in turn could reduce the
revenues they need for drug research.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson summarized a theme of the remarks to be delivered by the
president on Monday: ``High drug prices hurt seniors every day. A
Medicare drug benefit could alleviate that pain. Seniors often
forgo the medicine that a physician prescribes, because they can't
afford to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, White House officials said, Clinton will direct the
secretary of health and human services to do a 90-day study of drug
costs for the elderly. Specifically, he will ask for data to
document that elderly people who buy drugs on their own pay much
higher prices than favored customers like health maintenance
organizations and the federal Department of Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's message is being carried in radio, television and
newspaper advertisements featuring a woman named Flo, who frets
that Clinton would allow the government to meddle in her medicine
chest and force elderly people to get drug benefits through a
government-run health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Holmer said he believed that the advertisements were ``utterly
accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton says the advertisements spread ``several myths.''
Under his proposal, he says, Medicare would hire private companies
to manage drug benefits for the elderly, and the government would
not regulate drug prices or tell doctors what drugs they could or
could not prescribe.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, White House documents say, Clinton will rebut the
contention that his proposal would force Medicare beneficiaries
into a government-run health plan. He will insist that drug
benefits under his proposal are ``purely optional,'' and that
Medicare beneficiaries may keep any private drug coverage they now
have.
</P>
<P>
   On these issues, the facts are not black and white; the
disagreements often involve matters of interpretation. Independent
experts said that Clinton had probably underestimated the cost of
his drug plan, which he put at $118 billion over 10 years. But they
noted that the industry, while criticizing the Clinton plan, had
not offered a detailed alternative to ensure that the elderly get
the drugs they need.
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's proposal, Medicare would pay half of a
beneficiary's drug expenses, up to certain limits. The maximum
federal payment would start at $1,000 in 2002 and would increase
gradually to $2,500 in 2008.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In town meetings across the country, Republicans and Democrats
alike say, they have heard countless complaints from elderly
constituents aggrieved by the price of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, a Delaware Republican facing a tough fight
for re-election, said in June that the disparity between drug
prices in the United States and those in other countries was ``a
matter of real concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said, ``The public in America is
getting gouged.'' Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said, ``We've all
heard horror stories of seniors on fixed incomes forced to choose
between their medication and food.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have said they see a need for Medicare drug benefits
and want to start with low-income people. But the American
Association of Retired Persons says that ``all beneficiaries,
regardless of income, can have high out-of-pocket drug expenses''
and should therefore have access to Medicare drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats cite the erosion of employer-sponsored health benefits
as a reason for the government to provide drug coverage through
Medicare. A new study prepared for the Kaiser Family Foundation
says that the proportion of large employers offering retiree health
benefits has declined, to 67 percent in 1998 from 80 percent in
1991.

COLOMBIA AND REBEL GROUP BEGIN PEACE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO _ After nearly a year of false starts, dashed
hopes and spiraling violence, the Colombian government and the
country's principal Marxist guerrilla group began formal
negotiations Sunday aimed at ending more than three decades of
violent civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting at a site deep in a rebel-controlled zone, a government
team and leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
known here by the Spanish-language acronym FARC, met to discuss a
12-point agenda likely to be as contentious as the preliminaries.
The rebels are demanding an overhaul of virtually every aspect of
national life as a price for a negotiated settlement and have
resisted demands that they give up kidnapping and drug-trafficking,
their main sources of income.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are being held in Uribe, one of five rural
municipalities in a south-central region of savannah that President
Andres Pastrana declared a demilitarized zone last November and
handed over to the insurgents in a good-faith gesture intended to
get negotiations started. The rebels were not required to declare a
cease-fire in exchange, and no mechanism was created to monitor
their activities in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Initial discussions about a negotiating agenda began in January,
but were almost immediately suspended, after guerrilla leaders
accused the government of collusion with right-wing paramilitary
units and demanded the death squads be brought under control. Talks
resumed again in the spring, though, and early in May the
government announced that agreement on an agenda had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   But the formal start of negotiations was suspended days later
and then again in early July in a dispute over the role that
international observers would play in the process. After the
guerrillas launched a military offensive in mid-July that briefly
brought them near the outskirts of Bogota, the capital, the future
of the peace efforts seemed to be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, the Pastrana government has dropped its
demand for some form of foreign monitoring of the
guerrilla-controlled zone. At the same time, the U.S. Congress is
considering an emergency aid package for Colombia, which the rebels
have strongly criticized, that could entail as much as $1.5 billion
in assistance, much of it to the military, over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace is a long process that is not achieved from one day to
the next,'' Pastrana cautioned Friday while on a visit to Spain,
adding that while he hopes an agreement can be reached before his
term expires in 2002, he cannot guarantee success. ``The important
thing is to take the first step and that there exists political
will to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite expectations the talks will be slow-moving, Pastrana
clearly hopes his political standing will be strengthened by having
finally brought the rebels to the table. He has been castigated by
many Colombians _ three quarters of those who responded in a recent
poll said they believed the rebels were not negotiating honestly _
and some American officials for having ceded so much without
getting anything in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``This territory no longer belongs to the Colombian state, but
to the narco-terrorists of the FARC,'' Gen. Harold Bedoya, a former
minister of defense, complained in an interview here earlier this
month. ``The government has removed the last vestiges of public
authority from this area and handed over 200,000 Colombians to this
mafia, which has taken advantage of this absurd decision to build
drug laboratories and bring in arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The formal start to the peace talks coincided with a series of
protest marches in 700 cities and towns across the country Sunday,
demanding respect for human rights and an end to the violence that
has killed 35,000 in the last decade and displaced another 1.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations, in which several million of the country's 40
million people were said to have taken part, were organized by a
civic group called ``No Mas,'' or ``No More'' and had the support
of the government, which welcomes pressure on the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before the protests were to begin, however, three
powerful bombs exploded in Medellin, traditionally one of
Colombia's most violent cities.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the blasts caused extensive damage but that no
one was killed and that while guerrillas, drug traffickers and
right-wing paramilitary units were all possible suspects, no group
had yet claimed responsibility.

TV-GOODY (Undated) _ If you go by Emmy standards, Ally McBeal,

MCCAIN (Phoenix) _ Arizona Sen. John McCain is trying to run a
presidential campaign and at the same time reform the U.S.
political system, rather like trying to shoe the horse as he rides
it. But McCain is determined to turn that apparent disadvantage
into an opportunity, his aides say, by taking the issue on the
campaign trail and spearing his political opponents with it every
chance he gets. On Wednesday, McCain will take his first stab,
challenging his GOP competitors on the eve of a debate in New
Hampshire to support a plan to fund an education voucher program by
eliminating subsidies for oil, sugar, gas and ethanol. By KRIS

ANTIAGING CLINICS (Phoenix) _ Like most people, Bobbie Clift
doesn't enjoy growing old. Unlike most, she's doing something about
it. ``There's nothing better than to feel like you're not growing
old,'' said Clift, 39, a Nashville businesswoman. It's such a good
feeling, in fact, that Clift now flies to Phoenix three times a
year and pays thousands annually for treatments at an anti-aging
clinic opened recently by Valley millionaire John Sperling.
Sperling, 78, founder of the University of Phoenix, plans to open
nine upscale ``age-management'' clinics in Arizona and California,
and to invest at least a million dollars a year into aging
research. The first Kronos Clinic _ named for the Greek god of time
_ opened in Phoenix; the second is scheduled to open in Scottsdale,
Ariz., in the spring. By MAUREEN WEST. Story will move in the ``A''
and ``L'' categories. &QL;

<P>
   TODAY: With opening night coming up quickly, the Lakers have
just one more week of dress rehearsals. Which is not meant to imply
Dennis Rodman is returning. NBA exhibition: Portland vs. Lakers in
Albuquerque, N.M., Channel 9, 6:30 p.m. (KCAL also has this week:
Lakers vs. Phoenix in Las Vegas, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m.; Lakers vs.
Utah from the Pond, Thursday at 7:30 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY: The Series moves to Yankee Stadium, where the locals
spit on those stupid foam tomahawks. Real tomahawks aren't even on
the NYPD's list of top-10 deadly weapons. World Series Game 3:
Atlanta at New York Yankees, Channel 4, 5 p.m. (NBC also has Game 4
Wednesday at 5 p.m., Game 5 Thursday at 5 p.m., Game 6 Saturday at
4:30 p.m. and Game 7 Sunday at 4:30 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY: The Penguins' Jaromir Jagr has shed his long, flowing
locks, meaning hockey chicks must dig the short cut. NHL:
Pittsburgh at Ducks, FSW2, 7:30 p.m. (Also: FSW has Pittsburgh's
game at Kings, Thursday at 7:30 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY: Valencia High running back Manuel White needs a
320-yard rushing game to match Charles White for No.2 on the San
Fernando Valley's career list. Two more yards than that gives him
6,000 total. Maybe that's a little too optimistic to expect against
a team like Hart, but you expect he'll play the entire game this
time instead of sitting down at the half in a blowout. Prep
football: Hart vs. Valencia, FSW2, 7:30 p.m.

   FRIDAY: In the 1950 flick ``To Please a Lady,'' race car driver
Clark Gable meets columnist Barbara Stanwyck and they, you know,
put the pedal to the metal. It's not a remarkably memorable film _
Leonard Maltin gives it only 2{ stars. But 20 years later, we've
got Dr. J with Samantha Stevenson. Coincidence? ``To Please a
Lady,'' Turner Classic Movies, 1 p.m.

   SATURDAY: Stanford and Washington have together won eight of
nine Pacific-10 games this season. The other eight teams combined
are 12-19 against league foes. By process of elimination, either
the Cardinal or the Huskies can realistically talk Rose Bowl after
this one. NCAA football: Stanford at Washington, Channel 7, 12:30
p.m.

   SUNDAY: My kid wants to go trick-or-treating this year dressed
as NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt. Now !ital!that's pretty scary. My
costume will be that of CART driver Dario Frachitti, who'll be at
Fontana's California Speedway for this weekend's 500. The hope is
that while I'm in my helmet and jumpsuit, Frachitti's girlfriend,
Ashley Judd, won't know the difference. The 500 CART race, ESPN,
noon. (Also: ESPN has the truck series event, Saturday at 1 p.m.
and tape of the CART race pole qualifying, Saturday at 11:30 p.m.
ESPN's CART 2Day show goes live from the track Sunday at 8 a.m.).

`ALLY MCBEAL' FAILS THE TEST OF COMEDY: LAUGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   True confession, right up front: I'm one of those people who
doesn't really ``get'' ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand, I like the show fine. It has much to
recommend it. David E. Kelley's writing is almost always sharp (if
occasionally overly goofy), Calista Flockhart has a good comic
delivery, Greg Germann makes an enjoyable weasel of a boss (even if
he is channeling Michael McKean from the old HBO series ``Dream
On'').
</P>
<P>
   But some viewers love the show. (To their credit, if ratings
mean anything, they're avoiding the truncated ``Ally.'') To them,
it's more than a TV series _ it's a way of life, a sign that
someone understands the world of work and all its weirdness the way
they do.
</P>
<P>
   Those people doubtless cheered when, earlier this year, ``Ally
McBeal'' won the Emmy for best comedy. But that's the thing _ if
it's the best comedy on television, shouldn't it at least make me,
you know, laugh?
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the show provides plenty of humor. But not the kind
that makes you actually laugh out loud. Though vastly different in
theme and execution, ``Ally'' ``McBeal's'' humorous effect is more
along the lines of ``A Prairie Home Companion,'' Garrison Keillor's
radio show _ it's humor for people who don't like to actually laugh
but who like to nod and say, ``Mmm, that's funny,'' with a wry grin
on their face instead.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's ``Ally McBeal'' season premiere follows in that
tradition. Without giving too much away, just know that a quick
tryst for Ally and an anonymous partner leads to all sorts of
head-scratching high jinks, ha, ha.
</P>
<P>
   As for laughter, well, yes, it's humorous when John Cage says,
``Richard says communication is the death knell of any
relationship.'' Yes, it's funny when Fish says, ``You're a gender
bigot, Judge. I'd like you to walk a mile in her diaphragm.''
</P>
<P>
   But does it actually make you laugh? Is ``Ally McBeal'' in fact
the funniest show on television, a qualification that seems
reasonable enough when naming it best comedy?
</P>
<P>
   No. Not even close. In fact, there are few comedies left on
television that can be counted on to dependably cause a viewer to
close his eyes, open his mouth and let loose with a belly laugh.
Not coincidentally, wags are now pronouncing the death of the
sitcom. (Don't worry, it's a semiregular occurrence; when
``Seinfeld'' was hitting it big, the same geniuses pronounced the
death of the hourlong drama. Guess what's booming now?)
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, here's an unscientific look, not meant to be
comprehensive, at a few of the more notable network comedies and
how they rank on the laugh meter: &QL; 
GUFFAW:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Simpsons'' _ Funniest show on television, hands down.
You'd think that after a decade, a traditional family sitcom (even
if it is about a non-traditional, cartoon family) would start to
fade. No chance. As good, or better, than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' _ Every episode offers at least three laugh-out-loud
moments. Too bad no one watches it to enjoy them. &QL; 
HEARTY LAUGHTER:
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier'' _ It's slipped a bit, but so far, this season shows
signs of rebounding. Gotta love that Niles Crane. Unless you're
Daphne.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends'' _ Once it got popular, no one called it a
``Seinfeld'' rip-off anymore. Through-the-roof ratings will do that
for a show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' _ As comfortable as a chocolate
milkshake after school at the malt shop. And about as sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``King of the Hill'' _ When Fox sandwiched this between ``The
Simpsons'' and ``The'' ``X-Files,'' it had the best two-hour block
on television. The network broke it up, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Night'' _ OK, so it's not technically a comedy. And
``Ally McBeal'' is?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose Line Is It Anyway'' _ Ditto. &QL; 
CHUCKLE:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Drew Carey Show'' _ Formerly in the above category, it's
slipped noticeably.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal'' _ Enough said already.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just Shoot Me'' _ If David Spade and Wendie Malick got more
air time, this would move up a notch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcolm &AMP; Eddie'' _ A truly funny guy, Eddie Griffin can't
quite make the transition to sitcom hilarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Harvey'' _ Ditto. Maybe he and Griffin could team up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Futurama'' _ Proof that Matt Groening isn't infallible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spin City'' _ Well, sometimes, anyway. &QL; 
STONE-FACED STARE: Suddenly ``Susan'' _ I'll take Tuesday in the
next-show-canceled office pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Veronica's Closet'' _ Tempting to say it slipped, but it was
never funny to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stark Raving Mad'' _ Remember what happened to Aquaman when he
was out of the water too long? That's what'll happen to this if
(when) NBC moves it out from between ``Frasier'' and ``ER.'' Just
ask Veronica, above.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third Rock From the Sun'' _ How? Why? Its actors keep winning
Emmys. Don't the voters bother to even watch the show? &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ It was not yet 8:30 on a Saturday morning,
but as soon as Kara Beverly climbed aboard Amtrak train No. 84 in
Washington, she had Ralph Ellison's ``Invisible Man'' open on her
lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long is this train, eight hours?'' wondered Ms. Beverly, a
17-year-old senior at Elizabeth Seton High School in Prince Georges
County, Md. ``Great. I can finish this book and write my essay.''
Then she scanned the seats in the car reserved by Brown University
for this special recruitment trip to its campus here. ``Are there
any chemistry people here?'' she asked no one in particular.
</P>
<P>
   There were, indeed, plenty of thick chemistry textbooks tucked
inside the backpacks that crowded the overhead bins. Physics, too.
And calculus. It was a train full of students balancing Advanced
Placement courses with responsibilities for the National Honor
Society, teen-agers who had scored 1300 (out of a possible 1600) on
their SATs but were retaking them this fall in hopes of even higher
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   There was another thing that stood out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' marveled Joe Williams, as he boarded the train in New
Carrollton, Md. ``Everybody's black.''
</P>
<P>
   In the increasingly competitive environment of applying to elite
colleges, the still small number of high-achieving African-American
students are among the most coveted _ wooed with free trips to
campuses, personal attention from administrators and alumni, and a
bevy of scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   The battles over affirmative action that have led many
institutions to back away from giving preferences to minority
applicants have intensified these recruiting efforts as colleges
seek ways to eir campuses racially mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top minority students are recruited like rock stars,
they're really courted,'' said Esther Hugo, coordinator of
multicultural affairs for the National Association of College
Admissions Counselors. ``They are treated in a way they were never
treated before.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 100 students hopping aboard this train as it trudged up
the East Coast for a weekend of getting-to-know-you programs called
the Black Experience at Brown, the free ticket is flattering and
flirtatious, part of a courtship that began during junior year and
will stretch into spring.
</P>
<P>
   Some had already been eyeing the institution for its open
curriculum or eight-year medical program, while others had never
even considered it until the invitation arrived. Many aboard the
train will be the first in their families to attend a selective
college, and said that the chance to see what Ivy League life was
like, to camp in dormitories and tromp through late-night parties,
was an invaluable opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But as the foliage outside the windows grew more colorful, it
became clear that the trek north, in itself, was a key part of the
experience. A few students recognized one another _ from last
month's free plane trip to Washington University in St. Louis, or
last summer's minority student program at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology _ yet it was the camaraderie among total
strangers that was striking.
</P>
<P>
   They traded calculators and compact discs, mixing talk of
homework and hip-hop, exulting in the rare experience of being
together for who they are: smart, overachieving and black. Talk of
race was blatant and honest, as young people who had never met
before shared the same language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only black male in all of my classes,'' said Taylor
Keitt, 17, a football player at Central High School in Philadelphia
who was counting on scholarships for academics, not athletics.
``It's good to see so many of us trying to set ourselves high.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of qualified blacks out there,'' Taylor added
with a nod toward the affirmative-action debate. ``You don't have
to lower standards, just go and find them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like having to choose at all,'' Chantel Lee, 17, who
has one white parent and one black, said to another light-skinned
girl, Elizabeth Todd of Silver Spring, Md. ``I am what I am.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm not `other,''' added Elizabeth, referring to a racial
category on forms.
</P>
<P>
   The search for these youngsters begins with the first round of
standardized tests, when alongside the overall list of National
Merit Scholars come targeted lists of black and Hispanic students
with high scores. Those are the ones that Brown, and other schools
with similar programs, singles out for special perks like this
trip.
</P>
<P>
   The students hail from fancy private schools like Hotchkiss and
Spence and from magnet public schools, like Stuyvesant in New York
and Eleanor Roosevelt in suburban Washington. Few are from
low-performing inner-city public high schools where the vast
majority of black Americans attend school. Most are from working-
or middle-class families and are worried far more about financial
aid than about getting admitted.
</P>
<P>
   While Ivy League schools offer financial aid based only on need,
historically black colleges, state universities with honors
programs, and other select institutions also flood these students'
mailboxes with information about special scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Humphries, the president of Florida Agricultural and
Mechanical University, has personally flown to visit individual
applicants in his quest to lure more of these students than Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started her 10th-grade year,'' said Laura Nichols of
Manassas, Va., as she dropped her daughter, Tiffany, at Union
Station in Washington to catch the train. ``We get phone calls all
the time, maybe six or seven a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Admissions officers say students are much more likely to apply
to, and eventually attend, campuses they have visited. Ms. Hugo,
currently the outreach counselor at Santa Monica College, recalled
that when she worked at Westchester High School in Los Angeles, a
student who had already decided to go to a local women's college
nonetheless accepted free plane tickets to several campuses,
including Carleton College in Minnesota, which spends about $20,000
a year subsidizing visits by minority students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her why she took the trips,'' Ms. Hugo said. ``She
said, `Well, it's free travel, free food, so I thought I'd try it
out.''' The young woman ended up at Carleton (Ms. Hugo helped raise
money to buy her a winter wardrobe).
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose student body is about 7 percent black, started its
program nine years ago. Over the last five years, 75 percent of
those who attended the weekend and applied for admission were
accepted, compared with 32 percent of black applicants overall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On this year's train, there were students like Etsub Berhanu of
Silver Spring, Md., who is putting the finishing touches on her
application for early admission to Brown, due Nov. 1. ``I've
written it all, I just have to fit this in,'' Etsub explained,
referring to the present trip. ``I'm going to talk about how this
experience has helped me want to go to Brown. I hope it does.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Shaun Koiner, who attends a Roman Catholic
school in Washington and had already visited 22 campuses (after 15,
he said, they started to blur together); a certain campus in
Providence was not exactly prominent on his list.
</P>
<P>
   Two black Brown seniors trolled the train to answer questions.
Are there black engineering students? Do they have classes in
Capoeira, a Brazilian martial art? Is it colder than New York?
How's the food? (``Remember, it's known for its health,'' one
student said unconvincingly. ``There's salt and pepper on every
table,'' offered the other.) One girl wanted to meet the track
coach, another was interested in singing. Why did you decide to go
to Brown, they asked over and over.
</P>
<P>
   What they do not discuss is the persistent performance gap
between black and white students that spans the socioeconomic
spectrum. They barely hint at questions of black isolation in the
ivory tower, with oblique inquiries about Providence nightclubs,
and about whether tables in the dining halls tend to be segregated.
</P>
<P>
   They are used to being lonely, teased by friends from their
neighborhoods about ruining the curve on tests. One student says he
has already been in the local paper dozens of times for this
African-American honor or that, which makes him wonder whether he
is the only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of pressure,'' said Maya Martin, who lives in
Philadelphia, and spent the train ride being distracted from her
book, Aldous Huxley's ``Brave New World,'' by friendly boys.
``They're really depending on me to get a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Leah Tucker, Maya's seat mate, said she felt guilty because her
parents had already paid for her tuition at Philadelphia's
Germantown Friends School. ``If I get in everywhere that I apply,''
she asked rhetorically, ``do I have to go where I get a merit
scholarship?''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the weekend, the students were to be entertained by
various cultural groups on campus, invited to parties at a black
sorority and at Harambee House, a dorm where black students gather,
and to a discussion of the ``racial and sexual politics'' of ``He
Got Game,'' a Spike Lee movie. Brown's minority community was out
in force, putting on its best face, and the nervous high school
seniors were struggling to see where they would fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to visit Yale _ I was planning on applying early _ the
diversity just wasn't there,'' said Diana Bradshaw, who goes to New
Rochelle High School in New York state. ``If they have a minority
weekend, you know they care.''

BERKELEY STAYS THE COURSE FOR LOW-TECH CORE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By KATIE HAFNER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ In the midst of California's latest gold
rush, here's a city looking for lead.
</P>
<P>
   As high-tech companies sprout on all sides, this city of 107,000
people is making a concerted effort to preserve its low-tech core.
In the process, lost in a Zeitgeist all its own, Berkeley has
managed to deter the one industry that most cities are scrambling
to attract.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, executives at Ask Jeeves, an Internet
start-up that has expanded so rapidly it outgrew its offices here,
began looking for a new building. The company's preference was to
stay in Berkeley but, unable to find a suitable spot, Ask Jeeves
moved to Emeryville, a half mile south.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wondered if someone from the city would try to contact
us,'' said Curtis Vredenburg, a company executive who led the
search for a new site. ``But no one did.''
</P>
<P>
   Other local high-tech companies do not even bother with
Berkeley. When Pixar, the animation studio of ``Toy Story'' fame,
began looking for new space three years ago in anticipation of a
growth spurt, Berkeley did not make the short list, in part because
of the lengthy permit process. Pixar plans to move next year to
Emeryville from Point Richmond, just north of Berkeley,
leapfrogging Berkeley in the process.
</P>
<P>
   No one here is surprised. But even those who say that Berkeley
has recently grown less hostile to business are exasperated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're stuck in the '60s,'' said Mayor Shirley Dean, speaking
about those who stand firm on the city's manufacturing-friendly
policies.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, the mayor pointed to last year's Colgate
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if Hollywood were looking for a spot to film an urban
bomb scene, it would find a ready-made set in the abandoned
Colgate-Palmolive plant, whose 10 acres of buildings have steadily
deteriorated since the company left nearly 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a developer proposed an office complex for the site.
The complex would have drawn multiple software, multimedia and
biotech firms to the city. But when the city decided that 20
percent of the site had to be used for manufacturing, the proposal
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was breathtaking in its stupidity,'' said Patrick Kennedy,
a developer. ``Here's the whole Bay Area booming, and what we've
done is snub the whole world, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the policy say that unless the city preserves its
manufacturing base, social and economic diversity will suffer. They
argue, too, that the city simply does not have the space to serve
as much more than an incubator to high-tech start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Landau, a senior planner with the city, credits the
policy for a small increase in manufacturing companies over the
last decade. He said the issues surrounding manufacturing were
widely misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are parts of the economy that are often different from
the university-based economy that a lot of us in Berkeley are used
to, and I think it's not always necessarily visible,'' he said.
``But that doesn't mean it's not happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The part of the city most mired in dispute, known as West
Berkeley, is an eclectic assemblage of manufacturers, warehouses,
parking lots and residences, with a smattering of upscale
retailers, eateries and offices.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, when city planners and residents began working on what
came to be known as the West Berkeley Plan, which calls for a small
number of choice parcels to be set aside for manufacturing,
leftists and left-leaning moderates alike were in favor of it. When
the City Council approved the plan in 1993, people began to think
it might be flawed. Now those same people are sure of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Berkeley is being held hostage to the sentiment on the
part of some activists that the city has to return to the good old
days of lunch-pail jobs and blue-collar industry,'' said City
Council member Polly Armstrong. ``They're a group of people who
appear to be waiting for General Motors to come to Berkeley to
launch a new Saturn plant.''
</P>
<P>
   The stagnation stems from a classic case of Berkeley's most
earnest residents getting ``lost in their own Berkeleyness,'' as a
longtime Berkeley fixture named Wavy Gravy once described it when
running for City Council on a platform of lightening things up. (He
lost.)
</P>
<P>
   The feather in the city's hard hat is the biotechnology center
of the Bayer Corp.'s pharmaceutical division. Bayer, the city's
largest manufacturer, is now buying the Colgate site, partly to use
for parking.
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast, Emeryville, a swatch of a place, is the most
direct beneficiary of Berkeley's restrictive policies. Thanks to
its lenient zoning and speedy permit process, Emeryville has an
impressive roster of computer and biotech firms. The 300 or so
employees at Ask Jeeves, up from 50 a year ago, occupy 50,000
square feet in a building on the site of a defunct Westinghouse
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Alameda, another relatively obscure city south of Berkeley, is
nurturing a high-tech boomlet of its own. And Mayor Jerry Brown of
Oakland, hardly a capitalist tool, is promoting his city as this
side of the bay's newest ``high-tech settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   And so high-flying Internet companies continue to leave Berkeley
when they grow beyond a certain size.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Cybergold, another high-tech company, moved from
downtown Berkeley to Oakland in July, the chief executive, Nat
Goldhaber, got a call from an official in Berkeley's economic
development office asking why the company was leaving. Goldhaber
said he needed a building big enough to accommodate substantial
growth and wired for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person from the city said: `Oh. Have a nice time in
Oakland,''' Goldhaber said.

SANDERS HEARS THE TALK, THEN WALKS THE WALK 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Talk may be cheap, but for the Dallas Cowboys,
for Deion Sanders, it was like a bur in the saddle, a bee sting, a
lightning bolt.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys did not like what they heard from the Redskins
before Sunday's game here at Texas Stadium, that Washington was
really the better team even though Dallas had already won the first
match in overtime in Washington. The idea from Redskins receivers
that Sanders could be attacked and beaten from the onset.
</P>
<P>
   That last thought came personally from Washington's Albert
Connell. He said Sanders could not cover him one on one. Connell
said that his team would throw at Sanders all day long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Connell he played a good game,'' Sanders said after
Dallas spanked Washington, 38-20, claiming a first-place tie with
the Redskins in the National Conference East division. ``But I also
let him know that if he is going to hunt rabbits, sometimes it
ain't no fun if the rabbit has a gun, too. If you're going to talk
the talk, you had better be able to walk the walk. Their receivers
are young, and they have a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Defiant Deion. Delicious Deion.
</P>
<P>
   He took the challenge and turned it into a spectacle before
64,377 spirited fans in a manner that only he can. He made the
game's first tackle (Deion, tackle?), a jarring blow by the
198-pound cornerback on the 234-pound running back Stephen Davis
that threw Davis for a 4-yard loss. Sanders helped the Dallas
defense limit Washington to six plays on its first two drives while
Dallas, on its first two, built a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   He gathered a punt in the first quarter and suffered a
concussion on a piercing blow, a punishing head-to-head collision
with Redskins center Dan Turk. He left for the locker room. He
returned with 11 minutes 49 seconds left in the third quarter and
simply ran on the field, assumed his position. And then _ would it
be dazzling Deion if there was not a finale? _ he ended the game's
scoring with 9:03 remaining on a 70-yard punt return and spurt for
a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Dominating Deion.
</P>
<P>
   It was his league-record 18th touchdown off returns (eight on
interceptions, one on a fumble, three on kickoffs and six on
punts).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember half the game,'' Sanders said. ``I did just
run back on the field. I knew the doctors wouldn't clear me, but it
was important to get back on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the kind of intensity Dallas showed all day as it
matched Washington's 4-2 record, won its fifth straight in this
series and snapped a two-game losing streak against divisional
opponents where both losses (to Philadelphia and the Giants) were
by 13-10 scores. The Cowboys held Connell to two catches for 52
yards and a 44-yard score when Sanders was not in coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to go out and show something, and they thought
about it all week,'' Dallas Coach Chan Gailey said of his team. ``I
thought we'd get after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas scored the game's first 17 points. Ahead by 17-13 early
in the third quarter, Dallas snatched the game with Troy Aikman's
passing, with its defense forcing Washington punts and with Sanders
igniting his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman threw amazing passes _ long, short, medium-range, to his
right, to his left _ and kept making big plays en route to a
244-yard, two-touchdown passing day. He passed for 11 first downs.
Rocket Ismail caught six balls for 76 yards including the game's
first score, a 13-yard touchdown pass eight minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Washington converted on only four of 12 third downs (33 percent)
and rushed for only 61 yards. Dallas safety Darren Woodson led his
team in tackles with six.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not match their intensity,'' Washington Coach Norv
Turner said. ``We had a chance to take the lead in the East and we
didn't, and that's extremely disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington could not live up to its talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have other chances,'' Connell said. ``They won this
round.''
</P>
<P>
   He also hinted that Sanders plays a dirty brand of football.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he loves me,'' Connell said of Sanders. ``Ain't no
love here. When you take cheap shots and claim you're a man of God
... God don't like ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brian Mitchell, the Redskins' veteran special teams ace,
warned: ``You're not going to get trash talking out of the game.
When you do it and succeed, you're great. But if you talk and lose,
you shouldn't have said anything. If you're going to do it, you've
got to keep your focus and do your job. If you can't do that, maybe
you shouldn't say anything at all.''

COMMENTARY: BAGELS VS. DOUGHNUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Words in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARPER'S FERRY, W.Va. _ A sea change in American taste took
place at the beginning of this decade: The bagel overtook the
doughnut in popularity. Today we spend three-quarters of a billion
dollars a year on bagels, only a half-billion on doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Although these baked goods are similar in shape, they are wholly
different in character. Doughnuts are sweet and crumbly, with over
10 grams of fat; bagels are chewy and low in fat. Doughnuts are
fun, with sugary smiles, sales peaking at Halloween; bagels are
serious, ethnic and harder to digest.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in taste reflect shifts in other opinion. The triumph of
bagelism in the '80s and early '90s meant that tough munching was
ascendant; the decline of doughnuttiness meant that soft sweetness
was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That's changing now. The bagel explosion at the bakery level has
begun to level off; A.C. Nielsen reports only a 2 percent increase
over last year (frozen bagels are in actual decline), while
doughnuts have been rising at a 3.2 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Isn't Dunkin Donuts now selling bagels in its 2,100 stores
to compete with McDonald's penetration of the world McBagel market?
Hasn't the bagel (rooted in the Indo-European  &UR; bheugh &LR; , ``bend'')
become even more American than apple pie?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but. In the bagel's adaptive triumph lies the poppyseed of
its self-destruction. For the bagel has moved toward the center,
and that center has no distinctive hole; its crust has lost its
hard-boiled nature.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching for an ever-wider audience, the bagel has gone soft and
spongy. Although sourdough and caraway and sesame seed were
permissible variations, the lust for new markets has turned the
flavoring frenetic. The low point was reached with the introduction
of the  &UR; blueberry &LR;  bagel _ sweet, soft, inky-colored and hard to
tell from a stale doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, its open-faced purpose is being corrupted. The bagel was
never meant to be used in a sandwich; the towering production is
too wide for the human mouth. It is arrogant and wrongheaded for a
thick half-bagel to masquerade as a thin slice of bread.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the guiltily gulped doughnut has held fast to its
liberal essence. Despised by dieters, it remains deliciously
feminine, sinfully sweet and outrageously hedonistic.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the doughnut _ like excess in art and hypersensitivity
in sexual relations _ is staging a comeback. Its most
mouth-watering variation, frosted chocolate, is leading the way.
(Krispy Kreme, now going public, loftily calls its crumbly
concoction ``chocolate-enrobed.'')
</P>
<P>
   Today's doughnut knows what it is and defiantly asserts its
fattening identity. But today's phony bagel vacillates between a
confection and a tunafish-salad holder. Call it a ``doughgel'' or a
``banut'' _ this middling moderate, this triangulated toroidal,
this product of a foggy focus group is neither here nor there.
</P>
<P>
   The formerly chewy morsel that once had to be separated from the
rest of its ring by a sharp jerk of the eater's head is now devoid
of character _ half-baked, seeking to be all pastry to all men.
</P>
<P>
   What lessons does the coming end of the bagel boom teach us
about America at the  &UR; fin de millenaire &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   1. When you score a breakthrough and surge far ahead, never
forget the reason for your success. In the bagel's case, that
reason was a certain quality of tasty toughness against a crumbling
opposition of sustained sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   2. When you open up a long lead against the competition, never
let up and freeze the cake, lest hungry runners-up eat your lunch.
</P>
<P>
   3. When greed for an ever-growing market share causes you to
sacrifice your authenticity and compromise core principles, repent
and take a stand _ or your flavor will disappear into the mealy maw
of moderation.
</P>
<P>
   Americans profited from a clear choice when our breakfast rested
securely on a two-pastry system. But now the two poll-driven
pastries have become indistinguishable. That's why alien third
pastries _ from flaky croissants to nutty bran muffins _ vie to
attract voter-buyers who are bored with the bland, and who hunger
for leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, in the teeth of the doughnut resurgence, let bagels
be bagels. Character counts. Authenticity attracts. Unless the
overconfident bagel learns this quickly, it will be toast.

FLEEING THE TALIBAN
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By BOB HERBERT  
   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I asked the young woman who was sitting in my office if she had
ever seen her husband before the marriage ceremony. She said she
hadn't even seen him at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   She was married last year by proxy. Her mother, who was dying,
was desperate to find a way to get her daughter out of Afghanistan
and thus away from the sadistic clutches of the Taliban. If the
only available option was marriage to a complete stranger from a
foreign country _ in this case, Germany _ then so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Maryam Shams is 21 years old. Her nickname is Giti. In her black
jeans, white top and multitoned Nike sneakers she looks like a
college kid, not an escapee from a country in which the status of
women is so low and their treatment so fiendishly cruel that Meryl
Streep was moved recently to say that the women of Afghanistan were
being ``entombed alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions in Afghanistan are straight out of a medieval
nightmare, horrifying for men, women and children alike. The Times'
Barry Bearak wrote last week:
</P>
<P>
   ``Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia, along with thousands of
Pakistanis lit with the fervor of jihad, went on a destructive
spree this summer, killing wantonly, emptying entire towns,
machine-gunning livestock, sawing down fruit trees, blasting apart
irrigation canals.''
</P>
<P>
   A level of terror unimaginable to most Americans has been the
rule in most of Afghanistan since the Taliban took power a few
years ago. But the most consistently soul-crushing cruelties have
been reserved for women and girls. The Feminist Majority
Foundation, which has been trying to bring this aspect of the
tragedy to greater public awareness, calls it ``gender apartheid.''
</P>
<P>
   Women and girls in areas controlled by the Taliban are not
permitted to go to school or to work. The windows of their homes
must be covered or painted black. They can leave their homes only
in the company of a close male relative, and only if they are
completely covered by a burqa, an all-encompassing garment with a
small mesh opening through which the wearer can see and breathe.
Women violating any of the rules can be beaten on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Medical care for women is largely a thing of the past. Male
doctors are not allowed to examine the female body. Women and girls
are dying in droves from untreated diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Widows especially lead gruesome existences. Unable to work, many
have been reduced to begging for food. Prostitution is reported to
be increasing. And rape, forced marriages, forced prostitution and
other forms of abuse have become commonplace. Resistance has been
met with savage beatings, mutilations, abductions and murder.
</P>
<P>
   Giti Shams came to my office with her aunt, Zieba
Shorish-Shamley, who lives in Washington, where she runs the
Women's Alliance for Peace and Human rights in Afghanistan. With
her aunt interpreting, Ms. Shams said she was in the 10th-grade
when the Taliban brought an end to the education of girls. ``My
mother was worried constantly about me and my future,'' she said.
``And she was very, very worried that the Taliban, which very often
attacks at night, would attack us and rape or abduct me.''
</P>
<P>
   When her mother learned last year that she was dying of
pancreatic cancer, she sought desperately for a way to salvage a
future for her daughter. She managed to arrange a marriage between
Giti and a wealthy middle-aged Afghan man living in Germany. The
proxy ceremony was held months before the couple met last January.
Giti was allowed to go to Germany to live with her ``husband.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out, according to Giti and her aunt, that the new
husband was a twisted individual who abused, virtually imprisoned
and practically starved Ms. Shams. The arranged marriage was part
of a pattern of trafficking in increasingly desperate Afghan women,
said Ms. Shorish-Shamley.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shorish-Shamley learned what was happening to her niece in
May. Giti's mother had died and Ms. Shorish-Shamley, during a visit
to Germany, was attempting to relay the sad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found my niece malnourished and in the worst shape you can
think of,'' she said. ``She was very thin, very sad. Eventually she
broke down and told me all the things that were happening to her.''
</P>
<P>
   The aunt and the niece fled. Ms. Shams is now in the United
States as a refugee, telling her story wherever she can, hoping to
raise the level of concern for a situation that for so many is
beyond imagining.

FORBES SPENDS TIME AND LOTS OF MONEY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire publisher who
is again running for president, brought his anti-tax crusade here
this past weekend, spending his own money lavishly in order to
promote his view that the government should have less and spend
less.
</P>
<P>
   On a weekend that displayed the scenic autumn beauty of this
state and before crowds that shared his fiscally conservative
views, Forbes, who is running for the Republican presidential
nomination, came to unveil what he _ and his staff _ had promoted
as the ``Forbes New Economy Plan.'' But the plan was largely based
on the same views that he has long advocated: shrinking government,
shrinking taxes, shrinking the federal deficit and increasing
individual wealth.
</P>
<P>
   He promised that if his conservative economic plan were enacted,
the decade ahead would be ``dazzling'' _ workers would see their
wages increase by 62 percent, 24.5 million new jobs would be
created and the U.S. economy would double its current growth rate
and expand by 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to cut taxes and return the money to the people who
earned it,'' said Forbes in his stump campaign speech, and wherever
he said it, that line drew large applause. At a campaign stop at
the Oakledge Country Club in Sunapee, N.H., a listener named Steve
White agreed: ``We're overtaxed. We're unfairly taxed. Taxes are
confiscatory. In New Hampshire, we are very fiscally conservative,
and we don't like our money to go to the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' plan, amplified with some additional economic
statistics, consists of his basic message, which is that enacting a
17.3 percent flat federal income tax, replacing Social Security
with individual retirement accounts for younger workers and making
the government smaller will bring about a supply-side economic
boom.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to get his anti-tax message out, Forbes is spending heavily
here. Forbes television commercials flood the airwaves, direct mail
brochures blanket doorsteps and phone banks work constantly. And
Forbes is crisscrossing the state in a two-bus caravan filled with
sophisticated electronic equipment that enables him to
instantaneously broadcast campaign events to his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign pays such close attention to detail that even the
pumpkins at his Manchester campaign headquarters were carved with
Forbes 2000 logos. Altogether he is spending money at the rate of
$3 million a month, according to his campaign manager, William Dal
Col.
</P>
<P>
   In spending, Forbes is running almost neck-and-neck with
Republican front-runner George W. Bush _ Bush has spent $20 million
since January, compared to $19 million by Forbes, who has a net
worth of over $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   The big difference, however, is that while Bush's campaign cash
comes from donations, the bulk of Forbes' spending is from his own
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Dal Col, the campaign manager, said that the Forbes
campaign anticipates big spending ahead. With 113 people on the
Forbes payroll and campaign offices in states as far-flung as
Alaska, Louisiana, Arizona, Iowa and Delaware, among others, Dal
Col said the campaign has sufficient resources to ``engage'' Bush
both on the ground with grass-roots organizations and in the air
with television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col said the Forbes campaign will not hesitate to use the
same kind of hard-hitting television ads against Bush that Forbes
used against Republican front-runner Bob Dole in the 1996 primaries
_ ads that many Republicans criticized for being overly harsh on
Dole and for causing his support to drop in key electoral states.
</P>
<P>
   But Dal Col maintains that spirited attacks are what campaigns
are all about. When asked about the negative reaction to Forbes'
ads, Dal Col responded: ``It doesn't matter. You have to remember
this is an election. To be bold and spirited in the primaries is
what it's all about. I'm sure that when they see our ads that some
in the party will like them and others will get upset.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign is currently airing ads in New Hampshire,
and just finished airing ones in Iowa. These ads promoted Forbes'
views on taxes and Social Security, and were biographical.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the money Forbes is spending, he also engaged in
traditional meet-and greet sessions, often laced with humor.
</P>
<P>
   At the Belmont Restaurant in Manchester, Forbes turned to a
table of four men and, on a rainy morning, promised: ``If I'm
elected, I'll do something about this weather.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as 7-year old Maxwell Lawrence of Manchester listened,
Forbes added: ``And if I'm elected, you won't have homework.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: U.S. AND AFRICA _ UNFULFILLED PROMISES AND
SKEPTICISM
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
visited six African nations last week, her twin goals seemed to be
to reassure Africans that the United States was still interested in
the continent's affairs and to convince Congress that Africa
mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Using the backdrops of Sierra Leone, where a peace agreement
just halted a brutal eight-year civil war, and of Nigeria, which
recently emerged from nearly 16 years of military rule, Albright
pledged to assist them with significant increases in aid. Inserting
the two West African countries into the ongoing budget fight in
Washington, she castigated Congress for wanting to cut President
Clinton's foreign aid budget by more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   After a trip to Kano in northern Nigeria _ where city officials
closed off streets for her visit but were unable to clear the sides
of the usual mounds of garbage and refuse-chomping goats _ Albright
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``They find it pretty hard to understand that we're going around
saying we have the world's greatest economy, and that we have a
huge budget surplus, and they are there digging themselves out of
garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   The message conveyed by Albright, who returned to Washington on
Sunday, underscored the unfulfilled promises of Clinton's historic
visit to Africa in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   During that trip, the longest ever to Africa by an American
president and the first in two decades, Clinton talked of a ``new
African renaissance'' and a relationship rooted in partnership, not
Cold War paternalism. ``The United States is ready to help you,''
he said at the time, promising a new approach to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the president's emphasis on trade, Congress has yet
to pass the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, which would grant
certain African governments greater access to the American market.
Although Clinton called for direct aid to Africa to reach the highs
of the Cold War, development assistance has continued to decline,
to the current level of about $700 million, down from about $870
million seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although he spoke of democracy, critics of Washington's Africa
policy say the United States has not done enough to help resolve
the many conflicts that have erupted or expanded in Africa since
the president's visit _ at the same time that Washington and the
West quickly poured billions into Kosovo and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   And so during Albright's first visit to Africa since the
president's trip, there was skepticism among many ordinary
Africans, in sharp contrast with the exuberance heard during
Clinton's tour.
</P>
<P>
   At an AIDS awareness event attended by Albright here, a
participant, Stephen Otiemo, 29, said he had followed Clinton's
12-day tour very closely on the radio. ``We heard him make many
promises,'' Otiemo said, ``but we have not seen much so far. But
perhaps we had been hoping for too much. We cannot be angry because
we cannot force somebody to do what he does not want to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But somehow we are also angry because we have suffered for the
United States,'' he said, mentioning the August 1998 bombing of the
American Embassy here, in which more than 200 Kenyans were killed
along with 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Another spectator, Peter Lasu Ladu, 32, a Christian refugee from
southern Sudan, asked why Washington was willing to intervene so
decisively in Kosovo, but not in his native country's civil war,
where almost 2 million people are believed to have been killed in
the last 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a lot of promises,'' Ladu said. ``But to talk of
something and to implement something is different.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Albright promised $55 million to Sierra Leone and a
threefold to fourfold rise in Nigeria's current $27 million aid _
both will require congressional approval _ she argued that the
fulfillment of Clinton's promises, had been blocked by a
Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In line with other senior administration officials, she blamed
isolationism for their resistance. Republicans counter that they
are not isolationist, but out to protect America's best interests.
They and other critics also say the Clinton White House has failed
to bargain with Congress to secure foreign policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Washington's policy toward Africa say the
administration shares the blame for what they describe as
inattention toward the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration hasn't made a particularly aggressive case
on Africa specifically,'' said Salih Booker, a senior fellow at the
Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has raised Africa's profile and followed
through on some issues, including increased training for African
peacekeeping forces and pushing for debt relief, Booker said. But
he added: ``The real problem is that without a serious commitment
of resources, the American government can only talk. Talking is
important, but U.S. credibility in Africa will be eroded if the
administration can't put money and human resources, too, where its
mouth is.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright's tour _ which included Guinea, Sierra Leone, Mali,
Nigeria, Tanzania and Kenya _ was clearly intended to regain the
momentum on Africa. Asked to assess American relations with Africa
since the president's trip, Albright said: ``I believe that our
administration has spent more time, attention and money on Africa
than any previous administration. The fact that we haven't
accomplished everything we want is unfortunate, but it isn't
over.''
</P>
<P>
   The sober words were a long way from what Clinton told half a
million ebullient Ghanaians only 19 months ago: ``My dream for this
trip is that together we might do the things so that 100 years from
now, your grandchildren and mine will look back and say this was
the beginning of a new African renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   The change in tone reflects how much Africa, and Washington's
view of it, have changed in those 19 months. During Clinton's
visit, the administration's darlings were a so-called new
generation of leaders, pragmatic and competent men who would lead
Africa to its renaissance. But the four men most often regarded as
this generation's standard-bearers have all become embroiled in war
since the presidential visit.
</P>
<P>
   Yoweri Museveni, the president of Uganda, and Paul Kagame, the
leader of Rwanda, backed a rebellion against the government of
Congo and President Laurent Kabila, their former protege. Ugandan
and Rwanda troops even clashed briefly in the Congolese city of
Kisangani recently. Also, Meles Zenawi, the prime minister of
Ethiopia, and Issaias Afwerki, the Eritrean leader, started a
border war that has claimed tens of thousands of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Clinton's plane pointedly flew over Nigeria, the
African giant and its most populous nation, to protest the
repressive government of Gen. Sani Abacha. Since then, however,
Abacha's unexpected death unleashed a sweeping political
transformation that resulted in the inauguration of the first
civilian government in Nigeria in nearly 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   During Albright's stop last week in Nigeria, she heaped praise
on President Olusegun Obasanjo, who is due to visit Washington this
week. There was no talk of a new generation of leaders; Obasanjo,
after all, was Nigeria's military ruler in the late 1970s. But
Albright described Nigeria as a potential ``regional partner'' for
the United States in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nigeria's success in meeting the challenges of democracy will
be a welcome inspiration across Africa,'' she said in her keynote
speech of the trip and one of her most upbeat comments. ``For our
part, the United States will continue to be a strong supporter of
democratic forces across the continent.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE ALL-CENTURY PLAYER WHO HAUNTS BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the lovely things to look forward to next New
Year's Day _ when the world does not, after all, come crashing down
on our heads _ is an end to the plague of lists.
</P>
<P>
   You can be absolutely sure that 10 years from now, when Sammy
Sosa's Chicago Cubs play Hideo Nomo's Yomiuri Giants in a real
World Series, nobody is going to be blathering about the team of
the decade. Just play ball.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these millennium and century and decade lists are
arbitrary and sometimes cruelly exclusive, creating their own
mischief. The latest list is baseball's all-century team, announced
Saturday, 30 undeniably great players, including Pete Rose,
currently suspended from the business he says he loves.
</P>
<P>
   Rose showed up for the introduction of the all-century team on
worldwide television Sunday night, receiving a more raucous welcome
than the loud cheers for Henry Aaron, Ted Williams and the rest. He
came straight from the diamonds (and hearts and clubs and spades)
of Atlantic City. To baseball officials, he was as welcome as
garlic breath in the subway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a baseball person, I'm a teacher, I love the game,'' Rose
said, showing his old self-involved charm in a news conference more
crowded than anything the players would see after the second World
Series game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Manson can get a hearing,'' Rose noted, adding, ``I
hope they don't wait till 2060 to review my case.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has been hoping Rose would go away ever since he was
banished for gambling on sports, including, apparently, his own
sport. He makes it hard on baseball by remaining in serious denial,
and is ineligible for the Hall of Fame, although he has the highest
total of hits in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked pitching against him because he didn't hit home
runs,'' said Bob Gibson, one of the 30. ``But he was a great
ballplayer. When you get to the World Series the way he did, you
can say you are a winning ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   When the promoters of this all-century team started handing out
computer ballots to fans this past summer, nobody could figure out
a way to ban Rose from the poll. Wouldn't you know it? Charlie
Hustle finished ninth among outfielders, just inside the cutoff.
Right behind Rose (629,742 votes) were Roberto Clemente (582,937)
and Stan Musial (571,279).
</P>
<P>
   This was such an embarrassment that the officials created a
panel of ``experts'' to add five players to the squad. This is
where it gets sticky.
</P>
<P>
   Clemente was one of the great right fielders, plus a proud and
vocal early representative of Latino ballplayers, plus a hero for
the way he died in a plane crash while ferrying goods from Puerto
Rico to Nicaragua following an earthquake. Clemente also suffers
somewhat from the unfortunate fact of remaining dead. If his
burning, handsome presence were still among us, Roberto Clemente
would be in the top 25.
</P>
<P>
   Musial, who has been unfortunately eclipsed by the reasonable
veneration of the dynamic Ted Williams in recent years, is still
among us, and thank goodness for that. Stan the Man was the
laughing cavalier, Wayne Gretzky in floppy flannels. Even the
dems-and-doses denizens of Ebbets Field loved the guy. The experts
put him on the all-century team.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Stan Musial belonged on that team because of what he
has accomplished in his life, and just player-wise, the ability to
do a lot of things,'' said Joe Torre, a lodge member and hardly a
spreader of controversy. ``I didn't think it was fair to put Pete
in that category.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose arrived Sunday afternoon straight from one of those
ubiquitous card and autograph shows, for big bucks, at a certain
gambling den in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a show of 3,000-hit players,'' he explained. ``You can't
have one without me.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the selection of Atlantic City was a coincidence _
``It could have been Detroit'' _ and besides, he said, he doesn't
even like casinos because he prefers gambling on the horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slot machines are for 70-year-olds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rose did thank Commissioner Bud Selig for ruling that he could
appear on the ballot. Selig is locked into intransigence toward
Rose because of the untimely death of Commissioner Bart Giamatti in
1989, days after banishing Rose, who said he thought he had merely
been suspended indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   There is the sentimental notion that all Rose must do is
apologize for whatever it is that he did and he will be welcomed
back into the business. Rose raised the tantalizing suggestion
Sunday night that if Giamatti were still alive, he would have
reinstated Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I'm sorry,'' Rose told reporters, asking Selig to
``give me a second chance. I won't need a third.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose took advantage of his first official appearance at a
baseball function in 10 years. If we take this list seriously for a
nanosecond, it might have been better to arbitrarily ban active
players, giving us more time to judge them. With all due respect,
my guess is that Cal Ripken Jr. and Roger Clemens would not make
such a list 10 years from now, but that Mark McGwire and Ken
Griffey Jr. probably would. And while Nolan Ryan is a totally
admirable Hall of Famer, his selection as the century's top pitcher
is _ how else can one say this? _ ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably 50 to 60 guys who could be, should be, on
this team,'' Gibson said. ``All I know is that I'm on it, and thank
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said his St. Louis Cardinals of the late 60s could beat
the top 30. I like his style. Personally, if I could borrow Jackie
Robinson from the top 30, I would take my chances with the Brooklyn
Dodgers, circa 1946-1957.
</P>
<P>
   But enough of memories of other ages. The Yanks are playing the
Braves in real time. The clock is ticking on this century, and Pete
Rose is now on two opposite lists _ the all-century list, and the
suspended list. &QL;

MRS. CLINTON AGAIN BACKS HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With two economists and the head of New York's
largest coalition of labor unions by her side, Hillary Rodham
Clinton implicitly attacked Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Sunday for
not supporting an increase in the federal minimum wage and
suggested that he had not done enough to help the poor in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the wonderful news about the national economy in
general, poverty has gone up here in New York City,'' she said, in
a visit Sunday afternoon to the headquarters of Local 3 of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Queens. ``Now
there are those who have opposed an increase in the minimum wage,
arguing that it will cost jobs, and there are some people who say
that we need still more studies. Well, they are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In what has become a customary tactic in her exploratory
campaign for a U.S. Senate seat, the first lady did not mention the
mayor, her likely Republican opponent next year, by name. Instead,
she left the direct attack on Giuliani to Brian McLaughlin, a state
assemblyman from Queens who is also president of the New York City
Central Labor Council.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton listened attentively as two economists for the
Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit group in Albany supported in
part by unions, challenged Giuliani's assertions that raising the
base wage could result in jobs being lost and could hinder
welfare-to-work policies. Then she quickly launched into her own
veiled attack.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has repeatedly said he would like to see more
studies on the effect of raising the minimum wage, did so again on
Sunday when asked about Mrs. Clinton's comments. He also repeated
his statement that he expects to support the wage increase
eventually. ``My stand on the minimum wage is that I have asked a
study to be conducted to determine the impact it would have on poor
people getting jobs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the impact is minimal,'' the mayor said, ``I'll support it.
If the impact is substantial, then I'll try to find ways to
ameliorate that, which is what I have done in the past. So I think
what I am doing is actually much more caring and much more
compassionate.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he had asked the city's Human Resources
Administration to study the proposed increase in the minimum wage
now being considered in Congress, to $6.15 from $5.15, over two
years. ``I anticipate that I'll eventually support it, but first I
have to see what their study shows,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the union headquarters in Queens, Mrs. Clinton stood by
McLaughlin, a Democrat, as he criticized the mayor by name, just as
she has stood by on other recent occasions as Rep. Charles Rangel
of Harlem, Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx and other
Democratic elected officials rebuked Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have often heard that we live in the greatest city on
earth,'' McLaughlin said, an apparent reference to Giuliani's habit
of calling New York the capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greatness is measured in how well we treat the less fortunate
among us,'' he said. ``And with 25 percent of this city living in
poverty, we must strive and can do better.''

SPORTS COLUMN: GIANTS MAKE A STAND, RELATIVELY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Don't take the Giants' 31-3
excommunication of the Saints too seriously. Don't assume that the
Giants suddenly are off and running and passing toward Super Bowl
XXXIV, or even the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that the National Football League, as if it had studied
under Albert Einstein, operates on a theory of relativity. Each
week the ability of every winning team is relative to the ability
of the losing team it opposed. And the Saints, now desperate and
disorganized at 1-5, just might be pro football's worst team this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Giants, who edged the Dallas Cowboys, 13-10, last
Monday night, have won two in a row for a 4-3 record, but they
haven't really proved their worth as a playoff contender. So don't
make any airline and hotel reservations for Super Bowl XXXIV in
Atlanta, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   For now, just enjoy the fun of Sunday's virtually unopposed
rout, as all those Giants loyalists did. Especially in cheering the
two ``dee-fense, dee-fense'' goal-line stands late in the fourth
quarter, which prevented the Saints from the consolation of scoring
a touchdown or two long after the outcome had been decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just fought for them,'' Jessie Armstead was saying now,
referring to the fans shouting from the stands behind the west end
zone. ``We didn't want to let 'em score.''
</P>
<P>
   From the decibels of the ``dee-fense, dee-fense'' chant, you
would have thought that the playoffs were at stake, that a Saints
touchdown would have ruined the Giants' season. But an opportunity
to roar ``dee-fense, dee-fense,'' which originated with the staunch
Giants' defenses of the early 60's in Yankee Stadium, is all that
Giants fans ever ask.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, all those Giants loyalists appreciated the offense's
finally waking up, notably Kent Graham's 53-yard pass that Joe
Jurevicius caught in the back of the end zone on the last play of
the first half for a 24-3 lead. But in Giants Stadium there is no
chant or cheer with the ancestral spirituality of ``dee-fense,
dee-fense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a kick out of the goal-line stands,'' defensive end
Michael Strahan said. ``It gave the fans something to stay for.''
</P>
<P>
   With about four minutes remaining, the Saints had a third-and-1
at the Giants' 3-yard line, but Sam Garnes and Corey Widmer stuffed
Ricky Williams for no gain. On fourth down, Billy Joe Tolliver
misfired on a pass to Andre Hastings, who was covered by Jason
Sehorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some guys nicked up,'' Strahan said, ``but those were
the guys, like Jessie Armstead, that made the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan was talking about the second goal-line stand. Armstead
had sustained bruised ribs earlier, but defensive tackle Robert
Harris and safeties Percy Ellsworth and Shaun Williams were on the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Peter had replaced Harris and Jeremy Lincoln, a
cornerback throughout his eight years in the NFL, was playing
safety for the first time since 1986 when he was in a Toledo, Ohio,
high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not want to let 'em in the end zone,'' Lincoln said.
</P>
<P>
   With about two minutes remaining, Saints cornerback Fred Weary
recovered the rookie running back Joe Montgomery's fumble at the
Giants' 3-yard line. Ricky Williams gained 1 yard, then was stopped
for no gain. On third down, quarterback Danny Wuerffel rolled out
for no gain. On fourth down, Wuerffel's pass to Lawrence Dawsey was
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go out on the field and play that way,'' Coach Jim Fassel
said of the two goal-line stands, ``that had pride written all over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But stuffing the Saints in two goal-line stands isn't the same
as stuffing some of the NFL's better offenses.
</P>
<P>
   With their victory, the Giants moved within one-half game of
both the Cowboys and the Washington Redskins, whose 4-2 records
share the National Football Conference East lead. Now the Giants go
to Philadelphia next Sunday for what could be a 5-3 record. After a
bye week, they play the Indianapolis Colts here, then go to
Washington before returning against Arizona and the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a winning record,'' Armstead said, ``but we're not
going to pat ourselves on the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Not after drubbing the Saints, perhaps the NFL's most drubbable
team. And not if they also drub the Eagles, another drubbable team.
The Giants don't deserve to be taken seriously as a playoff
contender unless they go to Washington and reverse their
embarrassing 50-21 loss to the Redskins this season.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Giants' defense will be tested much more than it
was in those two goal-line stands against the Saints.

 &HT;    Family feud: Jeff Burton tops brother
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKINGHAM, N.C. _ For the third time this season, Jeff and Ward
Burton battled it out to the end at a Winston Cup race on Sunday.
For the third time, Jeff got the best of the brotherly rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton maintained his dominance over his older brother to
win the Pop Secret 400 at North Carolina Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say that I feel really bad that Ward didn't win the
race,'' said Jeff, 32. ``I know nobody believes that, but it's hard
to go out there and one of your goals has to be to beat your
brother. That's the hardest thing in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward Burton, whose lone career victory was at Rockingham in
1995, was in control of the race until a caution flag was raised
after Dale Earnhardt and Wally Dallenbach wrecked on lap 322.
</P>
<P>
   When Ward entered the pits three laps later, he had been in
front for the previous 23 laps. But the advantage was lost after
Jeff narrowly beat his brother back out to the track, and the
younger brother kept the upper hand over the final 68 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basically mad as hell, really,'' said Ward, 37. ``I don't
know where that anger is directed at, it's just circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Both brothers were slowed late in the event by Jeff Gordon, who
made a futile attempt to avoid being lapped. Ward appeared to be
more affected by Gordon's aggressive driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we would have got Jeff (Burton) if we had more time,''
Ward said. ``I'm not going to say names, but we had a lapped car
race us really hard. Jeff (Burton) got about 200 yards in front of
me and from there I was playing catch-up. I ran it with all I
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward eventually caught up with the rear of his brother's car on
the final lap and gambled with an inside pass on the third turn.
Jeff held off the challenge to post his sixth victory of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the only chance I had,'' Ward said. ``I couldn't go
high because of lapped traffic. I just drove it in there and, of
course, it didn't work. But if I had drove it in there easy it
wouldn't have worked either. I was just trying with everything I
had to win this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burton brothers also finished 1-2 at Las Vegas and
Darlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like having to beat Ward,'' Jeff said. ``It's a
difficult situation to be in. Any time you are in a business
situation with a family (it's) always pressing. And then when
you're in a business that competes with a family member, that's
even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, that's what I do. I mean, my job and what I love to
do is to win races, so whoever I'm racing against, my goal is to go
beat 'em. It's a shame it had to be Ward.''

 &HT;    Many whys to Falcons' demise
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ It was never a problem last year when injured
Falcons running back Byron Hanspard parked his car outside the door
to the locker room of team headquarters in Suwanee, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   He'd finish his rehabilitation, get in his car and leave. It was
like clockwork, every day.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Jamal Anderson didn't have it so easy. After
parking in the spot apparently reserved for injured players,
Anderson had to be careful not to hit a golf cart donated to coach
Dan Reeves, which had been left behind Anderson's car by Reeves'
granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Small thing? Of course. But it's just another little reminder
that everything is out of whack this year for the Falcons, who
continue to be a story of contrasts as they play at Pittsburgh
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons went 14-2 last season and shocked the professional
football world by advancing to the Super Bowl. This year, they're
1-5.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an ambitious and hard-hitting Falcons defense led the
NFL in turnover ratio at plus-20. This year, they're lethargic,
tied for last at minus-11.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, they were No. 6 in rushing, No. 2 against the run.
This year, they're No. 28 rushing, and No. 29 against the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling; it's the anti of everything you did,''
said free safety Eugene Robinson, who had his shining moment at
Super Bowl XXXIII in Miami turned into a fleeting 15 minutes of
fame. It's worth noting that Robinson's arrest for solicitation of
prostitution on the night before the Super Bowl against Denver
seemed to cast a pall from which the franchise has not recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been other, more tangible reasons, for the
Falcons' demise:
</P>
<P>
   _ The team was weakened by the decisions to release wide
receiver Tony Martin and weak-side linebacker Cornelius Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, released in a cost-cutting move, led the Falcons in
tackles last season, but he apparently brought much more to the
defensive unit. In Indianapolis, he has become a team leader and an
inspiration for the Colts defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons saved roughly $2.4 million by releasing Bennett. His
replacement, second-year player Keith Brooking, has played well.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves cut Martin during the offseason, when he wouldn't agree
to postpone a $400,000 roster bonus past March 1 to give the team a
chance to gauge the outcome of Martin's five federal charges of
money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked on it until the last minute to try to get them to
delay payment until we could see when a trial was set,'' Reeves
said. ``Mr. Martin (Tony's father, Hal) was dead set on him not
doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still felt like if ... becomes a free agent, we'd have a
chance to sign him.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who was acquitted on all charges, signed with the
Dolphins and is leading the team with 28 receptions for 481 yards
and two touchdowns. He's averaging 17.1 yards per catch.
</P>
<P>
   Martin led the Falcons last season with 66 receptions, but he
was valuable for much more than statistics. His speed changed the
way teams defensed the Falcons, helping Anderson rush for a
franchise-record 1,846 yards because teams had to honor the deep
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, of course it changed,'' said Vikings cornerback Jimmy
Hitchcock, whose team lost to Atlanta in the NFC title game, then
defeated the Falcons in the 1999 opener. ``He's a guy who can
stretch the field. Stretching the field meaning getting downfield.
This year, I don't think they're able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Falcons sent a dubious message on draft day when they
discussed the possibility of moving Anderson in a trade with the
Patriots. The story shocked Anderson and his teammates, and might
have factored in Anderson's lengthy holdout during training camp.
It was a big distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so big to this team, such a huge factor; when you heard
the trade talks it was a shock,'' wide receiver Jammi German said.
``I guess that was the business side of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves doesn't see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the biggest fallacy,'' he said. ``Calling and seeing
what somebody might be willing to give for somebody doesn't mean
he's going to be traded. If you don't call, you have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On draft day, the Falcons traded next year's first-round pick
to Baltimore for a second-round pick, and used it to draft Reggie
Kelly, one of four tight ends on the roster. Reeves said at the
time it wouldn't be a bad trade unless his team had a poor season,
which would make the lost pick occur earlier in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what?
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons were determined to go through with the trade,
they might have been better advised to draft a wide receiver or a
running back. Or they should have pursued backs and receivers
through free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves defends the trade by saying he felt good about the team's
receivers and running backs, even though Byron Hanspard, Anderson's
backup, missed the 1998 season with a knee injury. Ken Oxendine
carried 18 times as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like Byron was going to be back, Kenny was the backup,
and we felt Jamal was going to be there,'' Reeves said. ``We
thought we had plenty of running backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Anderson has not been replaced, and Reeves points to
the loss as the key to the Falcons' downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``You miss (Anderson) as a receiver, a blocker and as a
runner,'' Reeves said. ``You look at film from last year, and Jamal
made a awful lot of people miss. Plus, he was a great leader, a
tough guy. He gave guys inspiration. He was always fired up, and
you miss that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The timing of contract extensions created ill-will among
players.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons still have 10 starters whose contracts expire after
this season, nine who will become free agents. But the extensions
last month for starting defensive tackle Travis Hall, who still had
three years left, and reserve defensive tackle Ed Jasper, who got
two more years even though he had just joined the team, didn't sit
well with everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Starting defensive ends Lester Archambeau and Chuck Smith and
starting defensive tackle Shane Dronett are up for new contracts
after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is take care of myself, but definitely it shows
what the team is thinking,'' Dronett said. ``I take that back.
We're losing, and I wouldn't give anybody any more money, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said Hall and Jasper got extensions because they happened
to agree to terms sooner than the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we haven't tried to sign Lester and the
others,'' Reeves said. ``If you have success like we had last year,
and have that many free agents, you can't keep them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't keep people from thinking whatever they want to
think. But a lot of guys see what everybody else is getting. We
can't pay everybody necessarily want they perceive they're worth.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The juggling of offensive linemen has hurt. When Reeves moved
last year's second-round draft choice, Bob Hallen, into Calvin
Collins' starting left guard spot before the season, he explained
it was a move for the future. It hasn't worked. Greg Bishop will
start at left guard tonight.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little cohesion on the offensive line, and for
much of the season guards have been shuttling in and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob at times plays really well, but it hasn't been there
consistently,'' Reeves said. ``We thought ... six weeks into the
season, he would have gotten that down. It hasn't happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Can the Falcons turn it around? History suggests it's possible,
but not likely. The team began the 1997 season with a 1-7 record
before finishing 7-9. They rode that momentum to a wonderful 1998.
But that was then.
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, Falcons officials seemed to go against an
age-old adage: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
</P>
<P>
   The tinkering has taken a heavy toll.

GIANTS PRODUCE A MONTH'S OFFENSE IN ROUT OF SAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The offense scored four touchdowns,
which is normally a month's worth. It got 7 points on one of those
desperation passes that almost never work. In the game's final
minute, even though it no longer mattered, the defense put up a
goal-line stand, just to be obstinate.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five days after giving up 50 points at home and two weeks
after a miserable 3-point performance at Arizona, the New York
Giants won a laugher Sunday, running away from the New Orleans
Saints, 31-3.
</P>
<P>
   Routing a bumbling team like 1-5 New Orleans may not mean much,
but the outcome does: the 4-3 Giants are one of three teams near
the top of the National Football Conference East. Dallas and
Washington have &QC; 4-2 records.
</P>
<P>
   Two games after the Giants appeared in descent, the division
race is on. Remarkably, they are in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great to be 5-2,'' said Giants quarterback Kent
Graham, who had a serviceable day with two touchdown passes, one
interception and 239 yards while completing 19 of 29 passes. ``But
considering where we were, right now, we'll take 4-3.''
</P>
<P>
   The only negative for the Giants was injury related. Although
they were buoyed by the debut of the rookie running back Joe
Montgomery, who brought a little spirit to the team with a
skillful, determined 12-yard touchdown run, Montgomery also broke a
bone in his left foot and will be sidelined three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Safeties Shaun Williams (pulled hamstring) and Percy Ellsworth
(foot sprain) left the field on carts. Neither may play next week
at Philadelphia. Linebacker Jessie Armstead also bruised his ribs,
and defensive tackle Robert Harris left the locker room on crutches
with a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries aside, the Giants finally had a day when they looked
accomplished and adept. Most notable was a daring offense that
attacked in several new ways.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Pete Mitchell's expertise as a third-down receiver was
finally used as Graham threw to him five times, three times to
convert on a third-down situation.
</P>
<P>
   A double reverse sprung wide receiver Ike Hilliard for 24 yards
that led to the Giants' first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   And Graham threw downfield frequently, forgoing the cautious
approach so routine to the Giants. With 70 seconds left in the
first half and the ball at the Saints' 27-yard line, the Giants did
not settle for a field goal. Instead, Graham threw a touchdown to
Amani Toomer in the corner of the end zone for a 17-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the Giants got the ball back with 32 seconds left in
the half, they quickly moved 25 yards. From their 47-yard line, on
the last play before intermission, Graham launched a pass into the
Saints' end zone, where three Giants receivers waited. The ball was
tipped by Toomer and safety Sammy Knight and caught in the back of
the end zone by wide receiver Joe Jurevicius, giving the Giants a
24-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a Hail Mary work before,'' Giants Coach Jim
Fassel said. ``But there was no question in my mind we should go
for it. I told Kent, `Just make sure it gets all the way to the end
zone.'''
</P>
<P>
   The game was, in effect, over as soon as Jurevicius came down
with the ball because the Giants' defense continued to play at a
level that makes the unit among the elite in the National Football
League.
</P>
<P>
   They controlled and dominated the Saints, harassing quarterback
Billy Joe Tolliver into three interceptions. Ricky Williams, the
Saints' rookie running back, rushed for 111 yards on 24 carries,
but most of them were in the second half when New Orleans
threatened to cross the Giants' goal line only in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   Even that sequence was revealing. Montgomery's fumble had given
the Saints the ball on the Giants' 3-yard line. But twice the
linebackers stuffed Williams as he tried to bull into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   On third down, a play-action bootleg by the reserve quarterback
Danny Wuerffel failed when safety Sam Garnes ran him down and made
a spectacular open-field tackle. A fourth-down pass was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plays like that is how you judge a defense,'' Armstead said.
``We could let them score and they really wanted to score. But we
never want anyone to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstead left the game in the third quarter after a freakish
play that also sent Ellsworth to the sideline. Chasing Williams,
Armstead dived for the ball carrier, landing on Ellsworth's left
foot.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth's foot knocked the wind out of Armstead and left a
deep bruise on his rib cage. Ellsworth came off the field limping
on his left foot. Four plays later, with the Saints driving,
Ellsworth's backup, Shaun Williams, pulled his left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   That brought Ellsworth back into the game, his foot hastily
taped. He intercepted Tolliver's next pass.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth did not return to the game after his interception,
which left cornerback Jeremy Lincoln to play free safety because
the Giants' usual third safety, the rookie Lyle West, is also
injured.
</P>
<P>
   On the next New Orleans possession, it was Armstead's turn to go
from injury to interception. He picked off Tolliver's pass in the
flat and appeared to be on his way to the end zone when his
teammate Keith Hamilton accidentally got in his way, enabling the
Saints to catch Armstead from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery scored his touchdown on the next play, giving the
Giants their 31-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed something like this,'' Fassel said. ``I don't know
that I've ever had a laugher. Every game is tense. But a win is a
win.''
</P>
<P>
   And, for the first time this season, Fassel was not required to
apologize for the play of his offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that feels pretty good, too,'' the Giants' coach said. &QL;

   CABLE AND WIRELESS DENIES IT'S READY FOR A TAKEOVER
</P>
<P>
   As the telecommunications industry goes through a whirlwind of
merger-and-acquisition activity in the United States and Europe,
there is constant speculation that Cable and Wireless of Britain is
ripe for a takeover and ready to sell out.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chief executive, Graham Wallace, dismisses that
notion. He is trying to shift the company's focus away from its
consumer businesses toward its business customers. That has meant
selling some operations, including a deal announced Sunday to shed
its holdings in Israel's state-controlled phone company for $630
million.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN THE PRODUCT IS THE PLAN
</P>
<P>
   The desire to cash out big is not a new motivating force in the
technology industry. But what is striking about today's Internet
economy is how many entrepreneurs are focused on selling business
plans for their own sake rather than planning viable businesses.
And the ability to pull cash out of companies quickly and with
impunity may soon begin to crumple those Internet businesses that
can no longer get money from investors or the public markets.
</P>
<P>
   COLUMBIA REJECTS NISOURCE OFFER
</P>
<P>
   Columbia Energy Group rejected a $6.1 billion takeover bid from
the utility Nisource and said it would begin exploring
alternatives, including a merger with another company. The
announcement came one week after Nisource sweetened its bid.
</P>
<P>
   BIGGER TENT SOUGHT FOR ROAD SHOW
</P>
<P>
   The road show, the longtime practice of giving sophisticated
investors a preview before an initial public offering, is being
challenged by people who say all investors should be allowed to
take part in conference calls about important information. In
essence, the debate pits an Internet-age drive to give all
investors equal access against many companies' desire to conduct
private forums with the investors who still dominate the financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   WORD-OF-MOUTH OPINIONS GO ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   A handful of companies are hoping to take advantage of the
age-old effectiveness of word-of-mouth recommendations by creating
independent Web sites that give common folks and bona fide experts
a forum to voice their opinions, and users a way to rate the
pundits.
</P>
<P>
   PC SHIPMENTS UP 23 PERCENT IN 3RD QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   The personal-computer industry is continuing to show significant
global growth, with third-quarter shipments increasing by 23.2
percent compared with those in the quarter a year earlier,
according to a report to be issued Monday by Dataquest, a market
research company.
</P>
<P>
   MTV SHOW TO HAVE WEB PLAYERS
</P>
<P>
   In the latest attempt to attain true convergence of television
and the Internet, MTV plans to start a music-trivia game show in
which viewers can play along by logging onto MTV's Web site. The
program, ``Web Riot,'' will have its debut late next month, but MTV
plans to start promoting it Monday and to let potential players
begin downloading the required software. Media executives _
particularly advertisers _ will be waiting for MTV to prove that
the time for convergence has finally arrived.
</P>
<P>
   CRICHTON MAKES BOX-OFFICE DEAL
</P>
<P>
   The author Michael Crichton has made an unusual deal with
Paramount Pictures for his newest novel. Instead of collecting
millions of dollars by selling the rights to the studio, he has
opted to take a sizable percentage of the box-office receipts.
Executives said they could not recall a similar deal with a
novelist.

FOR SAINTS AND DITKA, A MISMANAGED CLOCK IS TICKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ With two minutes left in the shambles of
a rout by the Giants, a flock of reporters rushed to the New
Orleans Saints' interview room Sunday and jockeyed for position. It
is rare that the coach of a team that loses by 31-3 is this highly
sought. But this was Mike Ditka, the volatile coach whose reaction
to the Saints' deepening morass this season has taken him to the
brink of a meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in New Orleans, with his own fans showering him with
boos and jeers during what would become a 3-point loss to
Tennessee, Ditka cursed, made an obscene gesture and grabbed his
crotch as he left the field at halftime. The fans were angry
because the team had bungled a chance to score from the 1-yard line
at the end of the first half. The Saints fined Ditka $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   There was no outburst Sunday, just a tight-lipped, red-faced
soliloquy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were totally confused on defense, disorganized
offensively,'' Ditka said. ``Nothing else out there was really
respectable enough to call it Saints football, or any other kind of
football.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday another time-management blunder _ again at the end of
the first half _ opened the floodgates in what may be a benchmark
game for the Giants. Trailing by 17-3, with the Giants back on
their 22-yard line, Ditka stopped the clock with 17 seconds left.
Four plays later, Kent Graham threw a 53-yard desperation touchdown
to Joe Jurevicius to boost the Giants to a 24-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   William Roaf, the Saints' veteran offensive tackle, lamented:
``They go down there a minute before the half, they go down and get
a touchdown. See what I mean? We got beat. I mean, something's got
to give. I can't take it too much longer. They stopped everything
we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditka said of his clock management, ``It was poor. My fault. Not
good. We've done a poor job before; we did it again. Thank you.''
With that he left.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka was hired in 1997 and predicted that the Saints would
reach the Super Bowl. But the relationship between the good-time
city and the intransigent coach soured. A year after he was hired,
Ditka complained about the filth on Bourbon Street, the lack of
places to shop for clothes and the city's attitude. He complained,
``The people in this city are negative, and that bothers me.'' He
said, ``Before you can win, you have to believe you're worthy.''
When an increase in ticket prices was criticized, Ditka said: ``If
everybody is going to complain, maybe New Orleans doesn't need a
franchise. Ever think of that?''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Saints are headed for their third consecutive
losing season under Ditka, the team has become a potion for teams
in need of a lift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we're the elixir that makes everybody happy,'' he
said. ``When we show up, everybody seems to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditka is a relic, skating on thin ice and suffering from
comparisons: Dan Reeves, in just his second year as the coach of
the Atlanta Falcons, led the team to its first Super Bowl. Bill
Parcells guided the Jets to the conference championship game only
three years after inheriting a 1-15 team. Dick Vermeil, who
returned to coaching the same year Ditka returned, has led the St.
Louis Rams to a 5-0 start.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints' last winning season came in 1992. In a recent survey
conducted by The Times-Picayune, respondents predicted by a 2-to-1
margin that Ditka will not lead the Saints to the playoffs. By a
3-to-1 margin, those polled predicted that the Saints would post a
losing record for the third straight season under Ditka.
</P>
<P>
   As his teammates scurried out after Sunday's game, Ricky
Williams, the Saints' rookie running back, remained behind,
patiently answering questions about his milestone day. Williams,
the 1998 Heisman Trophy winner, had rushed for 100 yards for the
first time in his pro career, all of six games old.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just numbers, that's all,'' he said. In Williams'
case, numbers matter. A lot. The Saints, on Ditka's recommendation,
effectively mortgaged their future by trading a number of draft
picks for the chance to select Williams. In turn, Williams signed
an incentive-laden contract with the Saints. He is guaranteed $11
million, but his four-year contract can be worth as much as $68
million if he reaches all of 26 incentives written into the deal.
One incentive is reached if Williams averages 1,600 yards a year
over four years, a staggering figure. He'll have to average nearly
120 yards a game the remainder of this season to be on pace. He
hasn't been healthy enough to even make a dent.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams' fortunes have been as dismal as the Saints'. He
reported to camp out of shape, then injured his ankle, twice, and
injured his forearm. Sunday he gained 111 yards on 24 carries. He
scored once, but the touchdown was called back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been injured and banged up a lot, so I haven't had a
chance to really be myself out there,'' he said. ``For the first
time I felt more like myself.''
</P>
<P>
   As Williams left for the team bus, someone asked how he felt
about Ditka's explosions. Did he feel linked to his coach?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' he said. ``We're on different levels _ he's been
in football so long and this is my first year, so I can't really
understand what he's been going through, but I know it's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the rookie, is watching a coach near the end of his
career do a slow burn; it's all part of the business, but not fun
to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels like everything is his fault,'' Williams said. ``It's
really sad. I wish we could play better to make him feel better.''

MEXICAN PRESIDENT DEFENDS FAIRNESS OF PARTY'S 1ST PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Speaking two weeks before Mexico's first
presidential primary, President Ernesto Zedillo on Sunday defended
the fairness of the process and renewed his pledge to remain
neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo denied accusations that the primary for his governing
party has been rigged to favor Francisco Labastida Ochoa, his
former interior minister. His three rivals have complained
repeatedly that Labastida, the only member of Zedillo's Cabinet in
the primary, is the president's preferred candidate and has been
given unfair advantages by his Institutional Revolutionary Party,
known as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not during the process up to now, nor in what remains of it,
have I had, nor will I have, a preferred candidate,'' Zedillo said
Sunday in a speech to hundreds of party leaders. ``Nobody can point
to a single action, not even the smallest sign, to suggest that I
have failed in my commitment to strict neutrality.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's address to governors, members of congress, mayors,
union chiefs and other party leaders broke a seven-month silence.
He has not spoken publicly about the primary since March, when he
publicly renounced the tradition under which Mexican presidents
have handpicked their successors and urged party leaders to
organize the party's first primary, scheduled for Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, opinion polls have suggested that Labastida has
taken a significant lead over his closest rival, Roberto Madrazo
Pintado, a former governor of Tabasco. Two others seeking the
party's nomination, Manuel Bartlett Diaz, a former governor of
Puebla, and Humberto Roque Villanueva, a former speaker of the
House, are running far behind. The winner of the primary will
compete against two opposition-party candidates in presidential
balloting on July 2.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's three primary election adversaries have all
complained in recent days about what they say has been unfair
support given to him by governors and other officials, including
verbal endorsements as well as logistical and material help. But
Zedillo brushed aside those assertions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To all the candidates, I repeat: Have confidence in
democracy,'' Zedillo said. ``Have confidence in the PRI. Don't
waste your time and campaign resources inciting fears that are not
warranted. In short, don't cast aspersions on our party for unjust
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo has been especially aggressive in impugning the
impartiality of party leaders. Earlier this month, he accused the
governing party chief, Jose Antonio Gonzalez Fernandez, of working
to rig the primary in favor of Labastida, and demanded that
Gonzalez resign. A party panel established to referee the primary
campaign rejected Madrazo's accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints by Labastida's rivals have grown so vehement that he
has acknowledged that the party could rupture after the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo urged the four contenders to maintain party unity. ``In
elections as competitive as we expect next year's to be, unity is
simply indispensable,'' he said.

WENDY SCOTT, 50, WHO FAKED ILLNESS FOR ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala.)  (lb) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wendy Scott, who had one of the most severe cases on record of a
syndrome in which people feign illness or make themselves sick to
get medical treatment, died on Oct. 14 at a hospice in South
London. She was 50.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was intestinal cancer, said Mary Jane Lang, a friend
of Miss Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Scott, who lived in London, spent 12 years traveling from
one hospital to another in Britain and elsewhere in Europe,
pretending to be ill so that she could become a patient. She was
admitted to hundreds of hospitals and underwent 42 operations,
nearly all of them unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, Miss Scott recovered from the condition, called
Munchausen syndrome, which many doctors consider untreatable.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in The New York Times on July 20, Miss Scott
said she had not faked her way into a hospital in 20 years. She
credited her devotion to a pet with helping her recover. She became
so attached to a kitten that she gave up hospitals for fear the
kitten would be neglected in her absence.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, she tried to help other people with Munchausen
syndrome, communicating with them by mail, telephone and the
Internet. She also approached Dr. Marc Feldman, a psychiatrist at
the University of Alabama at Birmingham and an expert on Munchausen
syndrome, who said she had helped a number of patients.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Ms. Scott became increasingly ill but had
difficulty obtaining medical care in London because of her
notorious record. While visiting Miss Lang in the United States
last summer, she sought help from Feldman, whose colleagues in
Birmingham discovered that she had advanced intestinal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Scott remained in the hospital in Birmingham until last
month, and then returned to London.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Scott was born in 1948 in Wemyss, in the Fife region of
Scotland near the North Sea. Information about survivors was not
available.

 &HT;    Ward Connerly fights image issues
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Each word is spoken with increasing
anger. Ward Connerly is ticked off, and right now, race matters.
</P>
<P>
   A Palm Beach Post editorial comment that he considers dismissive
of his African-American, Irish, French and Indian ancestry, ``is
very demeaning of my heritage,'' says the man who wants Floridians
to end race-based affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's racist. Your damn paper gets away with it
because I'm a black.''
</P>
<P>
   If Connerly is aware of the irony of his statement, he never
lets on. Instead, he calms down and spends the next 45 minutes
talking about how we should have a society where race doesn't
matter.
</P>
<P>
   To his critics, Connerly is a political fraud. ``He wants to
tell blacks that race doesn't matter, but when he got angry he
didn't say he was Irish,'' says Tony Welch, 34, a Tallahassee
Democrat who shares much in common with Connerly except his
political beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly sees himself as a crusader who believes that the next
logical step in improving race relations is to end affirmative
action and replace it with programs that help the poor regardless
of color.
</P>
<P>
   He does more than talk about it. His movement succeeded in
changing the laws in the states of California and Washington so
governments and universities can no longer use racial preferences
in choosing students or awarding contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly wants to do the same in Florida. His organization here,
the Florida Civil Rights Initiative, has already collected more
than 50,000 signatures. Plenty to send a proposed 37-word amendment
to the state Constitution to the Florida Supreme Court. Soon, the
court will decide if those words are clear enough and limited in
scope enough to be put on the November 2000 ballot. Early polling
suggests that if the amendment makes it to the ballot, it will win
overwhelming support.
</P>
<P>
   He has been called a ``house slave'' and a ``puppet for the
white man.'' Gov. Jeb Bush urged him not to come to Florida, saying
he is ``too divisive.'' When Connerly, who had the help of former
California Gov. Pete Wilson in passing Proposition 209 last year,
asked to speak at the Florida Republican convention this month, he
was told, ``No.'' Ditto to his request to set up a hospitality
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The establishment in Florida from the governor on down don't
seem to give a damn about free speech and open discussion of
ideas,'' Connerly complains. ``The politicians and minorities in
Florida play hardball.''
</P>
<P>
   COMMON BONDS, UNLIKE IDEALS
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing Bush's concerns, Connerly asks, ``What issue isn't
divisive? You don't think a proposal for school vouchers isn't
divisive?'' For Connerly, getting rid of racial preferences is the
next logical step toward a time when his three grandchildren will
live in a society where race is no longer the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my grandkids to have to go through the crap of,
'What are you?''' he says. ``You know if I say I'm anything other
than African-American, I get grief. Why should there be this
intimidation?''
</P>
<P>
   Welch says, welcome to reality.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are black. Their wives are white. Their children
biracial. Connerly has two grandchildren who have a Vietnamese
mother. With as much as they have in common in their homes, they
have little in common on the issue of race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Ward Connerly really believes the bile he's
spewing,'' says Welch, a former Pensacola newspaper reporter who is
now a spokesman for the state Democratic Party. He spoke for this
story as a private citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agree that race should not matter, but it does, and I
have already had to explain to my 4-year-old daughter why it
mattered one day in preschool,'' Welch says. ``And Connerly knows
that the reason he is the chosen leader of that movement is because
of the color of his skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action and other preference programs must remain to
continue the effort begun with the 1964 Civil Rights Act to end the
racism embedded in both government and private industry, Welch
argues.
</P>
<P>
   'WELFARE FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS'
</P>
<P>
   Connerly believes the Civil Rights Act never intended preference
programs. Instead, it was a call to treat all people equally. The
only preference programs that should exist are those that help
people in poverty regardless of race.
</P>
<P>
   ``These programs have become like welfare,'' Connerly says.
``People have become dependent on them. And there are some serious
problems in Florida with cronyism and favoritism that abuse this
system. I believe the sole reason for the government to use
taxpayers' money to benefit anybody is to help people who need
assistance. Affirmative action is a form of welfare for the middle
class.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Connerly says, he experienced the callous racism of
the Jim Crow era where ``coloreds'' were often denied service in
restaurants and hotels and were forbidden to use ``white''
restrooms and water fountains.
</P>
<P>
   He went to community college in Sacramento and then went on to
get his four-year degree. A few years later he wound up working
with Pete Wilson, then a state legislator in California. At
Wilson's urging, Connerly got a job dealing with housing and
community development in then-Gov. Ronald Reagan's administration.
He now has a consulting business based in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   None of his jobs or clients was the result of any type of
affirmative action program, says Connerly. ``Say I'm a crony of
Pete Wilson. Say I'm appointed because I gave him $130,000 for his
campaign. But instead, we would rather believe a black person got
something because he is black. That stigma is not helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG READY TO MOVE FORWARD
</P>
<P>
   Welch suggests Connerly is being conveniently naive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he really believe that Ronald Reagan didn't consider the
color of his skin when he appointed Connerly?'' says Welch. ``I
don't doubt that his connections to Pete Wilson helped. I also
don't doubt that Connerly's race helped.''
</P>
<P>
   It is among the people who are half his age, such as Welch, that
Connerly sees the most promise for the future. He says younger
blacks do not want to cling to slavery or the days of Jim Crow
laws. He says younger whites do not want to be held responsible for
the past. Both, he insists, are ready to move forward in race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a Democrat, I would probably have more credibility
with some people about this issue,'' Connerly says. ``But then I
would be seen as a race traitor and as a traitor to the Democrat
ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he is viewed by his rivals as someone who is trying to
make a name for himself, put a few dollars in his pocket and win
respectability among conservative whites at the expense of
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I ask myself why I keep doing this,'' says Connerly.
``But I have an absolute belief that if you feel something strongly
enough, you have a moral obligation to follow through.''

CASEY MARTIN EARNS CARD FOR PGA TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By BILL FIELDS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOTHAN, Ala. _ Casey Martin's golf wasn't pretty, but when the
Nike Tour Championship ended Sunday, his tie for 37th place was a
beautiful thing to him.
</P>
<P>
   That was because despite closing with a 78 and finishing at
11-over-par 299, 16 strokes off the pace, Martin concluded the Nike
Tour season 14th on the money list. And as one of the top 15 money
earners on the Nike developmental circuit, he secured his PGA Tour
card, giving him playing privileges on the Tour next year.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is a disabled golfer who sued the PGA Tour for the right
to use a golf cart in competition and won; the Tour has appealed
the case in Federal Court, and a ruling is expected any day. He
began the week 12th on the money list. When he shot 77-78 in the
final two rounds, he was vulnerable to falling out of the top 15,
but he got help when three golfers immediately behind him on the
money list had off weeks as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a struggle, every week is a struggle,'' said Martin, who
was born with a circulatory disorder that has caused his right leg
to deteriorate and forced him to deal with constant pain. ``My life
can definitely be a struggle, but it's a fairy tale too at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the other 14 golfers who earned their 2000 PGA Tour
rights, Martin was handed his player's card by the PGA Tour
commissioner, Tim Finchem, after Bob Heintz had defeated Marco
Dawson in a playoff for the championship. As Finchem has done
throughout Martin's legal battle with the PGA Tour, he applauded
Martin's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased and excited for Casey,'' Finchem said afterward.
``He's overcome a lot to get to this point. Whatever the court
does, it does. We believe strongly in the rules we have regarding
walking in the sport, but at the same time you have to a great deal
of admiration at how far he's come. You have to take your hat off
to him, and we do.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Tour wins its appeal, it would be up to the Tour policy
board to decide whether to make an exception in Martin's case,
something it has not chosen to do before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see what the court does,'' Finchem said. ``And then
we'll talk about that. Right now, our posture is, we have a rule on
the books. If the courts don't disallow us from implementing that
rule, it would be implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeating a pattern from the third round, Martin began to
struggle in the middle of Sunday's final round. He bogeyed the
first three holes of the back nine, setting the tone for an
incoming 42. Finishing about two hours before the final group, he
had time to eat lunch, check the computer leader board and watch
the leaders finish on television. His mother, Melinda, sat with
him. His father, King, retreated to Martin's courtesy car to be
alone with his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was praying this trip wouldn't be in vain,'' King Martin
said. ``We don't do anything easy. We get there the hard way. I
wish I could just box the way I feel right now, because it's a
treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's legal case has created a fissure in professional golf,
but after playing two seasons on the Nike Tour, he has won over
some players after they have seen the difficulty he has just moving
from his cart to the ball. His right leg has gotten worse in recent
years and is unlikely to get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casey's a friend of mine, and I've got chills thinking about
it,'' said Carl Paulson, who finished first on the Nike Tour money
list and will be joining Martin on the PGA Tour. ``It's a dream
come true for him. He can't play without a cart. The way I look at
it, it's more unfair if he didn't get a cart than unfair if he has
a cart. It's a perfect script that he makes it this week.''

 &HT;    Lamborghini lemon case shifts to plantiff's past
 &HT;    By Scott Hiaasen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Who knows, maybe the Lamborghini Diablo
Roadster is the world's most extravagant lemon. But in a lawsuit
intended to prove just that, questions about the $238,000 sports
car's reliability are suddenly beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, attorneys for the Italian automaker will appeal to a
federal magistrate in West Palm Beach to throw out a suit against
the company filed by a Fort Lauderdale man, John Martin. They say
Martin is holding ``straw title'' to the car for its true owner,
Brian Neiman, a paralegal and felon who has become notorious in
South Florida legal circles for his role in several high-profile
discrimination lawsuits _ and for an aggressive style that
sometimes crosses the line.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of testimony about leaky doors, sudden engine stalls
and blinking dashboards, the case has now cast a spotlight on
Neiman's checkered career: From his convictions three years ago for
insurance fraud, to more recent accusations that he practiced law
illegally and has used ``blackmail tactics'' to extract
million-dollar settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defense to the case is to try to make me the highlight
of the case, which I am not,'' Neiman said. ``There's really one
question: Is the car defective?''
</P>
<P>
   It all began in June 1998, when John Martin v. Automobili
Lamborghini was filed in federal court. In the suit, Martin said
the company promised him that the low-riding purple sports car,
which can reach speeds of 200 mph, could take the wear and tear of
everyday driving. Instead, the car scraped over speed bumps, leaked
when it rained and stalled for no reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin would not have purchased the Diablo if he had been
advised of the existing design and manufacturing defects,'' the
complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   When the lawsuit was filed, Martin, 32, a jet engine mechanic
and pharmacy student, told The Palm Beach Post that his parents
helped him buy the 1997 car from a North Miami Beach dealership.
</P>
<P>
   But that turned out not to be so. Lamborghini lawyers found that
Neiman negotiated the deal for the car, and money from a bank
account in Neiman's name covered the difference after they traded
in a Ferrari (also held in Martin's name).
</P>
<P>
   READING THE FINE PRINT
</P>
<P>
   In initial court papers, Martin was described as Neiman's
roommate. It has since been disclosed in court papers that they
were lovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin may have been asked to hold straw title as a front, but
to have claimed in this suit that he was the purchaser and owner
... was a rank fraud on this court,'' Lamborghini lawyer John
Dotterrer wrote in court papers
</P>
<P>
   Neiman, 30, is the paralegal for Saul Smolar, the lawyer who
filed the suit. With Smolar and another attorney, Norman Ganz,
Neiman has helped collect millions of dollars in out-of-court
settlements from discrimination claims, many of them against large
employers and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Among their targets have been the Boynton Beach police, the
cities of Lake Park and Port St. Lucie, the St. Lucie County School
District and the Martin Correctional Institution.
</P>
<P>
   But the legal team's tactics have been criticized more than once
by opposing lawyers, judges and even some of their own clients. The
Lamborghini case has been no different.
</P>
<P>
   After questioning the ownership of the car, the Lamborghini
lawyers attacked the lawsuit itself. They found that Neiman, not
Smolar, was the one who signed the complaint, as well as several
other court documents. Court rules say only lawyers should sign
such records.
</P>
<P>
   When handwriting samples were demanded, Neiman and Smolar
admitted it was Neiman who signed Smolar's name. Smolar said he's
often out of the office and can't always sign documents, but he
reviewed them with Neiman over the phone, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   The defense wants Smolar and Neiman fined for the infraction.
And it's not the first time it's happened. Last month, a magistrate
in Fort Pierce recommended $10,000 fines each for Neiman and Smolar
for allowing Neiman to sign court papers. The judge also wants
Smolar barred from practicing in federal court for a year. Smolar
and Neiman have filed objections.
</P>
<P>
   DID THE COMPANY KNOW?
</P>
<P>
   To Lamborghini, it's further indication that the case against
the company is: The man who signed the complaint was the one who
bought the car, and he often drove it. Neiman has been ticketed
while driving the car, he paid for repairs, and he took tax
write-offs for it, court records show. Neiman's probation officer
said he even bragged about his new car, though Neiman said he
doesn't remember it.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you not make the case about Neiman when every rock we
pick up comes back to Neiman?'' said John Mullin, a Fort Lauderdale
lawyer with Lamborghini's distribution company.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman and Martin say none of this matters. Martin holds the
title to the car, his name's on the warranty, and he holds the
insurance. It was Martin, they say, who was trapped inside the car
when the doors jammed shut; he was the one who got smacked in the
head when the sunroof swung free.
</P>
<P>
   They also have statements from more than a dozen former
Lamborghini employees who say the company knew the car was a lemon,
and repair records showing the problems with the Diablo are
chronic, Neiman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real facts of this case will eventually bear out that the
Diablo is defective,'' Harris Solomon, a lawyer for Martin and
Neiman, said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   BIG MONEY BRINGS BIG PROBLEMS
</P>
<P>
   Lamborghini denies the Diablo Roadster is faulty, and lawyers
for the company say the ex-workers are disgruntled. Neiman says the
defense strategy has been to portray him as ``a fag and a felon,''
rehashing his convictions for grand theft and insurance fraud and
forcing him to disclose his relationship with Martin (they broke up
late last year after six years together).
</P>
<P>
   Neiman said he gave the car to Martin as a gift, and the
$145,000 check that covered the difference from the Ferrari
trade-in came from an account the two men still share.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to reconcile the relationship with him, and
this certainly hasn't helped it,'' Neiman said. ``The only thing he
left this relationship with was that car.''
</P>
<P>
   Neiman said he bought Martin about six cars over the years, paid
for with the money he made working with Smolar and Ganz.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Neiman and Ganz handled several high-profile
lawsuits from Miami to Fort Pierce, usually alleging race or sex
discrimination. They won big settlements, including $1.4 million
from the St. Lucie County School District, $1.6 million from
BellSouth and $1.3 million from the Broward County clerk's office.
</P>
<P>
   But opposing lawyers and some judges have said the team's
negotiating tactics were akin to blackmail. In one case, U.S.
District Judge Kenneth Ryskamp said Neiman, Ganz and two other
lawyers should share a $180,000 fine for using the threat of action
by the NAACP to try to get a large settlement. Ganz was the general
counsel for the civil-rights group's Fort Lauderdale branch at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   These issues eventually caught the notice of the Florida Bar.
Last year, while the bar was investigating Ganz's conduct in two
cases, Ganz resigned from his law practice, citing medical reasons.
His cases were then taken over by Smolar, who now is also under
investigation by the Bar.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits made Neiman a wealthy man wealthier, it seems, than
the lawyers he's worked for. Until recently, the law firm worked
mainly out of a $1 million waterfront home Neiman owned in Fort
Lauderdale. According to bar investigators, Ganz's law practice
made about $4.1 million in 1995 and 1996 _ nearly 70 percent of
which went to Neiman.
</P>
<P>
   But lately the courts have not been so kind to Neiman. He's been
prosecuted for practicing law without a license, the Florida Bar is
after him, and opposing lawyers have waged vitriolic
counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   THE `LAWYER' WITH A RECORD
</P>
<P>
   Neiman pleaded guilty in August to the misdemeanor charges of
practicing law illegally for negotiating settlements for clients.
He was sentenced to five years' probation, but it was suspended
while he appeals. He says he did it in an effort to clear up the
law: An appeals court has been asked to draw clear lines regarding
what paralegals can and can't do when working on a case.
</P>
<P>
   To the Florida Bar, the lines are obvious. Its 22-count
complaint, filed in January, says Neiman, not Ganz or Smolar, met
with clients, orchestrated the complaints and negotiated most
settlements, sometimes using ``coercive tactics'' to get their
clients to agree to the terms. The complaint also says Neiman
occasionally held himself out as an attorney; one client said she
didn't know Neiman wasn't a lawyer until she read about him in a
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman has been in trouble before. In 1996, he was convicted of
filing false insurance claims, saying he couldn't work for a year
because of complications from a tonsillectomy. He's also been
charged with taking part in bogus ``slip-and-fall'' schemes (one
involving his mother), leading to convictions for grand theft and
organized fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Neiman's recent civil cases have also soured. In one
suit against a skating rink, the rink's lawyers accused Neiman of
racketeering, saying he bribed witnesses to essentially set up the
case, court records show. Neiman dismissed the accusations as
``impertinent and scandalous,'' and the suit was later settled for
$15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman and Smolar were also sued in Broward County by some
former clients who say their legal fees were excessive.
</P>
<P>
   AND NOW HE'S A WITNESS
</P>
<P>
   Neiman dismisses all this as distractions from questions about
the Lamborghini's faults. He's busy working with Smolar, gathering
more evidence for future cases against the famous automaker.
</P>
<P>
   However, Smolar has withdrawn as Martin's lawyer because Neiman
has become a witness. Solomon, the lawyer who took over the case,
has filed a motion asking that evidence of Neiman's criminal record
be banned from the trial, which is set for April.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman sold his oceanfront home and now lives more modestly. (He
tried to argue to Fort Lauderdale zoning officials that he had to
work out of his house for health reasons. His condition?
Incontinence.) And though he insists the Lamborghini is still
Martin's to have, the violet vision that started the whole mess is
sitting in Neiman's garage. Martin, he says, can't keep it at his
condominium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worthless,'' Neiman said.

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
IRVING _ Washington receivers Albert Connell and Michael Westbrook
boasted last week that they weren't afraid of Dallas cornerback
Deion Sanders. They were confident, they said, that the future Hall
of Famer couldn't stop them.
<TEXT>
<P>
   What they failed to consider, however, was the Redskins stopping
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with a concussion suffered early in the game, Sanders
got his first punt return for a touchdown this season, running 70
yards to cap a 38-20 Cowboys victory over the Redskins on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Connell and Sanders tied with one touchdown apiece, Connell's a
44-yard reception late in the third quarter that still left the
Redskins playing catch-up. He finished with two catches for 52
yards. Westbrook was even less of a factor, catching three balls
for 38 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him (Connell) he played a good game and got his big
play, but it ain't no fun when the rabbit's got the gun, too,''
Sanders said. ``I know a lot of guys want to make a name for
themselves off me because I'm a big-game player, but I've got the
gun also.''
</P>
<P>
   At 4-2 each, Dallas and Washington are now tied atop the NFC
East, although the Cowboys obtained the tiebreaker edge by virtue
of a regular-season sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who didn't play when the teams last met in the season
opener, suffered his concussion on a punt return toward the end of
the first quarter. He barreled forward, head down, and met Dan
Turk, helmet on helmet. Shaken, Sanders got up slowly, then was
taken to the locker room for tests.
</P>
<P>
   He emerged from the locker room in the third quarter, bypassing
the sideline and heading straight onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the doctors weren't going to let me go out there,''
Sanders said. ``So I came right out of the tunnel, right onto the
field. I wouldn't hear no for the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither would his teammates, who had much to prove after 13-10
losses to the Eagles and Giants over the previous two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas offense, in particular, was desperate to show it was
better than the unit that was limited to one touchdown at both
Philadelphia and New York. It struck early and often, scoring 17
points on its first three trips down the field. In all, the
Cowboys' offense amassed 352 yards and crossed the goal line four
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We executed better, no turnovers, and did well in the red
zone,'' Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman said. ``We had big plays and
touchdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was responsible for three of those, connecting with
Rocket Ismail on a 13-yard pass on the opening drive and with tight
end David LaFleur on a four-yard pass late in the third quarter.
Aikman later carried the ball one yard himself, barely getting into
the end zone on an ugly but successful bootleg keeper early in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to throw it,'' Aikman said. ``It should have been an
easy touchdown. I made it more dramatic than it should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith plunged in from a yard out for the Cowboys' other
touchdown. Smith, who rushed for only 26 yards Oct. 18 against the
Giants, struggled on his outside attempts but was fairly successful
running north and south, finishing the day with 80 yards on 24
carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was very important after the way we played the last
two weeks that we come out early and establish ourselves, either on
the ground or in the air,'' Smith said. ``I think we did a good job
of that. We were more intense today. We did better flying around
and just trying to have fun playing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to have fun as Dallas surged to a 17-0 lead thanks
to Ismail's catch, Smith's run and a 32-yard field goal by Richie
Cunningham. The Redskins were held to 23 total yards in the first
quarter, which included Washington drives of nine and minus-13
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played horribly in the first quarter, and the Dallas
Cowboys played with a lot of intensity,'' Redskins coach Norv
Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas defense also came in with a mission, determined to
prove it wasn't as bad as it looked in Week 1 when it allowed the
Redskins to score 35 points. It made its point quickly as Sanders
leaped out on the opening play to nail Stephen Davis four yards
behind the line of scrimmage. Greg Ellis took the lead on second
down, hitting Larry Centers at the line for no gain. It was Chad
Hennings' turn on third-and-14. He drilled quarterback Brad Johnson
at the line of scrimmage to force a punt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very impressive,'' Dallas coach Chan Gailey said of
Sanders' initial hit. ``It looked like he shot out of a cannon. It
showed everyone we were going to get after them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins were eventually able to get the NFL's No. 1 offense
going. Johnson hit Mike Sellers with a 33-yard scoring pass to
narrow the gap to 17-7 with 6:52 remaining in the second quarter.
Brett Conway's second field goal made it a 17-13 game at the 10:35
mark in the third.
</P>
<P>
   But for the remainder of the game, Dallas came up with an answer
every time Washington threatened. After Conway's second field goal,
the Cowboys held the ball for nearly six minutes, driving 75 yards
and scoring on LaFleur's touchdown catch.
</P>
<P>
   After Connell caught his 44-yarder late in the third to again
pull Washington within four, the Cowboys drove 90 yards for
Aikman's one-yard score to increase the lead to 31-20. Sanders'
70-yard punt return was icing on the celebratory cake.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins finished with 272 yards total offense, a far cry
from the 504 they amassed in Week 1 against the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one was a little bit of a measuring stick,'' said Dallas
defensive coordinator Dave Campo, ``because of the fact that we
helped them to their No. 1 offensive ranking in that first
ballgame.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Quinn, the longtime director of NBC's ``Tonight'' show
when Johnny Carson was host, died on Thursday at his home in
Malibu, Calif. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, known as Bobby, was the director of the show from 1968 to
1992, when Carson left the show and he retired.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 Quinn won a Directors Guild of America award for his
work on Carson's second-to-last ``Tonight'' show, with Robin
Williams and Bette Midler as guests.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 Quinn was nominated for an Emmy for his directing of
``Tonight,'' ``after doing five shows a week for 25 years,'' as
Carson put it at the time.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Brooklyn, Quinn graduated from high school there and
served in the Marines during World War II and the Korean War. He
joined NBC in the 1940s as a mail clerk in Manhattan and rose
through its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   His marriages to Nancy Kyle and Tangley Lloyd ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife of 14 years, the former Charlotte
Micheli; three daughters, Patricia Hilton, Kathleen Gorlitz and
Demarest Quinn; six sons, Douglas, Kevin, Brian, Colin, Robert Jr.
and James; 13 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

VAN ARSDALE FRANCE, WHO SHAPED TRAINING FOR DISNEY WORKERS, DIES AT
87
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Wash., Colo., Ore., N.M.)  (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Van Arsdale France, the man who wrote the manual for teaching
Disneyland employees precisely how to smile, died on Oct. 13 in
Newport Beach, Calif. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   France brought a background in industrial relations to
Disneyland, which opened in 1955 in Anaheim, Calif. He spent more
than a quarter-century developing training programs for what came
to be called Disney University. After retiring in 1978, he was a
consultant to Disney until his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was able to put into effect the way Walt wanted the staff
to relate to guests,'' said Jack Linquist, who worked for the
Disney Co company for 38 years, the last five as president of
Disneyland. He called France ``a real Jiminy Cricket,'' who acted
as the conscience of Disneyland when he saw cost-cutters as
threatening the integrity of Walt Disney's vision.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney vision involved a formula in which all staff members,
not just the people who portrayed Snow White and Mickey Mouse, were
told to think of themselves as characters playing to an audience.
</P>
<P>
   France's basic idea was something he called ``the looking-glass
self,'' meaning that if staff members smiled, customers would
smile, too. No honorifics were permitted in Disneyland. ``The only
Mister here is Mr. Toad,'' France's manual commanded.
</P>
<P>
   The vision was broadly egalitarian. As the manual said: ``Every
guest receives the VIP treatment. We roll out the red carpet for
the Jones family from Joliet just as we would (with a few
embellishments) for the Eisenhowers from Palm Springs.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cast members were expected to know their roles and stay
in character. Women were to wear scant makeup and men were to be
clean-shaven.
</P>
<P>
   Some saw such commandments as rather harsh social control, and
some were even more critical.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1968 book, ``The Disney Version,'' Richard Schickel wrote
that Disney University trained people ``in the modern American art
forms _ pioneered by the airlines _ of the frozen smile and the
canned answer delivered with enough spontaneity to seem
unprogrammed.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrie Richards Alden, a jazz singer who worked at Disney parks
on and off from 1986 to 1993, said she found it oppressive.
``Everything about you had to be Alice in Wonderland,'' she said,
``even if you were a garbage collector making the minimum wage.''
</P>
<P>
   France was born in the Seattle area and moved to San Diego at
age 12, said Estelle Webb, his companion of 33 years. He graduated
from San Diego State University and worked in labor relations
before being asked to set up the Disney employment-training
program.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Nunis, who was hired by France at Disneyland's inception
and went on to become his boss as head of Disney Attractions, said
France always showed a willingness to learn and adapt. In the late
1960s, for example, France enrolled at the University of Colorado
at Boulder to gain exposure to the thinking of the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Nunis said that whenever France thought Disneyland was beginning
to slip a bit after Walt Disney's death in 1966, not following the
original policy of putting quality ahead of costs, he would
complain, often successfully. (Disney had refused to post signs
asking visitors not to step on gardens, resulting in the loss of
tens of thousands of plants a year.)
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, France wrote articles and pamphlets for
older people, including one that advocated bus travel, which he
adopted after he stopped driving. It was called ``The Bus and I:
Diary of a Reformed Autoholic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Webb said that France jogged decades before it became
popular and that he was an avid body surfer because his small size
had made it difficult to control the heavy surfboards of his youth.
Until several months ago, France ``ralked'' daily; ralking is the
word he coined for his combination of running and walking.
</P>
<P>
   France was married twice and is survived by two daughters,
Cheryl France of Portland, Ore., and Sandy Steen of Albuquerque,
N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Webb said she and France had lived around the corner from
each other for 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed in long engagements,'' she said.

SAY HEY KID WAS BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Where's Pete Rose? Why isn't he here? Oh, he'll be
here later in the day before Game 2 of the World Series when they
introduce the living members of the All-Century Team.
</P>
<P>
   Where's Peter Rose? Oh, he's doing a card show in Atlantic City.
What do you think, should he be in the Hall of Fame?
</P>
<P>
   The assemblage of writers went on and on about Pete Rose this
and Pete Rose that, but on this particular early Sunday afternoon I
wouldn't have cared had Pete Rose remained in Atlanta City and
gambled to his addictive heart's delight late into the evening.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest with you, I didn't give one damn bit about Pete
Rose, even though I happen to like Pete personally and believe that
he should have his plaque hanging in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   My childhood idol, Willie Mays, was present at an All Century
Team press conference at the Marriott Marquis, along with other
icons of his sport like Hank Aaron and Sandy Koufax and Stan Musial
and Bob Gibson and Warren Spahn and Mike Schmidt and Brooks
Robinson and Nolan Ryan and Yogi Berra.
</P>
<P>
   They stuck the players in three ballrooms for interviews, but I
was interested only in talking to the man who was the greatest
baseball player I've ever seen perform on the ball diamonds around
America.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, the immortal Say Hey Kid, with his thrilling style of
playing a game that he so often turned into a private recital of
his joyful skills.
</P>
<P>
   No one could make a catch more exciting than Mays, and no one
seemed to have more fun on the field than the hyperactive center
fielder of the San Francisco Giants who played 22 major league
seasons and wound up with 660 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   There have been passionate arguments among people who care about
such things about who the best living baseball player is since the
death of Joe DiMaggio, and the names mentioned most often are those
of Mays, Ted Williams, Pete Rose, Koufax, Musial and Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   But I, admittedly biased, think the arguments are specious.
</P>
<P>
   I thought Mays ranked No. 1 even when DiMaggio was living.
</P>
<P>
   But for some reason, in the wake of the New York-inspired
hysteria accompanying the deaths of DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle and
the on-going controversy surrounding Rose, Willie Mays has lapsed
into the public shadows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why haven't you received as much recognition in recent years
as some of your contemporaries?'' I asked Mays, as he sat at a
podium engulfed by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'm not going to go there,'' said Mays defensively. ``I
think I'm as well known now as I've ever been. I really don't think
of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Mays is stylishly dressed in a custom-made tan suit, and he's 21
pounds heavier at 210 than he was during those glad days when he
was chasing down fly balls and loosing his cap in parks around the
National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I weighed 189 my entire career, and had a 32-inch waist when I
retired,'' he says proudly.
</P>
<P>
   He is 68 years old now, and the hair has receded slightly and
the face is puffier than it was when he was the most entertaining
athlete in this country.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter from New York reminded him of that famous picture of
him playing stickball with kids on a street in New York when the
Giants still played there, and what an impact it had on the young
men of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way an athlete could do that today,'' says Mays, who lives
in San Francisco and works part-time for the Giants and Bally's.
``The streets are a little more dangerous. You might get in some
trouble if you tried it now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where exactly did you play stickball with the kids?'' Mays was
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was at 155th and St. Nicholas right near the Polo
Grounds,'' related Mays, shaking his head in fond remembrance.
``The police used to close off the street, and we'd have a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Mays how many more home runs he would hit had he not
played at Candlestick Park, where the wind blew in from left field
and forced Mays to change his batting stance and drive the ball to
the opposite field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I probably would have hit a few more,'' he said. ``But I'm
a guy who never cared about records. What I cared most about was
winning. If I concentrated on hitting just home runs, I'm sure I
could have hit 50 many times. If I concentrated on stealing bases,
I'm sure I could have stole more than 50 many times. But I was
never about numbers. I just cared about winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Mays refused to say anything about Pete Rose other than
extolling his virtues as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a terrific player,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rose later in the day would hold a lively press conference at
Turner Field, reiterating that he was sorry for his past gambling
deeds, saying how passionately he wanted to return to baseball,
saying there was no greater goodwill ambassador of the game than
himself and saying that he hasn't been treated fairly and that even
Charles Manson gets a hearing every year.
</P>
<P>
   Rose understandably commanded the most media attention among the
All Century Team members, but not for an old sports columnist who
remembers what Willie Mays defined.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the baseball scouts I've spoken to say you're the greatest
player they've ever seen,'' I say to Mays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you hear those things,'' he says. ``It's nice. They're
always touting someone as the `next Willie Mays.' They're saying it
about Andruw Jones. Once it was Cesar Cedeno. And then it was Eric
Davis. I'm sure one day one will come along.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so.
</P>
<P>
   But I doubt I'll be around to witness it.

WOULD-BE U.S. CITIZEN FROM MOROCCO SETS MARATHON RECORD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Six years after emigrating from Morocco, Khalid
Khannouchi is chasing the American dream. He has a Web site and a
sport utility vehicle. He hopes to win a gold medal for the United
States in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   If only he were a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi ran the fastest marathon in history on Sunday,
surpassing the old record by 23 seconds.. On a blustery morning, he
blew through a pack of Kenyan champions to win the LaSalle Banks
Chicago Marathon in 2 hours 5 minutes 42 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   A slight 27-year-old, Khannouchi came 3,500 miles from the city
of Meknes to Brooklyn in 1993. He married an American citizen in
1996, but his citizenship application has moved slowly through the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. After he moved to Ossining,
N.Y., his congresswoman, Rep. Sue Kelly, tried without success to
get congressional action in his case.
</P>
<P>
   Without action by the INS or Congress, Khannouchi will not be
able to compete in the U.S. Olympic trials next year. He said he
will not race for Morocco but wants to win a medal for his new
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my dream,'' he said after the race. ``I want to give
something back. I'm so grateful. `Thank you' is nothing. I really
want to do something for the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's resolution was rebuffed by a fellow Republican, Rep.
Lamar Smith of Texas, the chairman of the House Judiciary
Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims. ``It would be unfair,''
Smith wrote, ``to expedite naturalization for someone to allow them
to compete against American citizens for the small amount of slots
on the U.S. Olympic team.''
</P>
<P>
   But without Khannouchi, the United States will have fewer slots
in the marathon. Runners need times under 2:14 to qualify for the
Olympics. Only one U.S. runner has made that time during the
qualifying period. So, unless two other Americans slip under 2:14
by Sept. 11, 2000, Khannouchi would be adding a runner to the team,
not taking someone else's slot.
</P>
<P>
   The first American to break 2:14 did so Sunday in Chicago, and
he set a national record. David Morris, originally of Eagle River,
Alaska, finished a surprising fourth in 2:09:32. His time broke the
American record of 2:09:35 set in Chicago by Jerry Lawson in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Other Americans have run faster than Morris, including Alberto
Salazar in the Boston Marathon and the New York City Marathon and
Bill Rodgers twice in Boston, but their times are not recognized as
records because the courses were too downhill, too windy or too
short.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a perfect day for a marathon: 36 degrees by Lake
Michigan, with a wind of 8 mph. But the field of 30,000 was packed
with world-class runners who came to Chicago for the flat, fast
course and the $400,000 purse. They included Ronaldo da Costa of
Brazil, whose record Khannouchi broke.
</P>
<P>
   The race directors did everything imaginable to get a world
record. They hired three rabbits, runners who run fast
half-marathons before quitting. The pace car displayed not only the
race time but also the finish pace, so the lead runners could see
how close they were to the record.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbits did their jobs, pushing the leaders to a halfway
time of 1:03:00. In the 15th mile, da Costa dropped out. In the
18th mile, Moses Tanui, a Kenyan who has won the Boston Marathon
twice, assumed the lead. Tanui moved 26 seconds ahead, but
Khannouchi did not follow him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took a chance,'' Khannouchi said. ``The point today was to
stay relaxed. It was cold, a little windy. That's not my weather.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first marathon, Khannouchi won in Chicago two years ago
in 2:07:10. It was the fastest debut in history and the
fourth-fastest marathon at that time. Last year, with an injured
heel, he considered quitting but limped to second place.
</P>
<P>
   With three miles to go in this, his third marathon, Khannouchi
began to close quickly on the more experienced Tanui.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think about running a record today,'' he said. ``It
was more important to win. So I just decided to run a very relaxed
first half of the race, not to take any chances and pull away the
last three miles. That was the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   With a mile and a half to go, the pair entered a tunnel by the
lake-front, with Khannouchi three strides in the lead. When they
emerged 30 seconds later, he led by 30 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the point I decided,'' Khannouchi said, ``if I'm going
to get him, I have to move.'' He ran the last 3.1 miles at a pace
of 4:40 a mile.
</P>
<P>
   After chesting the tape, Khannouchi cried and embraced his wife
and coach, Sandra, a 2:42 marathoner and naturalized American
citizen from the Dominican Republic. Then he blew kisses with his
white-gloved hands.
</P>
<P>
   Tanui said that he had confused the distance, thinking the race
was further along when he moved ahead. He finished 33 seconds back,
in 2:06:15, a personal best.
</P>
<P>
   The women's race was closer but not near a record, with two
Kenyans finishing a stride apart. After falling just before the
middle of the race, the defending champion, Joyce Chepchumba, 28,
finished in 2:25:59, just ahead of Margaret Okayo.
</P>
<P>
   Each winner received $65,000, and Khannouchi added $100,000 for
the world record.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday afternoon he had updated his Web site, at
www.khannouchi.com, with a new headline, ``World Record 2:05:42.''

JETS LET A LEAD, A RAIDER AND A SEASON SLIP AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ It got worse for the New York Jets on Sunday,
and it comes at a point in the season when they have time on their
hands. They blew a 20-3 lead, blew a mini-revival by Rick Mirer at
quarterback and all but officially blew their season.
</P>
<P>
   In the final 15{ minutes of the game, the Raiders produced
touchdown drives of 72, 83 and 90 yards to generate a stunning
24-23 victory and drop the Jets to 1-6. The final touchdown came
with 26 seconds remaining. Quarterback Rich Gannon scrambled,
eluded Mo Lewis and drilled a 5-yard touchdown pass to James Jett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I got my arms around him,'' Lewis said. ``But it wasn't
enough. It wasn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But until that moment, a Jets' victory had seemed imminent, and
it appeared to have arrived just in time for Coach Bill Parcells
and his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I have to say it every week _ I thought it couldn't get
any more disappointing,'' Parcells said. ``We collapsed under
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Jets have two weeks off to think about Sunday because
of a bye week, time to wonder if there is something seriously wrong
in the underpinning of a team that had every right to expect a trip
to the Super Bowl only seven Sundays ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now players will be thinking not only about the loss. Some have
been surprised by the news that the wide receivers' coach Todd
Haley has been demoted to assistant and the offensive coordinator
Charlie Weis is taking over Haley's role.
</P>
<P>
   But these types of problems are often magnified in losing.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jets have a lot to magnify at the moment. From the
moment Vinny Testaverde was lost in the opening game, the Jets have
rarely demonstrated a spark on offense.
</P>
<P>
   This latest loss marks the fourth time this season they have
blown a lead in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for much of the game, Mirer (13 of 22, 158 yards) was making
third-down plays and the defense was covering the Raiders' speedy
receivers with clever schemes.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were opportunistic, too, with 13 points from three
turnovers. They got the better of the former Giant, Tyrone
Wheatley, who had found success here in silver and black. Instead,
he was knocked out of the game with a back injury following his
second fumble _ fumbles which had led to 10 Jets points.
</P>
<P>
   This was Mirer's fifth start. And, thanks to his own diving
touchdown and a John Hall field goal, the Jets led by 10-3 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy, though; Mirer seemed almost too pumped up at
first. After a while, however, he began to make plays. He had been
benched after the Monday night loss to the Jaguars, which marked
the second time in four starts he had failed to direct a touchdown
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday he quickly found Keyshawn Johnson to convert a third-down
pass. He also found Wayne Chrebet for a 34-yard pass play.
</P>
<P>
   But often, the Jets dug themselves into a hole on penalties.
They were flagged nine times, with seven accepted. They committed
three in the first quarter, including pass interference by Aaron
Glenn on Jett. Along with a 36-yard scramble by Gannon, it set up a
25-yard field goal by Michael Husted for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, mixing the run and pass well, got solid rushing from
Curtis Martin, a 28-yard reception from Johnson and tied the score
on Hall's 32-yard field goal. Martin went on to produce a 123-yard
game on 26 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' defense now was forcing Gannon to scramble. His
receivers were cloaked by white-jerseyed Jets. Then came the
strange series that led to a Jets' touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   From midfield, Mirer sought a sprinting Dedric Ward near the
goal line. Ward had a step on the defense, but his pass floated so
high and so long that it was easily picked off by cornerback Erie
Allen on the Raiders' 5-yard line. But on the next play, Wheatley
was hit by Jason Ferguson, the ball came loose, and Bryan Cox
recovered on the 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets immediately deployed five receivers. First, though, the
Raiders asked for a review of the Wheatley fumble. The call stood
and Mirer got back in formation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of passing, though, he took the ball and ran straight up
the middle. At the 2, he dived over the goal line for the touchdown
and a 10-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Dwight Stone, who hadn't carried the ball
since 1995, produced the Jets' longest run of the season, 36 yards.
Martin ran and caught the ball for 51 yards on the drive. Finally,
Eric Green, who had two catches for 5 yards all season, caught
another short one _ but it was a 2-yard pass from Mirer that was
good for a touchdown and a 17-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Again the Raiders began a drive that was ended by a Wheatley
fumble caused by Roman Phifer and recovered by Victor Green.
</P>
<P>
   The tackle also knocked Wheatley out of the game. He had been
the Raiders' leading rusher, but had totaled only 18 yards on eight
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley's fumble led to a 37-yard field goal by Hall. The Jets,
for only the third time this year, had produced 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders, who haven't been going deep, were forced to. So
Gannon found Tim Brown, who beat Glenn for 45-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   And then in the final period, they mounted a powerful 83-yard,
11-play drive capped by Zack Crockett's 3-yard run. The Jets lead
fell to 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn, the Pro Bowl cornerback, intercepted Gannon near
midfield on the next Raiders' drive. It set up another field goal
as the Jets took a 23-17 edge. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Maria Ley Piscator, a theater arts teacher and director and the
widow of the theatrical director Erwin Piscator, died on Oct. 14 at
the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in Manhattan. She was
101.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Vienna, Ms. Piscator began her theatrical career as a
dancer in Berlin and Paris and later turned to choreography. She
helped stage several productions with Max Reinhardt, including his
renowned production of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   She met Piscator, her third husband, in 1936 while studying for
a doctorate in literature at the Sorbonne. The two immigrated to
the United States and founded the Dramatic Workshop at the New
School for Social Research in Manhattan. Their students included
Stella Adler, Harry Belafonte, Marlon Brando, Tony Randall and
Anthony Franciosa.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Piscator also directed theatrical productions off-Broadway
and in Europe and was the director and founder of small theater
programs in New York for the elderly, children and others. Her
teaching also included work in the 1970s at the University of
Southern Illinois at Carbondale and at the State University of New
York at Stony Brook. She began working with the Elysium Theater
Company of Munich in the 1980s and in 1993 became the honorary
artistic director of Elysium _ Between Two Continents, a
Munich-based organization devoted to cultural exchange between the
United State and Europe, particularly Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Piscator wrote books including ``The Piscator Experiment:
The Political Theater,'' which was published by James H. Heineman
in 1967, a year after her husband's death. Her autobiography,
``Mirror People,'' was published in 1989.

   In the 16th and 17th centuries, when the riches and power of the
Netherlands put the country at the forefront of the Western world,
its great artists turned their talents to ``stilleven,'' or ``not
moving materials,'' known in English as still lifes.
</P>
<P>
   Vibrant flowers, tantalizing fruit and sumptuous banquets,
sometimes rendered in almost microscopic detail, became the
subjects of artists like Rembrandt, Samuel van Hoogstraten and
Joseph de Bray.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Sunday, 70 of these paintings are to go on view at
the Cleveland Museum of Art in ``Still-Life Paintings From the
Netherlands, 1550-1720.'' Assembled from more than 50 museums and
private collections, the exhibition will continue through Jan. 9.

   Masters' Touch
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the late 15th century, many of the best artists of
Germany and Switzerland expressed themselves most powerfully and
completely through their drawings.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday nearly 200 master drawings and watercolors by these
artists went on display in the West Building of the National
Gallery of Art in Washington. ``From Schongauer to Holbein: Master
Drawings From Basel and Berlin,'' reflecting the artists'
development, style and variety of subject, also includes works by
artists like Albrecht Duerer and Lucas Cranach the Elder. It runs
through Jan. 9. Information: (202) 737-4215.

ROBERT BLANCHON, 34, CONCEPTUAL ARTIST 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Blanchon, a conceptual and video artist whose work often
dealt with the subject of gay identity and AIDS, died on Oct. 4 in
Chicago. He was 34 and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from AIDS, said the artist Mary
Ellen Carroll, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchon, born in Boston, studied at the Art Institute of
Chicago. In 1990 he was among dozens of artists who created public
billboards for the Art Against AIDS project in Chicago. His work
was often notable for its sardonic wit, although his best-known
piece was deeply personal: it combined a letter from Blanchon to
his family telling them he was HIV-positive with their long
response. His most recent work dealt in more abstract ways with
themes of love and isolation.
</P>
<P>
   He had three solo New York exhibitions: at White Columns in
Manhattan and at Moment Art in Brooklyn, both in 1995, and at
Artists Space in Manhattan in 1994. He was included in numerous
group shows, including ``Disappearing Acts'' at Bound and Bound and
Leslie Tonkonow galleries in 1998 and ``Living Testament of the
Blood Fairies'' at Artists Space in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchon taught at the University of California at Irvine and at
the California Institute of the Arts. In 1998 he was a visiting
scholar at the the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He
was scheduled to teach at the Art Institute of Chicago this fall.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his parents, Lorraine and John Blanchon of
Foxboro and Martha's Vineyard, Mass.; a sister, Bonnie McGrath of
Tyngsboro, Mass.; a brother, Donald, of Washington, and an aunt,
Mary P. Blanchon of Belmont, Mass.

INEXPLICABLY, VIKINGS LOOK LIKE GEORGE'S TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The oddness of this strange, quirky season, in
which the traditionally good teams are bad and the bad teams are
good, crystallized perfectly at the Metrodome on Sunday. This
simple statement sums it all up: Quarterback Jeff George saved the
Minnesota Vikings from falling into the abyss by leading his team
past San Francisco, 40-16.
</P>
<P>
   There are head coaches who would rather eat their playbooks than
accept that George is capable of saving any team. He is known as
selfish, arrogant and, oh yeah, ditzy. Especially ditzy.
</P>
<P>
   But talented is a word that also describes George, mainly
because he can flick a pass on a dime 50 yards with little effort.
That arm strength helped to put a little cockiness back into the
Vikings' offensive step, something that had been missing all season
with Randall Cunningham as the starter.
</P>
<P>
   How long their success will last is unknown. Even though the
Vikings' 40 points was the most they have scored this season (their
previous high was 23 against Detroit) it was against the 49ers, who
have the league's 30th-ranked defense. Still, Minnesota, thanks to
George, may be at the beginning of a serious run that would put
them back in playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way our offense is supposed to be,'' said wide
receiver Randy Moss, who had only one catch for 24 yards because of
the 49ers' double- and triple-teaming. ``It's just a start, but it
was good. The last couple of weeks, we've struggled.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers were the cure. That team no longer resembles the
proud, brilliant franchise that dominated football over the past
two decades. Instead, they are a confused, aging and injury-riddled
group. Minnesota totaled 395 yards, averaged 6.6 yards a play and
outhustled the 49ers, part of the reason why San Francisco had 15
penalties for 104 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings were able to pick on San Francisco's secondary,
maybe the most porous in the league. The 49ers concentrated on
stopping Moss, but unlike in the recent past, the Vikings were able
to take advantage of that single-mindedness. Cris Carter (7 catches
for 84 yards), Jake Reed (3 for 42) and Matthew Hatchette (2 for
88) combined for 12 catches for 214 yards and 2 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   This is where George is more effective than Cunningham. George
is better at finding where a speedy receiver is single-covered.
Sometimes the coaches often literally told Cunningham where to
throw the ball before the play.
</P>
<P>
   That difference was apparent in the second quarter. Minnesota
trailed, 10-7, after a Leroy Hoard fumble was returned 71 yards for
a touchdown by San Francisco cornerback Darnell Walker. On the
first play of the Vikings' next offensive series, George saw
immediately that Hatchette was single-covered by Walker on the left
sideline. He let Hatchette outrun Walker and threw a deep strike
for an 80-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it was a perfect throw,'' Green said. ``It was,
`run with the safety.' And no one had help because they were
working to stop plays towards Randy's side. It was a perfect strike
right down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter Wade Richey made a 26-yard field goal to
pull the 49ers to 24-16. But George, working mostly from the
shotgun, again picked apart the secondary. The final play of that
drive was a 9-yard run up the gut by Moe Williams, who scored
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Many 49ers were puzzled to explain how they stumbled into their
troubling 3-4 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never dealt with a situation like this,'' said Jerry
Rice, the all-universe receiver, ``but I think if we were able to
come out of this it will make everything even sweeter, going
through all of this and still somehow finding a way to win and make
the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings are thinking the exact same thing. Only now, with
the strong-armed George at quarterback, they have a much more
realistic chance of doing it. &QL;

FISHER CONTENT WITH ROLE IN NEW OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKERSFIELD, Calif. _ It seems this short message isn't getting
through to Derek Fisher, not that he hasn't heard the refrain
enough.
</P>
<P>
   People keep saying how new Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson
likes to have tall guards on the floor in his vaunted triangle
offense, particularly in the starting lineup. Fisher stretches in
at 6-foot-1.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher knows Jackson also used plenty of smaller guards
while in Chicago _ guys like B.J. Armstrong, Steve Kerr and John
Paxon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys made huge contributions,'' Fisher said. ``The only
thing you can control is your play. You can't really get into who
the coach is going to play, who he likes. You definitely have to do
what the coach wants on the floor, but don't worry so much about
who they want you to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go out there and play and have confidence in yourself. That's
what I've been trying to concentrate on. I can't grow to 6-4 all of
a sudden.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher believes the new offense might actually be helping his
play. Certainly, he looked like he belonged Sunday afternoon in the
Lakers' 97-79 exhibition victory over the Miami Heat at the
Centennial Garden. In 23 minutes, he contributed 13 points, five
rebounds, two assists and two steals.
</P>
<P>
   With the trade of Nick Van Exel last season, Fisher was expected
to give the Lakers leadership at point guard in just his third
season. And often, Fisher looked like a young player trying to
provide leadership. But as the 1999-2000 season opener draws near,
Fisher looks like a guard playing more naturally. Fisher credits
simply being more comfortable as a player and running a
team-orientated offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't give us a lot of rules or say, `You can shoot, you
can't shoot, we want to give this guy the ball more than you,''' he
said. ``It's an offense where everybody shares the basketball and
the guy who is open can take the shot. It's really done wonders for
me as far as my confidence level.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, I always felt like there was a glass ceiling over
what the coaches wanted me to do out on the floor. My priorities
were to allow everybody else to play, then if I get a chance, then
play. Now I feel like the coaches are OK with me going out and
displaying my abilities within the framework of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Tex Winter said the Lakers won't restrict Fisher
because of his size.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what Derek is,'' Winter said. ``He's a fine NBA guard,
but he's certainly not the exceptional guard at this point. He'll
be a great complementary player for us. We're not worried about
him. He'll fit in very nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Forward Robert Horry sat out Sunday's game with his sore
left knee and is expected to miss exhibition games tonight in
Albuquerque and Tuesday in Las Vegas. Horry, bothered by tendinitis
in both knees, said he felt the knee lock up in Friday's game
against the Suns. It's the same knee Horry injured three years ago
when he first came to the Lakers. Said Horry: ``It's never really
been the same since. It's a lot looser than it's supposed to be.''
Jackson said it was not serious: ``I've been assured he'll be
fine.'' ... Shaquille O'Neal, always up for going against Alonzo
Mourning, led the Lakers with 14 points and 12 rebounds.

EDITORIAL: MODERNIZING MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 25:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Finance Committee voted last week to put off
consideration of legislative measures that would give Medicare the
same tools that private health insurers commonly use to control
costs and the quality of care. That probably means that debate on
this crucial issue will be delayed to next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had proposed a comprehensive plan to
improve Medicare, including a new prescription-drug benefit. Unless
Congress acts, Medicare will not have the flexibility to create new
choices of coverage for beneficiaries that will help reduce costs,
for them and for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, Congress greatly expanded
the ability of Medicare enrollees to join health maintenance
organizations. In three years the number of beneficiaries in HMOs
has doubled, to 7 million _ about 18 percent of the entire Medicare
population _ largely because HMOs can offer lower deductibles and
co-payments, more preventive care and drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Medicare still functions under the traditional
fee-for-service approach that is rapidly disappearing in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of Medicare HMOs has been a significant step
forward in modernizing the program. But up to now, Medicare has not
been able to offer beneficiaries much access to preferred provider
networks, the dominant form of managed care now in the private
marketplace. These networks, usually called preferred provider
organizations, or PPOs, have become so popular that they surpass
HMOs in number of enrollees.
</P>
<P>
   PPOs are less restrictive than HMOs because they typically
eliminate gatekeeping functions that prevent patients from seeing
specialists and generally allow patients to see doctors outside the
network for a higher fee. PPOs control costs by negotiating lower
fees with doctors who want to be part of the PPO panel and
selecting doctors who have a record of providing good-quality,
cost-effective care.
</P>
<P>
   Patients gain by paying lower out-of-pocket costs if they choose
a preferred provider. With the private sector moving to this
managed-care hybrid, Medicare enrollees should be allowed the same
cost-saving option.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also wants to offer special payment rates to
competitively selected hospitals that have demonstrated expertise
in complex medical procedures. Beneficiaries would not have to go
to these centers, but they could be offered lower cost-sharing and
other benefits if they do. The designated centers would benefit by
being able to increase their market share in certain procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Other measures would increase Medicare's use of competitive
bidding in purchasing goods and services, and establish a voluntary
case management plan for beneficiaries in fee-for-service Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and hospital groups are nervous about giving Medicare
any ability to pick and choose among providers. But ultimately,
these strategies will give patients new incentive to select
cost-effective care. The private sector has adopted these
approaches. It is time that Medicare caught up.

CHILD-CARE FUNDS GOING UNSPENT IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ When New York state's new budget was passed in
August, it appeared to throw an $800 million lifeline to New York's
low- and moderate-income parents, roughly doubling the amount of
money previously available to them to pay for child care.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, anyway, that money is no more than a promise. Tens
of thousands of New Yorkers who need subsidized child care are
unable to find it, advocates for the poor say, and providers of
such services have long waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
   More state money, the advocates contend, will make little
difference as long as there are too few places to spend it in.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, though, the state has no detailed plan for getting
the new money into the hands of low- and moderate-income parents.
Instead, it will simply give the money to local governments,
leaving crucial details, like deciding who is eligible for the
money, to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are glad to have the additional money, we are very
concerned that parents who need help with the cost of child care
may never get it,'' said David Hunt, executive director of the New
York State Child Care Coordinating Council. ``There's all this
money, but it doesn't appear to be getting into the hands of
parents who need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in fact, under a far smaller program to give
child-care subsidies to parents, the state was unable to spend much
of the money that it had devoted to that purpose. To date, roughly
$75 million remains from last year's $406 million allocation for
child care, state officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The state's inability to spend its child-care money is
apparently not a result of a lack of need. A recent study by the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that 82 percent
of the New York families eligible for government-subsidized child
care were not receiving it. Nationally, the figure was even higher.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason that the money has not been spent in New York,
advocates for the poor and some government officials agree, is that
there are not nearly enough day-care providers to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
   New York City was one of the few localities to spend all of its
allocation _ more than half the statewide total of child-care money
_ in the last fiscal year, yet even there, day-care providers had
waiting lists totaling between 35,000 and 40,000 people, according
to public and private estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The severe shortage of licensed day-care slots in New York,
experts say, is aggravated by efforts undertaken by local
governments, most notably New York City, to require parents on
welfare, most of them single mothers, to work for their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The office of the state comptroller, Carl McCall, has estimated
that an additional 109,000 children will need day care by 2001,
largely as a result of workfare.
</P>
<P>
   There are other causes for the state's failure to spend the
money. The advocates say many local governments have not focused on
the issue, grappling instead with other pressing and complicated
aspects of the continuing national effort to overhaul the welfare
system, like reducing the public assistance rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates go so far as to say that many counties do not
care about providing day care. Just as important, though, many poor
families are unaware that subsidized day care is available to them.
</P>
<P>
   Parents now receive subsidized day care in two ways.
</P>
<P>
   The most common is to have their children placed in day-care
programs that receive direct government payments.
</P>
<P>
   The other method involves parents receiving vouchers, which they
then give to providers as payment. Depending on local guidelines,
eligible providers can range from state-licensed centers to
relatives, neighbors and baby sitters, as long as they meet minimal
health and safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to gauge the disparity between supply and demand
in New York's child-care system with complete certainty. In part,
that is because no one agency keeps track of how many people
actually need affordable child care, or how many providers of the
service exist, experts on child care say.
</P>
<P>
   But this much is known: About 881,000 children are eligible for
subsidized child care in New York under the federal eligibility
guidelines, though only 158,000 children, or 18 percent, receive
such care. The number of children eligible under the state's
eligibility standards, which are stricter than federal standards,
is 631,000, meaning that about 25 percent are actually receiving
subsidized care.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, large numbers of children are not getting the
subsidies they are eligible to receive, child-care experts say.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the same time, only 485,000 day-care slots are being provided
by state-licensed operators. While they acknowledge New York's
shortage of licensed day-care slots, some state officials say the
gap is being filled by informal providers of child care, like
relatives and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But even these officials concede that they have no idea how many
informal providers operate in the state. Just as important,
advocates say informal providers are often unreliable and cannot
take the place of professionally licensed child-care operators.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some state officials assert that it is not the
state's obligation to build and operate day-care slots. Rather,
they say that the state should provide subsidies to people who need
them and that this in turn will create a demand for child care that
providers will try to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Terry McGrath, a spokesman for the state's Office of Children
and Family Services, pointed out that state expenditures on
child-care subsidies have increased to roughly $800 million this
year from $269 million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, he said, the number of children in
government-subsidized child care has risen to 138,000 this year
from 76,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath noted that the money allocated this year should provide
subsidies for an additional 40,000 children.

SIGMUND DIAMOND, PROFESSOR WHO INVESTIGATED THE FBI, DIES AT 79
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Fla., Md.)  (jw) 
 By ERIC PACE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sigmund Diamond, a Columbia professor of sociology and history
who studied American business titans, female industrial workers and
FBI information gathering, died on Oct. 14 in Norwich, Conn. He was
79 and lived in Salem, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was esophageal cancer, said his wife, Shirley.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond began his career at Columbia in 1955 and retired in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Compromised Campus: The Collaboration of
Universities With the Intelligence Community, 1945-1955,'' Diamond
wrote about the FBI's attempt to gather information from university
employees. In The New York Times Book Review, Herbert Mitgang wrote
that the book asserted that for at least 10 years after World War
II, J. Edgar Hoover's agents ``enlisted administrators and
professors and planted them as subagents in place.'' Diamond said
in the book that those university officials and teachers were
prepared to give the FBI information on coworkers they thought were
disloyal to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In his earlier book, ``Reputation of the American Businessman,''
published in 1955, Diamond chronicled titans like John Jacob Astor,
Cornelius Vanderbilt, J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond worked for the United Auto Workers during the 1940s,
compiling reports about women who worked during the war and what
happened to them after it ended. The report found that by early
1945, women who had been laid off were having trouble returning to
work, partly because of prejudice. While he a UAW staff member,
Diamond advocated that women get equal pay for equal work.
</P>
<P>
   During his time at Columbia, Diamond founded and headed the
history department's social history program and was a consultant
for an American Jewish Committee oral history project about the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond was born in Baltimore and received a bachelor's degree
from Johns Hopkins University in 1940 and a doctorate in American
history from Harvard in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   He said he suffered for his political beliefs before teaching at
Columbia. According to a 1977 article in Newsweek, he said he had
been a Communist Party member from 1941 to 1950. After leaving the
party, he said, he was turned down for a job as a part-time
lecturer in history at Harvard because he had refused, under
pressure from McGeorge Bundy, who was then a Harvard dean, to
identify other former party members.
</P>
<P>
   Bundy said in 1977 that he had opposed hiring Diamond partly
because he thought that Harvard's governing board ``would not want
an ex-Communist with these attitudes in any administrative job.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Diamond is survived by a daughter,
Betty Ann Diamond of the Bronx; a son, Stephen, of Coral Gables,
Fla.; four granddaughters, and two brothers, William of Washington
and Alvin of Baltimore.

WOODS FIRST IN 19 YEARS TO ACHIEVE 6 TOUR VICTORIES IN YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Instead of being spoiled by success,
Tiger Woods seems motivated by it.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell Saturday night after the third round of the
National Carl Rental Golf Classic, Woods was on the driving range
hitting golf balls until he could no longer see where they landed.
He remains hungry, driven to improve, driven to win, despite being
the world's No. 1-ranked player.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how much better Woods can get, how much
more distance he can put between himself and his peers. But Sunday
he added another victory to his growing collection, finding a way
to win when he was not at the top of his game. He became the first
player to win six times in a season on the PGA Tour since Tom
Watson won six times in 1980. And at age 23, the best for Woods may
be yet to come, a chilling thought for the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming early troubles and avoiding mistakes on the back
nine, Woods held on to win at Walt Disney World Resort by one
stroke over Ernie Els, who shot a 71 Sunday. Woods shot a
one-over-par 73 Sunday to finish 17 under par for the tournament at
271. Three strokes behind Woods were Bob Tway and Franklin Langham,
who tied for third.
</P>
<P>
   Woods continued a remarkable year _ he has won seven times
worldwide, including once in Germany _ that some of his peers are
having difficulty putting into context. After challenging Woods,
but failing to beat him, Els did not bite his tongue when asked to
evaluate Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is 23 years old, and he's already this good,'' said
Els, a two-time United States Open winner. ``There can't be anybody
in the world who hits the ball that pure. It's unbelievably long
and straight. Nobody can touch this guy at the moment. He has gone
to a level where I don't think the rest of us can really find right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods earned $450,000 Sunday to surpass $4.71 million for the
season, a tour record. He is almost $1.2 million ahead of David
Duval, who is No. 2 on the money list. And with next week's Tour
Championship and the World Golf Championship event in Spain left to
play, Woods could become the first player in tour history to
surpass $5 million or $6 million in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has won six times in his last nine starts, including the
PGA Championship. By refining his swing and improving his short
game, Woods has matured into a player who can win with power, with
finesse or with his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Is Woods anywhere near his peak? He would rather not think in
those terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to put any kind of limit to where I think I can
go,'' said Woods, who has won 13 times on the tour in 68 starts.
``I believe I can win golf tournaments. I take a lot of pride in
what I do. I love to practice more than I like to play. It's hard
to get complacent when you love to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Woods and the rest of the field faced a challenging
Magnolia Course with greens much firmer than they had been during
the first three days of the tournament. Starting the day tied with
Tway at 18 under par, Woods fell two strokes behind with three-putt
bogeys at Nos. 6 and
</P>
<P>
   ``The greens were just incredibly fast,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods adjusted. He made a 10-foot birdie putt at No. 10 to
get within one stroke of Tway, then hit a beautiful 9-iron approach
shot at No. 11 within 3 feet of the hole, setting up another birdie
to tie Tway.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tway self-destructed with a triple-bogey at the par-3 No.
12, hitting his tee shot into the water and his second tee shot
into a bunker. That left Els, playing a group ahead of Woods, as
the last pursuer with a realistic chance to win. But Els made two
crucial mistakes at No.s 14 and 17. Tied with Woods at 18 under
par, Els bogeyed No. 14 after hitting a terrible 5-iron shot into
the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the worst swing of the year there,'' Els said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods made another three-putt bogey at No. 14 to fall back into
a tie with Els, but Els bogeyed the par-4 No. 17 after hitting his
second shot onto the worst possible part of the green, the left
side. He was left with a 35-foot putt straight downhill that was
impossible to stop close to the hole if he missed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was done when I was lining up my putt, `' Els said.
``I was going to three-putt.'
</P>
<P>
   Els was right. His first putt raced 12 feet past the hole, and
then he missed the uphill putt that would have saved par. The bogey
gave Woods his one-stroke lead again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great year,'' Woods said. ``When I was in junior
golf, I thought I could never love the game as much as I did then.
But I can honestly say I love it more.'' &QL;

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is very little
difference between Penn State (No. 1) and Florida State (2), but
the difference between Kansas State (5) and Florida (6) is somewhat
larger.
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative records and average margin of victory of each
team's opponents do not include games against the ranked team.

BELMONT REPORTS DECLINES IN ATTENDANCE AND WAGERING 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Belmont Park ran its final races of the season
Sunday before giving way to Aqueduct for the next six and a half
months, and reported that its average attendance for the 32-day
autumn meeting had dropped by 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The final Belmont meeting produced mixed results, somewhat in
keeping with the trends in recent racing. Attendance dropped to an
average of 6,757 a day, but the total betting handle rose by 14.6
percent, to an average of $10.3 million a day, for the 32 days
since Saratoga ended its summertime run and the horses returned to
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   One day of racing was lost because of Tropical Storm Floyd, but
the betting totals probably reflected the spread of simulcast
betting to and from other outlets. However, on-track betting
slipped with the attendance by 3.3 percent, to an average of $1.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with the total handle,'' said Terry
Meyocks, president of the New York Racing Association. ``Meanwhile,
we would have hoped for a better meet on track, so naturally we're
disappointed. But with the weather not on our side, it took its
toll. Also, when you add in all the competition for the attention
of the New York sports fan this fall, it makes it even more
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't let a 32-day period dampen our enthusiasm. We've been
very fortunate, and the weather was on our side this year until
now. We had a very high-quality stakes program this fall, and
hopefully a lot of the horses that competed in this year's fall
championship meet will do well in the Breeders' Cup and in Eclipse
award balloting.''
</P>
<P>
   For the short autumn season at Belmont, the leading jockey was
Jorge Chavez and the leading trainer was John Kimmel.
</P>
<P>
   Belmont gave a dramatic farewell with a pair of $100,000 stakes
on the turf for 2-year-old horses. In the Miss Grillo Stakes, Gary
Contessa's Wolf Alert outdueled Windsong by the length of her nose
with Jerry Bailey riding. In the Pilgrim, it was John Campo Jr.'s
29-1 long shot Kachemak Bay, with John Velazquez riding, running
down Bailey and the favored King Cugat in the final strides.
</P>
<P>
   New York racing will be staged at the Aqueduct track starting
Wednesday at 12:30 p.m. and carrying on until Belmont opens next
May. This will be the 40th anniversary of racing at Aqueduct, and
the track will mark some history of its own with an opening-day
feature, the Discovery Handicap, a race that was won during its
eventful past by superstars such as Kelso and Forego.
</P>
<P>
   The fall portion of the Aqueduct meeting will run through Dec.
31, with no racing generally on Mondays and Tuesdays. The track was
originally built in 1894 but was reopened in 1959 before a crowd of
42,473. The most noticeable improvement installed since last spring
is a $4 million paddock, which replaces the old underground
facility and gives fans a clear view of the horses as they are
being saddled. &QL;

COMMENTARY: AMERICA FINDS DEMOCRACY A DIFFICULT EXPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TINA ROSENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the many effects of democracy's spread through much of the
developing world in the last few decades is the birth of a new
American industry, democracy promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the early 1990s, Washington began a wide variety of
programs worldwide to help Third World countries democratize,
including training election observers, improving parliamentary
libraries, cajoling political parties to form coalitions, teaching
citizens' groups how to lobby and helping independent newspapers
write business plans. Last year the American government spent $719
million on these efforts.
</P>
<P>
   While democracy has given rise to democracy promotion, the
reverse is less clear. There has been no systematic effort to find
out what programs actually aid democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists mainly focus on scandals or feel-good stories of
democratic triumph. Groups that do democracy promotion, mainly the
Agency for International Development, must wrest funding from a
hostile Congress every year and are under pressure to report quick
success. Evaluation is also complicated because many factors affect
political development _ and few agree on how to measure democracy
or even what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Carothers' forthcoming book, ``Aiding Democracy Abroad:
The Learning Curve,'' seeks to draw some general conclusions about
what works.
</P>
<P>
   Carothers, now vice president for global policy at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace in Washington, has worked in
democracy programs in various countries. His book is a clear-eyed
examination of attempts to reform legislatures, courts and
political parties, and new efforts to promote democracy from the
bottom up by helping local governments and civil society. He
focuses on how these programs have worked in Romania, Guatemala,
Zambia and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   Carothers' conclusion is that democracy promotion cannot make
the difference. No American democracy consultant can affect the
underlying conditions of a country that really determine its
democratic progress _ concentrations of power and wealth, political
traditions, the expectations of citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But the right programs over the long term, he says, can do much
in countries where a government genuinely wants democracy but lacks
expertise _ nations such as South Africa, Slovakia or Chile. In
dictatorships, aid to the besieged opposition can keep hope alive.
</P>
<P>
   But in nations that enjoyed some democratic progress but fell
into strongman rule _ such as Peru, Haiti, Cambodia, Kazakhstan or
Zambia _ classic democracy promotion efforts to reform government
institutions have been thwarted by leaders who have little interest
in sharing power.
</P>
<P>
   Few veterans of the business would dispute these fairly
straightforward conclusions. The democracy promoters at AID, and at
the political-party-run National Democratic Institute and
International Republican Institute, are learning from their early
mistakes. Hubris was one of them. Being American was once deemed
synonymous with possessing expertise in democracy, and many
consultants were campaign aides or congressional staff people who
knew little about the countries they visited.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy promoters are also changing their earlier tendency to
dictate precooked solutions that do not fit reality. And even when
Americans came in with good ideas, the lack of local input often
kept them from being embraced and sustained.
</P>
<P>
   A more persistent problem is the tendency to emphasize form over
substance. Democracy programs have largely helped foreign countries
replicate certain practices _ congressional hearings, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Carothers believes, activists are beginning to see that
these forms of democracy are easily manipulated by autocratic
leaders, and that governments reform only when they want to. In
Guatemala, he writes, a 10-year American effort to train the police
did not limit police abuses. What did work was the election of new
leaders, who pressed the security forces to reduce brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Carothers writes, democracy promoters try to be more
attuned to the political realities of the countries they work in.
This understanding has not yet meant the abandonment of unrealistic
efforts to work with authoritarian governments.
</P>
<P>
   But where governments resist reform, American consultants now
try to strengthen democratic forces by boosting grass-roots groups,
local governments and women's organizations. Americans increasingly
stay for months or years of intensive work rather than a few days.
In many places American organizations use regional experts, sending
Filipinos to Indonesia or Poles to Bulgaria _ people who are often
better received and know more about local realities.
</P>
<P>
   What critics of democracy promotion often overlook is that the
industry's mistakes have exactly mirrored the problems that bedevil
American foreign policy in general, including hubris and the
tendency to confuse surface reforms with deep-seated change.
Democracy activists, moreover, seem to have learned more rapidly
from their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the Pentagon still believe that foreign officers will
become less abusive if they rub elbows with the American
citizen-soldier, and many in the administration and Congress argue
that Myanmar's or China's dictatorships will soften if exposed to
American business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Few democracy activists today, by contrast, are naive enough to
think that a tour of America will instill democratic values. The
industry has carried out its share of useless programs. But it is
learning _ and faster than its congressional critics, who still
fail to realize that building democracy in many developing nations
is both crucial to American interests and resistant to instant
solutions.

SPORTS COLUMN: DADGUM IT, FLORIDA STATE STILL STRUGGLES WITH
WARRICK 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEMSON, S.C. _ Who would have thought that the man who has
returned the expression ``dadgum'' back to metropolitan sports
pages and national airwaves would believe in something as cosmic as
karma? But there was Bobby Bowden, a homey 69-year-old, suggesting
just that after a milestone 300th victory captured in a historic
coaching confrontation with his second son, Tommy.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bowden didn't invoke it to explain how his Florida State
team outlasted Clemson by 17-14 Saturday night. Or why his son, of
all people, ended up on the opposite sideline on the night he was
trying to join Joe Paterno, Bear Bryant, Amos Alonzo Stagg and Pop
Warner in the record books.
</P>
<P>
   No, Bowden reached for the notion of
what-goes-around-comes-around justice to describe the performance
of his prodigal wide receiver, Peter Warrick. The senior rejoined
the Seminoles here Saturday after a two-week suspension that was
lifted when he pleaded to a misdemeanor count of petty theft on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks, the team had been caught up in a saga that
began with Warrick's felony charge for accepting an illegal
discount on designer clothes _ getting more than $400 worth of
clothes for $21.40 _ and ended with Warrick, the president of the
university, a state legislator and countless Florida State fans
looking, well, foolish.
</P>
<P>
   The whole mess detracted from the Bowden family's big night and
the family patriarch appeared to understand that. He wasn't bitter.
He acknowledged that the distractions of the Warrick situation
spilled over to his star receiver's performance and he was was not
that sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick caught 11 passes for 121 yards, but dropped a couple of
big ones and seemed rattled by the boos and ``jailbird'' chants
that followed him throughout the game. Bowden said flatly that
Warrick dropped some passes that could have won the game earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen Pete play like that since he was a freshman,
and maybe that is the way it should be,'' Bowden said, tipping his
hat to karma.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick wasn't talking afterward. Bowden put the blame squarely
on Warrick. But from the beginning, Bowden said he believed that
this was a minor offense and he wanted Warrick back on the field.
When it first broke, he said he ``was praying for a misdemeanor''
settlement. When he got it on Friday, the coach called it ``a
miracle from above.'' On Saturday, he proclaimed the settlement _
which includes one year probation, 300 hours of community service,
$579 in restitution and $295 in court costs _ was fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got drug addicts that we let out of jail,'' Bowden said.
``The kid is trying to get an education. He's going to dadgum
graduate and some want to hang him. I say you punish him and let
him go become a citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   But that message was terribly diluted by the uproar that
preceded the settlement in Florida last week. It began with
Warrick's lawyer, John Kenny, offering state attorneys a deal (not
a very good one for his client) where the receiver would serve jail
time in the spring in exchange for a reduced charge.
</P>
<P>
   When Florida State University President Talbot ``Sandy''
D'Alemberte said he would not allow Warrick to rejoin the team now
and serve time later, there was an outcry from some boosters and
alumni _ including state Sen. Jim King who sent a letter to the
university president criticizing his handling of the Warrick
matter.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alemberte cut short a trip to Barbados and, on his return, was
reportedly the target of 600 e-mails, many of them hostile and
accusing him of everything from grandstanding to embarrassing the
athletic department. To counter charges that he failed to
communicate the university's policy to the athletic department, he
released a copy of an Oct. 11 e-mail to Athletic Director Dave
Hart.
</P>
<P>
   In it D'Alemberte wrote: ``Please caution Bobby about raising
expectations too high for Peter Warrick's return. I have an open
mind but I am inclined to think that Warrick must not only
negotiate a plea bargain but also get all contact with the criminal
justice system behind him (including any community service or other
sentence handed down).''
</P>
<P>
   Still, on Saturday, Warrick was back as a starter, guilty of a
misdemeanor and facing community service in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Those aren't exactly the ideal circumstances for a proud
institution of higher education or an accomplished coach to salute
a successful football program or celebrate an impressive career
milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, the season's first Bowl Championship Series ranking
will be released and Florida State (8-0, No. 2 behind Penn State in
the New York Times computer ranking and No. 1 in the ESPN/USA Today
and Associated Press polls) will likely hold the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS rankings factor in the news media and coaches' polls,
eight computer rankings (including The New York Times') and
strength of schedule to come up with the Nos. 1 and 2 teams to
ensure that they play each other in the national title game in the
Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking does not matter until the end of the season when the
nation's two best teams will show themselves. But with four games
left and his team not playing well, coach Bowden has got plenty of
reasons to be aware of that dadgum karma. &QL;

CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR'S FUND-RAISERS SCRUTINIZED
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MIKE ALLEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ They were the nation's youngest governor and
the nation's youngest state treasurer, glad-handing contributors
eager to be associated with a popular administration.
</P>
<P>
   At fund-raising receptions in New York and the posh suburbs of
Hartford as he geared up for last year's re-election race, Gov.
John Rowland of Connecticut sipped drinks and shook hands with
representatives of funds that had just received _ or were about to
receive _ investments of state pension money.
</P>
<P>
   The receptions seemed routine at the time, but they are now
being scrutinized by federal and state investigators. The parties
were organized by Paul Silvester, whom Rowland appointed as state
treasurer when the incumbent resigned. Silvester pleaded guilty
last month to racketeering and money laundering during his 17
months in office.
</P>
<P>
   Silvester, 37, who left office in January after losing an
election and now faces up to six years in prison, admitted cooking
up an ambitious scheme to enrich himself, his relatives and his
friends through the placement of state pension funds, and is now
freely talking to investigators about who else was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, 42, said he knew almost nothing about the fund-raisers
and who was giving them. He has adamantly denied any wrongdoing and
has said that Silvester betrayed him just as he betrayed the other
citizens of the state.
</P>
<P>
   But as what is likely to be a long, ugly scandal begins to play
out, the overriding question is whether prosecutors have built a
tight case against one greedy former officeholder, or whether they
have found the thread that could unravel the state's political
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   No one has more on the line than Rowland, who was Silvester's
political patron. It remains unclear whether the investigation will
find that Rowland did anything illegal as he engaged in the
aggressive fund raising that is now being closely scrutinized. But
at the least, the governor runs the risk of his administration's
being darkened _ and perhaps defined _ by scandal, and his judgment
is sure to be called into question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Connecticut has remnants of old machine politics, but it was
always done with a wink and a nod, with self-imposed limits,'' said
Scott McLean, a political science professor at Quinnipiac College.
``This was on a grand scale, with rich New Yorkers helping to
manipulate state investments. Whether he personally did anything
wrong or not, the rest of Rowland's term is going to be a
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a plea bargain, Silvester was to receive four to six years
in prison. But his sentencing was not set until March 20, and
prosecutors said he could reduce his sentence by giving information
about other possible crimes. Lawyers involved in the investigation
said Silvester had provided voluminous information about possible
illegal activity by politicians in both parties, several of whom
were showered with ``finders' fees'' that Silvester demanded in
return for investment of state pension money.
</P>
<P>
   Silvester has contended that lobbyists acting as intermediaries
for Rowland pressured him to invest more than $100 million with
fund managers who had promised payments to allies of the governor,
or had made contributions to his campaign. Rowland has repeatedly
denied any wrongdoing, and simply making investment recommendations
would not be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland has said that Silvester's statements are lies from a
criminal seeking to curry favor with prosecutors. ``Frankly, he'll
pretty much say anything to have his sentence reduced,'' the
governor told reporters earlier this month.

RANGERS' SCORELESS STRING REACHES THREE GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last time the New York Rangers had been shut out
in three consecutive games, Harry S. Truman was president. That was
Oct. 19, 21 and 22, 1950 _ at the beginning of some of the bleakest
years in team history.
</P>
<P>
   Those Rangers did not make the playoffs in five straight
seasons. These Rangers are at two and counting. And Sunday night at
Madison Square Garden, these Rangers were blanked for the third
consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was by 3-0, to the Vancouver Canucks and their
24-year-old goaltender, Kevin Weekes, who stopped 19 shots for his
first National Hockey League shutout. He has defeated the Rangers
twice this season after entering it without a victory in 15 NHL
games.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Schaefer scored the first two goals as the Canucks handed
the Rangers their fourth consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 234 minutes 31 seconds _ nearly four hours _ since
the Rangers' last goal. They have not scored since 5:29 of the
first period on Tuesday night in a 2-1 loss at the Garden to San
Jose. The Rangers lost in Philadelphia, 5-0, on Wednesday night and
again to the Flyers, 2-0, on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Messier, the former Rangers captain, scored his 613th
career goal into an empty net, tying him with Mario Lemieux for
sixth in NHL history. And that brought some of the biggest cheers
of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Messier, who led the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup in 54
years in 1994, was making his third trip back to the Garden as a
member of the Canucks. It was obvious he was still a fan favorite.
Messier jerseys could be spotted throughout the stands, and there
was a loud ovation for No. 11 when he was introduced before the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Could it have been the 38-year-old center's final trip to the
Garden? Doubtful. Messier is in the final guaranteed year of the
three-year contract he signed with Vancouver. But Messier said
before the game that he was optimistic about the progress that the
rebuilding Canucks had made this season. And regardless whether the
Canucks pick up his option, Messier said he wanted to play
somewhere after this season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Messier said it was difficult coming back to the Garden
to play. Both he and Wayne Gretzky had said the same thing about
playing in Edmonton earlier this month, as the Oilers prepared to
retire Gretzky's number against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's especially tough playing against all the guys I spent a
lot of time with here,'' Messier said, referring especially to Adam
Graves, Mike Richter and Brian Leetch. ``I never got used to
playing against Wayne. And I feel the same way about Gravy, Ricky,
Leetchie and all the guys that were really soldiers for me when I
was here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the guys who believed in me and what we were trying
to do and were the sole reason we won the cup here. So when you
experience something like that with players, it's hard to compete
against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than Leetch, Graves and Richter, however, only Darren
Langdon remains on the Rangers from the Messier era. The Rangers
have not made the playoffs since Messier left as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their revamped lineup and their N.H.L.-record $58.8
million payroll, the Rangers have struggled offensively this season
without Gretzky quarterbacking their power play. After going 0 for
4 on the power play Sundayl night, the Rangers are 4 for 55 this
season, easily the worst in the league. Over their last seven
games, the Rangers are 1 for 27.
</P>
<P>
   To add insult, the Canucks scored the game's first goal while
the Rangers had the man advantage. Schaefer scored it for the
Canucks _ who swept the two-game season series with the Rangers _
at 16:50 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Mathieu Schneider had jumped into the play along the right-wing
boards in the Canucks' zone, but when he could not pinch the puck
in along the boards, it freed Vancouver for an odd-man rush.
Schaefer finished it with a wrist shot from the right circle that
clanged off the post and into the net's top right corner.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers could not even muster a shot in the second period
until more than 15 minutes had been played. By then, the only other
cheers came each time the scoreboard flashed a Yankees run in the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   And when Weekes made a miracle save on Theo Fleury with just
over 13 minutes left in the final period _ Weekes, lying on his
stomach, reached up to glove the shot _ Fleury could not even break
his stick over the boards.

IN FILM, IMMIGRANTS BRING REAL LIFE TO ACTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cesar Monzon lives in a single basement room in
Queens, thousands of miles from his family in Peru, whom he has
seen for only two weeks in 11 years. When he does not have work, he
spends his days on a Queens corner with dozens of other immigrants,
hoping that a contractor will drive up with an offer of low-paying,
back-straining work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a person matures he accepts what life gives him,'' Monzon
said, ``including the suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   But one fortuitous meeting on that Queens street corner relieved
Monzon of a bit of his suffering. As Monzon was waiting there for
work five years ago, he met David Riker, a writer and director who
was making a film about immigrants in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Monzon and a few dozen fellow Hispanic immigrants who are
not actors and were cast by Riker in ``La Ciudad,'' or ``The
City,'' are the focus of a rising buzz that has the film poised to
become a sleeper hit in the city's Spanish-speaking communities and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The film, in black and white, tells four stories: of day
laborers hired to clean bricks, of a homeless puppeteer and his
daughter, of a young couple from the same town in Mexico who fall
in love and of a seamstress struggling to find money for a sick
child back home. Although the tales are fictional, they rely on
stories the immigrants told Riker during his five years of
research.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opened over the weekend at the Quad Cinema on
13th Street in Manhattan, has drawn strong reviews and was sold out
for several screenings. It has struck a chord among Hispanic
people, who have been hearing about the film almost nightly in
coverage on the Spanish-language television network Univision.
</P>
<P>
   Although the film is fictional, to Monzon it is fact. ``It is my
story,'' he said Sunday at a Mexican restaurant in Corona, Queens,
near the room he rents for $300 a month. In its telling, he said,
he has found some comfort. ``In reality, life is like that,'' he
said of the film's stories about immigrants facing exploitation,
pain and loneliness. Seeing what he has felt manifested on the
screen, he said, ``gives me tranquillity.''
</P>
<P>
   In workshops, Riker drew on the immigrants' memories, some
deeply painful. A group of garment workers re-enacted their border
crossings; men talked about their friends being killed in a civil
war. ``He supported us,'' Monzon said.
</P>
<P>
   Riker and the laborers turned actors were already being
recognized Sunday on the streets of Corona. ``I can't tell you how
many years I've listened to the people in the industry say it's an
important film, or beautiful, but no one would want to see it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is Riker's use of actual working immigrants, rather than
professional actors, that seems to be evoking such a powerful
response. ``I saw it on TV,'' Fernando Mercado, a Mexican immigrant
who lives in Brooklyn but comes to Corona for its Mexican
restaurants, told Riker in the Teatro Plaza, a Spanish-language
movie palace in Corona. ``The people in it work, right? They're
nonprofessional actors. I want to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Riker had previously tried to persuade the Teatro Plaza to hold
a community screening there. ``From the beginning I've believed
this is the place the film should do most of its business,'' he
said of the theater, whose concession stand sells jugos tropicales
and chorizo con arepa.
</P>
<P>
   The theater had said no, but by Sunday, potential ticket buyers
were coming in to ask when ``La Ciudad'' was coming.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few minutes, Riker received calls, first from the
theater's manager, then from its booker, suddenly eager to screen
the film.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru, Monzon worked for the state telecommunications company.
But when terrorists began attacking state workers, he feared for
his life. He reached an agreement with his wife: he would go to
America to work, and she would stay with their four children.
</P>
<P>
   He has worked for as little as $7 a day. He sends money home,
but he does not send news of his pain. ``I don't put them through
that,'' he said of his family. ``It's not good that they worry.''
</P>
<P>
   At one moment in rehearsal, Monzon told Riker that it was fine
to instruct his nascent actors, but he needed to let them express
what was inside. What came out of Monzon was an unscripted scream,
at the moment in the film when a fellow worker dies. ``In that
moment I felt the sadness of my father dying in my arms,'' Monzon
said, ``the desperation, not being able to do anything. That's the
secret of that scream.''
</P>
<P>
   Silvia Goiz, 33, a seamstress from Puebla, Mexico, in the film
plays a seamstress whose bosses refuse to pay the wages she is owed
and desperately needs to send to her sick child in Mexico. ``People
see she looks exactly the way they do,'' Riker said. ``She is on
the big screen. It makes them think they are on the big screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goiz said she has seen enough factory bosses yell at enough
of her co-workers that, when a professional actress yelled at her
in an early audition, she cried.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goiz, who lives in Corona with 13 relatives and works six
days a week, said curiosity drew her to Riker's auditions, after
which she went through three months of auditions and acting
exercises before she was selected to be the lead of ``The
Seamstress'' section. ``Others could express their ideas more
confidently,'' Riker said of Ms. Goiz. ``But there was so much
feeling in her.''
</P>
<P>
   The actors were paid for shooting, though not rehearsals. Seeing
herself on the screen, she said, brought sadness at the stories,
but also personal happiness. ``I never thought I would be up there
on the big screen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her older sister, Teresa Goiz, who also works in a factory, said
she cried and cried watching the film. ``It's the reality of our
lives,'' she said.

USC'S COLLECTIVE SLUMP SIMILAR TO '96
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC freshman wide receiver Kareem Kelly turned on
the TV in his hotel room Saturday morning and became intrigued by
what he heard on a college football pregame show.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said (Florida State coach) Bobby Bowden hasn't lost more
than two games in one season since '88,'' Kelly said. ``I thought
that could be us in a couple years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, youthful optimism. Kelly has done everything possible to
help USC this season, already setting two freshman records for
receptions and yards. But not even his efforts are enough to lift
the Trojans out of their current malaise.
</P>
<P>
   People might feel like Saturday's 35-31 loss to Stanford was
deja vu, the second straight week USC blew a 21-point lead. But
this season is really a re-occurrence of 1996. The Trojans have
lost three consecutive games for the first time since '96, and the
program seems in similar shape.
</P>
<P>
   Just like three years ago, there really isn't one person who can
be blamed for the misfortunes but rather a collective slump that
has engulfed the team. Whether it's the defense or the offense's
fault, it doesn't really matter. You just seem to know USC will not
protect its lead. Or make a sufficient comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone will play hard, but plays will not be made. It's about
performance, not blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of heart. We don't know what's going
wrong,'' free safety David Gibson said. ``We've reached deep.
Things are just not going our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither on nor off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this week had a sour taste just as it got
started, when Trojans coach Paul Hackett singled out his seniors
and upperclassmen for their inconsistent play. That's one thing
that certainly didn't happen in '96.
</P>
<P>
   It grew worse in midweek, when Hackett gathered the seniors
together and scolded them for not accomplishing anything their
first three years. This is hardly the stuff that inspires the
troops to turn in a morale-boosting victory.
</P>
<P>
   You could almost predict that USC would find a way to fall
apart, with the mixed messages that were being sent during the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Trojans are on the verge of missing a bowl for the third
time in four years.
</P>
<P>
   USC needs to win four of its final five games just to be
considered for a bowl berth. The Trojans' schedule is supposed to
be easier in the second half, but nearly everyone assumed before
the season that USC would beat Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, one day we'll get it together, but we have to start
very soon because we don't have many games left,'' linebacker
Markus Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   USC (3-4, 1-3) is facing real stress this week as it prepares to
go to Cal. The Trojans could easily pack it in and have a season of
disastrous proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of pressure on us,'' Kelly said. ``I can handle
it, but can everybody else is the question?''
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be USC's real problem. Individually, each player
thinks he can do the job. It's just when the team as a whole is
considered that a lack of confidence becomes an issue. It better be
addressed soon, or USC will be taking the month of December off.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward (left hamstring) and offensive
guard Faasea Mailo are listed as probable against Cal. Linebacker
Markus Steele (ankle) and linebacker Troy Polamalu (concussion) are
listed as possible.

By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Danny Pena was one of the first Los Angeles Galaxy
players showered and clothed following the Galaxy's 2-0 victory
over Colorado on Sunday at Mile High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he sat down and looked over his shoulder, he could
see the small group of reporters coming his way. For Pena, the
well-deserved attention is something he's coming to expect,
especially this time of year. And the way he wears his emotions on
the field is the same way he fires back answers to questions.
</P>
<P>
   After spending most of the afternoon containing Swedish
midfielder Anders Limpar _ the Galaxy's man-mark specialist ended a
scoreless affair in the 74th minute, beating Rapids goalkeeper Ian
Feuer _ which proved to be the knockout blow as Los Angeles swept
Colorado, 2-0, in the best-of-three first-round series to reach the
Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Galaxy awaits the outcome of Wednesday's Chicago-Dallas
match. Chicago beat Dallas 4-0 Saturday to extend their series to a
deciding game. The winner will face the Galaxy on Sunday at the
Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   With the goal, Pena, believe it or not, became the Galaxy's
all-time leading scorer in the playoffs, raising his total to four
after hammering home three last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The referee Rich Grady said, `Why do you always wait for the
playoffs to score goals?' said Pena. ``I just smiled. I didn't feel
I gave my team what it needed offensively for a good 80 minutes,
but it only takes one good moment to rectify that.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal, set up brilliantly by playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos,
caught the Rapids by surprise. Cienfuegos was dribbling to his
right, drifting away from the Rapids net, then dumped a no-look
pass the other direction for Pena, who was alone inside the penalty
area. When Feuer came out to challenge, Pena's delicate chip found
the center of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cien is always telling me not to talk to him, that he will
find me,'' Pena said. ``I never said a word to him, and, sure
enough, he found me like the magic player that he is and I was
fortunate enough to finish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the greatest feeling on earth. It kind of justified
everything that I've gone through over the course of the last three
years. You're looking at a happy man right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid said he felt Pena would do something special when he
walked off the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the one guy walking around who definitely had his game
face on,'' Schmid said. ``Danny Pena, you can never take this away
from him, he will give you everything he has till he takes his last
breath on the field. He wants to win at all costs and it was a
much-deserved goal for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy substitute Joey Franchino finished a rebound in the 84th
minute to seal the victory _ but most of the Galaxy's best work
came in the first 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Limpar, who said in the Denver papers that Colorado would come
out and attack, was true to his word. Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin
Hartman needed to make three big saves early and the rest of Los
Angeles' defense weathered the storm until the Galaxy found its
rhythm offensively.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Braves juggled their lineup for Game 2 of
the World Series on Sunday night hoping for more offense. What they
got, as a result, was terrible defense and very little offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had no trouble scoring runs on Sunday night, but the
Braves gave them more, anyway, and by thrashing Atlanta, 7-2, the
Yankees now are poised for a World Series wipeout. They lead by two
games to none, as the series shifts back to New York for the next
three games _ or two, if the Braves can't avoid the sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta managed just one hit against the Yankees' David Cone on
Sunday night, and has accumulated seven hits and three runs in the
first two games of the series, batting 7 for 58 (.121)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it will be Manager Joe Torre, or outfielder Paul O'Neill,
or Cone, who didn't allow a hit until the fifth inning on Sunday
night. But after the Yankees gained a stranglehold on this series,
someone was sure to remind everybody else how another team came
back to win the World Series after losing the first two games at
home _ the 1996 Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Don Baylor, the Braves' hitting coach, approached Keith Lockhart
after Atlanta's defeat in Game 1 on Saturday and suggested that
Lockhart stay ready, he might play in Game 2. What Lockhart didn't
know was that Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox planned major lineup
changes for Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez had embarrassed the Braves' right-handed
hitters with his slider _ in particular, the second baseman Bret
Boone, the catcher Eddie Perez and the left fielder Gerald
Williams. Knowing that Cone is similar to Hernandez, who throws his
slider from different angles to confoundright-handed hitters, Cox
stacked his lineup with left-handed hitters. Lockhart started at
second in place of Boone, who had 144 starts in the regular season,
Ozzie Guillen was the shortstop instead of Walt Weiss and Greg
Myers opened at catcher rather than Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just throwing it out there,'' Cox said, ``and seeing if
they won't change things.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some risk to Cox's strategy: Guillen and Lockhart are
vastly inferior to Weiss and Boone on defense. But Cox could have
assumed, with justification, that the shortcomings of his
substitute middle infielders would not have manifested themselves.
Kevin Millwood is a fly ball pitcher of the first order, who
averaged 0.88 ground balls for every fly ball this season.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee, the Yankees' left fielder, studied videotape of
Millwood on Sunday afternoon, like a student cramming for a final
exam. What he saw was Millwood whipping his fastball 93 to 95 miles
an hour, overpowering hitters before dropping in his sharp
curveball or a slider.
</P>
<P>
   The Kevin Millwood who pitched on Sunday night was nothing like
the pitcher whom Ledee studied. His fastball in the first inning
was 90 to 91 mph, his slider was inconsistent, and he didn't really
use his curveball. He had no weapons with which to finish off the
Yankees' batters. Chuck Knoblauch, the first batter of the game,
fell behind no balls and two strikes and Millwood leaned back and
pumped a high fastball, a neanderthal approach that might have been
effective if he had better stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch slammed a single into left-center field, and time
and again this was Millwood's pattern in the first inning. After
Derek Jeter pulled a single into left field _ the Yankees had first
and second and nobody out _ O'Neill fell behind by no balls and two
strikes and fouled off three two-strike pitches, before he hit a
single to center field, Knoblauch scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams grounded into a double play, Jeter taking third,
and it appeared Millwood might get out of the inning allowing just
the one run. But Tino Martinez fell behind by 1 ball and 2 strikes
and then smashed a line single to left, scoring Jeter. Ledee drew a
walk, and like those before him, Scott Brosius fell behind no balls
and two strikes, before grounding a ball toward the middle, to the
left of Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, the Braves' regular shortstop, may or may not have
reached the ball; Guillen did not, and Martinez scored as the slow
roller reached center field. The Braves had two hits in all of Game
1, they were facing a tough pitcher with a revamped lineup, and
they were down three runs before their first at-bat. Millwood
required 38 pitches to get through the first inning, and more
telling is the fact that of those, the Yankees' swung and missed
just one time.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood slogged through the second inning, throwing another 18
pitches. But Bernie Williams led off the third inning by falling
behind in the count by 1-2, then bouncing a ball to Lockhart's
right, and past him _ a ball Boone would have easily reached.
Martinez singled and Ledee crushed a double between the outfielders
in left and center, Williams racing home with the Yankees' fourth
run. Cox figured there was no point in waiting for Millwood's spot
in the lineup to come around in the bottom half of the third; Terry
Mulholland relieved Millwood and retired the next two hitters, the
runners holding at second and third.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Cone was next, his hitters' senses dulled by
years of playing in the American League. But he waged a surprising
battle with Mulholland, fouling off five pitches; the Yankees would
foul off 24 pitches in the first three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Then Cone reached out and poked a ball with the end of his bat,
the pain of imperfect contact slicing through his hands as his
little pop fly spun at Guillen. The shortstop took a couple of
steps to his right, held out his glove, an easy chance _ and he
dropped the ball. Martinez went across home plate to make the score
5-0, and Cox put both hands on the top of his head in frustration,
in a Homer Simpson pose. Guillen and the Braves were booed heavily
as they ran off the field at the end of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   But there would be more follies. Jeter doubled to lead off the
fourth, took third on a fly ball and after the Braves intentionally
walked Bernie Williams, the Atlanta infield played back, looking
for a double-play. Sure enough, Martinez grounded to Guillen, who
flipped to Lockhart, who bobbled the ball for a moment before
stepping on second and, in fear of losing the doubleplay, fired the
ball high and wide of the first baseman Ryan Klesko. More boos. The
Yankees now were in command, 6-0, and half their runs were a direct
result of the play of the Braves' middle infield.
</P>
<P>
   Fans would begin quietly fleeing Turner Field and the cold
shortly thereafter, not hanging around to see the outcome of the
only remaining drama of the evening: Could the Braves get a hit off
of Cone?
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander had stymied the Atlanta left-handers with his
split-fingered fastball, and he was so very careful. He threw 35
pitches in the first three innings and only two were on the inside
half of the strike zone. An outside slider to Brian Jordan hung in
the bottom of the first inning and the Braves' cleanup hitter
crushed a high drive to left field, certainly a home run on most
days. But the wind was gusting from left to right and Jordan's fly
fell about five feet short.
</P>
<P>
   Cone walked three in the first four innings, but Atlanta had no
hits. When Myers skipped a single through the middle to start the
fifth, the fans roared sarcastically. &QL;

NERVOUS? BRAVES HAVE GOT TO BE, BASED ON THEIR ANEMIC HITTING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Derek Jeter, who in a moment would bat with the bases
loaded in the eighth inning of a game the Yankees were losing, 1-0,
looked at a spectator in the first row of the box seats next to the
Yankees' dugout and posed a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nervous?'' the young shortstop asked George Steinbrenner on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Receiving no audible reply from his employer, Jeter proceeded to
step into the batter's box and rap a single between shortstop and
third base, tying the game. The Yankees would score three more runs
in the inning and defeat the Atlanta Braves, 4-1, and take a 1-0
lead in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Now it should be the Braves who are nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Yankees' 7-2 romp on Sunday night in Game 2, the
Braves are in a perilous position, down two games to none and
heading to New York for the next three games. Hmmm, now where have
we heard that before?
</P>
<P>
   That's it, the Braves' grand scheme is to play this World Series
in the exact opposite pattern as they played the 1996 World Series.
In that one, they beat the Yankees twice at Yankee Stadium and then
went home and lost three games before returning to New York for one
more game and one more loss. Turnabout is fair play, is it not?
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the real world, the Braves are braced by the
reality that they haven't defeated the Yankees in a World Series
encounter in their last six attempts and the Yankees haven't lost a
World Series game in their last 10 late October outings. But the
Braves have even more serious problems than patterns and
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   They can't hit. They have amassed a grand total of 2 hits in 14
innings against the Yankees' starting pitchers, and they have
scored a total of three runs in the two games.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of a psychological barrier standing in the way
of winning and a pitching barrier positioned in the way of their
hitters is making this a more difficult World Series than the
Braves had envisioned. Not that they planned on breezing past the
Yankees, but they did expect to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Before the World Series began, the Braves said no link existed
between this one and the one they lost in 1996. This team, they
noted, is not the team that lost that Series, so that one should
have no effect on this one. But the Braves still haven't won a game
since Game 2 three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To have any chance against the Yankees, the Braves knew they had
to hit better than they did in Game 1 and better than they did in
the National League Championship Series against the Mets. But Don
Baylor, the hitting coach, rejected any suggestion that the Braves'
two-hit effort Saturday night was a continuation of their
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in that cold stuff or whatever,'' Baylor said
as the Braves took batting practice on Sunday evening. ``That
wasn't the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, he said, was Orlando Hernandez, the baffling Cuban,
who allowed one hit, a fourth-inning home run by Chipper Jones, and
struck out 10 in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy pitched good last night; he pitched great,'' Baylor
said. ``We never came close to having an attack. We didn't have
good swings at all. We never were in the good offensive counts,
2-0, 3-1, where he made a mistake. David Cone is going to do pretty
much the same thing as El Duque did _ change speeds, throw his
cutter, his slider.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone did exactly what Hernandez did Saturday night, allowing one
hit in seven innings. But the Braves didn't score against Cone, who
permitted only a leadoff single by Greg Myers in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to change the Braves' fortunes, Bobby Cox, their
manager, made wholesale changes in the lineup. ``After you get two
measly hits,'' Baylor said, ``you better think about something
else.'' They did, and they got five measly hits.
</P>
<P>
   Myers caught in place of Eddie Perez, Keith Lockhart replaced
Bret Boone at second base and Ozzie Guillen played shortstop in
place of Walt Weiss and batted second in place of Boone. Cox
dropped Andruw Jones from sixth to eighth in the batting order.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he's not swinging good,'' Baylor said of Jones. ``He
realizes it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones didn't swing well from the No. 8 slot either. He popped to
short, grounded into a double play after Myers singled and took a
third strike for the third out after Cone had walked two of the
first three batters in the seventh inning. In the games in New
York, when the designated hitter will bat instead of the pitcher,
Cox could drop Jones even lower, to the No. 9 spot.
</P>
<P>
   Cox explained that with the lineup changes he was trying to
``generate a little offense.'' Brian Jordan, who retained his
cleanup spot in the batting order, said that it was ``unusual for a
World Series to change the lineup so dramatically'' and that the
players who did not find their names in the posted lineup were
``pretty surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan added: ``I guess Bobby's trying to mix it up, make
things happen. We only got one or two hits yesterday, so we need to
get something going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves better get a lot going quickly or they could go home
later this week with no more games to play.
