Cardinals down Astros 10-9
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ST. LOUIS _ Here on the banks of the Mississippi River, they like
to boast of the largest Fourth of July weekend festival in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   And while the real fireworks aren't scheduled to go off for
another few days, those hoping to see an early display of
explosives could have gotten their fill Saturday afternoon at Busch
Stadium, where the St. Louis Cardinals outbombed the Astros in a
10-9 slugfest.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros outhomered the Cardinals 4-3 but St. Louis did more
damage with its round trippers, getting three-run homers from Mark
McGwire and Fernando Tatis _ the most telling blow of the game _ to
send the Astros to their 13th loss in 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys did a great job of swinging the bats,'' said Jeff
Bagwell, who was 3-for-5 with two home runs for the Astros. ``But
we needed to score 11 runs, and we came up short at nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really the same old story: If we pitch well, we don't
hit; if we hit, we don't pitch well. I really don't know what else
to say about it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored seven runs in the first three innings, jumping
out to a four-run lead, but by the sixth inning they were faced
with another catch-up situation.
</P>
<P>
   And while they had the potential go-ahead run on first base when
Cardinals closer Dave Veres got Chris Truby to pop out to end the
game, the outcome was fairly predictable, considering the Astros
had lost each of the previous 45 games they trailed going to the
ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's leadoff homer started the ninth-inning threat. But in
the end, all it did was pull the Astros close enough to suffer
their 18th loss in 21 one-run games.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrating?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to answer that question anymore,'' manager Larry
Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   No answer needed; you could see it on Dierker's face and the
faces of every coach and player on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the most frustrating year of my career,'' Bagwell
said. ``It's draining for us, and I'm sure it's draining to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros starter Octavio Dotel wasn't exactly a sight for sore
eyes, allowing seven hits and six runs on a day when the Astros
provided him plenty of extra run support.
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to be just what the doctor ordered for a pitcher
who has lost four consecutive decisions and hasn't won since May 5,
but Dotel was working with less than his best stuff.
</P>
<P>
   His fastball was about four miles per hour slower than normal
and when a pitcher relies as heavily on one pitch as Dotel does, he
can't afford to have it at less than its best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what was going on with me,'' Dotel said. ``But I
didn't have my best stuff; I know that. I just have to keep going
out there. Some day, things are going to be different for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a bad day for Cardinals starter Garrett Stephenson,
a nine-game winner whom the Astros feasted on for 11 hits and seven
runs (six earned) in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who had 15 hits in the game, including a
season-high-tying seven for extra bases, scored two runs in the
first and three more in the second to reclaim the lead after
McGwire's three-run homer in the bottom of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back homers by Moises Alou and Richard Hidalgo increased
the Astros' lead to 7-3 in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fifth time the Astros have had back-to-back homers
this season, and Hidalgo has been involved each time. It was the
first homer since June 14 for Hidalgo, who leads the team with 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals pulled within a run and chased Dotel with three
runs in the fourth, then took the lead for good with four in the
sixth, three on Tatis' two-out homer off Doug Henry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our year has been like that at-bat I had against Tatis,'' said
Henry, who has allowed more home runs (nine) than anyone in the
Astros' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a pitch that wasn't even in the strike zone; he
shouldn't have even swung at that pitch, and he hits it out of the
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatis missed 54 games with a groin injury before returning to
the lineup Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep winning and you keep winning and that's what it's all
about,'' said the Cardinals' Jim Edmonds, who doubled twice and
drove in two runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who are on pace to lose a club-record 106 games,
dropped to 26 games below .500 and trail St. Louis by 21 games in
the National League Central.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Thompson (1-1) pitched 2 innings in relief of Stephenson to
get the win, allowing one unearned run on one hit. The save was
Veres' 16th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Slusarski (1-5) gave up two runs on two hits in two innings
of relief in taking the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is just another example of the way the whole
stinking season has gone,'' Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it will only be half over after today's series
finale with the Cardinals.

Magic has key to free-agent sweepstakes
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
``Hi, this is Tim Duncan. I'm either on the phone right now or out
of the house, so at the tone, please leave a message.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're the Orlando Magic, please press one, and make sure
you follow that with plenty of zeroes. If you're the San Antonio
Spurs, press two, as in Twin Towers. If this is Grant Hill yo,
Grant, hit 33 and tell me what's up. If you're the Chicago Bulls,
please hang up and try again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for calling. And have a nice payday er, day.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday marked the start of the NBA's free-agent shopping
frenzy, and for every general manager in the league it's the same
story _ Tim Duncan, when you absolutely, positively have to have
the best.
</P>
<P>
   Accept no substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   And forget about Bull markets, this is expected to be a Mouse
market _ as in Orlando, current home of Disney World and what is
hoped to be the future home of Duncan and _ in a domino effect _ a
couple of other free agents. Like Hill, who shares not only a
friendship with Duncan, but an agent (Lon Babby).
</P>
<P>
   But if Hill doesn't join the Magic, then other free agents will
jump at the opportunity to play alongside Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tracy (McGrady, of Toronto) watched the success of the Lakers
with (Shaquille) O'Neal at center, and he realizes that Tim is one
of the best centers in the game,'' said Arn Tellem, McGrady's
agent. ``I think what Tim Duncan does will set off the free-agent
process for a lot of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Orlando is banking on.
</P>
<P>
   But while it is interested in two or three free agents of note,
the Magic is determined to make Duncan the center of attention.
With that in mind, the Magic has invited Duncan and Grant to drop
down _ together, of course _ for a little visit. Orlando is pulling
out all the stops, and with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic learned the hard way what life is like on the other
side in 1996 when the Lakers won a high-stakes recruiting war to
land Magic center Shaquille O'Neal to a deal totaling $120 million
over seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was just one of the big-time free agents in the class of
'96 to change teams _ joining Dikembe Mutombo (from Denver to
Atlanta) and Allan Houston (from Detroit to New York).
</P>
<P>
   Orlando hopes there is a chance for similar movement among this
year's top targets (Duncan, Hill and Eddie Jones) and some of the
budding stars as well (McGrady, Jalen Rose, Rashard Lewis, Austin
Croshere and Tim Thomas).
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how this plan works,'' said Orlando general manager
John Gabriel. ``We've worked it here, and we've had it worked
against us. I hope we'll be busy (in the free-agent wars).''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? The Magic has been busy up to this point.
</P>
<P>
   Between last June and the February trade deadline, the Magic
made 37 transactions involving 38 players, creating a little more
than $13 million in cap room. Four starters, including resident
star Penny Hardaway, were dealt from a team that made the playoffs
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Wednesday's draft-day moves, when the Magic dumped two
of its three lottery picks, along with two contracts in Corey
Maggette and Derek Strong, to get the organization $21 million
under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando can now go out and sign two maximum-salaried free agents
from a list that includes Duncan, Hill, McGrady, Jones and Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Teams began negotiating with free agents Saturday, but they
can't sign those players until Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Had it not cleared out the extra cap room, the Magic would have
been forced to try to work out a sign-and-trade deal with at least
one of the teams that will lose one of its stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have been able to sign two free agents before, but
the sign-and-trade thing would have come into play,'' said Magic
coach Doc Rivers. ``It would have been tougher. We have the money
now to go out and get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs expect to be busy as well, most of it centering on
letting Duncan know how much he is loved by the organization. And
should Duncan re-sign with San Antonio, the Spurs will make heated
pitches to Hill, Duncan's good friend, who would have to sign for
the $2 million exception for a chance to play on a team that could
challenge the Lakers for NBA supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   So the Spurs, who can offer Duncan seven years (one more than
competing teams) and bigger annual raises (12.5 percent vs. 10
percent), are gearing up their sales pitches as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in competition with another team for Tim,'' said Gregg
Popovich, who serves as Spurs coach and general manager. ``So in
that sense, you have the same sort of feeling in your stomach as
you do before a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two seasons now _ the regular season and free
agency. They (free-agency rules) have made the summers like college
(recruiting).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that was intended, but that's the reality of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For all teams, not just the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons are working just as hard to keep Hill in the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about this with Grant,'' said Joe Dumars, Pistons
president of basketball operations. ``And I'm not being cocky or
anything. I've talked with him probably every day the last two
weeks. And we've talked about his little visit down South (to
Orlando).
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand and respect that he wants to check out his
options. And we'll talk when he gets back. I know it looks bad from
what everyone's saying and writing, but, right now, I have no
reason to believe that he's not going to be in training camp come
fall _ with us.''
</P>
<P>
   But will that be enough?
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte's Jones, another top free-agent prize, is going to
mull any and all offers before making a decision. The Hornets
appeared to be one of the top teams in the East until their
first-round bust against Philadelphia in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   So Jones, whose name has come up in sign-and-trade scenarios
with Miami, isn't tying himself down to Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity, to be in position to
choose where he wants to play,'' said Jones' agent, Leon Rose.
``That's why he's going to be deliberate, making sure he makes a
good decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is eligible for a seven-year, $86.6 million deal with the
Hornets, or a six-year, $67.5 million contract with teams that are
at least $9 million under next year's salary cap _ Chicago and
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm going to talk to the teams that have the money
to sign me,'' Jones said. ``I've been watching what Orlando has
been doing, and it looks like they're going to be able to get three
(big free agents) now, so as a free agent you have to like that.
But I don't want to say anything more than that.''

&HT;    WHITE ABALONE ON BRINK OF EXTINCTION
</HEADLINE>

By CECILIA CHAN

<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. _ In its heyday, white abalone dotted the ocean
floor in the prime fishing grounds off the Ventura County coast and
numbered in the millions from Point Conception to Baja.
</P>
<P>
   The sea snail was common fare on California's menus, offered
deep fried or in sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   But with fewer than 2,540 remaining, white abalone is nearly
extinct. The public has until Wednesday to comment on a National
Marine Fisheries Service plan to list the mollusk as an endangered
species, the first time a marine invertebrate would receive the
classification.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is listed, it's sort of a milestone in our thinking
about the ocean,'' said Ian Taniguchi, a marine biologist with the
California Department of Fish and Game. ``For the longest time,
probably throughout recorded history, there has been a sort of
mentality that things that come from the ocean are infinite, are
non-exhaustible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception we could ever fish an invertebrate species to
extinction is sort of being realized now with the white abalone.''
</P>
<P>
   The NMFS had already designated the white abalone as a candidate
for the endangered list in 1997. Last year, several environmental
groups - including the Channel Islands Marine Resource Institute in
Port Hueneme - petitioned the agency to include it under the
Endangered Species Act. And state Fish and Game currently is
working on listing the species under California's Endangered
Species Act, Taniguchi said.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental groups hope to bring more attention - and,
potentially, money for restoration and recovery - by classifying
the abalone as endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties also would be greater for those who illegally harvest
the species, with violators facing a $100,000 fine and a year in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   The white variety is among eight species of abalone that live
along the West Coast. It is the deepest dwelling, found on
low-relief rocks covered with algae at 80 to 200 feet, where the
water temperature is cooler.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, divers harvested thousands of pounds of the
melon-sized invertebrate - its shell lined with mother of pearl -
for the local and Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have always been a delicacy from Native Americans
onward,'' said Tom McCormick, director of the Channel Islands
Marine Resource Institute. ``They've always been perceived as
something exotic, very delicious and very California.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early 1950s after the war, (with) scuba diving becoming
available and expanding to new areas, you would hear reports of
hundreds of thousand of abalone from dives,'' he said. ``There are
pictures showing mountains of abalone as tall as two-story
buildings at processing plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people in the 1940s and 1950s, the $1.50 abalone sandwich
was very common. That memory is gone for younger people unless they
are out sport diving in Northern California to get the red
abalone.''
</P>
<P>
   The white abalone, favored for its tender meat, commanded a
higher price at market, up to 20 percent more than the red abalone,
which was the main staple of the fishing industry, Taniguchi said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1969 to 1977, more than 95 percent of the commercial white
abalone harvest took place, with a peak catch of 144,000 pounds in
1972, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. A common
spot for catches was off the Ventura County coast - east of Santa
Cruz Island to Anacapa Island.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 30 years the white abalone population has gone
from an estimated high of 2.22 million to 4.24 million to 1,613 to
2,540 - a 99 percent decline, the NMFS reported.
</P>
<P>
   That drop prompted state Fish and Game officials to close
fishing for white, pink and green abalone in 1996. A year later,
they imposed a moratorium on commercial and sport catches on all
abalone species found south of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Although harvesting was banned, the white abalone has not
rebounded, marine biologists say.
</P>
<P>
   Overfishing has reduced the density of the population, making
reproduction practically nil for the slow-growing gastropods, which
have a life span of 30 to 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Both male and female abalone are broadcast spawners, meaning
they release their eggs and sperm into the water to make contact by
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to be within a few yards of each other to have
successful fertilization,'' McCormick said. ``If they are spaced in
order of 1 to 1 miles apart, in most cases these animals won't
successfully reproduce because they are so far apart. So they will
die of old age.''
</P>
<P>
   Abalone move slowly on a single foot along the ocean bottom, and
adults have extremely limited movements. With its single, flattened
spiral shell, the species averages five to eight inches long.
</P>
<P>
   Research in the 1970s showed a potential of one white abalone
per square meter in its natural habitat - today it's maybe five
abalone per hectare or 10,000 square meters, Taniguchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Locations such as San Clemente, Catalina Island and Anacapa
Island, where the greatest number of white abalone was removed in
the 1970s, were surveyed last fall with disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found 157 in 10 days of looking,'' said Dan Richards, a
marine biologist at Channel Islands National Park. ``That is not
very good. Seventy hours of prime time searching over really good
habitat - and that was all we could find.''
</P>
<P>
   Although human consumption is largely to blame for the white
abalone's demise, some experts said a bacterial infection also
could have played a role.
</P>
<P>
   Withering syndrome, which shrivels the abalone in its shell, has
decimated 99 percent of the black abalone, McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   First detected in the late 1980s in Southern California waters,
the syndrome is moving north and has reached Point Conception, in
Santa Barbara County, he said. The syndrome, which affects the
abalone's digestive glands, also has been found in pink, red, green
and white abalone.

Sampras shakes off leg injury
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WIMBLEDON, England _ When a tennis player hears his opponent is
injured, he usually knows he has a great chance.
</P>
<P>
   Unless that opponent is Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who limped through his second-round match after
suffering acute tendinitis in his ankle and shin, didn't let the
injury affect him in his third-round match Saturday, losing the
first set but coming back to beat fellow American Justin Gimelstob
2-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather play him not injured than injured,'' Gimelstob
said. ``Have you ever seen him lose injured? He's a great player.
He seems to thrive on playing injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras had to call for a trainer to have his left ankle and
shin massaged and taped Wednesday evening during his second-round
match. Though he was limping, he won that match against Karol
Kucera in four sets.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of several matches Sampras won while in distress, the
most notable being the 1996 U.S. Open quarterfinal meeting with
Alex Corretja, when Sampras became ill on the court yet still
pulled out the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing hurt is something I've learned to deal with over the
years,'' Sampras said. ``This is Wimbledon, this is what I play for
all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do everything I can to play. I'm not risking my
career to play this tournament, but I'm not 100 percent and it's
something I have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first set, it was hard to tell he was ailing. He had
little trouble running down Gimelstob's volleys. He managed
well-placed serves and passed his opponent with ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``My movement is one of my best advantages out there, and I'm
not at 100 percent, but even at 80 percent, my movement is better
than a lot of guys out here, especially on this surface,'' Sampras
said.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the story early. He spent Thursday and Friday
icing his ankle and getting treatment from the trainers. He
benefited from the long early matches and rain delays that
postponed his match, therefore giving him an extra day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   But the rust had set in.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras double-faulted four times on his first service game,
allowing Gimelstob to break and take a 3-0 lead. He double-faulted
again on set point, giving Gimelstob an edge.
</P>
<P>
   Just as significant, Sampras didn't manage a single winner off
his groundstrokes in the opening set, the only winners being four
volleys.
</P>
<P>
   ``My racket felt like a foreign object, which doesn't happen too
often,'' Sampras said. ``This is not an easy surface to play on
when you haven't picked up a racket in 2{ days.
</P>
<P>
   ``First set, I was so rusty. Had no rhythm on my serve. But once
I got that break in the second and started to feel a little better
about my timing, my rhythm, my serve started coming on a little
bit, started to feel a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob could only watch as Sampras started to look like a
six-time Wimbledon champion over the next few sets. Sampras drilled
37 unreturnable serves over the final three sets and had 46
winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has intangibles,'' Gimelstob said. ``Comes up with certain
shots on the run or certain shots that would get by other guys. In
his mother's womb, I think God spent a little extra time on his
right shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, the No. 1 seed, has only one seeded player remaining in
his half of the draw. He could meet No. 9 seed Thomas Enqvist in a
quarterfinal match if he is able to get past Jonas Bjorkman.
</P>
<P>
   With no play today, Sampras again will have one day off to
rehabilitate the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sore,'' Sampras said. ``Two days off definitely helped.
Yesterday, I was praying for rain and got it, which is nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's sore and it's probably going to continue to be sore
and I just need to find a way to play on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's draw lost French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten, the
No. 4 seed, who fell to Alexander Popp 7-6 (6), 6-2, 6-1. Kuerten,
who was suffering from a cold, said he felt lethargic.

   ``After I played two days ago, I felt a little bit worse, with
fever,'' Kuerten said. ``I was not feeling really, really bad, just
weak. I could run, could play, but not full of energy. That's
enough to be out of a tournament like this.''
</P>
<P>
   It was enough for Popp, ranked No. 163 in the world, to
characterize the match as the best he's had.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the nicest day of my life up to now,'' Popp
said.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Andre Agassi, who went 18 games in the fifth set against
Todd Martin on Friday, had an easier time Saturday against Jerome
Golmard for a 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 victory. No. 12 seed Patrick Rafter
also advanced.
</P>
<P>
   And No. 10 seed Mark Philippoussis prevailed in a marathon,
pulling out a 38-game fifth set to beat Sjeng Schalken 4-6, 6-3,
6-7 (7) 7-6 (4), 20-18.
</P>
<P>
   The 83 games were the most in a match at Wimbledon since 1970,
before tiebreakers were used, and the time (5 hours, 5 minutes) was
the longest since the 5:12 victory by Pancho Gonzalez over Charlie
Pasarell, 22-24, 1-6, 16-14, 6-3, 11-9 over two days in the first
round in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the training I've done paid off,'' Philippoussis said.
``I've always considered myself a fighter. That kind of match I'm
proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis, who served 20 aces in the final set and 44
overall, was broken only once in the first set and once in the
fourth. Schalken was broken once each in the second, fourth and
fifth sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He served unbelievable the entire match. That's why he won,''
said Schalken, who fired 30 aces in the match.
</P>
<P>
   The women's draw had no surprises. No. 5 seed Venus Williams
continued to cruise through the women's draw, beating Nathalie
Dechy 6-0, 7-6 (4).
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Lindsay Davenport posted a 6-4, 6-2 win over
Paola Suarez. No. 6 Monica Seles and No. 9 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario
advanced to the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   Three unseeded Americans _ Jennifer Capriati, Lilia Osterloh and
Kristina Brandi _ are also in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   The players are off today. Play will resume Monday.

Sampras shakes off leg injury
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WIMBLEDON, England _ When a tennis player hears his opponent is
injured, he usually knows he has a great chance.
</P>
<P>
   Unless that opponent is Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who limped through his second-round match after
suffering acute tendinitis in his ankle and shin, didn't let the
injury affect him in his third-round match Saturday, losing the
first set but coming back to beat fellow American Justin Gimelstob
2-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather play him not injured than injured,'' Gimelstob
said. ``Have you ever seen him lose injured? He's a great player.
He seems to thrive on playing injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras had to call for a trainer to have his left ankle and
shin massaged and taped Wednesday evening during his second-round
match. Though he was limping, he won that match against Karol
Kucera in four sets.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of several matches Sampras won while in distress, the
most notable being the 1996 U.S. Open quarterfinal meeting with
Alex Corretja, when Sampras became ill on the court yet still
pulled out the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing hurt is something I've learned to deal with over the
years,'' Sampras said. ``This is Wimbledon, this is what I play for
all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do everything I can to play. I'm not risking my
career to play this tournament, but I'm not 100 percent and it's
something I have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first set, it was hard to tell he was ailing. He had
little trouble running down Gimelstob's volleys. He managed
well-placed serves and passed his opponent with ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``My movement is one of my best advantages out there, and I'm
not at 100 percent, but even at 80 percent, my movement is better
than a lot of guys out here, especially on this surface,'' Sampras
said.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the story early. He spent Thursday and Friday
icing his ankle and getting treatment from the trainers. He
benefited from the long early matches and rain delays that
postponed his match, therefore giving him an extra day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   But the rust had set in.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras double-faulted four times on his first service game,
allowing Gimelstob to break and take a 3-0 lead. He double-faulted
again on set point, giving Gimelstob an edge.
</P>
<P>
   Just as significant, Sampras didn't manage a single winner off
his groundstrokes in the opening set, the only winners being four
volleys.
</P>
<P>
   ``My racket felt like a foreign object, which doesn't happen too
often,'' Sampras said. ``This is not an easy surface to play on
when you haven't picked up a racket in 2{ days.
</P>
<P>
   ``First set, I was so rusty. Had no rhythm on my serve. But once
I got that break in the second and started to feel a little better
about my timing, my rhythm, my serve started coming on a little
bit, started to feel a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob could only watch as Sampras started to look like a
six-time Wimbledon champion over the next few sets. Sampras drilled
37 unreturnable serves over the final three sets and had 46
winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has intangibles,'' Gimelstob said. ``Comes up with certain
shots on the run or certain shots that would get by other guys. In
his mother's womb, I think God spent a little extra time on his
right shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, the No. 1 seed, has only one seeded player remaining in
his half of the draw. He could meet No. 9 seed Thomas Enqvist in a
quarterfinal match if he is able to get past Jonas Bjorkman.
</P>
<P>
   With no play today, Sampras again will have one day off to
rehabilitate the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sore,'' Sampras said. ``Two days off definitely helped.
Yesterday, I was praying for rain and got it, which is nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's sore and it's probably going to continue to be sore
and I just need to find a way to play on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's draw lost French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten, the
No. 4 seed, who fell to Alexander Popp 7-6 (6), 6-2, 6-1. Kuerten,
who was suffering from a cold, said he felt lethargic.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I played two days ago, I felt a little bit worse, with
fever,'' Kuerten said. ``I was not feeling really, really bad, just
weak. I could run, could play, but not full of energy. That's
enough to be out of a tournament like this.''
</P>
<P>
   It was enough for Popp, ranked No. 163 in the world, to
characterize the match as the best he's had.

Todd Martin on Friday, had an easier time Saturday against Jerome
Golmard for a 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 victory. No. 12 seed Patrick Rafter
also advanced.
</P>
<P>
   And No. 10 seed Mark Philippoussis prevailed in a marathon,
pulling out a 38-game fifth set to beat Sjeng Schalken 4-6, 6-3,
6-7 (7) 7-6 (4), 20-18.
</P>
<P>
   The 83 games were the most in a match at Wimbledon since 1970,
before tiebreakers were used, and the time (5 hours, 5 minutes) was
the longest since the 5:12 victory by Pancho Gonzalez over Charlie

MERCKER EAGER TO GET BACK ON MOUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Pitcher Kent Mercker admitted he's put on
about seven or eight pounds in the past seven weeks since having a
cerebral hemorrhage on the Edison Field mound May 11. But he says
he's completely recovered and said he believes he could be pitching
in the majors in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   That's not going to happen, but Mercker is obviously eager to
get back to pitching. He rejoined the team Saturday and plans to
remain with the team until he's ready. He had a precautionary
angiogram Friday at USC Medical Center, for peace of mind more than
anything else. Doctors have all but ruled out an aneurysm as the
cause for the hemorrhage, meaning there is virtually no risk of
another occurring.
</P>
<P>
   The good news out of his situation, Mercker says, is that he got
to hang around his Dublin, Ohio, home with his family in the spring
and summer months.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all that money I've spent on landscaping, I finally got
to see the flowers and trees with leaves on them,'' he said. ``I'm
glad I was home. If I was here I probably would have rushed. I
would have sneaked out in the hall to play catch and been right
back in the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker said the Angels training staff will treat him like a
post-concussion patient, which would include monitoring his blood
pressure while he rides an exercise bike.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Mercker's hopes to return in 10 days, manager Mike
Scioscia said: ``That's wildly optimistic, but I'm not going to say
it's not possible.''
</P>
<P>
   QUICK CAREER HIGH: Garret Anderson's home run Friday was his
22nd, a career high. He did it in less than half the season, but he
continues to say he's not trying to hit home runs. Going into
Saturday's game, eight of his last 18 hits were homers. Of
Anderson's 77 hits this season, 39 have been singles and 38 have
been for extra-bases (22 homers, 15 doubles, one triple).
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is still hitting just .241, but lately has been hitting
to the opposite field, a sign his swing might be coming around.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm over there on that side of the field, things are
going pretty good because I'm just reacting to the ball,'' Anderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson began this season as a .300 lifetime hitter. It might
be difficult for him to reach .300 this season, but Scioscia would
like to see him get close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he's not a .240 hitter,'' Scioscia said. ``We'd much
rather see him hit .270 or .280 with the 110 RBI he's capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   IDLE DUO: Derrick Turnbow and Edgard Clemente haven't done much
for the Angels this season, but they're not going anywhere. Turnbow
is a Rule V draftee, meaning if the Angels wanted to send him to
the minors, they would first have to offer him back to his original
team, the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Clemente, the nephew of Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente, is out
of options, meaning if the Angels wanted to send him to the minors,
Clemente could opt for free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Turnbow, the 12th pitcher on a 12-man staff, has pitched only 11
2/3 innings in nine games this season, mostly in a mop-up role. But
he's pitched relatively well and has a 3.86 ERA. Still, Scioscia
says if not for Turnbow's Rule V restriction, he'd be pitching in a
high Single-A league this season.
</P>
<P>
   Clemente has struggled as a pinch-hitter and part-time DH. He's
hitting .182 (10 for 55), but did make a game-saving throw from
right field in Minnesota last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a tremendous amount of potential,'' Scioscia said. ``We
want to get him as many at-bats as we can, but we also have
responsibility to get production right now, and (Scott) Spiezio is
producing from the right side.'' &QL;

SPARKS' WIN STREAK HITS 8 WITH VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KERRY MURRAY  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Sparks continue to be the
WNBA's hottest team as they extended their winning streak to eight
games and defeated the Cleveland Rockers 75-67 on Saturday evening
at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   But that streak, Delisha Milton said, means nothing to the
Sparks. They're thinking playoffs and working to win as many games
as they can.
</P>
<P>
   And in some ways, coach Michael Cooper added, Los Angeles'
recent success only makes them more of a target for other teams.
</P>
<P>
   For Cleveland, the most recent team to gun after the Sparks, a
full-court pressure zone nearly stopped Los Angeles' impressive
streak, the longest run in the WNBA this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gutsy win,'' Cooper said. ``Our defense was superb
and that was what kept us in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles outrebounded the Rockers 38-23. Both teams shot
nearly identical percentages _ Los Angeles hit 42.6 percent from
the field and Cleveland hit 42.3 _ so the true difference in the
game came down to defense and the Sparks being able to recover from
the Rockers' testy zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time in this league that I've seen a full-court
pressure zone,'' Cooper said. ``It's not so much a nuisance, but a
delay method.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland started the game with man-to-man defense but after the
Rockers' leading scorer, Eva Nemacova, left the game with a
sprained left knee six minutes into the first half, coach Dan
Hughes launched the zone to try to close a 23-12 Los Angeles lead.
</P>
<P>
   The change worked, as Cleveland immediately worked its way back
into the game with a 12-2 run and eventually took its first lead of
the game at 27-26.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are such a good transition team,'' Hughes said. ``We
wanted to slow that down.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Los Angeles was the team to enter the locker room with a
37-35 lead at half.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland came back and challenged in the second half, keeping
Los Angeles in check. With less than three minutes left, the
Rockers even came so close as to tie 64-64, but Los Angeles went on
one final run to end the game with a comfortable eight-point edge.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles was led by Lisa Leslie's 22 points and Milton's 12
boards. Chastity Melvin took over for Nemacova's absence, scoring
18 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks return to the Forum today for a 5 p.m. PDT game
against the Detroit Shockers. &QL;

Burton holds off Jarrett to claim tight Pepsi 400
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Jeff Burton held off Dale Jarrett in the
final four laps to win the Pepsi 400 Saturday night and ruin
Jarrett's hopes of making it three consecutive victories at
Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   It also reversed the results of the Daytona 500 in February when
Jarrett finished ahead of Burton to win the season-opening event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The restart at the end was tough because the best in the
business was behind me,'' said Burton, who earned his first victory
at Daytona. ``I blocked him pretty hard, but that's what you've got
to do. He was going to have to knock me out of the way to get by
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace was third, Mark Martin fourth and Ricky Rudd
finished fifth in a clean sweep for Ford drivers in front of an
estimated crowd at 170,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett moved up from 29th in the final 40 laps after a lug nut
problem caused him to have a 31-second pit stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we made a run at it,'' Jarrett said. ``It wasn't
three in a row, but it was close and we gained some points.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett made several attempts to move around Burton's No. 99
Exide Batteries Taurus, but Burton cut him off every time. They
went to the checkered flag with Jarrett up against Burton's bumper,
finishing .149 seconds back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really big for our race team,'' said Burton, whose
average speed was 148.576 mph. ``Our team needed a kick in the
pants and this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Spencer prompted the final caution flag of the race when
he went spinning down the backstretch with seven laps to go. That
set up a four-lap shootout for the victory, with Burton in front,
Jarrett second and Dale Earnhardt third.
</P>
<P>
   But Earnhardt got shuffled back to eighth when Wallace and
Martin lined up to move Earnhardt out of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt still gained ground on Winston Cup points leader Bobby
Labonte, who finished 12th. Earnhardt is only 52 points behind
Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like Jarrett was going to lead from start to finish
Saturday after starting on the pole in the No. 88 Quality Care
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the event was as boring as it gets for
restrictor-plate racing because there wasn't a single pass for the
lead in the first 58 laps, something that never had happened in the
41-year history of the event.
</P>
<P>
   The first caution flag of the race came on lap 53 of the 180-lap
event because of debris on the track in turn 2. That bought about
the first pit stops of the race, and Wallace appeared to move up
from fifth to second as the leaders headed back on the track.
</P>
<P>
   But Wallace was penalized for speeding on pit road and forced to
go to the back of the lead lap, placing Wallace 40th for the
restart.
</P>
<P>
   The first lead change came on the restart lap when Bill Elliott
lined up with Tony Stewart, Burton and Martin to push past Jarrett
and move him to the fifth spot.
</P>
<P>
   The first accident came on lap 81 and ended the night for Terry
Labonte, Michael Waltrip and Jeremy Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip was on the outside of Labonte as the two cars passed the
start-finish line. Labonte's Kellogg's Chevrolet started to spin
backward and went into the wall, hitting hard on the driver's side
of the car. Waltrip also slid sideways down the frontstretch before
he was hit by Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte briefly lost consciousness when he hit the wall, but he
walked away on his own. The Corpus Christi native was taken to the
Halifax Medical Center for a precautionary CAT scan, which was
negative. Mayfield suffered a bruised shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   That accident brought about the second round of pit stops and
moved Ward Burton to the front on the restart at lap 90, but
Elliott moved back to the lead three laps later.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Pruett hit the wall in turn 1 to bring out the next
caution on lap 104. Jeff Burton was in front after the next rounds
of pits, but Johnny Benson passed him for the lead one lap later.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the first time Benson had led a race since he was in
front in the final laps of the Daytona 500 five months ago before
Jarrett and a line of Fords slipped past him.
</P>
<P>
   Another accident came with 46 laps to go when Mike Skinner
bumped Elliott from behind and caused Elliott's back wheels to lift
in the air as Elliott spun around and crashed hard into the wall
nose first entering turn 3.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who had run among the leaders all night, was furious
when he climbed out of the McDonald's Ford. He pushed away a safety
official and walked up the track, pointing angrily at Skinner as
Skinner went by him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I knew why it happened,'' Elliott said. ``I got hit and
the next thing I knew is I was going head on into the wall. This
type of racing is aggravating and it gets worse as you get late in
the race because more guys take chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's crash brought the lead cars into the pits for the
final time. Jeff Burton's crew chief, Frank Stoddard, elected to
take a chance and only change the right-side tires so Burton could
gain track position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gutsy move by Frankie, but it proved to be the right
thing to do,'' said Burton, who earned $152,450 for the victory.
``If your car isn't handling well, you will fall back in a hurry
here by only changing two tires. But our car was handling so well
that we were confident it would work.''

<P>
   For six innings, though, Washburn looked as though he might top
Cooper's performance. Washburn took a no-hitter into the seventh
inning, when he gave up solo homers to Olmedo Saenz and Matt
Stairs. Stairs' homer came with two out and ended Washburn's night
after 6 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn (4-2) wasn't dominant _ he walked five and retired the
side in order only twice _ but he was effective. Like Cooper the
night before, he relied on his defense to get him through.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I don't think his command was as sharp
as other games he's pitched,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.
``He worked behind (in the count) a lot. But when he got behind he
came up with some good pitches. This is what Jarrod Washburn is
about. He battled. He has tremendous poise on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have good command, they made me throw a lot of
pitches, I didn't think I threw well at all,'' Washburn said.
</P>
<P>
   He might not have had a chance at a no-hitter even if he got
through the seventh. He made 93 pitches through six innings and was
tired by the time he came out, having made 107 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if it was going to be a no-hitter it was going to have
to be a combined no-hitter,'' Washburn said. ``I would have fought
(coming out). but it would have been a losing battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn added he didn't doubt Scioscia would have the guts to
take him out even with a no-hitter going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would have,'' Washburn said. ``He's got a lot of
guts. I don't think he'd hesitate when it's best for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn joked he thought about the no-hitter in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to limit hits every game,'' he said. ``The less
hits I give up, the better outing I should have. I try to give up
no hits every game. Some guys say they're not conscious of (a
no-hitter), but I'm conscious of it the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the A's had no hits through six, they were putting
the ball in play, as Washburn had only one strikeout (he finished
with two). And he got a good defensive play in the sixth to keep
the no-hitter intact.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Benji Gil ranged to his left to backhand Randy
Velarde's grounder and make a perfect throw to first for the second
out of the inning. Washburn also got double-play grounders to end
both the second and fifth innings.
</P>
<P>
   The no-hit drama ended quickly, however, when Saenz slammed
Washburn's second pitch of the seventh inning _ his 95th pitch of
the game _ over the left-center field fence 417 feet away. Two outs
later, Stairs got his, and Washburn was replaced by Al Levine, who
pitched the final 2 1/3 innings and gave up only one hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had only eight hits, four off A's starter Ariel
Prieto (1-1), but they made them count. Mo Vaughn was the only
Angel with more than one hit, getting three singles and driving in
two runs. Bengie Molina hit a two-run homer, his second home run in
two days.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also got help from the A's defense, which made three
errors _ two that directly led to two unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   Because Seattle also won, the Angels remained five games out in
the AL West. But they moved to within 3 1/2 of second-place Oakland
and went four games over .500 (42-38) for only the third time this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Angels third baseman Troy Glaus went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts
and is hitless in his last 14 at-bats. It marked the first time
this season he has gone hitless in three consecutive games. &QL;

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Peavine Watershed Alliance is only 3 years old,
but Georgia water experts already are calling it a model for
solving the state's water pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
   To clean the Chattahoochee, you've got to prevent stuff from all
those little creeks and streams that flow into the river from ever
getting there, says Frank Carubba, a state expert in runoff
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``A local watershed effort is the foundation for everything,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   It all boils down to how water acts when natural areas are
replaced with pavement that doesn't soak up the water. The result:
Meandering creeks such as Lullwater, a tributary of Peavine Creek,
receive torrents of dirty runoff from parking lots, driveways and
rooftops. The unnatural deluge undermines the roots of trees along
creeks and destroys the banks that nourish delicate plant and
animal life.
</P>
<P>
   The Peavine Alliance started with one woman and one garden club
fed up with seeing beautiful trees and plants literally going down
the creek, says Patricia White, Peavine's founder and full-time
volunteer director.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-year resident of the Atlanta neighborhood Druid Hills,
White started noticing changes in Lullwater Creek in the mid-'70s.
Her garden club cares for a 6-acre conservation park along
Lullwater Creek, and older members remember when the creek was
small enough for them to hop across.
</P>
<P>
   Garden club pictures from the 1940s show a clear creek, no more
than a few feet across. Now Lullwater is one of the state's
``impaired'' waterways, meaning it has reached the maximum
pollution it can tolerate. It is 25 feet wide in places, due to
polluted storm water runoff, and you could drown in its roaring
brown waters after a storm. During a drought like we have now, when
there's less water in our streams, it's more important than ever to
make sure the little water we have is clean, White says.
</P>
<P>
   A watershed is a drainage area where all the water runs to a
single point, like Peavine Creek. A lot can be done in a watershed
to prevent pollution and restore natural conditions. It's all about
how things are planted and built _ street by street, house by
house, creek by creek. One of Peavine's active members, for
example, is Robert Reed, an architect who creates ``creekkeeper''
homes with gutter systems that flow into cisterns and absorbent
surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   White says it wasn't until the '90s that she and her neighbors
really understood how dramatically urban runoff was changing the
luscious environment that lends character to the Peavine
neighborhoods _ Lake Claire, Candler Park, Druid Hills and part of
Decatur. White began asking her environmental friends what a
neighborhood could do to hold onto its creeks and greenery. She
contacted Tom Schueler at the nonprofit Center for Watershed
Protection in Maryland. He warned her if she got involved in
community watershed protection, she'd never be uninvolved.
</P>
<P>
   He was right, White says with a laugh. With the help of
neighborhood leaders and a small grant from a local conservation
group, White organized a steering committee and launched the
Peavine Watershed Alliance on July 10, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no scientific expert,'' she said, ``but I'm pretty expert
at organizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, with board members representing 14
organizations, including Fernbank Museum, Paideia School, Druid
Hills Golf Club, Emory University and three local governments,
Peavine won a $250,000 grant for a watershed management plan. It
was the first professional plan for a community watershed
organization in the state.
</P>
<P>
   White is proud of the alliance's accomplishments. There are
quarterly educational workshops. In creek cleanups, members have
pulled out bedsprings, old wheels and the like. They produce
newsletters and encourage involvement of most of the nine schools
located within the watershed. Decatur High School's ``ecoteam''
monitors and tests stream quality, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Peavine also mentors four emerging watershed alliances: South
DeKalb, Rock Creek, Little River and Proctor Creek. Working with
the Georgia Adopt-a-Stream program, Peavine funded a video about
the effort, titled ``Building a Watershed Alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes plans to utilize it in pushing for a state water
management plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, White's work isn't just about pollution
prevention and community organizing. It's about the relationship of
people to water, about ``rivers of life,'' as she puts it.

 &HT;    Growing numbers of people enjoying the RV lifestyle
 &HT;    By Stephanie Allmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When Julie Swanson's husband talked about buying a
recreational vehicle six years ago, she wasn't too excited about
the idea. The couple had never been avid travelers and they already
had a home to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, nah, we didn't need anything like that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But after spending time with folks at an RV ``jamboree'' who
cooked and ate together, played games and reminisced about all the
places they'd traveled, she quickly changed her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those people seemed to have so much fun, so we saw them
having a ball and thought, well, we needed something to do after we
got older,'' she said. ``And we've been going ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 72-year-old Julie is the immediate past president of the
Bosque River chapter of the Good Sam RV travel club, (short for
``Good Samaritan''). Her husband, Gordon, also 72, is the Texas
state treasurer for the Good Sam Club. They spend at least one
weekend a month in their 34-foot Georgie Boy motor home and
sometimes take excursions for several weeks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The camaraderie of RVers and free-spirited RV lifestyle that
attracted the Swansons is also helping to draw in millions of
Americans who want freedom and flexibility when they travel. The
RV-traveling population, once dominated by retired snowbirds, is
quickly becoming more diverse with the influx of baby boomers and
those with discretionary income.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 study conducted by the University of Michigan found there
were almost 10 million RVs on the road. Since 1993, RV ownership in
households headed by boomers age 45 to 54 years old had increased
by 25 percent. RV-owning boomers with families now outnumber the
traditional core market of over-55 empty-nesters, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Affordability and flexibility in traveling attracts many people
to RVs, said Jeff Beddow, spokesperson for the Recreation Vehicle
Industry Association. A survey by the organization found that RV
travelers save an average of $1,700 per year on travel. In
addition, an RV is considered a second home by the IRS, making
interest payments tax deductible.
</P>
<P>
   But ask most RVers, be they ``full-timers'' or weekend
travelers, and they'll tell you the appeal of RV travel lies in
intangibles, such as friendships made in campgrounds and the
ability to get away at a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just like being able to go out, not having to be confined
in a hotel or a motel and having our own facilities,'' said William
Teat of Bellmead, who, with his wife Eva, has been RV-traveling for
30 years. In that time, they have owned six different RVs. Now,
they own a 30-foot ``fifth wheel'' RV that they pull behind a
one-ton pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just kind of leave your cares behind and just enjoy the
trip and the fellowship with the different RVers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Teats, like the Swansons, belong to an RV travel club and
often drive in caravans and camp with 20 to 30 other rigs, he said.
Driving vehicles as big as RVs is awkward at first, but ``it's not
too bad after you get used to it,'' he said. The travel clubs keep
in touch with CBs or cell phones and alert each other if they're
having problems.
</P>
<P>
   Once they get to a campground, they hook up to water,
electricity and sewer lines. Then, the fun and relaxation begins.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Swanson said a typical day in an RV might start with
sleeping in later than usual, cooking breakfast from foods she
either brought from home or bought at a roadside grocery store, and
then watching TV. Around lunch time, she said, campers start
visiting each other in their RVs. They go for walks or drive into a
nearby town in a car that someone has towed behind an RV. At night,
campers may have ``pot luck'' dinners, in which they all cook
different dishes and come together for dinner. They play cards or
table games inside or outside each others' RVs.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson remembers one cold night in Amarillo when she cooked a
pot of chili and invited 30 or 40 other campers over to eat and to
warm up inside her motor home. Some campgrounds have recreation
centers, tennis courts, playgrounds or swimming pools, which
attract entire families.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds like a pretty relaxed life, it is, Swanson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just a bunch of happy wanderers, and we love to get
together,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Swansons have met some of their best friends on the road and
frequently receive invitations to visit them all over the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   RVers are typically independent, quiet, free-spirited people,
said Red Tiner, owner of Concord Trailer Park in Bellmead. He rents
spaces for about $170 a month to people who want to live in RVs.
While some call their RV their home and don't stray from the park,
others take off and travel for months at a time, he said. While
they're gone, he tends to their property. That's one of the major
advantages he sees to living in an RV full time.
</P>
<P>
   But many RV owners are reluctant to sell their homes and move
into their RVs because they don't want to give up the stability of
their lives, he said. So instead, they travel in an RV from their
home base.
</P>
<P>
   Being in an RV, though, is not unlike being at home. Most have
all the amenities of home, such as bathrooms, kitchens and
bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   There's an RV to fit virtually any lifestyle and price range,
said Jerry Harrison, manager of Mack's Camper Sales in Robinson. On
the low end are pop-up campers that sell for about $4,000. Motor
homes, which are not towed but driven from the front, can cost
several hundred thousand dollars, he said. Most RV dealers require
a down payment but will finance them over 10 or 15 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   RVs have changed and improved through the years just like homes
and cars, Harrison said. Popular now are campers or motor homes
with ``slide-out'' rooms, which expand at the touch of a button
into large living rooms or bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Other RVs have furniture that folds into the walls, making room
inside for motorcyles and other small vehicles. Many also come with
satellite and Internet hookups, he said, keeping travelers
connected to the ``outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   Owning an RV takes maintenance, even off the road, Teat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not hard to keep, but they keep you busy doing
things,'' he said. ``There are always little things that need to be
done _ like fixing lights.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Teat is off the road, it doesn't take much for him to get
the ``itch'' to travel again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spontaneous trips are the best,'' he said. ``That's my
favorite thing _ just getting away and going to see things. When we
do that, we just kind of play it by ear. If we see someplace we
like to stop, we just do it.''

   SOLARMAX _ The northern lights, including rare red colored
auroras, have been seen as far south as the Carolinas. In Alaska
and Greenland, radio frequencies used by aviators and mariners have
been hit by sudden fadeouts. NASA, worried that unusual heating of
the Earth's atmosphere was dragging down its space station, had to
use the space shuttle to boost it to a higher altitude. It's the
summer of the hyperactive sun, Cycle 23. Every 11 years or so, the
storms that rage across the surface of the sun reach a frenzied
peak, flinging charged particles and hot gases into space with
predictable _ and sometimes unpredictable _ consequences for the
increasingly wired world on the third rock from the sun. ``Solar
activity is expected to peak in the next month or two,'' says
Ernest Hildner, director of the government's space weather center
in Colorado. ``Every cycle is different, but there is no question
that our society is more vulnerable now than it ever has been.''

book became a best seller and Shiller an instant celebrity,
appearing on TV and in the financial press, where he defended his
views with quiet assurance. His basic argument is that common
stocks have risen in price to levels that are unsupported _ and
unsupportable _ by the profit prospects of U.S. corporations. The
other side of that argument is another book, ``Dow 36,000,'' which
was published in September and also became a best seller. (Walker,

 &HT;    Student activists tend to issues big and small
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Lacy Elwood has a gripe with the media. And here's
what she's going to do about it: She's going to improve it from
within.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Read has an answer to those who gripe that ``government
is the problem.'' Stop griping, she'll say, and be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   At this point Read and Elwood, can only claim to have been a
part of student government. The distinction is immaterial. It's all
the same thing ultimately: people taking charge of events and
making as many as possible feel in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Recently when the Texas Association of Student Councils (TASC)
convened for its annual conference, activities involving both
students were recognized. The student councils from Mart High
School, where Read just graduated, and Connally High, where Elwood
just finished up, were among four Waco-area contingents receiving
the association's sweepstakes award. The other area sweepstakes
winners were China Spring and Clifton.
</P>
<P>
   Jointly, they are answers to the age-old whine, ``What's become
of the youth of America?''
</P>
<P>
   In the year since Columbine, we've made like cicadas in the
night, strumming up fears and generating no light.
</P>
<P>
   Elwood resents the national media portrayal. She's going to
study journalism at Baylor University in hopes of doing it better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how hard it is to get a good story. (But) it seemed
like every time we turned around there was something bad to
report'' when the subject was young people.
</P>
<P>
   Those reports did not include, for instance, the effort Connally
kids exerted to raise money for a freshman girl who survived a
traffic accident that claimed another student's life.
</P>
<P>
   The student council tapped student mirth amid tragedy and held a
male ``beauty pageant'' _ the most beauteous having raised the most
money. The ``Miss CHS'' contestants rang up $2,000 in a week. In
sum, it was a statement of caring and good humor.
</P>
<P>
   Elwood, the Connally Class of 2000 salutatorian, had the unusual
experience of being student council president as a junior last
year, then served in a support role her senior year. There was a
lot do.
</P>
<P>
   The Connally student leaders got a taste of organizational rigor
as host council for the state TASC convention in Austin, bringing
into the mix the Cadet marching band, jazz band and choir. They
also hosted 500 students for a district conference.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the world-changing worth of student government isn't
in the deeds _ no one expects high schoolers to save the world _
but in the doing. It shows what's possible.
</P>
<P>
   In Mart, a student council led by Read ran up a long list of
accomplishments and in-school projects: drug education, energy
conservation on campus, a safe-prom initiative. The council also
did things for others: a Veterans Day assembly, Food for Families,
a Halloween party for Head Start.
</P>
<P>
   Read, who will attend Texas A&AMP;M this fall, said being in student
government means bucking a tide of negative impressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once young people see they can do something they'll do it,''
she said. ``The hard thing is showing the other people in the
community how much we really do.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Read is organizing a citywide cleanup this month
for junior high and high school students, tentatively set July 29,
through First Methodist Church of Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Will she seek out a role in student government at A&AMP;M? Are an
Aggie's corpuscles maroon? (Answer: Emphatic yes.)

 &HT;    Who's running the South?
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ Stroll the marble _ or, depending where you are,
reinforced concrete _ walls of any Southern capitol in this
turn-of-the-century year, and you will notice many things that
appear untouched by the new era.
</P>
<P>
   The past few decades have witnessed revolutionary changes in the
racial and gender makeup of Southern legislatures and the awakening
of the Republican Party in the South. A generation of Southern
governors _ often with the presidency as their ultimate goal _ have
pushed impatiently to modernize their state governments.
</P>
<P>
   But outside the chambers where an increasing share of the most
important decisions affecting the region are made, those who make
the laws and those who would have the laws made their way still
engage in a familiar mating dance. In many states, a seasoned
observer can tell you in what corner of a capitol hallway a certain
kind of deal might be cut, based on which lobbyist stands there
every day and which legislator passes by.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South has always been the region where (interest) groups
have predominated, probably because of the weakness of any
countervailing force like strong political parties,'' wrote
academics Clive Thomas and Ronald Hrebenar in an article for State
Legislatures magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the splintering of power _ between Republicans and
Democrats, blacks and whites, governors and their increasingly
independent legislatures _ appears only to have strengthened the
hands of the lobbyists. At the same time, the number of those
waiting in the halls to catch a legislator's ear has exploded all
around the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alabama is a dream state for lobbyists,'' said Milo Dakin,
whose clients include several gaming interests. The Legislature
gives itself such flexibility, he said, that there is virtually no
certainty what is going to happen from day to day _ ``an ideal
climate for a lobbyist.'' The governor no longer has a controlling
hand, and a skillful lobbyist who can influence 30 or 40 votes is
``just as likely to have a majority as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I registered here in 1978, you could put all the
lobbyists in the Capitol on a school bus,'' Dakin said. ``Now you
couldn't get them all on an Amtrak train.''
</P>
<P>
   `NEW ECONOMY', NEW LOBBYING
</P>
<P>
   It was easy for Calvin Kytle and James MacKay to frame the
question in their landmark 1947 study, ``Who Runs Georgia?'' In
those days, Georgia Power Co., a few businesses and the state's
agricultural interests were the only players in the Legislature's
yearly power struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, the answer Kytle and MacKay came up with _ ``a
few executives in a few corporations, together with a few skilled
politicians'' _ still sufficed for much of the South. But as the
``new economy'' begins to affect the region, the old system is
beginning to mutate in interesting ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who runs North Carolina? There are a lot more answers than
there used to be,'' said Ran Coble, executive director of the North
Carolina Center for Public Policy Research.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, the center has polled North Carolina legislators,
Capitol reporters and lobbyists to rank the 50 most influential
lobbyists in Raleigh. It's not a fool-proof measure of political
influence. Some of the most effective lobbyists, after all, are
those who attract the least notice. But the ranking does give some
indications of how things are changing.
</P>
<P>
   There used to be more lobbyists on the list who worked
exclusively for one or two big clients, winning the favor of key
committee members and weighing in as the voice of the company when
its interests were at stake.
</P>
<P>
   These days, some of the most effective lobbyists are
free-lancers brought together temporarily to work as a team on a
specific issue. That mirrors Alabama, where it is not unusual,
according to Dakin, for a lobbyist to hire another lobbyist on a
spot contract for a day, simply to win the vote of a specific
legislator with whom that lobbyist has close ties.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer lobbyists from the old trio of tobacco, textiles and
furniture are showing up on the North Carolina list, and there are
more lobbyists for health care, hogs and homebuilders _ a
reflection of the state's changing economy.
</P>
<P>
   More public interest lobbyists and women have been ranked in
recent years, along with lobbyists representing a growing number of
new companies, such as those that have sprung up around the
Research Triangle near here. With the ``new economy,'' observed
Ferroll Guillory, director of the Southern politics program at the
University of North Carolina, has come an interest in issues _
``livability,'' sprawl, day care _ the Old Guard was not much
concerned with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that a relatively small number of companies and
the Farm Bureau carried the political weight in this state. Today,
political power is spread out over a diverse group of individuals
and organizations and companies,'' said Don Beason, a lobbyist with
several major business clients who is ranked No. 2 on the center's
list.
</P>
<P>
   This trend has been widened by the increasing complexity of the
problems state legislatures grapple with, and the devolution
movement, which over the past decade has transferred an increasing
share of responsibility back to the states.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time a few years ago, observed Bobby Kahn, chief of
staff to Gov. Roy Barnes, when a committee meeting on health care
might draw only a lobbyist for the Medical Association of Georgia.
These days, with hospitals, nursing homes, medical specialties and
public interest groups looking to their own interests, the same
meeting might draw several lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Dakin, who has lobbied in several Southern states, traces the
proliferation back to the 1970s, when California, with its auto
emissions legislation, sent a message to national corporations that
they could no longer confine their efforts at winning influence to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   MORE MONEY IN STATE POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   Simply registering to lobby in a state is likely to trigger a
barrage of letters from legislators asking for campaign donations.
Just as much as the increased costs of campaigning, the enlargement
of the donor pool appears to be contributing to the staggering
increase in the costs of politics at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   The states don't have uniform reporting procedures, and it is
much harder to get comprehensive statistics about campaign finances
at the state level than the federal. But there are strong
indications the South's capitols have witnessed an inflation in
costs that rivals Washington.
</P>
<P>
   According to a public interest group, the North Carolina Forum
for Research and Economic Education, what the average winner spent
in a North Carolina Senate race rose from $36,301 in 1994 to
$82,161 in 1996 and $110,638 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And the spending figures don't tell the entire story. Much of
the money being raised from lobbyists and their clients is going
into the coffers of powerful legislators who have weak or often no
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the cases where their races aren't contested, they're
raising lots of money to chase away possible opponents and to
funnel money to their colleagues,'' said Bob Hall, director of
Democracy South, a public interest group based in Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   A few states have attempted to contain campaign spending at the
legislative level, but this has proved difficult. Florida, for
instance, has a $500 cap on contributions to state races, but it
allows unlimited soft money contributions to the state parties,
which in turn have great flexibility in getting money back to the
candidates. For example, soft money contributions to the Florida
Republican Party, which now controls the Legislature, jumped from
$9.9 million in 1996 to $24.3 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by Florida Common Cause, health care
interests and the insurance industry each contributed more than
$442,000 to the two parties in the first three months of this year,
when the Legislature was about to consider a measure that affected
patients' right to sue their HMOs. The measure failed. So did
legislation affecting the sale of generic drugs, after
pharmaceutical interests contributed more than $79,000.
</P>
<P>
   The increased emphasis on political action committees and
campaign contributions does not sit well with Dakin, schooled in
the ``eyeball-to-eyeball'' approach. But, he says, ``the system
runs on revolving funds,'' and lobbyists understand they have to
open their checkbooks to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   He prefers the ``personal touch,'' which sometimes means
ordering carry-out dinner for 150 or 200 people in a committee room
without making a big deal about who picked up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing the game doesn't just mean campaign contributions.
Playing the game means being there all the time, every time,''
Dakin said.
</P>
<P>
   SHADOW SECTORS
</P>
<P>
   Along with money and personal contacts between powerful
executives, their lobbyists and the legislators, a traditional
source of power throughout the South has been the number of
employees _ and voters _ companies such as Carolina Power &AMP; Light
had in legislative districts throughout North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Guillory observed, these local powerhouses are
being outnumbered by companies, such as EDS, which are
headquartered out of the state, or, as is the case with
Glaxo-Wellcome, out of the country. These companies do not often
leave the same deep footprint in the Capitol corridors.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the noticeable developments across the region is
the rise of what might be called shadow sectors: big business
interests that either can't, or choose not to, play the traditional
game of statehouse power politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling in Louisiana and tourism in Florida provide contrasting
examples of the effect shadow sectors can have.
</P>
<P>
   While observers detect a splintering of business interests
elsewhere, John Maginnis, who has written several books on
Louisiana politics, says the biggest change in that state's power
politics the last few years has been the unifying of business
interests under the banner of LABI, the Louisiana Association of
Business and Industry.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the business lobby hung together to defeat a proposed
oil and gas processing tax supported by Gov. Mike Foster, who
helped unify the business community to pass his tort reform
measures and has since been foiled by business in his attempt to
find new revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and gas gets off the hook, Maginnis said, because the
Legislature can always hang another tax increase on casinos and
video poker. The gaming sector spent enormous political capital to
gain entrance into Louisiana, and with its revenues skyrocketing it
has little influence to prevent its becoming a cash cow for the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louisiana's always been able to survive on other people's
money,'' Maginnis said. ``It used to be oil and gas, and now
gambling has started to fill the gap.'' But ``taxing Texans,'' as
they call it in Louisiana, only puts off the day when the state
will have to reckon with the shortcomings in its tax structure, he
contends.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Florida would describe the tourist industry as a
pushover at the Legislature, but it is subdued in the role it
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think Disney and some of the Central Florida
entertainment attractions would run the state. But Disney is a very
low-profile corporate citizen in Tallahassee,'' said Richard
Pinsky, a lobbyist and Republican campaign consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it was directly affected, he noted, Disney didn't
flex any muscles when a proposal to tax cruise ships came up _
aware, perhaps, that the measure was going to fail anyway. But the
tourist sector also didn't speak up for itself this year, he said,
when the South Florida counties eliminated auto emissions testing,
a move that could lead to more pollution, tighter government
restrictions and fewer tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Southern states, which have been generous in
bestowing incentives to new industries, Florida has lost a number
of businesses to Arizona and other states. That is due in part,
Pinsky believes, to tourism, which brings revenue into the state
and has little interest in attracting more industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the changes being felt in the Southern economy are only
slowly being reflected in terms of influence in state legislatures.
The old giants still wield considerable power _ but they do so in a
more crowded field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question tobacco has less clout today than 30 years
ago. There's also no question they still have a lot of clout,''
Coble said of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Similar things are said about oil and gas in Louisiana and
agriculture in Florida. The old powers still ply the statehouse
halls, seeking to wield influence. But the halls are a lot more
crowded these days.

 &HT;    City seeks diversity to save small-town soul
 &HT;    By Karen Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ White people in Decatur, Ga. want more black
neighbors. They also want more neighbors who are poor.
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the sentiments behind a proposed strategic plan for
the city's next decade. The report, scheduled for a vote by city
commissioners July 17, is based on comments made during a series of
public meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people at the meetings were well-to-do whites. Over
and over, they said that they want to save the ethnic and economic
diversity that gives their city its markedly off-beat beat.
</P>
<P>
   They're afraid that skyrocketing property values are forcing
low-income residents _ especially elderly African-Americans _ to
move out of Decatur because rising assessments are making their tax
bills unaffordable. They're worried that police officers and
waiters can't afford to live near where they work.
</P>
<P>
   They're willing, they say, to grant the tax breaks and denser
zonings needed for developers to build lower- and middle-income
homes and apartments. They're willing to pay for marketing programs
to bring more minority residents to the city.
</P>
<P>
   They say Decatur can't become home only to wealthy whites
because it will cost the city of 17,400 its small-town soul.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING PRICED OUT
</P>
<P>
   The average sale price of an existing home in Decatur jumped 31
percent in the past three years, from $142,781 in 1997 to $186,614
in 1999. A new home in 1997 cost $202,367 on average; in 1999, it
was 20 percent more, at $242,430.
</P>
<P>
   The price increase reflects a major societal shift. Forty years
ago, many of Decatur's white residents stampeded out to homogenous
suburbs as black people moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Wilson, Decatur's first black mayor, has said that
when she moved into the then-predominantly white Oakhurst
neighborhood in 1966, she awoke the next morning to find the white
neighbors on either side of her new home gone.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cope, a 54-year-old white Decatur native, estimated that
three-quarters of his family's friends moved while he was in high
school. ``We thought we had good friends and they were racists,''
Cope said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960 U.S. Census showed Decatur's population was 85 percent
white and 15 percent black and other minorities. By 1990, that had
changed to 53 percent white and 47 percent black and other
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to Atlanta Regional Commission estimates,
Decatur's population is 59 percent white and 41 percent black and
other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Decatur also has more elderly residents, on average, than either
the state or nation: 18 percent are at least 62 years old, compared
to 12 percent statewide and 15 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the African-Americans who moved into Oakhurst had been
middle-class residents of Beacon Hill, a black neighborhood on
Decatur's west side. They moved when Beacon Hill was razed for a
public housing project.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're worried that they may be about to undergo what is,
in effect, a second bout of urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain things are happening that seem very familiar,'' said
City Commissioner Kecia Cunningham, an African-American whose
constituency includes most of the city's African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to low-income constituents being unable to afford
rising assessments, Cunningham said aggressive real estate agents
are taking advantage of elderly residents who don't realize the
value of their property, convincing them to sell at prices that are
too low.
</P>
<P>
   ``And even if they do hold out, the neighbors they've had for 25
or 30 years are gone,'' Cunningham said. ``It's no longer their
community.''
</P>
<P>
   City Commissioner Jim Baskett, who represents the city at large
but lives on the south side, said he gets calls weekly from elderly
constituents, black and white, worried that they'll have to move
because they can't pay their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Tax relief as a way to keep elderly residents, particularly
African-Americans, emerged as a theme two years ago at a series of
public roundtable discussions led by resident Jon Abercrombie.
</P>
<P>
   The roundtable group studying diversity was about half white,
half black, said Cope, who was a member. Cope said Abercrombie told
them, ``Decatur had to be big enough to protect the weakest members
of our city,'' Cope recalled. ``The middle-class and
upper-middle-class white people kept looking at each other and
nodding their heads and said, `You're right. It doesn't happen very
often, but it needs to happen here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   They knew, Cope said, that would mean shifting more of the tax
burden onto themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The strategic plan also notes that most city employees can't
afford to live in the town that employs them. First-year police
officers and teachers, for example, qualify as low-income residents
because their annual salaries are less than the $31,690 median for
80 percent of Decatur residents.
</P>
<P>
   The strategic plan recommends that city officials find ways to
include more affordable homes for city employees in future
development.GOOD INTENT VS. THE MARKET
</P>
<P>
   The report lacks specifics, but also calls for:
</P>
<P>
   Developing marketing programs to attract minority residents.
</P>
<P>
   Improving the condition and availability of rental housing.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing and publicizing tax breaks for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan is approved, it will become a guidebook for city
planners and the city manager to enact concrete programs and
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the battle between the report's good intentions and
the market forces driving Decatur's boom is a tossup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Backed up with appropriate public policy measures, then it
probably is possible,'' to encourage diversity, said Emory
University political scientist Michael Rich. ``But in the long run,
the market is a pretty powerful force.''
</P>
<P>
   If any community can put up a good fight, it would be Decatur,
where residents' starched white shirts cover tie-dye hearts and the
only frowned-upon lifestyle is one of conspicuous consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Decatur has a history of jumping off the beaten path. In the
1830s, residents of the young town turned down the chance to become
a major transportation hub, telling the Western and Atlantic
Railroad to move on to what is now downtown Atlanta. The money and
excitement simply weren't worth the noise and dust, they decided.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, residents said ``no thanks'' to shopping malls and
superstores, gambling that the small businesses and small houses
then being abandoned in favor of suburban sprawl would someday come
back in vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Decatur resident Tom Keating worries, though, that the city will
be missing the point if it focuses only on keeping a certain number
of minority residents. It's more important, he said, that minority
residents, no matter how many, be treated fairly.

 &HT;    Opposing best sellers indicate stock market's direction
debatable
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the Nasdaq composite index dropped like a lead
dot-com from its all-time high in March, Princeton University Press
moved up the publication date of Robert J. Shiller's book by nearly
a month to April 3.
</P>
<P>
   The book is ``Irrational Exuberance,'' a scholarly and
foreboding forecast that the common stocks we love so much are
headed for a prolonged bear market over the next 10 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The book became a best seller and Shiller an instant celebrity,
appearing on TV and in the financial press, where he defended his
views with quiet assurance.
</P>
<P>
   His basic argument is that common stocks have risen in price to
levels that are unsupported _ and unsupportable _ by the profit
prospects of U.S. corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of that argument is in the book ``Dow 36,000,''
which was published in September and also became a best seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dow 36,000'' was authored by James K. Glassman, 53, and Kevin
A. Hassett, 38, two resident scholars of the American Enterprise
Institute, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Shiller's position is that investors, Wall Street
professionals as well as individuals, have been on an irrational
buying binge that, based on history's record, will inevitably come
to an end with enormous losses followed by years of minimal
returns.
</P>
<P>
   This gloomy scenario so impressed Alan Greenspan at a private
economic briefing in 1996 that the chairman of the Federal Reserve
used the now-famous term ``irrational exuberance'' in a speech that
December.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan asked if maybe the stunning run-up in stock prices
during the 1990s was not due in part to this ``irrational
exuberance.'' His comments sent stocks tumbling from Tokyo to Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Greenspan or his speech writers apparently coined
the term. Shiller, 54, says he did not use it _ until he adopted it
as the title for his book.
</P>
<P>
   Shiller uses the price-to-earnings ratio to measure the value _
or excessive value _ of stocks. The P/E measures the price of a
share of stock relative to a company's per share profit, either
looking back or looking forward. The price is sometimes expressed
as a multiple of earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, investors have paid an average of $15 for stock in
a company earning $1 a year in profits. Today, based on the
Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks, they pay almost $30 for each
$1 in profits, and have paid more.
</P>
<P>
   Shiller notes that the S&AMP;P multiple has been as low as five
times earnings in the recession of 1920-21, to a high of 44.3 times
in January of this year. The index's P/E was 32.6 in September
1929, just before the Great Crash in October, and 20.3 in August of
1987, prior to that year's crash, also in October.
</P>
<P>
   He identifies three earlier periods of excessive stock prices _
prior to the one we are in now _ and says that each time they led
to disaster for investors.
</P>
<P>
   The market lost 67 percent of its value in the 20 years
following the turn-of-the-century peak in 1901, and almost 81
percent of its value between the October 1929 crash and January
1932. In the 20 years following the January 1966 peak of the '60s
bull market, stock returns averaged less than 2 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some event will trigger another such setback for the market,
Shiller says, pointing out that it could be any one of many causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't predict short-term moves in the stock market,'' he
says. ``Bull markets like the one we have now can go on for a long
time. But clearly we're in a nonsustainable situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Shiller's book is by common consent the most authoritative case
against long-term continuation of the bull market in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to Shiller and many other analysts who believe stocks
are overvalued and vulnerable to a fall, Glassman and Hassett in
``Dow 36,000'' argue they are a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Glassman and Hassett believe that 36,000 is where the Dow Jones
industrial average should be trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks are significantly undervalued, and they are rising in a
one-time-only positive `correction.' Reason requires a Dow of about
36,000,'' Glassman says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks were undervalued in the past because investors believed
they were riskier than they really were,'' he adds. ``Now, acting
more rationally _ that is, with less aversion to risk _ they are
bidding up the prices of stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Glassman and Hassett don't quibble with those who say that
stocks are trading at high multiples, as measured by
price-to-earnings ratios.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, they say ``so what?'' Such valuations are based on
the perceived riskiness of common stocks, when in fact stocks are
not as risky as investors fear, they contend.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the economy is in a new era that will produce the
future profits that justify the current prices of common shares.
</P>
<P>
   They deny that a stock market ``bubble'' exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``When economists talk about a bubble, what they mean is the
greater fool theory _ the idea that there's a greater fool who will
buy my stock at whatever the price,'' says Glassman.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of some individual stocks, there's no doubt that
bubbles occur. But there is some doubt that there ever has been a
bubble for the overall market, even in 1929,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dow 36,000,'' as well as ``Irrational Exuberance,'' has come
in for sharp criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Barron's columnist Gene Epstein accused Shiller of exaggerating
the current P/E by using 10 years of trailing _ backward looking _
earnings as the denominator. That submerges the big earnings surge
of recent years, Epstein says. Edward Yardeni and some other
economists argue that stocks are not as overvalued as Shiller
contends, based on projected, or forward looking, earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Glassman and Hassett are accused by critics of minimizing the
``risk factor'' of stocks too much. Bonds, the critics say, while
admittedly less rewarding than stocks, really are safer.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology says stocks have not appeared to be risky in the past
mainly because ``people have been very cautious about buying
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   But if investors begin to buy stocks based on the belief that
they are without risk, he says stock valuations will swing widely
``with the slightest bit of news.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors are unyielding. They say their books are products of
extensive research and careful thought, including comments and
observations from peers.
</P>
<P>
   As for their advice to investors and potential investors, their
positions are equally clear.
</P>
<P>
   Take your stocks out of the market, says Shiller, and put the
money in bonds and cash and other assets.
</P>
<P>
   Buy more stocks, say Glassman and Hassett. If anything, most
people do not have enough stocks in their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Still confused about who is right?
</P>
<P>
   Who isn't?

 &HT;    Who's running the South?
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ Stroll the marble _ or, depending where you are,
reinforced concrete _ walls of any Southern capitol in this
turn-of-the-century year, and you will notice many things that
appear untouched by the new era.
</P>
<P>
   The past few decades have witnessed revolutionary changes in the
racial and gender makeup of Southern legislatures and the awakening
of the Republican Party in the South. A generation of Southern
governors _ often with the presidency as their ultimate goal _ have
pushed impatiently to modernize their state governments.
</P>
<P>
   But outside the chambers where an increasing share of the most
important decisions affecting the region are made, those who make
the laws and those who would have the laws made their way still
engage in a familiar mating dance. In many states, a seasoned
observer can tell you in what corner of a capitol hallway a certain
kind of deal might be cut, based on which lobbyist stands there
every day and which legislator passes by.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South has always been the region where (interest) groups
have predominated, probably because of the weakness of any
countervailing force like strong political parties,'' wrote
academics Clive Thomas and Ronald Hrebenar in an article for State
Legislatures magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the splintering of power _ between Republicans and
Democrats, blacks and whites, governors and their increasingly
independent legislatures _ appears only to have strengthened the
hands of the lobbyists. At the same time, the number of those
waiting in the halls to catch a legislator's ear has exploded all
around the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alabama is a dream state for lobbyists,'' said Milo Dakin,
whose clients include several gaming interests. The Legislature
gives itself such flexibility, he said, that there is virtually no
certainty what is going to happen from day to day _ ``an ideal
climate for a lobbyist.'' The governor no longer has a controlling
hand, and a skillful lobbyist who can influence 30 or 40 votes is
``just as likely to have a majority as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I registered here in 1978, you could put all the
lobbyists in the Capitol on a school bus,'' Dakin said. ``Now you
couldn't get them all on an Amtrak train.''
</P>
<P>
   `NEW ECONOMY', NEW LOBBYING
</P>
<P>
   It was easy for Calvin Kytle and James MacKay to frame the
question in their landmark 1947 study, ``Who Runs Georgia?'' In
those days, Georgia Power Co., a few businesses and the state's
agricultural interests were the only players in the Legislature's
yearly power struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, the answer Kytle and MacKay came up with _ ``a
few executives in a few corporations, together with a few skilled
politicians'' _ still sufficed for much of the South. But as the
``new economy'' begins to affect the region, the old system is
beginning to mutate in interesting ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who runs North Carolina? There are a lot more answers than
there used to be,'' said Ran Coble, executive director of the North
Carolina Center for Public Policy Research.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, the center has polled North Carolina legislators,
Capitol reporters and lobbyists to rank the 50 most influential
lobbyists in Raleigh. It's not a fool-proof measure of political
influence. Some of the most effective lobbyists, after all, are
those who attract the least notice. But the ranking does give some
indications of how things are changing.
</P>
<P>
   There used to be more lobbyists on the list who worked
exclusively for one or two big clients, winning the favor of key
committee members and weighing in as the voice of the company when
its interests were at stake.
</P>
<P>
   These days, some of the most effective lobbyists are
free-lancers brought together temporarily to work as a team on a
specific issue. That mirrors Alabama, where it is not unusual,
according to Dakin, for a lobbyist to hire another lobbyist on a
spot contract for a day, simply to win the vote of a specific
legislator with whom that lobbyist has close ties.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer lobbyists from the old trio of tobacco, textiles and
furniture are showing up on the North Carolina list, and there are
more lobbyists for health care, hogs and homebuilders _ a
reflection of the state's changing economy.
</P>
<P>
   More public interest lobbyists and women have been ranked in
recent years, along with lobbyists representing a growing number of
new companies, such as those that have sprung up around the
Research Triangle near here. With the ``new economy,'' observed
Ferroll Guillory, director of the Southern politics program at the
University of North Carolina, has come an interest in issues _
``livability,'' sprawl, day care _ the Old Guard was not much
concerned with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that a relatively small number of companies and
the Farm Bureau carried the political weight in this state. Today,
political power is spread out over a diverse group of individuals
and organizations and companies,'' said Don Beason, a lobbyist with
several major business clients who is ranked No. 2 on the center's
list.
</P>
<P>
   This trend has been widened by the increasing complexity of the
problems state legislatures grapple with, and the devolution
movement, which over the past decade has transferred an increasing
share of responsibility back to the states.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time a few years ago, observed Bobby Kahn, chief of
staff to Gov. Roy Barnes, when a committee meeting on health care
might draw only a lobbyist for the Medical Association of Georgia.
These days, with hospitals, nursing homes, medical specialties and
public interest groups looking to their own interests, the same
meeting might draw several lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Dakin, who has lobbied in several Southern states, traces the
proliferation back to the 1970s, when California, with its auto
emissions legislation, sent a message to national corporations that
they could no longer confine their efforts at winning influence to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   MORE MONEY IN STATE POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   Simply registering to lobby in a state is likely to trigger a
barrage of letters from legislators asking for campaign donations.
Just as much as the increased costs of campaigning, the enlargement
of the donor pool appears to be contributing to the staggering
increase in the costs of politics at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   The states don't have uniform reporting procedures, and it is
much harder to get comprehensive statistics about campaign finances
at the state level than the federal. But there are strong
indications the South's capitols have witnessed an inflation in
costs that rivals Washington.
</P>
<P>
   According to a public interest group, the North Carolina Forum
for Research and Economic Education, what the average winner spent
in a North Carolina Senate race rose from $36,301 in 1994 to
$82,161 in 1996 and $110,638 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And the spending figures don't tell the entire story. Much of
the money being raised from lobbyists and their clients is going
into the coffers of powerful legislators who have weak or often no
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the cases where their races aren't contested, they're
raising lots of money to chase away possible opponents and to
funnel money to their colleagues,'' said Bob Hall, director of
Democracy South, a public interest group based in Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   A few states have attempted to contain campaign spending at the
legislative level, but this has proved difficult. Florida, for
instance, has a $500 cap on contributions to state races, but it
allows unlimited soft money contributions to the state parties,
which in turn have great flexibility in getting money back to the
candidates. For example, soft money contributions to the Florida
Republican Party, which now controls the Legislature, jumped from
$9.9 million in 1996 to $24.3 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by Florida Common Cause, health care
interests and the insurance industry each contributed more than
$442,000 to the two parties in the first three months of this year,
when the Legislature was about to consider a measure that affected
patients' right to sue their HMOs. The measure failed. So did
legislation affecting the sale of generic drugs, after
pharmaceutical interests contributed more than $79,000.
</P>
<P>
   The increased emphasis on political action committees and
campaign contributions does not sit well with Dakin, schooled in
the ``eyeball-to-eyeball'' approach. But, he says, ``the system
runs on revolving funds,'' and lobbyists understand they have to
open their checkbooks to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   He prefers the ``personal touch,'' which sometimes means
ordering carry-out dinner for 150 or 200 people in a committee room
without making a big deal about who picked up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing the game doesn't just mean campaign contributions.
Playing the game means being there all the time, every time,''
Dakin said.
</P>
<P>
   SHADOW SECTORS
</P>
<P>
   Along with money and personal contacts between powerful
executives, their lobbyists and the legislators, a traditional
source of power throughout the South has been the number of
employees _ and voters _ companies such as Carolina Power &AMP; Light
had in legislative districts throughout North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Guillory observed, these local powerhouses are
being outnumbered by companies, such as EDS, which are
headquartered out of the state, or, as is the case with
Glaxo-Wellcome, out of the country. These companies do not often
leave the same deep footprint in the Capitol corridors.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the noticeable developments across the region is
the rise of what might be called shadow sectors: big business
interests that either can't, or choose not to, play the traditional
game of statehouse power politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling in Louisiana and tourism in Florida provide contrasting
examples of the effect shadow sectors can have.
</P>
<P>
   While observers detect a splintering of business interests
elsewhere, John Maginnis, who has written several books on
Louisiana politics, says the biggest change in that state's power
politics the last few years has been the unifying of business
interests under the banner of LABI, the Louisiana Association of
Business and Industry.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the business lobby hung together to defeat a proposed
oil and gas processing tax supported by Gov. Mike Foster, who
helped unify the business community to pass his tort reform
measures and has since been foiled by business in his attempt to
find new revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and gas gets off the hook, Maginnis said, because the
Legislature can always hang another tax increase on casinos and
video poker. The gaming sector spent enormous political capital to
gain entrance into Louisiana, and with its revenues skyrocketing it
has little influence to prevent its becoming a cash cow for the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louisiana's always been able to survive on other people's
money,'' Maginnis said. ``It used to be oil and gas, and now
gambling has started to fill the gap.'' But ``taxing Texans,'' as
they call it in Louisiana, only puts off the day when the state
will have to reckon with the shortcomings in its tax structure, he
contends.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Florida would describe the tourist industry as a
pushover at the Legislature, but it is subdued in the role it
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think Disney and some of the Central Florida
entertainment attractions would run the state. But Disney is a very
low-profile corporate citizen in Tallahassee,'' said Richard
Pinsky, a lobbyist and Republican campaign consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it was directly affected, he noted, Disney didn't
flex any muscles when a proposal to tax cruise ships came up _
aware, perhaps, that the measure was going to fail anyway. But the
tourist sector also didn't speak up for itself this year, he said,
when the South Florida counties eliminated auto emissions testing,
a move that could lead to more pollution, tighter government
restrictions and fewer tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Southern states, which have been generous in
bestowing incentives to new industries, Florida has lost a number
of businesses to Arizona and other states. That is due in part,
Pinsky believes, to tourism, which brings revenue into the state
and has little interest in attracting more industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the changes being felt in the Southern economy are only
slowly being reflected in terms of influence in state legislatures.
The old giants still wield considerable power _ but they do so in a
more crowded field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question tobacco has less clout today than 30 years
ago. There's also no question they still have a lot of clout,''
Coble said of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Similar things are said about oil and gas in Louisiana and
agriculture in Florida. The old powers still ply the statehouse
halls, seeking to wield influence. But the halls are a lot more
crowded these days.

 &HT;    Retire? No way. Options abound for older workers
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Miriam Dennis-Stinson taught home economics for more
than 37 years, 34 of which were in the Atlanta school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been 38 had I not taken maternity time,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   It really doesn't matter how you calculate it. When she retired
on June 9 from Kennedy Middle School in southwest Atlanta, you
might expect that after that much time on the job, Dennis-Stinson
would, well, retire.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis-Stinson, 60, a self-proclaimed ``jill of all trades'' is
as busy as ever.
</P>
<P>
   When she's not painting the exterior of her home, laying tile in
her kitchen or installing a suspended ceiling in her basement _ all
of which are recent projects of this ardent do-it-yourselfer _ she
is honing her entrepreneurial skills as a seamstress.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a ``retiree'' spend some 11-12 hours a day making
dresses from scratch instead of lounging by a pool or hitting golf
balls?
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have some responsibilities,'' says Dennis-Stinson, who
is a mother of three, including a son still in college.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, Dennis-Stinson's in pretty good financial shape with
her pension and an annuity. And though her sewing will bring in
extra money, one of the primary reasons she still works is because
she can't imagine not working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a workaholic,'' she laughs while continuing to
work on a dress. ``Somebody just told me that, and I think I'm
beginning to believe it. Retire ? Probably not, knowing me.''
</P>
<P>
   Workaholic or not, Dennis-Stinson is not the only retiree
eschewing unemployment. The New Economy has produced a feisty crop
of new retirees, folks who refuse to go quietly into a state of
perpetual leisure. Some, like Dennis-Stinson, turn to new
entrepreneurial ventures. Others find new opportunities in a
different industry. Still others are beginning to land part-time
positions with their former full-time employers.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity of post-employment options for the recently
retired is a sign of the times. On average, today's retirees are
blessed with longer life expectancy than their parents and
grandparents. Their children aren't yet old enough nor large enough
as a group to replace them in the work force. And, the booming
economy has wrought a shortage of well-trained workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People delaying retirement and returning to the work force
post-retirement have helped the labor force expand at twice the
rate of the working-age population over the past four years,''
reported U.S. News &AMP; World Report in a recent cover story.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are retiring,'' says Cathy Fyock, a human
resource consultant who specializes in working with retirement-age
adults. ``But they are retiring to their next job.''
</P>
<P>
   That next job may be a hobby or favorite pursuit, such as
Dennis-Stinson's sewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sewing) has been something I've done all along, as a
supplement to my teaching salary,'' Dennis-Stinson explains. ``I
have always sewn. I've done alterations and, especially, prom and
wedding dresses.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days, instead of an occasional frock here or there,
Dennis-Stinson is taking larger orders. Her current project is a
wedding. Not just a wedding gown, but an entire wedding party: 16
dresses, including the bride's gown and dresses for the mother of
the bride, the flower girls and 11 bridesmaids.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister called me and told me it just makes her tired
thinking about making all those dresses,'' Dennis-Stinson quips.
``It's not really a chore because I enjoy it so. I get physically
tired, but mentally, I so enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   That can-do attitude is shared by many of today's
post-retirement entrepreneurs and older workers, Fyock says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the gift of retirement, that you can go back to work
doing your dream job and there's nothing to stop you.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``gift'' may also be the key to post-retirement longevity,
asserts Fyock, who is the author of ``UnRetirement: A Career Guide
for the Retired, the Soon-to-be Retired and the Never-want-to-be
Retired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to a lot of older adults who say, `I thought I'd
like to play golf or garden all the time,' '' only to find those
activities unfulfilling and undesirable, Fyock says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, doing little or nothing after retirement may actually
be hazardous to your health, Fyock adds. ``Work feeds us in many
more ways than a paycheck,'' she says. ``It's a way to stay active,
to feed the soul, to be with friends, to feel challenged, to feel
like you're giving back.''
</P>
<P>
   Fyock says she has seen anecdotal evidence that retiring without
ambitions for additional work or other productive activities may
actually hasten death.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for a growing number of retirees, many of whom joined
their companies at an early age or took advantage of corporate
downsizing proposals, retirement can come quite early in life.

   Bill Sisk retired at age 50 last year after some 27 years with
Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. A former sales and marketing executive, Sisk
says landing a job right out of college with the apparel giant
based in his hometown of San Francisco was his first ``grown-up
job.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Sisk relocated to Atlanta to help launch a new line of
men's slacks. He met and married his wife, Helene, and then he
faced a choice: He could either move back to San Francisco for a
post the company offered him there, or he could take an early
retirement package Levi's was using to help trim its work force.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to move, Sisk opted for retirement, securing 91
percent of what his retirement salary at age 55 would have been, as
well as full medical and dental coverage for himself and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a window of opportunity that may not have availed itself
ever again. Those kind of enhanced retirement packages, depending
on who's at the helm of the company, (sometimes) go away,'' Sisk
says.
</P>
<P>
   Sisk left Levi Strauss in October 1999. In April, after
researching franchise opportunities, he launched Proforma Sales and
Marketing Consulting, a business solutions, commercial printing and
promotional products firm.
</P>
<P>
   Why go right back to work?
</P>
<P>
   ``First, of all I'm only 50 and that's much too young. . . .
Nobody in my family every retired at 50,'' Sisk says. ``The reason
I work, I don't want to project being lazy. I'm still mentoring my
nephews and nieces, who are still struggling. I have a nephew going
to Morris Brown (College), and I want to be an example for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Duke, a special services manager, took early retirement at
Monsanto Co. in 1991, after working there 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wasn't quite ready to retire,'' says Duke, now 62.
</P>
<P>
   So he became part of the global agricultural firm's phased
retirement program. ``I went from 60 hours a week of full-time work
to 30 hours when I retired, and now I work only 18 hours a week,''
says Duke, guest relations educator at Monsanto's research center
in Chesterfield, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Phased retirement, in which retired employees return to work
part time, is a growing option in corporate America, driven by a
tight labor market and the desire of baby boomers to remain active.
</P>
<P>
   ``We introduced phased retirement a decade ago because coming
out of the lean and mean era of the 1980s, we realized we needed
replacements _ and also that we had qualified, intelligent and
loyal retirees we wanted to maintain our relationship with,'' said
Liz Thien, head of Monsanto's Retiree Resource Corps.

there is a gimmick in all of this, it is that there is no gimmick.
The gambit is being watched in cities and towns across the nation
by station managers who have been unable to stem the loss of
viewers of their local news programs, from which they derive much
of their advertising revenues. Though all broadcast TV programs
have been losing audience amid increased competition from cable and

NEW ENCRYPTION SYSTEM WOULD PROTECT MUSIC ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Internet continues to influence the evolution of
intellectual property law and policy, one issue currently
generating tremendous controversy is the free and anonymous
swapping of digital music files.
</P>
<P>
   Various companies have proposed forms of encryption as solutions
to the problem. Now add another candidate: Three mathematicians at
Brown University have capped six years of research with a patent
for an encryption code they say will make it impractical _ if not
impossible _ to infringe copyrighted data like digital music.
</P>
<P>
   The mathematicians, Jeffrey Hoffstein and Jill Pipher, both of
Pawtucket, R.I., and Joseph Silverman of Needham, Mass., patented a
system they say can quickly encode every second of a data stream
with a different encryption key. That means that a typical
three-minute song would be scrambled into 180 different codes;
anyone taking the time to break a single code would be rewarded
with only one second of music.
</P>
<P>
   They say the encoding works so quickly that encryption keys
could be instantly disposable. Data like songs could be encoded to
play on only one specific music player or computer, after which
that particular version of the code would be thrown away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone orders music, then it can be encrypted specifically
for that user,'' explained Scott Crenshaw, chief executive of the
Rhode Island company that owns the patent, NTRU Cryptosystems Inc.
``It will only download on that user's device. He can't share it
with his friends without authorization because it simply won't play
on his friend's device.''
</P>
<P>
   The encryption can be used for data transmissions between
computers, cellular phones, digital music players ``or virtually
any consumer device connected to the Internet,'' Crenshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw contends that the encoding and decoding is much faster
than with any similar system, and he says it does not use much
computer memory. ``It's tiny and can fit into 1,500 bytes, while
competitors take 10 or 20 or 30 times as much space,'' he said.
``That's important because consumer devices have very little
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other encryption systems, the new invention grew out of
advanced mathematical formulas. NTRU's technology differs from
other encryption processes, Crenshaw said, because it relies on a
mathematical system called a ``convolution product'' to make it
faster and more efficient. With that kind of math, he said,
encoding requires only one step, while decoding requires only two.
Some other encryption systems need more than 1,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The invention uses what is called ``public key'' encryption,
which does not require the sender and receiver to privately
exchange code keys to complete a transaction. Crenshaw said that
when a person ordered music online, his computer or music player
would provide the encoding key to the server computer of a Web site
dispensing the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The server uses that key to encode the data, and then throws
it away,'' Crenshaw said. The encoded music comes back to the
user's computer, which already knows the key and uses it to decrypt
the data. ``No other player has that key,'' he said. ``The music is
useless if sent to another player.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardware or software employing the encryption technology
would have to be included in consumer electronic devices. Crenshaw
said NTRU had signed a licensing agreement with an Israeli company
called Aladdin, which makes the so-called tokens that activate
music players and that could contain the encryption technology.
</P>
<P>
   A chip in the token would tell the music distributor what
encryption key to use. The customer could move the token between
his MP3 player, home stereo, computer or other device so he could
listen to his music library in more than one place, Crenshaw
explained, but because the token would be customized for his
devices only, he wouldn't be able to give it to a friend to share
digital music illegally.

   Read-Rite, an electronic components maker in Milpitas, Calif.,
has been in no position to complain whenever fluctuations in
electrical service shut down a vital computer-controlled milling
machine. After all, the local utility, Pacific Gas and Electric,
has lived up to its contractual obligation to keep the power
flowing and to prevent voltage surges or dips of 10 percent or
more.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the milling machine, which helps Read-Rite make
the tiny devices that read and write information on computer disk
drives, crashes if voltages vary as little as 5 percent. And such
flutters have occasionally occurred the last two years as Pacific
Gas, a unit of PG&AMP;E Corp., has performed its daily juggling act of
matching power demand and supply in the region. So far, Read-Rite's
solution has been to monitor the incoming power closely and adjust
settings on the milling equipment manually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to watch it closely because we can lose materials
worth thousands of dollars,'' said Shahzad Mahmud, director of
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Read-Rite's milling machine is indicative of a long-running, but
accelerating, problem: The nation's electrical power supply system
is not up to the task of meeting the digital economy's needs. While
the utility industry has historically prided itself on delivering
fairly stable power 99.9 percent of the time, today's computerized
economy is demanding even fewer interruptions and a much steadier
current.
</P>
<P>
   That is because electricity is more than just energy for
computers _ it is the medium they use to do their job. Rapid,
minute changes in voltage represent the ones and zeros that make up
digital information.
</P>
<P>
   Those patterns are ultimately translated into a human voice
during a phone call, a calculation during a banking transaction, a
dose of radiation during cancer therapy or a photo of a new baby
e-mailed to scattered relatives. Any disruption in the power supply
that compromises the processor's ability to manage those voltages
can lead to lost data or system crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Power disturbances around the world cause more than 17,000
computer disruptions every second, from annoying frozen cursors to
serious destruction of equipment, according to the latest
calculations of American Power Conversion of West Kingston, R.I.,
which began building backup power systems for computer users in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have worked well for an economy that ran on motors and
lights,'' said Peter Gross, a leading designer of giant
telecommunications hubs, data centers and other buildings that
operate around the clock. ``There's a major disconnect with what's
happening in the digital world.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also an explosion of interest in technologies and
services that address the new economy's power needs. And the
remedies go well beyond the surge suppressors that most home PC
users employ to protect their computers during lightning or voltage
spikes. The solutions aimed at businesses include backup generators
manufactured by companies like Caterpillar and smaller power
supplies from American Power Conversion and the Liebert unit of
Emerson Electric. There are innovative fuel cells from start-ups
like FuelCell Energy; new flywheels from Active Power and Beacon
Power and a variety of battery improvements. Companies like
International Rectifier and Ixys are finding strong demand for new
microchips that manage power equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The computer-driven economy's push to transform the electricity
business adds up to a $500 billion opportunity for the companies
selling into it, according to Mark P. Mills, a Washington-based
consultant who, along with Peter Huber, a senior fellow at the
Manhattan Institute, coined the term ``powercosm'' to describe the
evolving market. The two men jointly publish The Digital Power
Report for the Gilder Group.
</P>
<P>
   The message certainly is resonating on Wall Street.
International Rectifier has soared from less than $12 last summer
to more than $55. Ixys, a smaller competitor that was hovering
around $3 in November, reached $69 last Tuesday. Start-ups like H
Power, a fuel-cell maker, and Active Power are on the runway for
public offerings this summer, hoping to find the same kind of
welcome as Capstone Turbine, which went public on Thursday at $16 a
share and ended the week at $45.0625. Meanwhile, giants like
General Electric and the deregulated arms of numerous utilities
have been pouring venture capital into the field.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the digital economy is causing electrical
headaches in two ways. The most straightforward is that it drives
up demand for electricity in regions like the Northeast where
capacity is already strained in the peak summer months. Last week,
on Manhattan's Upper East Side, for example, Consolidated Edison
shut off service to eight apartment buildings and lowered its
voltage in the neighborhood for several hours on a hot, muggy day.
</P>
<P>
   The rising demand involves much more than air-conditioning, of
course. Consider the transformation of a 16-story building in
downtown Newark, N.J., which formerly housed a Macy's department
store and consumed roughly 10 watts of power a square foot before
the store was shut down in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the upper floors have been reopened as a
``telecommunications hotel'' where companies like WorldCom, IDT,
Qwest and Level 3 Communications park rows of data servers, routers
and other electronic equipment, as well as cooling systems, backup
power and other devices. According to Public Service Electric and
Gas, the local utility, such users require 40 to 50 watts a square
foot.
</P>
<P>
   One developer looking at another site in North Jersey for the
home of a potential million-square-foot data and communications
center asked Public Service for 100 megawatts of power, according
to Patrick Downs, the utility's vice president for operations
support. ``That's one-third of what we give the whole city of
Newark,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the most extravagant estimates of the new economy's
impact on sheer demand put the level at less than 10 percent of the
total capacity of traditional utilities. To energy managers,
engineers like Gross and, more recently, Wall Street, the volume of
demand for power is less noteworthy than the higher quality of
electricity that digital users are insisting upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three nines is great for the grid,'' Mills said, referring to
99.9 percent reliability, or roughly eight hours of power losses a
year. Indeed, it is hard to imagine this figure becoming much
better, given the vulnerability of power supply grids to bad
weather, animals shorting out transformers and other equipment, and
drunken drivers hitting utility poles.
</P>
<P>
   But even ``three nines,'' Mills said, is ``trash for a
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills' prescription for microprocessor-friendly power quality is
10 nines, or 99.99999999 percent reliability _ a mere 32 seconds of
power loss a year _ plus equipment to protect against those gaps
and the sags, spikes and surges in between.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So great is the cost of computer disruptions to the economy that
the sale of services or equipment to prevent such problems is
starting to be seen as a can't-miss proposition for those with the
right technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Model T was introduced, people didn't worry about the
grade of gasoline,'' said Larry R. Wilson, director of strategic
planning for the electric power unit of Caterpillar. The invention
of high-performance cars changed that, Wilson said, and now the
same thing is happening on a much broader scale with electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where people have a power quality need, price is not an
issue,'' Wilson said. He predicts strong growth for Caterpillar's
generator sales to a ``premium'' market of users for whom price is
no object when it comes to reliable backup energy. Such users are
willing to pay the equivalent of $20 a kilowatt for backup
supplies, compared with about 7 cents a kilowatt, on average, for
electricity drawn directly from the utility grid.
</P>
<P>
   Although it varies by state around the nation, utility
regulators generally define a momentary power loss as one lasting
one to five minutes. Such interruptions can cause havoc in
stock-trading systems, automated paper mills and other
computer-driven processes unless there are backup power generators
and equipment to switch to them seamlessly.
</P>
<P>
   But in many cases, trouble does not wait for an outright power
loss. A voltage dip of just 10 percent, with no interruption, can
cause problems for some systems in a sixth of a second, according
to Marek Samotyj, who manages power quality programs for the
Electric Power Research Institute, a Palo Alto, Calif., research
group owned by utility companies. And some sensors in medical
equipment fail if current is cut off completely for as little as
four milliseconds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the crowd of suppliers that offer remedies swells, the
question of who will pay for better power is very much unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, American Electric Power, a large utility based in
Columbus, Ohio, and the equipment maker Siemens Power Transmission
and Distribution began studying what combination of monitoring
equipment and system improvements would be required to supply
premium-quality power to an industrial park in Delaware, Ohio.
American Electric's goals included learning whether premium power
could command premium prices, according to Harry Vollkommer, one of
the project managers for the utility.
</P>
<P>
   But James Osteen, senior industrial engineer at Nippert Co., a
wire manufacturer that is one of the major utility customers in the
park, does not see a more stable power supply as a premium product.
He said all companies were expected to improve quality continually
these days, and the utility should be no exception. ``Our
expectation is that we won't pay more for premium power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar attitude prevails in Detroit. In order to keep
business from the Big Three auto companies, Detroit Edison is
currently supplying power under a contract that penalizes it if it
fails to steadily reduce the number of power losses and
fluctuations. The number of power losses at General Motors has been
reduced by two-thirds since the contract began in 1995, and Detroit
Edison has improved enough to avoid any penalties so far for power
sags, according to John C. Anderson, director of energy services
for GM.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the new economy's power needs, however, is not simply
a matter of improving the utility grid. Studies show that 70
percent of disruptions originate from electrical problems at
customer sites, according to Richard P. Bingham, a manager at
Dranetz-BMI, a power-quality products and consulting company, in
Edison, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laser printers often take out computers when the heater comes
on,'' said Bingham, citing but one example. Electronic ballasts in
overhead lighting and compressors in soda machines also cause
unexpected loads. And electronic devices, like drives that adjust
speeds on motors to save energy, generate electrical interference
on the lines that power them. The interference, known as harmonic
signals, can trip up other equipment unless it is canceled by
filtering devices. And many schools, he said, are creating problems
for themselves by overloading their electrical systems with new
electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of problems and the public's dwindling patience with
disruptions means that trouble-shooters like Dranetz-BMI can no
longer restrict themselves to the utility-dominated world, where
the person on the other end of the phone is generally an engineer.
``There are a lot more people with less and less knowledge of
electricity calling me with questions,'' Bingham said.

ONLINE GROCERY SHOPPING STILL FACES LOGISTICAL HURDLES
</HEADLINE>
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, two big names in the online grocery business
announced they were merging, with Webvan agreeing to pay $1.2
billion for HomeGrocer.com. Online grocers seem to be coming
quickly to the realization that there is strength through scale,
but significant kinks in the business continue to present big
challenges to its long-term viability.
</P>
<P>
   Online grocery shopping beckons like an electronic Statue of
Liberty to the tired, the time-pressed and the hunkered masses who
consider going to the grocery an odious task. Why drive all the way
to the supermarket to tangle with a shopping cart, and risk getting
the one with the sticky wheel, when you can sit quietly at your
computer and click through your choices at your convenience?
</P>
<P>
   The converted sing the praises of online grocery shopping,
calling it convenient, reliable and, yes, no more expensive than
conventional supermarket shopping. ``It probably ends up being more
cost-effective, because you don't pick up the things you don't
need,'' said Robin Bonenfant of Norwalk, Conn., who recently began
using Peapod, the Chicago online grocery pioneer that will have its
10th birthday on Wednesday. ``They take coupons as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Armando Quintero, a father of two who stays home with his
children in San Rafael, Calif., said ordering from Webvan had
simplified his life in some ways. ``They can deliver very early in
the morning, so if we need lunch items for our kids, we could get
them delivered before school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he said, he and his wife, who is at work at an office
all day, ``interact online'' _ going over their electronic shopping
list and adding or deleting items from their separate computers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fans, only about 2.8 percent of Americans buy their
groceries online, according to estimates by Evie Black Dykema, a
senior analyst with Forrester Research. Among the drawbacks people
typically cite are having to plan and having to think about the
delivery schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be organized and thinking ahead,'' said Tracy
Petrak, a legal secretary from San Rafael who orders occasionally
from Webvan. At one point, she was surprised to receive a large
postcard from the company, observing that she had not ordered in a
while and asking, ``What did we do wrong?'' Webvan also sent her a
$25 coupon to use on her next order, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people just do not want to give up the social opportunities
or the nostalgia they associate with grocery shopping. It ties in
with memories of their parents, sometimes, or contributes to a
sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel guilt about shopping online,'' Dykema said.
``Anecdotally, there is this feeling that it's a little artificial
to have their groceries sent to them. It's similar to when Procter
&AMP; Gamble introduced cake mixes, and they found that women wanted to
add their own egg. That way, it was their own cake.''
</P>
<P>
   To get people to buy groceries online, companies are using a
variety of models. Peapod, which appeared on the edge of extinction
just three months ago when its chief executive quit suddenly and a
financing deal fell apart, has now aligned itself with a
traditional supermarket giant, Royal Ahold. In Fairfield County,
Conn., where Bonenfant points and clicks, Peapod used Ahold's Stop
&AMP; Shop stores to fill produce orders, while turning to a Peapod
warehouse for other items.
</P>
<P>
   So thorough is the alignment that Royal Ahold owns 51 percent of
Peapod, and a former Ahold executive, Marc van Gelder, is running
Peapod. Van Gelder seems convinced that Peapod's new model will
work. ``This is a leverage of the Stop &AMP; Shop chain, which stands
for good value and good quality,'' he said. ``And we are also
leveraging, from a procurement perspective, all the advantages you
get from being linked to a $26 billion company. It is a great
competitive weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Stop &AMP; Shop stores are also being used to promote Peapod, and
the two companies are running joint advertisements. ``We do
advertising in local newspapers as well as public relations and
door hangings,'' van Gelder said. ``What we want to get to is to
really personalize e-mail for customers. We will be able to
communicate with our customers on a personalized basis.''
</P>
<P>
   By hooking electronic shopping so thoroughly to an old-style
chain, Peapod is following the example of many European online
grocers, which in many cases were started by the traditional
retailers. J. Sainsbury and Tesco in Britain and Carrefour and
Promodes in France, some of the biggest chains in Europe, all have
online services they promote through their stores, said Jacob
Jensen, a consultant with Roland Berger Associates, a
consumer-products consulting firm in New York, who has studied
e-grocers in Europe and in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But does the model really work? Online grocery companies are
typically plagued by two issues: making sure their orders are
packed and delivered properly and keeping their costs down _
something that is particularly difficult when a fleet of trucks or
vans is involved.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen said creating a large warehouse, along the lines of
Amazon.com, was the only way to meet the first goal effectively.
The cost issue is best addressed, he said, by keeping geographic
markets closely circumscribed.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a cost perspective and from a fulfillment basis, the
dedicated warehouse is the best model,'' he said. ``What really
upsets the consumers is if you don't deliver the products they
ordered, or if you don't hit the window you promised for delivery.
And in terms of managing delivery costs, it means the route density
has to be mapped out ahead of time.''
</P>
<P>
   One French online grocer, Tele-Market, has tried to solve the
distribution issue by subcontracting its delivery service. ``They
have independent couriers driving around with their products, and
they take other companies' products along as well,'' Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the more deliveries in a given area, the lower the
costs overall. But except for a few cities, Americans who can
afford computers and Internet access are more likely to live in
suburbs, if not exurbs, which means more driving for any company
that offers delivery.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to building critical mass for online shopping,
timing may turn out to be everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next wave is when these 18- to 20-year-olds start
replenishing their own households,'' Dykema said, noting how that
age group already goes online to do much of its shopping, from cars
to electronics to groceries. ``They can't imagine why consumers
wouldn't look online first for products. They don't suffer from any
of these hang-ups.''

TED TURNER PLANS $1.2 BILLION EXPANSION AND MORE CNN ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN ROBINSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Spurred by declining ratings during slow news periods,
CNN's parent, Turner Broadcasting System, announced last week a
billion-dollar expansion that included broadening the network's Web
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Turner will spend $1.2 billion the next five years to enlarge
its downtown Atlanta headquarters and build and renovate its
offices and studios elsewhere in the city. One of its new downtown
towers will house over 3,000 new employees for the online and
wireless services it plans.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's strategy is to expand the network's online presence to
include research tools and more in-depth coverage. The result would
be a wealth of information from a combination of on-air and online
sources, said Steve Heyer, chief operating officer for Turner
Broadcasting, a Time Warner subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``People online are looking for a broader array of easy-to-get
news and information,'' he said. ``We are a dominant player in news
online. We don't want to lose that position, so what you're seeing
is the logical extension of that commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Woelfel, president and editor in chief of CNN Interactive,
the online division, said Turner's expansion in Atlanta would lead
to CNN's availability on wireless devices and interactive
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are expanding the content, but we're also expanding a lot
in how we deliver it,'' Woelfel said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner will undoubtedly collaborate with its prospective parent
company, America Online. The AOL merger with Time Warner still
needs federal approval, but many here expect the union to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to work with them very closely,'' Woelfel said.
``The clout that AOL has in the market is really going to help us
as we try to distribute our products and market them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Heyer said Turner's expansion plans began long before there
was talk of a merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get approval to build buildings of this scope and
scale that quickly,'' he said. ``We've had these plans in the works
for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyer did say, however, that the likelihood of an AOL-Time
Warner union was another reason the expansion was important for
Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pride ourselves on being the fastest-growing division of
Time Warner, and we'd like to keep that going inside AOL,'' he
said. ``That's hard to do, given how fast AOL is growing.''
</P>
<P>
   The expansion also affirmed Turner's commitment to Atlanta a day
before plans for the AOL-Time Warner world headquarters in
Manhattan were announced.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.2 billion expansion comprises three new office buildings,
a tourist attraction highlighting Turner's entertainment networks
and a collaboration with Omni Hotels to more than double the size
of Turner's existing hotel at CNN Center, which is managed by the
Omni chain. The buildings should be completed by 2005.

rich history of brawling, innovative television news _ the

it is that there is no gimmick. The gambit is being watched in

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to be a writer, you have to write every day. The
consistency, the monotony, the certainty, all vagaries and passions
are covered by this daily reoccurrence.
</P>
<P>
   You don't go to a well once but daily. You don't skip a child's
breakfast or forget to wake up in the morning. Sleep comes to you
each day, and so does the muse.
</P>
<P>
   She comes softly and quietly, behind your left ear or in a
corner of the next room. Her words are whispers, her ideas shifting
renditions of possibilities that have not been resolved, though
they have occurred and reoccurred a thousand times in your mind.
She, or it, is a collection of memories not exactly your own.
</P>
<P>
   These reminiscences surface in dreams or out of abstract notions
brought on by tastes and excitations, failures and hopes that you
experience continually. These ideas have no physical form. They are
smoky concepts liable to disappear at the slightest disturbance. An
alarm clock or a ringing telephone will dispel a new character;
answering the call will erase a chapter from the world.
</P>
<P>
   Our most precious ability, the knack of creation, is also our
most fleeting resource. What might be fades in the world of
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   How can I create when I have to go to work, cook my dinner,
remember what I did wrong to the people who have stopped calling?
And even if I do find a moment here and there _ a weekend away in
the mountains, say _ how can I say everything I need to say before
the world comes crashing back with all of its sirens and shouts and
television shows?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have a novel in me,'' I often hear people say. ``But
how can I get it out?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, always is, every day.
</P>
<P>
   The dream of the writer, of any artist, is a fickle and
amorphous thing. One evening you're remembering a homeless man,
dressed in clothes that smelled like cheese rinds, whom you once
stood next to on a street corner in New York. Your memory becomes a
reverie, and in this daydream you ask him where he's from. With a
thick accent he tells you that he was born in Hungary, that he was
a freedom fighter, but that now, here in America, his freedom has
deteriorated into the poverty of the streets.
</P>
<P>
   You write down a few sentences in your journal and sigh. This
exhalation is not exhaustion but anticipation at the prospect of a
wonderful tale exposing a notion that you still only partly
understand.
</P>
<P>
   A day goes by. Another passes. At the end of the next week you
find yourself in the same chair, at the same hour when you wrote
about the homeless man previously. You open the journal to see what
you'd written. You remember everything perfectly, but the life has
somehow drained out of it. The words have no art to them; you no
longer remember the smell. The idea seems weak, it has dissipated,
like smoke.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first important lesson that the writer must learn.
Writing a novel is gathering smoke. It's an excursion into the
ether of ideas. There's no time to waste. You must work with that
idea as well as you can, jotting down notes and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The first day the dream you gathered will linger, but it won't
last long. The next day you have to return to tend to your flimsy
vapors. You have to brush them, reshape them, breathe into them and
gather more.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter what time of day you work, but you have to
work every day because creation, like life, is always slipping away
from you. You must write every day, but there's no time limit on
how long you have to write.
</P>
<P>
   One day you might read over what you've done and think about it.
You pick up the pencil or turn on the computer, but no new words
come. That's fine. Sometimes you can't go further. Correct a
misspelling, reread a perplexing paragraph, and then let it go. You
have re-entered the dream of the work, and that's enough to keep
the story alive for another 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The next day you might write for hours; there's no way to tell.
The goal is not a number of words or hours spent writing. All you
need to do is to keep your heart and mind open to the work.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing we create is art at first. It's simply a collection of
notions that may never be understood. Returning every day thickens
the atmosphere. Images appear. Connections are made. But even these
clearer notions will fade if you stay away more than a day.
</P>
<P>
   Reality fights against your dreams, it tries to deny creation
and change. The world wants you to be someone known, someone with
solid ideas, not blowing smoke. Given a day, reality will begin to
scatter your notions; given two days, it will drive them off.
</P>
<P>
   The act of writing is a kind of guerrilla warfare; there is no
vacation, no leave, no relief. In actuality there is very little
chance of victory. You are, you fear, like that homeless man,
likely to be defeated by your fondest dreams.
</P>
<P>
   But then the next day comes, and the words are waiting. You pick
up where you left off, in the cool and shifting mists of morning.

RESIGNATION OF ORACLE'S PRESIDENT UNRELATED TO SPYING, ELLISON
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Who's minding the store at Oracle Corp.?
</P>
<P>
   First, there was last week's clamorous disclosure that the
software giant had paid a private investigation service to gather
information about Microsoft Corp. allies. Then on Friday came the
abrupt resignation of the company's president, Raymond Lane _ a
move the company said was unrelated to the investigation
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the day-to-day operation of Oracle is now in the
hands of a troika of executives who report directly to Larry
Ellison, the company's flamboyant and mercurial founder and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview over the weekend, Ellison cited three executives
as key members of his executive team: Gary Bloom, 38, Oracle's top
marketer and executive vice president; Jeffrey Henley, 54, the
chief financial officer; and Safra Catz, 38, Oracle's
highest-ranking woman and a former investment banker who is now an
executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Henley and Bloom have both been with the company for a decade,
and Bloom in recent months had been assuming more and more of the
departing president's duties. Catz was at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette before joining Oracle last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said that Lane would not be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Although acknowledging that the timing of the announcement was
not ideal, Ellison said that the resignation of Lane, 53, a former
Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton executive who was widely credited for having
helped rebuild Oracle during the last eight years, had nothing to
do with the Microsoft controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just a good time for this transition,'' Ellison said
in a telephone interview. ``We have been planning Ray's departure
for several weeks, it was related the end of our fiscal year.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the appearances of upheaval, Oracle, of Redwood City,
Calif., the largest database software company, is on a roll, having
capitalized on the Internet commerce boom the last two years. On
June 20, the company announced strong earnings gains in its fourth
fiscal quarter. Excluding investment gains, Oracle reported
earnings of $926 million, up 76 percent from similarly adjusted
income of $527 million in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose
17 percent, to $3.37 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good time for Oracle to have this happen,'' Roger
McNamee, a director of Integral Capital Partners in Menlo Park,
Calif., said of Lane's resignation. ``Larry Ellison has surrounded
himself with a great team and a deep team.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Lane's resignation nonetheless raised eyebrows.
The company chose to issue a news release announcing Lane's
departure at 6 p.m. Pacific time on Friday at the start of the long
Fourth of July weekend. The news release offered no reason for his
resignation, and Lane could not be reached for comment over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But David Roux, Oracle's former executive vice president for
corporate development, who is now a general partner at Silver Lake
Partners, an investment firm in Menlo Park, said it was unlikely
that Lane's departure indicated any split or dispute with Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oracle is very much Larry's company,'' he said. ``One of the
reasons that Ray was so effective and well-liked was that he was
never confused about the core fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said that Lane had been on vacation last week when the
company made the surprise disclosure that it had paid for a a
covert investigation of several Microsoft lobbying groups. He said
he and Lane had not talked about his decision to publicly defend
the spying effort on Wednesday, at a news conference where Ellison
told reporters he thought that his company was not arrogant, rather
had performed a ``public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said that he did not know Lane's future plans, but added
that Lane had a new family, with one young child and a second on
the way. He said Lane, who will remain on Oracle's board, had made
more than $2 billion in the increased value of Oracle stock since
joining the company in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison also noted that most of Lane's responsibilities at
Oracle had already been shifted to Bloom, the executive vice
president who also has responsibility for product development.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bloom said in a telephone interview on Saturday:
``My own role has evolved over time and I'm quite comfortable with
it. There are a number of organizations that have been shifted from
Ray's to my responsibility, including the partners program, the
education business which is a $500 million business, as well as
worldwide support and worldwide marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Bloom who took responsibility for introducing a new
version of the company's Internet Application Server 8i, which came
out on Wednesday. The software, crucial to the e-commerce
operations of many businesses, has become one of Oracle's most
important products.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside Bloom and Henley, Ellison said that Catz, who had been
a managing director at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, was playing an
important role at Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Catz had helped build Softbank Corp., the Japanese
company founded by Masayoshi Son, but had joined Oracle because she
was tired of the extensive travel required by her work as a banker.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's great,'' Ellison said, ``But she doesn't like public
attention. She'd be upset if she heard I was telling you about
her.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When magazine publishers and chief executives of
media companies discuss the latest problem facing the magazine
industry, they use words like ``passion,'' ``devastation'' and
``death.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives who usually favor brevity will spend an hour in
conversation detailing the potential ``horror'' of the crisis. The
feared trauma is such that magazine publishers have been cruising
the halls of Congress for the last five months, spending millions
of dollars lobbying for relief.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a grand theme like freedom of speech or censorship
that is kicking up all the emotion. The panic involves a rate
increase the U.S. Postal Service has proposed to take effect next
year, which would raise the cost of mailing subscription copies of
magazines by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Estimating that the rate increase will cost their industry $300
million in the next two years, magazine publishers are going _ well
_ postal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be potentially devastating for many magazines,''
said Nina B. Link, the president of the Magazine Publishers of
America.
</P>
<P>
   The Magazine Publishers of America plans to spend $10 million
this year lobbying Congress on the issue, while companies like Time
Warner, the parent company of Time Inc., have put their own
lobbyists to work on the case as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Magazine Publishers, a trade group to which more than 1,000
of the largest consumer magazines belong, has placed ads in trade
journals stating that the proposed increase is twice the average
increase the Postal Service usually proposes, is three times the
rate of inflation and is double what the Postal Service actually
needs to cover the projected costs of processing magazines.
</P>
<P>
   But economists for the Postal Service say that while the service
is willing to negotiate the proposed increase, it is not only
necessary _ it is mandated by federal law. The Postal Reform Act of
1970 mandates that every class of mail must cover its own mailing
costs.
</P>
<P>
   This latest rate proposal comes at a tense time for the
industry: newsstand sales are sinking, subscriptions are down for
many consumer magazines, and several smaller but high-profile
magazines have closed this year.
</P>
<P>
   And some publishers still remember the last time such a large
postal increase went into effect for the magazine industry _ in the
early 1970s, when the added financial burden contributed to the
demise of even some venerable publications like the old weekly
Life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small magazines are the ones that will be most devastated
because they have smaller margins,'' Link said. ``This will hurt
them the most. And it will be hard for other magazines with larger
circulations that don't have much wiggle room.''
</P>
<P>
   Link has spent a substantial part of the last five months on
Capitol Hill, pleading with members of the House and the Senate to
encourage the Postal Service to turn back the increase. She has
encouraged both Democrats and Republicans to unite in asking
William J. Henderson, the postmaster general, to reconsider the
increase.
</P>
<P>
   And Link has been joined by some of the most powerful figures in
magazine publishing: Cathleen P. Black, the president of Hearst
Magazines; Christopher M. Little, the president of the Meredith
Publishing Group, and Daniel B. Brewster, the former chief
executive of American Express Publishing who is now the chief
executive of Gruner &AMP; Jahr magazines. Link has hit Capitol Hill
with as many as 10 magazine publishers in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been trying to educate anyone and everyone as to why
this is so unfair and unjust and unreasonable,'' Link said. ``We
absolutely will not accept these kinds of increases. We feel the
industry has been singled out.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rate increase applies to consumer magazines that
are mailed under the bulk classification of ``periodicals.'' Rate
increases for other categories, like first-class mail, are in the
single digits. Greg Frey, a spokesman for the Postal Service, said
that the last increase _ 4.6 percent _ was proposed two years ago
and went into effect in January 1999. Link said because that
increase was so much smaller, the decision met less criticism from
the magazine industry.
</P>
<P>
   Little of Meredith said that every Meredith title would be
affected by the proposed increase, the news of which he described
as ``a bombshell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every copy of Better Homes &AMP; Gardens will be affected,'' he
said, referring to a Meredith title. ``And at Hearst every copy of
Good Housekeeping will be affected, and at Conde Nast, every copy
of Vogue.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed increase has also made strange bedfellows; two of
the most concerned crusaders against the increase are The National
Geographic Society and Playboy magazine. Both magazines depend on
subscriptions for much of their circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Of The Geographic's 8.5 million circulation, 8.2 million copies
are sent by subscription. Playboy's subscribers number 2.6 million
out of a total circulation of 3.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sims, senior vice president for magazine publishing at
the National Geographic Society, said it cost the society 24 cents
to send a subscription issue out; the proposed increase could raise
that to about 27.6 cents an issue. At 3.6 extra cents an issue each
month for 8.2 million issues, that is an increase of $295,200 a
month in expenses for the society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't sound like much at first,'' he said. ``But when you
when you add up the costs of print, editorial and other
distribution costs, well, pretty soon you don't have any money
left.'' He described the rate increase as ``potentially devastating
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Day, a senior vice president at Playboy Enterprises and the
publisher of Playboy, said, ``If this goes through, we will have to
look to other lines of our business to fund that.''

   Ashley Lyons, an economist and the manager of pricing for the
Postal Service, acknowledged that the proposed increase was a
substantial one.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are saying is that the costs of handling magazines
will go up by roughly 12.8 percent over the next three years,'' he
said, adding that the Postal Service was actively investigating
ways to reduce the increase. The postmaster general testified
before the House Postal Appropriations Subcommittee that he would
take steps to achieve $150 million in savings that would apply to
magazine handling.
</P>
<P>
   Frey of the Postal Service said that the service was not
singling out any industry and was making every effort to
incorporate cost-cutting measures proposed by the magazine
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The various classes of mail must support themselves and we
cannot cross-subsidize,'' he said. ``And that is mandated by law.
For them to feel singled out or to imply that there is a conspiracy
against some of our best customers is ridiculous.'' Frey said that
additional increases in postage would be likely this year because
of recent increases in gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   But even the Postal Service's avowal to try to curb the increase
does not placate publishers like Little, who has criticized the
Postal Service as poorly managed. He said the postmaster general
had disregarded the Magazine Publishers of America's
recommendations over the last two years to keep the increase in the
single digits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first heard of this 15 percent hike, we came in and
said, `Now wait a minute,' '' Little said. ```We have been working
with you for two years and we have been promised that the rate
increase would not be anything in the double digits, and then you
present us with a 15 percent rate increase.' That to us is just
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   If the magazine industry and the Postal Service cannot reconcile
their differences, the magazine industry may be left with little
recourse. Link said that publishers had begun to explore other
options, like shipping magazines via non-government means like
United Parcel Service, DHL and Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   Sims of The National Geographic said that the National
Geographic Society had broached the idea of negotiating a contract
rate with the Postal Service, such as the Society does with foreign
postal services like England's Royal Mail. But he said the U.S.
Postal Service would not negotiate individual corporate contracts.
</P>
<P>
   On June 12, Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Md., introduced a bill in
Congress that would reduce the rate increase. Congress and the
Senate have until November to approve the new postal rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever think you'd hear so much passion about postage
rates?'' Link asked. ``It's ridiculous. I dream about it at
night.''

CONDUCTING SOME PANDA DIPLOMACY ON THE WEB; A BREAK IN MOORE'S LAW,
BUT, HEY, WHO'S COUNTING?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Va.)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those who contend anything can be found on the Web may be right.
A Maryland couple just found a giant panda for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce and Iresha Fletcher of Chevy Chase were the winning
bidders in an online auction to ``adopt'' Mei Shiang, a 2-year-old
giant panda that lives in the Wolong Nature Reserve in China. For
their $6,100, the couple will receive a year's worth of e-mail and
videos on their ward's progress. The money goes to the Wolong Panda
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Why adopt a panda? ``The U.S. and China are the two powers in
the world, and hopefully a program like this can help relations,''
Fletcher explained last week.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher's hope is certainly shared by Twinbays International,
which sponsored the auction. Twinbays was formed in April 1999 to
sell Chinese goods to Americans but now hooks up U.S. manufacturers
with Chinese suppliers. Last Thursday, Twinbays held a reception in
Washington for Chinese officials and Virginia venture capitalists
to honor the Fletchers and to introduce itself in its new guise.
</P>
<P>
   Although Twinbays has headquarters in Reston, Va., the company
employs only 20 people there; it has 40 people in China. ``It's
necessary that we show our respect for the Chinese environment,''
Martin David, president of Twinbays, said of the panda promotion.
``The auction cost us a small fortune, but it's cheaper than buying
full-page ads.''

   A BREAK IN MOORE'S LAW, BUT, HEY, WHO'S COUNTING? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ever-faster computers are just in the nature of things. Behind
the blase optimism is Moore's Law _ named after Gordon Moore, the
co-founder of Intel, who observed that the number of transistors
chip makers could fit on a given piece of silicon doubled every 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   Yet recently, computer scientists have begun to fret that the
end of Moore's Law _ and, with it, the march of computing progress
_ is in sight as the physical limits of minute circuitry loom.
</P>
<P>
   So the IBM announcement last week that it had built the fastest
supercomputer becomes of interest to more than the computing
equivalent of drag-racing fans. The $110 million machine, built to
simulate the testing of nuclear weapons, is three times as powerful
than the previous record holder. And the earlier front-runner, also
from IBM, was finished 21 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there is a break with Moore's Law, at least in this
rarefied realm.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation for the jump lies largely in the rapid progress
IBM has been able to achieve in materials science and systems
design. For example, using copper instead of traditional aluminum
wires in chips allows for higher circuit speeds with lower power
consumption. Another lift comes from the programming wizardry that
enables the supercomputer, which sprawls over an area the size of
two basketball courts, to orchestrate the data-chugging power of
more than 8,100 microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent conference called Beyond Silicon, sponsored by MIT's
Technology Review magazine, Nicholas Donofrio, senior vice
president for technology at IBM, said he believed that recent
advances made the limits of Moore's Law less worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   With the new supercomputer, he said last week, ``We're not
relying solely on lithography on silicon _ the stuff of Moore's Law
_ to scale up computing power.''
</P>
<P>
   And to be honest, the achievements of the IBM supercomputer,
known as ASCI White, are impressive even to nonpropeller heads. It
would take a person with a calculator 10 million years to do the
number of calculations that the new supercomputer can do in one
second. A silly comparison in some ways, but one powerful dragster.

ADVERTISING: NEW ACCOUNT ASSIGNMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., skedded earlier as NEW-AD-COLUMN) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For agencies large and small, the second half of 2000 is
beginning the same way the first half ended, with a flurry of
account assignments from advertisers in major categories like
beauty products, automobiles, dot-coms and banking.
</P>
<P>
   Estee Lauder in New York, the cosmetics and fragrance giant,
named A/R Media in New York to assist its in-house team with the
creative development of a new national campaign. It marks the first
time in several years that Lauder has sought creative direction
from outside the company.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will continue to feature Elizabeth Hurley, the
actress who serves as the public ``face'' of Lauder, in ads that
are expected to be shot by the fashion photographer Steven Meisel.
The new work is planned to start in January.
</P>
<P>
   A/R Media, headed by Alex Gonzalez and Raoul Martinez,
specializes in designer fashion advertising for apparel marketers
like Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, Missoni, Emanuel Ungaro, Valentino and
Versace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of parallels and similarities between fashion
and beauty,'' said Donna Laveran, a spokeswoman for Lauder. ``A/R
is a name known in the fashion and beauty worlds.'' A/R was chosen
after a six-month review, she added, declining to disclose the
other participants.
</P>
<P>
   Though a budget for the campaign is not being disclosed, Lauder
spent $116.2 million last year on advertising, according to
Competitive Media Reporting in New York, which tracks ad spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bates Worldwide in New York, part of the Cordiant Communications
Group, remains the agency of record for Lauder, handling duties
like media planning and buying.
</P>
<P>
   On the automotive front, BMW of North America in Woodcliff Lake,
N.J., part of BMW AG, named Washington Daniel Advertising in
Chicago as its first agency of record for so-called diversity
marketing initiatives aimed at African-Americans and other
consumers. Billings were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The company is hoping that Washington Daniel can help ``to
extend our brand to a more diverse audience,'' said Jim McDowell,
vice president for marketing at BMW of North America. Other clients
of Washington Daniel include Anheuser-Busch and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon Minneapolis, part of the Fallon Worldwide unit of
Publicis SA, handles general market advertising for BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to other account assignments, Finance.com in Long Island
City, , N.Y., a Web site offering financial and investment advice
that is part of the e-Citi operation of Citibank, named Kirshenbaum
Bond &AMP; Partners in New York to handle its first account. Spending
was estimated at $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a review that had been narrowed to
Kirshenbaum Bond and four undisclosed agencies. Kirshenbaum Bond
handles another assignment for Citibank, the American Airlines
AAdvantage credit card program.
</P>
<P>
   Kirshenbaum Bond was also being considered in a review for the
U.S. account of Citibank, which has been handled by the New York
office of Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising. The review for that account,
with billings estimated at $48 million, was narrowed last week to
two agencies, the daily fax edition of the trade publication
Advertising Age reported: Fallon Minneapolis and three offices of
TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom
Group. Citibank is owned by Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   In another dot-com decision, MySimon.com in San Francisco, an
online comparison shopping service that is part of CNET Networks,
named Leo Burnett USA in Chicago, part of the Leo Burnett Co. unit
of the B Com3 Group, to handle its account, which had been at
Bigelo &AMP; Partners in San Francisco. Billings were estimated at $15
million.
</P>
<P>
   The MySimon.com decision came after a three-week review that had
been narrowed to Burnett and three undisclosed agencies based in
the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   And the Hibernia Corp. in New Orleans, which operates banks in
Louisiana and Texas, named Doner in Southfield, Mich., to handle
its account, which had been at Caldwell VanRiper/MARC in
Indianapolis, part of MARC USA. Billings were estimated at $15
million to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a review that had been narrowed to Doner
and two other agencies. One was McCann-Erickson Southwest in
Dallas, part of the McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising unit of
the McCann-Erickson World Group, which is owned by the Interpublic
Group of Cos. The other was Publicis in Dallas and New York.

VETERAN HAITIAN MUSICIANS STRETCH TRADITIONAL RHYTHMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A big band doesn't survive for 37 years without being
flexible. Orchestre Tropicana d'Haiti, one of Haiti's two reigning
big bands along with its older rival, Orchestre Septentrional,
celebrates its 37th birthday in August. When it performed for
dancers on the night of June 30 at Lincoln Center's Midsummer Night
Swing series, it ambled between homegrown tradition and congenial
extensions.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican
Republic, and Orchestre Tropicana gives more than a glance over the
border. Between Haitian compas tunes, the singers switched from
Kreyol (Haitian Creole) to Spanish as the group played its own
versions of bolero, cumbia, Dominican merengue and the
stripped-down Dominican ballad style called bachata. In place of
the bachata's spiky acoustic guitar, the keyboardist used a banjo
sound. Yet Orchestre Tropicana holds on above all to the unhurried
beat of the compas. The occupation of Haiti by the United States
from 1915 to 1934 brought swing bands, and Haitians adapted the
lineup for their own dance music. Haitian big bands played compas
with a gentle beat that carried a jovial, evolving interchange of
riffs from saxophones, brasses and singers. Then, in the late 1960s
and 1970's, along came so-called minijazz bands like Tabou Combo.
Guitars took over the horn parts, and the rhythm eased toward rock
and salsa.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestre Tropicana, which is directed by Louis Jean, has not
ignored the changes. Its songs from recent decades have added
guitar licks and synthesizer lines to the round-robin of riffs. It
has also moved from songs about love and domestic troubles _ like
``Angelique,'' which complains that she always cooks the same meal
_ to songs with uplifting messages. Yet the saxophones, trumpets
and trombones have held onto their -unslick, blithely out-of-tune
dialogues, and the music remains breezy and affable.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestre Tropicana's songs get better as they grow longer. They
can seem understated, almost lackadaisical, when they start. After
a minute or two, they are unassumingly pleasant, with smoothly
crooned melodies over the clip-clopping compas beat. But after
about four minutes, something mysterious happens. New riffs keep
turning up from every section of the band. And the mesh and
colloquy of stuttering saxophones, cheerful sustained trumpets,
pearly syncopated guitar lines, calliopelike keyboard phrases and
self-effacing percussion directly insinuate themselves into feet
and hips, making dancers move without a hint of pressure. For all
its modesty, the music persists because it never wears out its
welcome.

 (Attn: Calif., Va., N.Y., Tenn., )   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Scott Sassa, the president of NBC's West Coast division, in
so much trouble with the network's management that he is about to
be fired?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all, say a wide range of senior NBC executives. The
officials were put on the defensive last week when The New York
Post published an article saying that John F. Welch Jr., the
chairman of General Electric, NBC's parent, had criticized Sassa
during a tense senior management meeting last Tuesday. The article
said that Sassa would be out in a matter of days. Dismissing the
threat to Sassa, Kassie Canter, the corporate spokeswoman for the
network said, ``The Post dredged up a six-week-old rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hollywood had been rife with rumors for many weeks of
Sassa's imminent departure _ always steadfastly and authoritatively
denied by NBC executives.
</P>
<P>
   But The Post report had its biggest fact right. NBC did have an
executive meeting last week, and Welch did have occasion to ``beat
up'' Sassa, as one executive put it, as well as some other NBC
division heads.
</P>
<P>
   Welch was unhappy with the entertainment division that Sassa
directs for not following the lead of ABC and CBS into the hot
programming trend of reality shows like ``Who Wants To Be a
Millionaire'' and ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC's president, Bob Wright, had already expressed
dissatisfaction with the division's reluctance to enter the reality
race. Last December, just after ``Millionaire'' emerged as a force
that would overwhelm prime time, Wright was voicing concern about a
then-obscure show CBS had purchased called ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Wright's anxiety, NBC still did nothing to try to buy
the rights to other reality formats being offered to the networks.
NBC's entertainment executives said they had no special budget to
buy summer programs, making it impossible to get in on the intense
bidding for shows like ``Big Brother,'' for which CBS paid $20
million and which makes its debut on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But one senior NBC executive said, ``That didn't mean they
couldn't get `The Mole'.'' That reality show, set for January, was
snapped up by ABC. Welch also expressed concern in last week's
meeting because NBC seemed to have few promising shows lined up to
take advantage of the upcoming promotional platform of the Summer
Olympics in September. NBC's coming fall series have not received
strong advance notices.
</P>
<P>
   So while reports of Sassa's shaky status may have been the
product of some nasty efforts to undermine him, the pressure on him
is only going to increase. ``We know the fall season is crucial,''
one senior NBC entertainment division executive said. ``If we don't
have a hit or two, things could get really ugly in October.''
</P>

   A New Magazine for Professional Athletes
</P>
<P>
   Do not look for Pro, a new magazine, in local stores. The
publication will be sent only to the homes of its target market:
professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The glossy publication, which features helpful articles on
everything from investment planning (three athletes ``show their
monetary moves'') to buying a luxury watch (``it's all in the
wrist''), is shooting for a tiny target audience of 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly magazine, introduced in May, is circulated only to
current and recently retired American professional athletes, who
receive it free.
</P>
<P>
   While many magazines depend on revenues from advertising for a
significant portion of their budgets, Pro's publisher, Street &AMP;
Smith's, plans to rely solely on ad sales _ confident that
advertisers will jump at the opportunity for access to one of the
nation's most affluent demographic groups.
</P>
<P>
   The typical professional athlete makes far more than do doctors
or even the chief executives of major corporations. And since the
athletes that receive Pro are also usually younger than other
affluent professionals, they are less likely to be loyal to certain
brands. John Capouya, Pro's editor in chief and a former editor at
The New York Times, said part of what made the gamble surrounding
his new magazine interesting was its reliance on advertising alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We guarantee advertisers exclusive access to these people at
home,'' he said. ``That's what we think is our unique advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The first issue features advertisements for a luxury yachting
company, a home security company run by former Navy Seals and an
asset management group.
</P>
<P>
   Each issue will have sections on topics like shopping, exotic
travel, sports psychology and health. Many of the short articles
are collaborations between writers and athletes, Capouya said.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, as Capouya states in his first letter from the
editor, will not feature any negative stories about athletes.
Instead, it will try to help athletes by providing advice,
mentoring and support, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Hopkins, a Tennessee Titans lineman who encouraged athletes
to hold open doors and sign autographs in the article he wrote for
the first issue, said: ``I don't know if helpful is the word. Let's
just say entertaining.''

   CNN News Comes to DoCoMo Handsets
</P>
<P>
   CNN plans to announce on Monday that it has stuck a deal with
Japan's largest mobile telephone operator, NTT DoCoMo, to provide
news and other information to customers via their mobile telephone
handsets.
</P>
<P>
   The service will provide breaking news in English or Japanese to
subscribers of DoCoMo's i-mode service, a wildly popular service in
Japan that allows customers to surf customized Web sites over the
Internet. I-mode became so popular in Japan that DoCoMo recently
had to curtail sales of cellular phone handsets that offer Internet
access to ease the load on its overburdened network.
</P>
<P>
   While most Web sites on the Internet have had a hard time
charging consumers for access to content, CNN, a unit of Time
Warner, predicts that customers will be willing to pay for content
over their mobile telephones. While news headlines will be free,
users will be charged 300 yen, or $2.83, to download an entire
article. The charges will be added to customers' monthly telephone
bills.
</P>
<P>
   The service is being offered through CNN Mobile, a CNN unit that
has formed similar alliances with other mobile telephone operators
internationally. The information delivered over the service comes
mostly from CNN's Web site, CNN.com.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN/i-mode service could serve as a model of sorts for other
mobile Internet access services, because of DoCoMo's network, which
can deliver data at much higher speeds than most other current
mobile telephone networks.
</P>
<P>
   The service will be promoted through CNN Interactive and CNN
International and could eventually be marketed through America
Online, if AOL's acquisition of Time Warner is completed.

A CONFIDENT ARMSTRONG EXPECTS A FIGHT IN A RACE WITH NEW DYNAMICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDUN, France _ Looking relaxed and sounding unruffled, saying
that his form is good but needs some improvement, Lance Armstrong
predicted a tough Tour de France. ``It'll be a good fight,'' he
said solemnly, then broke into a smile, as if he knew a secret. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he does. Perhaps, though, it's not really a secret. ``I
like my own chances,'' he finally said. He squared his jaw and
waited for a contradiction _ a dare that was hard to accept.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is no longer in the overall leader's yellow jersey
that he wore for two weeks last summer. He finished second to David
Millar of Cofidis as the 87th edition of the race began Saturday,
and Millar retained the yellow jersey Sunday after finishing 17th
in the 120-mile race from Futuroscope to Loudun. Tom Steels of
Mapei won the opening stage in 4 hours 46 minutes 8 seconds.
Armstrong was 37th, in the same time as Steels, and and is second
over all, trailing Millar by only four seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Millar is, as Armstrong described him, ``a good guy and a good
friend,'' but Armstrong has a long memory. When the new leader of
the Tour came up to him at the starting line in Futuroscope Sunday
morning and proudly showed him his yellow jersey, yellow helmet and
yellow shorts, Armstrong said, ``One thing wrong.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that?'' Millar asked. Armstrong pointed to the Cofidis
team name on the shorts. That was the employer who Armstrong feels
betrayed him by trying to reduce his salary and then terminate his
contract when he was stricken with testicular cancer four years
ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yellow jersey or not, Armstrong, the leader of the United States
Postal Service team, is wearing No. 1 on his back because of his
victory in the Tour last year and he is, as the French sports
newspaper l'Equipe anointed him Saturday, Le Boss. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His strength has been evident in races this spring and his
motivation is, as always, sky high. He is riding, he says, not only
``to prove that a cancer survivor can win this bike race, the
hardest sporting event in the world,'' but also to gain the respect
he feels some riders begrudge him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why, he was asked in an interview, after his clearcut triumph
last year do so many people say this is an open race and then list
seven, eight and nine candidates for victory? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that started with those guys who weren't here last
year,'' Armstrong replied, naming Marco Pantani, the Italian who
won the Tour in 1998, and Jan Ullrich, the German who won in 1997.
``Pantani and Ullrich perhaps didn't respect the race last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Pantani missed last year's race after failing a drug test;
Ullrich was injured. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's all history, it doesn't matter,'' the 28-year-old
Texan said. ``We're all here now, everybody's here, and I think
everybody will have the ambition to go to the finish. That's the
way I prefer it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody was to get an injury or crash or mysteriously pull
out, I would be disappointed. If it was a Pantani or an Ullrich _ a
big favorite _ I would be disappointed because if they're not
there, inevitably somebody says, `Well, Pantani wasn't there.' Or
`Well, but.' So this is better. We're all here, let's go, we'll
find out.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong leaned back in his chair, poured a glass of water and
went on: ``It's hard this year. It's a totally different race from
last year, not that it wasn't hard then. But being the defending
champion, being that the course is a lot harder this year, being
that all the others are back, there are totally different
dynamics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there's no time trial before the mountains
changes a lot.'' In the first long individual time trial last year,
Armstrong won easily, hammering the morale of his rivals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the psychological factor, he was talking tactics.
``You can't have a cushion this year and let guys get away _ no,
you can't do that,'' he said. ``Everybody can be a threat unless
they have a poor team trial,'' which will be held Tuesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong looks fit, perhaps a bit under his usual weight of 165
pounds.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As the defending champion, I know I'm a marked man,'' he said,
``but this Tour should be a little easier than last year's because
I'm one more year away from cancer.'' After diagnosis, surgery and
three months of chemotherapy in 1996, Armstrong returned to the
sport in 1998 and to the Tour in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``To sum it up, I'm a little less nervous than I was last year,
I'm confident about my team and comfortable about my condition.
Plus I have the experience of winning the Tour.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is he stronger than last year? After a long pause, Armstrong
answered: ``Probably yes. That's normal with age and the further
away I get from my illness. It's normal that my body is still
recovering from that period but at the same time I am getting older
and more experienced. I should be stronger. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have to work hard. I don't like to train, I'm lazy.''
He allowed himself a mischievous grin. ``No, actually I thrive on
training, it's fun to me. I prefer it to racing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Training pays a lot less than racing, he was told. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Not if you win the one race a year,'' he replied. ``It's too
bad, but that's the way it is. The Tour is so big.''  &QL;

   LEBANON-TOURISTS (Kfar Kila, Lebanon) _ It was a fine, sunny
Sunday and thousands of people flocked to Lebanon's newest tourist
attraction _ a stroll along the barbed wire fence here at the new,

   HARRY-POTTER-FRENZY (Los Angeles) _ This coming weekend, when
the latest Harry Potter novel, ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire,'' officially goes on sale, at least 9,000 Federal Express
trucks will be deployed around the nation on that morning by the
Internet retail giant Amazon.com to help deliver 250,000 presold

metal-hulled fishing trawler dipped in cement and topped with two
masts. Its captain, Dmytro Biriukovich, never doubted for a second
that the ship would make it to New York, not when the ship ran
aground on the Dnepr River a few days into the trip and lost a big
chunk of her keel. Or when storms in the Mediterranean shredded the
mainsail. Or when they lost their satellite phone service somewhere
around Spain, or their radio gave out in the Atlantic, setting off
an oceanwide search. By Andy Newman.

`STAR-SPANGLED EDEN': COLORFUL BUT A STRANGE LOT, THESE YANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Boldface words should be set in italics.) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spitting was murder. Charles Dickens called Washington ``the
headquarters of tobacco-tinctured saliva,'' adding, ``I would be
content even to live in an atmosphere of spit, if they would but
 &UR; spit clean &LR; .'' Oscar Wilde observed that ``America is one long
expectoration.'' And Frances Trollope, the famously tart author of
``Domestic Manners of the Americans,'' captured the American
ambience all too colorfully by remarking that ``the gentlemen spit,
talk of elections and the price of produce, and spit again.'' As
for sound effects, Mrs. Trollope otherwise observed that ``when a
patriotic fit seized them and `Yankee Doodle' was called for, every
man seemed to think his reputation as a citizen depended on the
noise he made.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there was much for James C. Simmons to work with in
assembling this panoramic survey of 19th-century America and how it
appeared to certain well-known, often jaundiced observers from the
British Isles. And while it is not promising to discover that
Simmons is the author of privately commissioned personal, family
and corporate histories, he proves well-suited to the omnibus
format of ``Star-Spangled Eden.''
</P>
<P>
   His own writing has a textbook tone, but it glosses over a wide
array of 19th-century events and customs, and it is studded with
livelier firsthand observations. From the fact that a gentleman
could be ostracized in Cincinnati for using the word ``corset'' in
mixed company to a brief history of longhorn cattle, his book
provides an enjoyably anecdotal backward look. It's a way to learn,
for instance, that ticket scalpers of the past were known to smear
their clothing with molasses while they lurked near box offices, in
order to keep other, cleaner customers away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star-Spangled Eden'' concentrates on eight British visitors
and proceeds chronologically, from the dismay of Mrs. Trollope
(Anthony's mother) at being addressed as ``old woman'' in America,
which she first visited in 1827, to Oscar Wilde's 1882 comment on
Niagara Falls: ``Every American bride is taken there, and the sight
of that stupendous waterfall must be one of the earliest, if not
the keenest, disappointments in American married life.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the eyes of these visitors, who have little in common
beyond Simmons' decision to include them, the book glimpses the
Civil War, the hardships of slaves on Georgia plantations, the
spectacle of Union soldiers streaming into Washington after being
routed at the Battle of Bull Run, stagecoach travel, the authentic
Wild West and the exotic life of the Mountain Man. Imagine the
surprise of George Ruxton's English editor when Ruxton, who had
gone native in a big way while writing ``Adventures in Mexico and
the Rocky Mountains,'' claimed to be ``half froze for buffler meat
and mountain doin's'' after he had returned home.
</P>
<P>
   The most celebrated English visitor included here is of course
Dickens, whose 1842 visit prompted the kind of reception now
associated with Britney Spears. ``People  &UR; eat &LR;  him here!'' remarked
one observer about the fanfare, which had soured and backfired by
the time Dickens described his travels in ``American Notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Angered by the pirating of his work by American publishers,
Dickens had already made himself persona non grata before he drew
attention to Manhattan's stray farm animal population. ``Here is a
solitary swine lounging homeward by himself,'' he wrote. ``He has
only one ear, having parted with the other to vagrant dogs in the
course of his city rambles. . . . He is in every respect a
republican pig, going wherever he pleases and mingling with the
best society, on an equal if not superior footing, for every one
makes way when he appears, and the haughtiest give him the wall, if
he prefer it.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons gives equal time to Fanny Kemble, the popular actress
who came to America to perform, fell in love with a Southerner,
married him and then found herself to be the mistress of two large
Georgia plantations. A committed abolitionist with an innately
patronizing manner (``How marvelously unpoetical these people!''
she declared about the general American populace), she traveled
south and wound up publishing a forceful denunciation of slavery.
And the marriage was brief.
</P>
<P>
   Also here is Frank Harris, well known for the sexual exploits of
``My Life and Loves'' but here describing being on a work crew
building the Brooklyn Bridge. Richard Burton, the seasoned explorer
with a taste for exotica, is on the record here for a visit to Salt
Lake City, where he observed polygamous family life with great
interest. ``A menage a trois, in the Mormon sense of the phrase, is
fatal to the development of that tender tie which must be confined
to two,'' he wrote. ``In its stead there is household comfort,
attention, circumspect friendship and domestic discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the sharpest-eyed observers here is William Howard
Russell, the war correspondent whose Crimean dispatches for The
Times of London are thought to have inspired Tennyson's ``Charge of
the Light Brigade'' and prompted Florence Nightingale to take up
battlefield nursing. His well-recorded sojourn in Washington at the
start of the Civil War included vivid meetings with President and
Mrs. Lincoln. ``She is profuse in the introduction of the word
`sir' in every sentence, which is now almost an Americanism
confined to certain classes,'' he informed English readers.
</P>
<P>
   Bull Run Russell, who earned that nickname for stirring
reporting about newly embattled America, also memorably describes
becoming ill and being told by an American doctor to drink a mint
julep every two hours. But on the whole, as one Confederate
soldier's wife wrote of Russell: ``I find his criticism mild. I
expected so much worse. Those Englishmen come, somebody says, with
their three P's _ Pen, Paper and Prejudices.'' And she concluded,
``He let us off easily.''

`STORM' OUTFLANKS `PATRIOT' AT BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
  By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Despite predictions of a neck-and-neck race for the
Independence Day weekend box office between a pair of big-studio
behemoths, it turned out to be not much of a race at all. ``The
Perfect Storm'' blew away ``The Patriot,'' earning an estimated
$41.7 million since its Friday opening, compared with $21.6 million
for its rival, a Revolutionary War epic.
</P>
<P>
   The third major opening of the weekend, the family-oriented
``Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' registered barely a blip,
earning just $6.6 million and ending up in fifth place behind the
animated ``Chicken Run,'' with $12.8 million, and the Jim Carrey
comedy ``Me, Myself and Irene,'' with $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday weekend shakedown was of particular importance in
Hollywood this year because the summer movie season, which runs
from Memorial Day to Labor Day, had been in a slump in recent
weeks, at least compared with last summer's record-setting pace.
Many were hoping that strong showings by the holiday films would
power a strong second half for the summer, traditionally the most
lucrative moviegoing period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall the box office is up for the first time in three
weeks, and that's good,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of
Exhibitor Relations, a Los Angeles company that monitors box-office
performance. ``This was a pivotal weekend for the summer because
with that slump we were in, we really needed a weekend to bring us
out of the doldrums.''
</P>
<P>
   The top 12 movies earned an estimated $121.7 million over the
three days ending Sunday, up 5.3 percent from last year's total for
the same period. The rise comes after three consecutive weekends in
which the box office fell around 20 percent compared with the same
weekends last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely good news, because it means that audiences are
excited about the movies that were playing this weekend,''
Dergarabedian said.
</P>
<P>
   But whether this weekend's rise will be strong enough to
resuscitate the summer box office remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, hopefully, the pictures will hold on,'' said Tom Sherak,
longtime distribution chief for 20th Century Fox. ``These pictures
just need to hold on so the exhibition world can get a little more
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the weekend provided spectacular news for Warner
Brothers and its ``Perfect Storm,'' which exceeded most
expectations and provided the largest three-day opening in the
studio's history and the biggest openings ever for its director,
Wolfgang Petersen, and its star, George Clooney. It was also the
third highest-grossing Fourth of July release in history, behind
1997's ``Men in Black,'' with $51.1 million, and 1996's
``Independence Day,'' with $50.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dominated the weekend, making almost double the
second-place film,'' said Dan Fellman, president of distribution at
Warner Brothers. ``And we still have two big days before the
holiday is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellman credited Petersen's direction and the spectacular
special-effects by Industrial Light and Magic with making the
difference, as well as the studio's advertising campaign, nearly
ubiquitous in recent weeks, showing a fishing boat dwarfed by a
huge wall of water. Of special importance, he said, was the film's
PG-13 rating, which expanded the potential audience. ``The
Patriot'' is rated R.
</P>
<P>
   As with ``The Patriot,'' the audience that turned out for ``The
Perfect Storm'' was primarily those over 25. But Petersen's sea
adventure, based on the best-selling book by Sebastian Junger about
a devastating 1991 storm and its effect on a boat crew of
Massachusetts fishermen, drew an audience that was slightly skewed
toward women, about 53 percent female and 47 percent male.
</P>
<P>
   If the film can now begin to attract more young people, who make
up the bulk of the summer movie audience, it stands a good chance
of becoming the second $200-million film of the summer, after
``Mission:Impossible 2,'' which opened over the Memorial Day
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be around $75 million for our first week and certainly
have $100 million in 14 days or less,'' Fellman said. ``It
certainly has the potential to be a $200 million movie.''
</P>
<P>
   This was also a very good weekend for DreamWorks, which added
400 screens for its critically praised ``Chicken Run'' and saw only
a 27 percent decline on its second weekend, indicating that the
film is also enjoying strong word of mouth. By comparison, Fox's
``Me, Myself and Irene'' saw a 50 percent drop-off in its second
weekend and, despite the star power of Carrey, ended up finishing
behind ``Chicken Run.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend box office figures are based on actual ticket sales
from Friday and Saturday and estimates by each of the studios of
Sunday ticket sales. Final figures for the weekend will be made
public on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia Pictures was putting the best spin possible on the
opening weekend for ``The Patriot,'' a film that many expected to
end up in first place, largely on the drawing power of its star,
Mel Gibson, and the track record of its director, Roland Emmerich.
But its R-rating and a running time of 2 hours 40 minutes may have
worked against it, as well as an aversion among young moviegoers to
period pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot'' opened on Wednesday, hoping to take maximum
advantage of this year's long holiday weekend, with the Fourth
falling on a Tuesday. Instead, the studio estimated the film would
finish its first week with about $43 million, only slightly more
than ``Perfect Storm'' made in its first three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we played a bit more adult than we had anticipated,
because of the ratings and the subject matter,'' said Jeff Blake,
Columbia's head of distribution. ``We didn't play like an R-rated
action film. Now we have to do what we have to do to become the
best-holding movie of the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Blake said the exit polls were strong, and ``The Patriot''
saw a 25 percent rise in ticket sales from Friday to Saturday, so
there are hopes that the movie will still do very well. ``Though
perhaps it will be more in a long run way,'' he said. ``I think we
have a wonderful chance to be the adult film of the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gordon, one of the film's producers, said that he had
always anticipated such an opening, since the film's main audience
is older and less inclined to run out and see something on its
first weekend. He pointed to other recent films, including ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' which he also produced, as having similar openings
yet going on to extremely lucrative runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a great thing to crow about,'' Gordon said. ``Oh,
we won the weekend.' But I'd rather look at the great business the
weekend held for everybody. We're not in competition with anybody.
There's room for several good pictures.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As collectors and dealers gathered here last week for
Christie's and Sotheby's big sales of Impressionist, modern and
contemporary art, the auction houses' legal troubles in the United
States seemed to make no difference to the buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was clear that the shadow cast by the federal
antitrust investigation in New York had crossed the Atlantic. At
the same moment on Tuesday night that Sotheby's was holding its
sale of Impressionist and modern art at its Bond Street
headquarters here, Christie's was conducting its auction of
contemporary art just a few blocks away on King Street.
</P>
<P>
   Such scheduling conflicts never happened in the past when the
two companies met openly to plan the year's auctions. But with
prosecutors investigating whether the auction houses fixed prices
and questioning every move they make, it was obvious that a message
was being not so subtly delivered, even at this distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't talk to each other at all anymore,'' said one top
auction house official who requested his name not be used. Other
than that, no one in charge offered any explanation.
</P>
<P>
   As the auctions here progressed, the strong economy gave
collectors confidence about the art market, making last week's
sales successful for both Sotheby's and Christie's. Prices were
consistently high, especially for the rarest, most expensive works.
If these sales are any reflection of today's tastes, then
Impressionist paintings, sculpture and photography are especially
popular. But while prices were strong, few bidders went wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an intelligent market,'' said Franck Giraud, head of
Christie's 19th- and 20th-century art departments worldwide.
``Nobody got carried away, but at the same time they didn't let the
best things go for low prices. There were no bargains.''
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Clore, a deputy chairman of Sotheby's who runs its
Impressionist and modern art department here, defined the market as
healthy and controlled. The biggest difference between today and
the 1980s boom, she said, is that people now are more
discriminating. ``They aren't in a rush. They don't need to buy
mediocre material, and there's no absolutely speculative buying.''
</P>
<P>
   The best works sold for prices consistent with the boom years of
the late 1980s. At Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art,
for instance, Degas' ``Young Dancer at 14,'' a 1922 posthumous cast
of a dancer with a cream-colored silk bodice and a tulle-and-gauze
tutu, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $11.5 million,
above its $10.9 million low estimate.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fourth time a 1922 cast of this statue had sold at
auction in 12 years. In 1988, at the height of the market, one was
included in a sale of art from the estate of William Mayer Goetz, a
founder of 20th Century Fox, and his wife, Edith, at Christie's in
New York, where it sold to Prince Jefri Bolkiah, the brother of the
Sultan of Brunei, for $10.1 million. In 1996 Sotheby's sold another
Degas in New York on behalf of the Shelburne Museum in Vermont for
$11.9 million. And in November, Prince Jefri sold his at Sotheby's
in New York for $12.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some prices last week exceeded those in the late '80s boom.
Monet's ``Beach at Trouville,'' a sun-dappled seascape, sold to an
unidentified telephone bidder at Sotheby's on Tuesday night for
$16.4 million, well above its $15 million high estimate. The
painting had fetched $10.7 million at the Goetz sale at Christie's
in New York 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A 1942 Matisse, ``Dancer in an Armchair With a Checkered
Floor,'' that was expected to bring $3.9 million to $5.4 million at
Sotheby's, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $7.4
million. Four people wanted the painting, which shows Carla
Avogadro, a dancer who was a friend of the artist, posing in a
bright yellow chair against a background of black and white checks.
The buyer bid through David Norman, head of Sotheby's Impressionist
and modern art department in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Final prices include the auction house's commissions: for
Sotheby's it is 20 percent of the first $15,000, 15 percent of the
next $85,000 and 10 percent of any amount over $100,000. Christie's
charges 17.5 percent of the first $80,000 plus 10 percent of any
amount above that. Estimates at both auction houses do not reflect
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Christie's combined its Impressionist and
Post-Impressionist auction with its sale of 20th-century art in one
evening, and both areas of the market were strong. Its star
painting was Cezanne's ``Still Life With Fruits and a Ginger Pot''
from 1895. It was exhibited in the artist's first retrospective in
Paris the year it was painted and later belonged to two famous
dealers, Ambroise Vollard and Bruno Cassirer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Cezanne, who was never satisfied with a painting, this was
unusually finished and resolved,'' Giraud said. Two determined
bidders vied for the painting, which ended up selling to William
Acquavella, the Manhattan dealer, for $18.1 million, just at its
high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Three bidders at Christie's were willing to spend upward of $6
million for Monet's 1894 ``Spring Landscape (Giverny),'' which sold
to an unidentified telephone bidder for $6.6 million, just above
its low estimate of $6 million. A later, more abstract Monet, ``The
Japanese Bridge,'' painted between 1918 and 1924, was fought over
by two determined telephone bidders. It finally sold to an
unidentified bidder for $4.3 million, above its high estimate of
$2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   One rare and much sought-after painting, a brightly colored
Fauve portrait of the artist Jean Metzinger painted by Robert
Delaunay in 1906, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $2.9
million, far above its $2.1 million high estimate. Delaunay, who
was better-known as an abstract painter, did few Fauve paintings.
Metzinger is posed at an angle with a cigarette hanging out of his
mouth, and in the background is a Japanese print, reminiscent of
the famous van Gogh portrait ``Le Pere Tanguy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of Fauve artists you think of Matisse, Braque,
Derain and Vlamink; you don't think of Delaunay,'' Giraud said.
``So for a collector of Fauve works, this was a great find.''
</P>
<P>
   At both Sotheby's and Christie's, sculptures tended to be
popular, as they have for the last year. Works by Rodin, Giacometti
and Picasso all brought prices far above their high estimates. One
reason was that as the prices of paintings have steadily risen in
recent years, sculptures by artists like Matisse, Picasso and Degas
have seemed cheap by comparison.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Among contemporary collectors the same can be said for
photographs. Artists like Cindy Sherman, Nan Goldin, Gilbert and
George, and Thomas Struth were fought over by a crowd of young,
international collectors who were willing to pay any price to take
home famous images. Never mind that these photographs are printed
in multiples.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this media-saturated world, young collectors were raised on
images,'' said Tobias Meyer, head of Sotheby's contemporary art
department worldwide. ``They are not concerned with things being
unique, they want to know that they have something that is exactly
the same as a photograph hanging in the Museum of Modern Art.''
</P>
<P>
   This group of buyers, Meyer added, tend to come from the film
industry. ``They are completely uninterested in abstract painting.
It's a midcentury struggle they have no connection to.''
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary art in general continued to command high prices, as
it did at the auctions in New York in May. At Christie's sale of
20th-century art, Bacon's ``Study for a Portrait (Man Screaming)''
from 1952 sold for $4.4 million, far above its $2.7 million high
estimate. A Jeff Koons, ``Large Vase of Flowers,'' a 1991
polychrome wood bouquet of 140 spring flowers that stands 4 feet 3
inches high and was estimated to sell for $380,000 to $520,000,
fetched $994,961. The buyer was identified only as a European
collector.
</P>
<P>
   At Sotheby's a photorealist painting by Gerhard Richter of a
view of Corsica with a sailboat in the distance was bought by
another unidentified collector for $1.3 million, twice its high
$670,00 estimate. Two people fought to take home a late de Kooning,
``Untitled XVII,'' from 1982, an abstraction of bright blues and
reds on a white background. It sold to an unidentified telephone
bidder for $1.9 million, more than twice its high $900,000
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Experts at both Sotheby's and Christie's noticed an increase in
European buyers this season. No longer were the Top 10 works in
each sale bought by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of Europeans was a significant change,'' Meyer
said. ``This is a market fueled by new buyers and new money. It's
the economy that drives it.''

A SOME CAREFUL PRUNING, THE U.S. WOMEN'S TEAM REGROWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
  FOXBORO, Mass. _ Euphoria over winning the 1999 Women's World Cup
was quickly tempered for the Americans by a coaching change and a
contract dispute with the United States Soccer Federation. What had
seemed certain was no longer certain. Invincibility was replaced by
insecurity.
<TEXT>
<P>
   April Heinrichs, one of the early stars of the women's national
team, replaced Tony DiCicco as coach in January and bluntly told
the veterans, ``I don't care if you've played in three World Cups,
if I feel you are past your peak, I will release you.'' In her
first game as coach, she did not start the captain, Carla Overbeck,
or midfielder Michelle Akers, considered the greatest player ever
in the women's game. ``Are you putting me out to pasture?'' a
perplexed Akers asked Heinrichs.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, the coach cut five veterans who were not contending for
starting positions.
</P>
<P>
   Had she been hired by the federation to clean house?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had gone through this huge ugly brawl over the contract and
all we had been hearing was, `They don't want you guys anymore, you
create too many problems,''' the co-captain Julie Foudy said. ``We
were like, `Is she listening to them, does she believe that, did
they pick her because of that?' We didn't think so, but I don't
think she understood how nervous we were about that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the American women will face Brazil in a
rematch of the World Cup semifinal here in the championship match
of the Gold Cup at Foxboro Stadium. The teams also played to a 0-0
tie in a Gold Cup group match last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the early fears were unfounded. Heinrichs said
she never intended to do any clear-cutting of the American roster,
just some necessary pruning. Fifteen of the 18 members of the 2000
Olympic team are expected to be players from the World Cup team.
And Heinrichs has become widely popular for her competitiveness and
for her encouragement of the players to be creative and take risks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Americans face difficult questions as they attempt to
repeat as Olympic champions at the 2000 Games in Sydney, Australia,
in September: Can they survive a difficult draw that features their
toughest rivals, Norway and China, in the first two matches? Can
they win on the road after winning the 1996 Olympics and the 1999
World Cup at home? Can they compensate for injuries that have
affected the spine of their defense _ Akers (shoulder surgery),
Overbeck (knee surgery) and goalkeeper Briana Scurry (shin
splints)? Can they remain focused on soccer while also enjoying the
endorsement and public-appearance bounty of a World Cup victory?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics are going to be our biggest challenge,'' Foudy
said. ``There are a lot of people tugging at the team, so many
demands. It's been a major topic of conversation. It requires that
much more focus, that much more dedication and commitment to
saying, `No, I can't do this.' If it's not going to help you in
September, say no now. This is the last time we'll all be together.
We want to go out with a bang, not with regrets. Everyone asks if
we'll be complacent, but that's not us. We've worked harder this
year than we ever have.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after the World Cup, attendance has inevitably dropped at
the national team's matches, but Foudy said people still frequently
approached the players in airports and high-fived them and
congratulated them on the victory. ``I'm amazed at the depth of
people we've reached, from Midwesterners who never watched a soccer
match to Nascar-type guys,'' she said. ``I think it's going to have
a big impact on kids for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   With her exultant, jersey-removing celebration at the conclusion
of the penalty-kick shootout against China in the World Cup, Brandi
Chastain has entered the national lexicon as an answer on ``Who
Wants to be a Millionaire'' and a question to the finalists in the
Junior Miss America pageant. The pageant contestants criticized
Chastain, but she said she had no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not unhappy I did it,'' she said. ``It was a liberating
moment for myself and I hope it was a liberating experience for
other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Five reserves from the World Cup team have been dropped from the
pool of Olympic players _ goalkeepers Saskia Webber and Tracy
Ducar, midfielder Tiffany Roberts, forward Danielle Fotopoulos and,
most notably, midfielder Tisha Venturini, who scored two goals on
four shots in the World Cup. Of the younger players brought in, the
most significant has been goalkeeper Siri Mullinix, who has started
in Scurry's absence and has performed assertively in patroling the
penalty area and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got depth at every position that we've never had
before,'' said Heinrichs, who coached the past four years at the
University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Scurry, Overbeck and Akers are expected back with the team this
month, but Akers remains the biggest question mark. At 34, she
continues to suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome and is recovering
from surgery to repair a dislocated shoulder. She has not played
with the team since the World Cup, and Lorrie Fair has assumed her
spot in defensive midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Elite players can take significant time off and still retain
their skills, Heinrichs said, which Akers has done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our hope that she can do that again,'' Heinrichs said.
``On the other hand, she battles chronic fatigue and she hasn't
been with the team in 11 months. That's like Steve Young taking a
year off and jumping back in in the middle of the season when the
49ers are 6-5 and making a playoff run. That's a concern. But
Michelle certainly has a presence just being on the field. There's
value in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Her shoulder surgery in April was complicated by a fracture and
nerve damage, Akers said. She will not be completely healed for the
Olympics but will be healthy enough to play, she said. Akers also
struggled to regain her energy after the World Cup and even
considered retirement in early April. In a way, the shoulder
surgery restored her motivation, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the fire is back,'' Akers said. ``I've trained my fanny
off. My health is good. I'm confident that, if given the chance to
play in, I can be a starter for the team.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Apprehension about Heinrichs as coach began to dissolve in
March, when the team traveled to a tournament in Portugal.
Heinrichs got to know the players, they got to know her. The day
before the final against Norway, she had the team play an amusing
game of soccer golf, complete with props and a team manager who
carried a tray of sparkling water around the course as if she were
a waiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony was great,'' defender Kate Sobrero said of DiCicco, who
led the team to victory in the 1996 Olympics and the 1999 World
Cup. ``He took this team farther than anyone ever had. But change
makes you better. It's good to have April. She wants you to take
risks and gives you the freedom to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs, who is 36 and a native of Littleton, Colo., is a
seminal figure in American soccer, the first woman elected to the
sport's national hall of fame. She was captain of the American team
that won the inaugural Women's World Cup in China in 1991, playing
forward with Akers and Carin Gabarra in an alignment known as the
triple-edged sword, fronting a relentless attack that outscored the
opposition 74 goals to 5 during qualifying and the final round of
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``April set the foundation for this team,'' Foudy said. ``All
the principles we live by _ the work rate, the mentality, the
teamwork, all the things that have made us successful _ stem from
her days as captain.''
</P>
<P>
   Anson Dorrance, who recruited Heinrichs to the University of
North Carolina and later made her captain of the national team,
frequently tells the story of how Heinrichs upset the upperclass
players at Carolina with her ferocious play as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you going to do about April?'' one player asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clone her?'' he thought to himself.
</P>
<P>
   She became a star by racing through cultural red lights that
hindered women from being overly aggressive on the soccer field and
by dispelling the conventional wisdom that women had difficulty
competing against friends for fear of destroying their personal
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was driven to compete, driven to want to win, and the
consequences never occurred to me,'' Heinrichs said. ``I didn't
feel constricted by social norms or constrained by criticism. In
fact, I felt the opposite. I felt my acceptance as a person came
through my athleticism. It wasn't until I was 22 or 23 that I
separated my athletic identity from my personal identity and
realized they weren't tied in.''
</P>
<P>
   Foudy, who played four seasons with Heinrichs on the national
team, said she had never met so competitive a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on the road, on one of our first trips, and we were
playing Pictionary,'' Foudy said. ``I was on her team, and she was
screaming: `Draw faster! What is it you're drawing, I can't tell!'
She was intent on winning this freaking game as if her life
depended on it. On the field, I knew what she was like, but this
was a whole new level. Obsessed with winning Pictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   It is in this aggressive image that Heinrichs wants to mold the
national team for its run at an Olympic gold medal, bringing an
attacking style that she likens to the Phi Slama Jama days of
basketball at the University of Houston. It was the way the
Americans played during her own days on the national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``At practice, we used to pick teams and play, and my first pick
would always be April,'' Foudy said. ``I didn't care if she had two
broken legs, a straight jacket, crutches, I'd take her first. Even
if she couldn't play, she'd be on the sidelines screaming to get
everyone going.'' &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A complex of thunderstorms will ignite across the eastern Great
Lakes Monday morning as a jet stream disturbance intercepts a humid
air mass. These storms will then march east, nearing the Northeast
and Middle Atlantic seaboards around dusk. Some of the storms have
damaging winds, but the most disruptive character of the storms
will be heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast will be partly sunny and humid. As the sun heats
the ground, ascending currents of moistened air will cause
billowing clouds to form, some of which will produce thunderstorms.
Storms will be most numerous in south Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Humid air streaming north from the Gulf of Mexico will fuel
afternoon thunderstorms over the western Plains while cool and
unsettled weather affects the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: THUNDERSTORM RHYTHMS
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn on Sunday, strong thunderstorms erupted in
Minnesota. Unlike many thunderstorms, these were not energized by
solar heating. The key to these storms were the rhythms of the
moisture-laden wind a half-mile above the ground. During the day,
turbulent motions mixing the lower part of the atmosphere cause the
5000-foot winds to be slowed by friction. When the sun's energy is
lost, a shallower layer is mixed, allowing the 5000-foot winds to
be unfettered by friction. These faster winds were able to supply
the moisture vital to the night storms.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KFAR KILA, Lebanon _ It was a fine, sunny day Sunday and
thousands of people flocked to Lebanon's newest tourist attraction
_ the barbed wire fence at the new, official border with Israel _
for a stroll with the kids, a chance to pose for pictures and
videos or even throw a stone or two in the general direction of the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   By late morning, festive flag-bedecked cars and buses jammed the
narrow roads, pock-marked by artillery, that wind through the steep
stony hills of the strip of southern Lebanon that Israel and its
proxy militia had occupied for more than two decades. Lebanon,
alone in the Arab world, has Sunday as its day of rest, a tradition
of its Christian-led government.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way from Beirut, many of the village squares were
decorated with broken-down armored cars or old artillery pieces,
now plastered with Hezbollah posters, left behind when the South
Lebanese Army, the Israeli-sponsored militia, fled in the wake of
Israel's abrupt pullout in May.
</P>
<P>
   Bright yellow Hezbollah flags flew over all the old SLA and
Israeli strongholds and gun positions, but there was no sign in the
streets of armed militiamen or the once-common checkpoints. In the
past few days, new yellow roadside signs have sprouted, marking
places where Israeli patrols were ambushed by the Hezbollah, or
where it lost some of the 1,200 resistance ``martyrs,'' as the
Islamic militia calls the fighters lost doing battle here.
</P>
<P>
   A mock-up of a Katyusha multiple rocket launcher, made of
plastic piping with Sohat mineral water bottles painted red posing
as missile tips, has been set up by the entrance to the walk along
the border. The model was the subject of urgent phone calls between
military officials on both sides of the border and U.N.
peacekeepers before assurances were given that it was a fake.
</P>
<P>
   In true Lebanese fashion, merchants have sprung up around it: a
soft ice cream truck, a couple of makeshift restaurants, stands
selling clothing and watches and tapes of resistance songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks God, business is good,'' said Mahmoud, a hefty, bearded
fighter turned merchant at what appeared to be the authorized
Hezbollah souvenir stand, directly across from the fortified
Israeli position at the Fatma Gate, where they used to let their
SLA allies enter Israel. ``Especially on Sunday. All the day is
like this, crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah baseball caps in yellow, red or blue were selling for
two U.S. dollars, the preferred currency. There were small yellow
Hezbollah flags for $2, bigger ones for $3, along with T-shirts,
key chains, recordings and other nicknacks. But even this shop had
no monopoly on framed pictures of the Hezbollah leader Sheik Sayyed
Hassan Nasrullah; They were everywhere, showing the sheik looking
thoughtful, waving a rifle or talking on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Near the gate, Jalal Hammoud _ who had grown up here, been
jailed and expelled by the SLA, and returned last month _ happily
tended the gas-fired oven in a cargo container marked ``Bakery of
Liberation'' that he had moved down from Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my village, I was born and lived here,'' he said, making
manoushee, a traditional thin, flat bread, topped with thyme,
cheese or meat. ``Now we are happy. And business is good,
especially Sunday because thousands of people come from Beirut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to Hezbollah,'' read a banner stretched near the
entrance, and the Shiite Moslems here, the constituency of the
Party of God, took particular pride in what the sheik and his men
have trumpeted as the sole Arab victory over the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, it is a kind of a promenade, a walk along the
barbed wire lined fence looking into the Israeli positions. There
were troops of Shiite Muslim boy and girl scouts, the girls with
light blue smocks and darker head coverings. For women, the styles
ranged from full black Iranian-style chadors to flashy open-toed
spike heels. People took pictures of each other along the fence,
videotaped everything in sight and climbed on buildings for a
better view.
</P>
<P>
   But someone _ apparently, a member of the Hezbollah _ had also
thoughtfully dumped piles of rocks at convenient intervals along
the walkway and many, particularly young men, hurled them over the
fence. Except for a rare Humvee on a quick patrol of the dirt road
next to the fence, there were no Israelis in sight. Still, the
stone-throwers seemed to find it a satisfying exercise. One 7-year
old girl, Tamara Hajji, came from near Zahle with a slingshot in
her back pocket, and her parents clustered around encouragingly as
she took aim.
</P>
<P>
   Among the crowd, there were also many Palestinians living in
Lebanon _ including one group of 234 from the Bekaa valley. Beneath
their stone-throwing bravado is a fear that they are being left out
of the maneuvering toward some sort of Middle East peace, as well
as a bitterness at the way they are treated here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out, get out,'' screamed an elderly Palestinian woman,
awkwardly heaving a rock at the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from Dearborn, Mich., Abed Hussein, a Ford Motor worker,
took in the scene with his daughters, Nancy, 19, who wore a white
headscarf with her red Tommy Hilfinger jersey, and Zinab, 17, in
tow. The whole scene, Zinab said, made her feel ``proud.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   He had come with the girls to visit his 82-year-old father, Abed
Hussein, who had fled his home in Israel in 1949. The elder Hussein
still lives near Sidon, where he raised the next generation of his
Palestinian family.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen members of the extended family piled into a green
van, the girls trailing Hezbollah flags out the windows, and drove
through back roads until they found an old border post left over
from the days of the British and French mandates, Ali Hussein
videotaping all the while. By the old wrecked gate was a Hezbollah
outpost, manned by a couple of riflemen. Up the hill stood an
Israeli watchtower. Here, the old man could point to the village
where he grew up, Malkiya.
</P>
<P>
   One man dug up some of the soil and put it in a plastic bag to
take home. Another car pulled up to the lonely spot with another
Palestinian family from Dearborn. Someone put one of the resistance
cassettes they had just bought in the car's player and soon they
were all holding hands, dancing in a circle to the strong beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my father's father's father's land,'' the old man
said, pointing past the barbed wire. ``The fig and olive trees are
all the same. When I see it, it is like a knife cutting my
stomach.''

   TERRACE-COLLAPSE - The parties had just started warming up when
the music stopped at 4:45 p.m. Saturday. A terrace overlooking Lake
Erie at the Lonz Winery, crowded with over 100 people, collapsed in
an instant, 18 feet into an old wine cellar, killing one Columbus
man and sending at least 75 people to the hospital. ``They came
running up and said, 'Stop playing, the terrace just collapsed,' ``
said Larry Read, who has played the piano for revelers at the
winery for 12 years. (Dayton Daily News)

witnessed revolutionary changes in the racial and gender makeup of
Southern legislatures and the awakening of the Republican Party in
the South. A generation of Southern governors _ often with the

   SOLARMAX _ The northern lights, including rare red colored
auroras, have been seen as far south as the Carolinas. In Alaska
and Greenland, radio frequencies used by aviators and mariners have
been hit by sudden fadeouts. NASA, worried that unusual heating of
the Earth's atmosphere was dragging down its space station, had to
use the space shuttle to boost it to a higher altitude. It's the
summer of the hyperactive sun, Cycle 23. Every 11 years or so, the
storms that rage across the surface of the sun reach a frenzied
peak, flinging charged particles and hot gases into space with
predictable _ and sometimes unpredictable _ consequences for the
increasingly wired world on the third rock from the sun. ``Solar
activity is expected to peak in the next month or two,'' says
Ernest Hildner, director of the government's space weather center
in Colorado. ``Every cycle is different, but there is no question
that our society is more vulnerable now than it ever has been.''

by city commissioners July 17, is based on comments made during a

When she retired on June 9 from Kennedy Middle School in southwest
Atlanta, you might expect that after that much time on the job,
Dennis-Stinson would, well, retire. Hardly. Dennis-Stinson, 60, a
self-proclaimed ``jill of all trades'' is as busy as ever. When
she's not painting the exterior of her home, laying tile in her

   STOCK-MARKET-DEBATE _ ATLANTA _ When the Nasdaq composite index

``Irrational Exuberance,'' a scholarly and foreboding forecast that
the common stocks we love so much are headed for a prolonged bear
market over the next 10 to 20 years. The book became a best seller
and Shiller an instant celebrity, appearing on TV and in the
financial press, where he defended his views with quiet assurance.
His basic argument is that common stocks have risen in price to
levels that are unsupported _ and unsupportable _ by the profit
prospects of U.S. corporations. The other side of that argument is
another book, ``Dow 36,000,'' which was published in September and
also became a best seller. (Walker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: HER ISSUES AND HER LEGACY
</HEADLINE>
  By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ How does Madeleine Albright want to be remembered
as secretary of state? As Albright zoomed from country to country,
region to region _ four hours here, 36 hours there in nine days _
the legacy question was never far away.
</P>
<P>
   Part of her mark in history will be as the first woman to hold
the post, a role she relishes. In Seoul, South Korea, last week,
she emerged from her plane in citrus yellow, a bold look she said
was intended as a metaphor for President Kim Dae Jung's ``sunshine
policy'' with North Korea. In Berlin, she was not too shy to tell
an audience that she was grateful for cosmetics to help disguise
her exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has also taken on issues that others may have
considered too soft, like the empowerment of women in developing
countries and Internet literacy in nations under dictatorships.
</P>
<P>
   But as Albright traveled from Beijing to Seoul and on to Warsaw
in late June, with an interlude in the Middle East and a drive
through the Brandenburg Gate, it was clear that, in the last six
months of her term, she wants to concentrate on her vision of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy, she said in Warsaw, was her ``lodestar.'' And to
emphasize the message, she intends to stay on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're going to do is keep traveling around the world and
have 36-hour days, so six months is nine months,'' she told
reporters as her plane headed home last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   She has already visited 82 countries since she took office in
January 1997, a record for any secretary of state. She plans two
trips to Asia this month, and perhaps another in the fall,
including a possible stop in Nepal, where she has never been.
</P>
<P>
   Albright says her travel shows how the job of secretary of state
has changed since the end of the Cold War. Her predecessors, she
says, concentrated largely on the Soviet Union and the Middle East.
Since then, there has been an explosion of new countries _ 189 in
the United Nations at last count.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, foreign policy issues, Albright likes to say, have
expanded beyond traditional questions of arms control and balance
of power to international business corruption and illegal
immigration. She feels obliged, she suggests, to push U.S.
interests to new corners of the world. And for Albright, a child of
Central Europe whose Czechoslovak parents fled the Communists and
arrived in the United States in 1949 to begin a new life, the
nurturing of democracy is a prime interest. (As she bounced from
culture to culture on this latest trip, she appeared most at home
chatting into the late evening over coffee in Warsaw's old town).
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of her stay in Poland was a conference that
pulled together 107 democracies. But the gathering _ born very much
of Albright's guiding hand _ revealed undertones of resentment at
American hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   This was most stridently expressed by France, which refused to
sign the closing statement. But there were criticisms elsewhere,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch in
New York, whose organization was present in Warsaw, says the
promotion of democracy by the United States is useful but is done
in such a way that it ``fuels growing hostility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is increasingly viewed as a government that
preaches to the rest of the world but is unwilling to be bound by
international standards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Albright's efforts, Washington has failed to sign U.N.
accords on an international criminal court or on the control of
land mines _ largely because the administration and Congress want
to make American military personnel immune from international laws
imposed on others, and Albright failed to beat out the Pentagon in
internal administration debates.
</P>
<P>
   Albright seems to believe that she does best abroad, riding
imperial motorcades and speaking unchallenged from a broad variety
of venues. There, she is away from the political sniping of
Congress and day-to-day management from the National Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   She finished this last tour of the world in Berlin with a speech
on democracy in the Balkans, which dealt with Serbia as a last
holdout of repression.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary began her term rebuking the harshest of dictators,
Saddam Hussein. She was one of the strongest advocates within the
administration for military strikes and economic sanctions against
him, but the Iraqi leader remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   Since then _ before, during and after last year's Kosovo war _
she has paid much attention to another repressive leader, President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. A year after the NATO air
campaign, he, too, remains in power _ much to the evident
disappointment of Albright.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, she reiterated that Milosevic belongs in The Hague,
home of an international tribunal that indicted him on charges of
war crimes. ``If Milosevic cared at all about the rule of law,''
she added, ``he would turn himself over to The Hague.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he will go,'' she said as she headed home, offering
no clear scheme to achieve that goal beyond what she called a
combination of people working inside and outside Serbia, and her
opinion that his government is increasingly brittle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patience is what is necessary,'' she said. ``The calendar is
not what we're looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright is keenly aware of her own calendar, however. She was
asked whether the Balkans, which have consumed much of her time,
would remain a top priority for the next administration. ``It
depends on who gets elected,'' she replied, adding, ``No matter
where I am, we're not going to forget them.''

RAFTER LIKES HIS CHANCES WITH A REPAIRED SHOULDER  
 THE SERIOUSNESS OF MCENROE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ During a long winter, there were moments
when Patrick Rafter's surgically repaired shoulder deceived him.
After arthroscopic surgery in October to repair a tear in his
rotator cuff, he went through a series of optimistic strides that
were routinely dashed by a setback.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't sure, but perhaps the tennis career was over for
Rafter, the two-time U.S. Open winner with the screaming-teen
following. Rafter thought that if this season was too much of a
struggle, he might retire. But after all the rehabilitation, and
all the time he was forced to confront his tennis mortality, Rafter
has snapped back to life. When play resumes on Monday at Wimbledon,
the 12th-seeded Rafter will face Thomas Johansson in the Round of
16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize I have a chance here again,'' Rafter said. ``Now,
I'm starting to play good tennis again. The shoulder's fine. Makes
me excited to be out here. I still haven't had a big five-setter,
yet. Not that I want one, but it still really hasn't been tested
out. But I'm confident it will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not so sure after his surgery. Just over a year ago,
Rafter began to feel the pain creep into his shoulder during the
French Open. It worsened at Wimbledon as he advanced to the
semifinals. By the United States Open, it was unbearable, and he
withdrew in the fifth set of his first-round match. But after
toiling through rehabilitation, he feels confident in wielding his
big serve. Still, in the back of his mind, there is a clock
ticking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just pretty happy out here doing what I'm doing and trying
to enjoy the most of it right now,'' the 27-year old Australian
said. ``There's no guarantee the shoulder will be ready or fit in
three years, so I'm doing everything I can, all the strength work.
I'm at the gym all the time. I have a lot of other little exercises
I have to do every day. If I can continue that, then hopefully I
can get through another couple years.'' headline  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more intriguing matches on Monday, the resilient
Jennifer Capriati will play the second-seeded Lindsay Davenport in
the Round of 16. They represent just two of the Americans who have
survived the women's draw.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to fare well at the French Open, the American
women are dominating Wimbledon. The list also includes Venus and
Serena Williams, Monica Seles, Lisa Raymond, Kristina Brandi and
Lilia Osterloh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been really great,'' Davenport said. ``There is always a
level of players, it seems, that always get forgotten because
they're not at the top, like Osterloh, Brandi and even Raymond to a
certain point. So it's been a very good tournament. It's nice to
see everyone still around here.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SERIOUS MCENROE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the day of rest at Wimbledon, John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg
stirred up echoes from the past when they played in a charity event
Sunday. In 1980, Borg defeated McEnroe for the Wimbledon title
after an epic fourth-set tie-breaker. Sunday, McEnroe used his deft
touch to come away with a 6-3, 7-6 (5) victory. Typical McEnroe, he
yelled out, ``You can't be serious,'' when the referee delayed
suspending the match because of a 15-minute drizzle.  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: THE INDEPENDENCT WAYS OF THE WILLIAMS' SISTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON , England _ It was early in the fortnight, and Richard
Williams was crisscrossing the grounds with a cigarette dangling
from his lips, shaking random thoughts from his head like Tic-Tacs.
Did he mention his screenplay, his plans for a magazine, his
interests in cashing in on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm into Webcasting,'' Williams said. ``If Serena and Venus
went into that business, they'd make more money in two years than
they would in 50 of doing something else. If it was up to me, I'd
like to see them retire right now and move on. Let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just a suggestion, though. At the same time that tour
parents like Damir Dokic and Samantha Stevenson appeared on the
grounds of the All England Club like Svengalis for their children _
either feeding them answers to questions or hovering over their
every move during the first week of Wimbledon _it became more
apparent that Richard and Oracene Williams have raised two
independent thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   They still call Richard Williams Daddy, but as Serena and Venus
Williams exit their teens one by one, both have been encouraged to
inch into adulthood. With built-in filters for parental advice,
they have begun to make their own decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on what decision it is,'' said Venus Williams, who
turned 20 two weeks ago. ``My parents have taught us to make
decisions on our own, to be independent. But on certain things, we
still go, `Can we do this?' It's quite odd.''
</P>
<P>
   But normal, too. Sometimes, normal seems in short supply on the
tour. So does perspective, and this is a trait Venus and Serena
Williams use deftly when it comes to their father's techno-career
dreams for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're real good at something, it's tough to say goodbye,
especially if it's something you've done all your life,'' said
Venus Williams, who, like Serena, will begin Week 2 of Wimbledon
with a Round of 16 match today. ``I suppose I'll be around a little
while more. No more retirement scares at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd get bored in an office, just sitting around, eating
doughnuts.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows herself well. Early last week her father told a story
about how Venus used to stare out the window of her second-grade
classroom, with the sound of the lecture as background noise for
her daydreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teacher said to me, `Your daughter has no interest in
school; she's always looking out the window,''' Richard Williams
said. ``I thought she was kidding, but I got up on top of the
building and saw her looking out the window. I asked Venus why, and
she said, `Everything they're doing, I did in first grade.'''
</P>
<P>
   On a tour where education is sometimes squeezed in between photo
ops, practice time, travel schedules and matches, the articulate
Williams sisters do seem advanced. They enjoy the learning process
_ even on the court. They have heard past criticisms about their
games _ too much power, not enough strategy _ and have been open to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a different game than when we first came out,'' said
Serena Williams, who will be 19 in September. ``We have a lot of
power, whereas someone who doesn't have it has to do different
things. But I think now I have added strategy to my game.''
</P>
<P>
   They have not altered their flair, though. They are still as
free-spirited and shoulder high in self-esteem as when they arrived
on the scene, but they were a calm core amid the lunacy that
whirled around them last week. On the same day Jelena Dokic's
ranting father was led away by police, an accusation of a racial
slur was leveled by Alexandra Stevenson, and Alexandra's mother,
Samantha, described a physical confrontation with a French player,
the Williams sisters would not be baited into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Serena Williams has denied any encounters of overt
racism on the tour, but she was politically aware enough to take a
stand against the Confederate flag issue in South Carolina,
refusing to play in the state. On Friday night, a day after
Alexandra Stevenson's claim, Serena Williams was asked again if she
had been confronted with racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already covered that question,'' said. ``You can get the
transcripts.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters are quick-witted, sometimes coy, but often viewed as
aloof. Yet their standoffishness seems borne out of a survival
instinct. Last week, Stevenson described hazing she said she
received by fellow players whom she believed were jealous of her
celebrity. While the Williams sisters have been celebrated on
magazine covers and in television features, they do not take notes
on who loves or loathes them. Steering clear of gossip, they keep
their distance from other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always around my mom, my dad and Venus,'' Serena Williams
said. ``Just stick close to yourself and be not too friendly.
That's why a lot of people have a problem with us, because we're
not too friendly with anyone. We're cordial, say, `Hi,' and et
cetera.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not motivated by popularity, steered by cliques or
unnerved by sister envy. When Week 2 of Wimbledon begins, Venus and
Serena Williams will be on track to accomplish the same thing: win
at Wimbledon. Last summer, Serena won the United States Open title
while Venus sat emotionally detached from the moment. At that
point, the issue of sibling rivalry took root. On Saturday, Venus
Williams handled the issue the same way she does most others, with
maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even think we have sibling rivalry in our heart,'' she
said. ``Whatever we share, we share the best we can. I don't think
it's inside of us. Does it really matter who won a Grand Slam
first? She played better. It's my loss. It's her win. It's all in
the Williams family.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a family that is tight, and yet Richard and Oracene
Williams have given their daughters room to grow. Their daughters
recently moved into their own home. And during a week when parents
trampled the bounds of control, the sisters stood out as glowing
examples of independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad always talks about his mom,'' said Serena Williams,
whose grandmother was a sharecropper. ``He always talks about how
she helped him be the person that he is. He's a very positive
person. He's really outgoing and really he's like _ I wish I could
describe him. He's very determined. I just imagine my grandmother
to be the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really got a chance to know her very well, but from
all the stuff that he says and the things that he does, usually the
apple doesn't fall far from the tree.''  &QL;

IN CHICAGO, TV NEWS GOES BACK TO BASICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something strange has happened to the 10 p.m. newscast on
Chicago's Channel 2, WBBM-TV.
</P>
<P>
   It was in February that the health correspondent, Dr. Michael
Breen, stopped doing nightly health reports with titles like
``Potentially Deadly Fruit'' (grapefruit) and ``The Secret to a
Good Sex Life'' (exercise), to focus on topics like risks
associated with early prostate cancer screening (unnecessary
treatment). And the weatherman, Steve Baskerville, toned down his
chatty banter in favor of shorter meteorological reports.
</P>
<P>
   One night last month, when the other local newscasts opened with
live reports from a neighborhood where the power had briefly gone
out, WBBM devoted most of its early minutes to an accord between
the Environmental Protection Agency and chemical manufacturers,
limiting the use of a dangerous insecticide.
</P>
<P>
   And last Wednesday, when the other 10 p.m. programs led with
stories about a nonfatal shooting of an off-duty police officer and
Elian Gonzalez's return to Cuba, the Channel 2 newscast began with
a lengthy report on the day's Supreme Court decisions, including
one to strike down a law banning a controversial form of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the management at WBBM-TV has thrown out the local
news playbook of pizazz and sensationalism used at TV stations
throughout the country and replaced it with an on-air clinic in
no-frills journalism.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is a gimmick in all of this, it is that there is no
gimmick. For Channel 2, the CBS-owned station in Chicago, the
restructured news program represents not so much a bold move in
journalism as an attempt to increase revenue and crawl out of last
place in its local news market.
</P>
<P>
   But it also casts the national spotlight once again on Chicago,
the third-largest television market in the country _ where Jerry
Springer, Siskel and Ebert and Oprah Winfrey were made famous. The
no-gimmicks strategy is being studied across the nation by news
directors and station managers, who have sought ways to stem the
loss of viewers of their own local news programs, which can account
for as much as a third of a station's advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Some reasons for dwindling local news audiences are obvious:
with 24-hour news channels and information available over the
Internet at any time, the news market has simply become more
competitive. Yet there is a growing sense in local TV news that
another factor behind the ratings decline is a perception among
viewers that the newscasts have been gradually dumbed down.
</P>
<P>
   The people who devised the new 10 p.m. model at WBBM, where
ratings for the late evening news have plunged 70 percent since the
late 1980's and are far behind its competitors' on the NBC and ABC
stations, share that view. They set about developing a new 10 p.m.
program last year with an eye toward righting what they saw as the
wrongs of local TV journalism, hoping to prove that higher-quality
news would draw a higher-quality audience _ better educated, more
affluent _ worth more to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it is unclear if the experiment is working. Although the
program's ratings rose initially, they later dropped. But whether
their effort succeeds or fails, the station's journalists say the
reward has been in the journey, which has involved heavy doses of
journalistic soul-searching about local TV news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had lost our way, and we disappointed a lot of
people who counted on us,'' Carol Marin, the program's anchor, said
in an interview at her Chicago office. ``We stopped telling you
things that were particularly important and started just telling
you anything that we thought maybe offered you a little bit of eye
candy.''
</P>
<P>
   Marin, 51, said she believed that the quality of local news had
deteriorated gradually in recent decades. As entertainment
programming costs went up, news became a comparatively stronger
profit generator for station managers, who with the help of
consultants devised stunts and gimmicks to draw viewers.
</P>
<P>
   One such stunt, in fact, led Marin to leave her previous job, in
1997, as the lead anchor at WMAQ, Chicago's NBC station. In what
she considered a clear ploy to lure viewers, WMAQ hired Jerry
Springer, host of the daytime talk show, as an on-air commentator
for the newscast she co-anchored. After nearly 20 years at the
station, she quit in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Marin moved to WBBM, initially as a part-time correspondent
focusing on investigative pieces not only for the local news, but
also for the CBS network's new prime-time magazine show ``Public
Eye with Bryant Gumbel.'' She said at the time that she had sworn
off anchoring for good.
</P>
<P>
   But when the ratings for WBBM's late evening news program
slipped even further in May 1999, the station manager, Hank Price,
persuaded Marin to take the 10 p.m. anchor slot by promising that
she would be able to shape the local program as she saw fit.
</P>
<P>
   It was an offer she could not refuse. Along with station
executives and news department staffers, Marin set about devising a
wholly new 10 p.m. broadcast. She convened dozens of meetings over
six months in which they debated how news should be defined and how
it should be conveyed to viewers. The meetings became almost like
group therapy sessions, according to station staff members.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the group concluded that the conventional local news
format long used for Channel 2's late evening newscast was
unacceptable. So they decided that the revised 10 o'clock news
would not follow any rigid formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were questions that we asked like, `What do viewers want
from weather?''' said Pat Costello, the new WBBM news director.
``If there's the threat of a big storm, they want to know
everything. Otherwise, they want to know `How hot? How cold?' and
`What's it going to be like for the next five days?'''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Baskerville, the weatherman, was told to shorten his reports,
although he was assured they would grow in length and prominence in
cases of severe weather. Tim Weigel, the sportscaster, was given
similar orders.
</P>
<P>
   Another philosophical question arose: If an abandoned warehouse
is burning brightly near the highway, making for great photography,
but no one is hurt and traffic has not been affected, is it a
story? Maybe, Marin said. But, she added, ``You don't stick a
reporter out there in front of it, eight hours later, and say,
`There was an unbelievable fire here earlier today where nobody got
hurt and nothing was lost.'''
</P>
<P>
   Breen, the health reporter, and staff members agreed that the
nightly health reports were among the worst offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd say, `Coming up: The fruit that kills you,''' Breen
recalled. ``And, it would be, `grapefruit _ if you combine it with
certain medications.''' The solution, they agreed, was for Breen to
present reports less frequently but on weightier issues.
</P>
<P>
   The team also decided the station would produce longer stories
and pass over those considered inconsequential. And any banter
between personalities that was not spontaneous was out, as were
plugs for sponsors or network shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the things that I said I couldn't ever do again,'' Marin
said, ``is to say, `Meet the real guy behind tonight's movie.'''
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, there would be no closing shots of animals _ or,
as the staff mantra had it, ``no water-skiing squirrels.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, at least, it was a completely new format for
television news. And Price signed off on the plan. With CBS so far
back in third place, there was nothing to lose. And here was a
program he could sell to advertisers as being geared to a more
upscale, sophisticated crowd. The sales staff did just that,
executives said, lifting the rate for a 30-second spot nearly 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   When the revamped format was introduced on Feb. 7, Marin, as a
lone female anchor, stood in marked contrast to the rival network
affiliates' male-female anchor teams. Her competitors led their
newscasts with stories about a water main break earlier that day in
downtown Chicago. Marin's newscast all but ignored it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she opened with a report about the deposed city
treasurer, Miriam Santons, who had spoken that day with reporters
for the first time since a judge had reversed her conviction on
charges of fraud and attempted extortion.
</P>
<P>
   For the first month, viewer reaction was positive. According to
Nielsen Media Research, the television ratings service, the program
was watched in 214,700 homes in February, a sweeps month in which
stations closely gauge ratings to set advertising rates. But while
the audience was 5 percent larger than it had been a year earlier,
viewership was still far smaller than for the 10 p.m. news programs
on ABC (474,295 households) and NBC (349,563).
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while there was a falloff among older viewers of Marin's
program, its audience of people between 25 and 54 _ who matter most
to the advertisers that sponsor news _ increased 33 percent over
the year-earlier period. And viewership among more affluent viewers
was also up for February.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings upturn seemed to be temporary, however. During the
May sweeps period, the program's viewership declined 13 percent in
total households, compared with the prior May, and was down by 25
percent among viewers in the 25-to-54 age range, according to
Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   The WBBM approach has come under fire from some media critics
and, not surprisingly, from competitors, who have taken to calling
it ``PBS on CBS.'' One of the newscast's more prominent critics is
Bill Kurtis, a former WBBM anchor who is now host of
``Investigative Reports'' on the A&AMP;E cable network.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Kurtis criticized the program for failing to
report all of the news of the day. ``I think they made a mistake,''
he said. ``You have to cover the news or you're a talk show.''
</P>
<P>
   At WBBM, Price said he intended to stay with the format adopted
for Marin's 10 p.m. program, which, he said, still needed time to
catch on with viewers.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems the people who matter, the people who buy ads, are
willing to stick with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really holding out,'' said Ross S. Currie, local broadcast
director of the Chicago branch of TN Media, a media buying firm.
``I really think 'BBM will come around.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Currie said he expected the ratings to go up soon, with
some help from CBS' new hit program in prime time: ``Survivor.''

AT 49, EARNHARDT PUTS THE THROTTLE TO CRITICS ABOUT HIM AGING 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE CALDWELL   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ He is 49 years old and hates it that he
cannot quite get his gut to disappear. Otherwise, Dale Earnhardt is
as happy as he could possibly be. He will almost admit to having
fun. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone tells you I'm riding my years out,'' Earnhardt
said, pleasantly but firmly, ``they're not paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, pay attention to this: Earnhardt is back to running with
the whippersnappers, chasing an eighth Winston Cup championship.
Following an eighth-place finish in the Pepsi 400 on Saturday, he
remained in second place in the standing, just 52 points behind
Bobby Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton won the race by holding off Dale Jarrett at the
finish line, but the race to accumulate points has become more than
a sideshow. Before Saturday's race, Labonte led Earnhardt by 67
points. Jarrett, 129 points behind Labonte a week ago, is now only
76 points back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Dale Earnhardt driving harder and more aggressively than
I have seen him in the last three years,'' Burton said. ``I don't
see him bowing over by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who won his last championship six years ago and
finished second in 1995, never dropped too far off the pace. But he
dropped far enough for people to start noticing and delicately
making the point that he was getting passed by.
</P>
<P>
   That rankled Earnhardt almost as much as driving in a race like
the Pepsi 400 in which restrictor plates are mandated to keep
speeds down. This was never about age.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after breaking his collarbone and sternum in a
spectacular accident, Earnhardt is fully healthy. He also believes
he is driving for a team that has a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt has not won a race this year but has finished in the
top five seven times, equaling last year's output. He likes winning
more than almost anything else, even seeing his son, Dale Jr., win
a race, but he knows that consistency, not just checkered flags,
wins Winston Cup championships. Much of the pressure will now come
from chasing Labonte. Bring it on, Earnhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy the pressure,'' he said. ``I thrive on it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Earnhardt does not like is Nascar continually coming up
with ways to slow drivers down. He misses the old days, which for
him were the 1980's, in which he and drivers like Darrell Waltrip
and Rusty Wallace did a lot of ``gouging and sticking.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not like what has developed on the track. Now, Earnhardt
said, the contenders run in a pack _ ``existing on the track
together,'' to use his words _ waiting for the perfect time to make
the one move that could win a race.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years ago, Bill Elliott won the pole for the Daytona
500 by turning a 210-mile-an-hour lap. The top qualifying speed for
Saturday's race, run on the same track, was 187.547 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only sport that ties the hands of the competitors
from going faster,'' Earnhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   He has foiled rules changes that might have handcuffed him.
Richard Childress, the owner of Earnhardt's black Chevrolet, said
before the Pepsi 500 that the race should be a showcase, for all
cars but the Chevies. Even after the race, Earnhardt grumbled, ``I
think the Chevrolets are all about 15th-place cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Earnhardt finds himself on Labonte's rear bumper midway
through the Winston Cup season. Labonte said Saturday that he still
felt confident. ``They beat us,'' Labonte said after finishing
12th, ``but it was not as bad as it could have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the top contenders are aware that Earnhardt has
more experience at winning championships than they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he has a lot more experience at winning
championships than Bobby and me put together,'' Jarrett, the
defending champion, said, ``and we could take a lot of other people
and add them to that mix, and he'd still have more experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that he's going to be tough as this goes on, as the
season winds down, and if he can hang around, and we certainly feel
that he will, it's going to be interesting to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Mayfield nudged aside Earnhardt on the last lap of a
victory June 19 at Long Pond, Pa., and Winston Cup fans instantly
saw delicious symbolism in a 31-year-old pushing aside a driver
closing hard on 50. Earnhardt said he was upset only that Mayfield
made a big deal about the bump after the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like he felt guilty about it,'' Earnhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt said he had forgotten about it. There are other things
to think about now, and for that, Earnhardt is glad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to come down to team and driver,''
Earnhardt said, and he made sure to emphasize the second part. &QL;

`WIDOWS': SOME LAUGHS, BUT LEAVES AN EMPTY FEELING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By DAVID DeWITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four husband-hunting women. Three wife-seeking men.
Guess who is going to be disappointed?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dance on Widows' Row'' is a comic yarn about a group of
North Carolina neighbors who have bad luck with husbands. Their men
keep dying. The widows are glad to have the pensions, but they miss
the companionship and hate the gossip that keeps their street off
limits to the town's menfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Magnolia (Barbara Montgomery) has had enough. She invites some
bachelors _ ``I did my homework. Ain't a dog in the bunch'' _ to
join her and her fellow widows at her home for a romance-sparking
party.
</P>
<P>
   Cupid shows up. So does the Grim Reaper. That makes the lusty
widows sly suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dance on Widows' Row'' is a mild farce, and it drew plenty
of hoots and hollers at the performance I saw. But between each
hoot and holler were anxious moments spent waiting for the next
laugh. The cast seemed most anxious of all, because when they
couldn't play to the audience, they didn't have much to do.
</P>
<P>
   The production is directed by its playwright, Samm-Art Williams,
who has earned respect for plays like ``Home.'' The old-fashioned
style of ``Widows' Row'' has its place, and it's good to see comic
parts for older actors. But it's uncomfortable to watch mature
performers make leering faces and Viagra jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' production, by the New Federal Theater at the Henry
Street Settlement's Harry De Jur Playhouse doesn't offer enough
character to fill out its caricatures. Elizabeth Van Dyke offers
the broadest and least substantial performance as Annie, the
churchgoer who becomes a temptress. She and sometimes the rest of
the cast seem to flaunt the production's loud, empty feel.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Thomas and especially Jack Landron commit to the play's
comic heights, Elain Graham has moments with an entertaining bite,
and Montgomery anchors the action well when the play is allowed to
relax. But that's not often, because it is desperate to yuk it up
and hope the audience is paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Felix E. Cochren's naturalistic set, Evelyn Nelson's more
extreme costumes and Shirley Prendergast's cool lighting combine
for a mixed effect that doesn't help the production.
</P>
<P>
   At moments, the widows of this play seem destined to discover a
sort of woman-affirming unity, but those moments are unfortunately
too fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   `THE DANCE ON WIDOWS' ROW' Written and directed by Samm-Art
Williams; production stage manager, Jacqui Casto; set by Felix E.
Cochren; lighting by Shirley Prendergast; costumes by Evelyn
Nelson; sound by Sean O'Halloran; technical director, Green Turtle

TWO EXAMPLES REVEAL THE GLORY OF PURE CLASSICAL BALLET
</HEADLINE>
 By JENNIFER DUNNING  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``La Bayadere'' was created in 1877. ``Theme and
Variations'' came seven decades later. But the two works are at
heart shining examples of the great glory of pure classical ballet.
And the dancers of American Ballet Theater communicated that truth
with joyous clarity in performances at the Metropolitan Opera House
in New York on Thursday and Friday nights respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Paloma Herrera offered an interestingly double-faceted portrait
of Nikiya, the frail young temple dancer whose doomed love for the
warrior Solor forms the narrative of ``La Bayadere.'' Herrera's
pliant torso subtly suggested Indian classical dancing, each soft
twist and tilt registering love, sorrow and anger in Marius
Petipa's tale of exotic India, glowingly restaged by Natalia
Makarova.
</P>
<P>
   In the famous Kingdom of the Shades pas de deux in the second
act, Herrera became a grand ballerina. Stretched tall, she surged
authoritatively through the scene's fast turns and balances, though
her occasional snapping finishes distracted from the flow of her
dancing. The redoubtable Julio Bocca was her Solor, with Gillian
Murphy icy and powerful as the treacherous Gamzatti.
</P>
<P>
   This has been Bocca's season. The purity and infectious
excitement of his dancing promise to linger long in the memory, as
once again he stepped into a role vacated by an injured dancer,
this time Angel Corella. Special praise must go to the corps in the
second act, whose dancing rightly embodied Baudelaire's ``luxe,
calme et volupte.'' Herman Cornejo stood out for the welcome
fluency he brought to the hard-dancing Bronze Idol. David Lamarche
conducted the Minkus score, performed with enjoyable panache.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin De Luz is often cast as rapscallion characters whose
cheekiness sometimes conceals the considerable technical demands of
the choreography. De Luz got his chance at elegance in a role debut
as the lead male in ``Theme and Variations,'' George Balanchine's
glittering, sweeping reinvention of Petipa's classicism. A little
short in height for such a part, De Luz seemed to grow in stature
as he negotiated challenges like a fiendish-looking series of air
turns with ease and solemn grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Tuttle brought an unexpected but welcome warmth to her
impressively danced ballerina role. Ermanno Florio conducted the
Tchaikovsky score.

   U.S. INVESTIGATING ADVISER TO KAZAKHSTAN
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors are investigating whether an American trade
consultant funneled millions of dollars in payments from major oil
companies like Phillips Petroleum and Mobil to Kazakhstan officials
who are his clients, according to a Justice Department document.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Justice Department asked Swiss authorities for
help in investigating the financial activities of James Giffen, a
prominent consultant for trade deals in Russia and former Soviet
republics.

<P>
   After the abrupt resignation of Oracle Corp.'s president,
Raymond Lane, the day-to-day operation of the company is now in the
hands of three executives: Gary Bloom, 38, Oracle's top marketer
and executive vice president; Jeffrey Henley, 54, the chief
financial officer; and Safra Catz, 38, a former investment banker,
now an executive vice president.

   ONLINE GROCERS STILL FACE HURDLES
</P>
<P>
   The announcement last week that Webvan had agreed to pay $1.2
billion for HomeGrocer.com showed that online grocers are realizing
that there is strength through scale but that significant kinks in
the business continue to present big challenges to its long-term
viability.

   NETEASE DAMPENS SPIRITS IN CHINA
</P>
<P>
   The poor debut on Friday of the Chinese Internet company
Netease.com _ whose American depository receipts opened at $15.50
but fell to $12.125 on Nasdaq _ has sent shudders through China's
Internet entrepreneurs, who see an overseas listing as their only
hope.

<P>
   TWO MORE POINTS IN WEB PRIVACY DEBATE
</P>
<P>
   When the online privacy debate peaked earlier this year, the
watchwords were ``notice'' and ``choice.'' Consumer groups demanded
that online advertising companies give consumers more notice when
tracking their behavior and give them the choice to avoid such
tracking. But two other principles have received scant air time:
giving consumers ``access'' to data collected on them and providing
them with the ``security'' that the data is kept private.

   CNN BROADENS ONLINE PRESENCE
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by declining ratings during slow news periods, CNN's
parent company, Turner Broadcasting System, announced last week
that it would broaden the network's online presence to include
research tools and more in-depth coverage. The result would be a
wealth of information from a combination of on-air and online
sources. Turner will spend $1.2 billion the next five years to
enlarge its downtown Atlanta headquarters and build and renovate

ANALYSIS: WORLDCOM AND SPRINT LOOK FOR WAYS TO SAVE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most telecommunications experts may see the $115 billion
WorldCom-Sprint merger as having one foot in the grave, but the
companies are not yet ready to declare it dead.
</P>
<P>
   At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Some people at both WorldCom Inc. and the Sprint Corp. contend
that the deal can be salvaged, despite opposition from regulators
on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say that it is not 100 percent locked and clearly
over,'' one person close to the companies said over the weekend.
``Over the next few days it will become more clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both companies have declined to comment, while
they weigh their options. Reached over the weekend, John Sidgmore,
WorldCom's vice chairman, would say only: ``I believe the company
will be successful with or without Sprint. We have more options
than people think.''
</P>
<P>
   One impetus for keeping the merger on life support may be the
desire of Bernard Ebbers, WorldCom's 58-year-old chief executive,
to make the merger the capstone achievement of the acquisition
strategy he has used for nearly two decades to build WorldCom into
an international power. Otherwise, Ebbers would be left to
contemplate how the deal's rejection by antitrust officials in
Washington and Brussels was the result of the very modus operandi
that brought him so close to the pinnacle.
</P>
<P>
   But the merger die-hards may be unable to prevail, at least
partly because some executives at the two companies differ sharply
on just how they would handle the regulatory challenges.
</P>
<P>
   After the European Commission's top antitrust official said last
Monday he opposed the deal on grounds that it would give WorldCom
too much control of Internet traffic, the companies withdrew the
merger proposal in Europe _ though reserving the option to
re-introduce it in the future. Last Tuesday, the U.S. Justice
Department filed a suit to block the merger, saying it would place
too much of the nation's long-distance market in WorldCom's hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprint merger hold-outs are inclined to try fighting the
Justice Department in court, according to people close to the
companies. But WorldCom, contending that a court battle would take
too long to be effective no matter the outcome, is said to be
willing to accede to the Justice Department's demand _ that it sell
Sprint's long-distance and local phone operations, as well as
Sprint's Internet business. That would still give WorldCom what it
wants most: Sprint's extensive wireless network.
</P>
<P>
   But Sprint opposes such a drastic dismembering, which is why
many analysts predict that it may end up seeking a merger partner
that would keep the company largely intact. ``I think they'll be
speaking German soon,'' said Eric Strumingher, a communications
analyst at PaineWebber. He was referring to the German
communications giant Deutsche Telekom's well-known interest in
Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, WorldCom would have trouble promising regulators
that it would dismantle Sprint until it knew how much money the
various units would fetch. And under its deal with Sprint, WorldCom
is constrained from talking to outside companies about splitting
Sprint into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Ebbers have said in recent days that if the
Sprint deal had gone smoothly, he might have considered it his swan
song, the final act of a spectacular career that would have let him
leave the stage on his own terms. But besides being a
communications titan, Ebbers is also known as a combative, ornery
man _ an executive who would almost certainly not want to go out on
a busted Sprint deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, if we had closed the deal and everything had worked out
perfectly and the stock was at 90 or 100 then maybe he would
leave,'' one person close to WorldCom said over the weekend. ``But
he wouldn't want to go out without things being tied up.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one thing Ebbers has always cared about, it is his
company's stock price. After rising robustly for most of the 1990s,
WorldCom's stock has languished since last year, closing Friday at
$45.875, up $1.8125.
</P>
<P>
   So analysts and people close to the company said Ebbers was
quite likely to take a dramatic step to raise his company's share
price, whether or not the Sprint deal was saved. The most likely
move, according to people close to the company, would be a sale of
most or all of WorldCom's consumer long-distance business, second
in the nation only to AT&AMP;T's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bernie does one thing for sure, which is show Wall
Street that he's really working for the shareholder,'' said
Strumingher, the analyst. ``It's been now almost a year where his
stock has underperformed dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Before acquiring MCI in 1998, WorldCom was hardly in the
consumer business at all. And these days, the consumer
long-distance industry, with its incessant price wars, is often
less profitable than serving business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Because consumers, unlike business customers, do not sign
long-term contracts, the consumer side of the industry can also be
far more volatile. That is why many institutional money managers
are currently wary of investing in companies that have a big
presence in the consumer long-distance business _ a wariness that
has also deflated AT&AMP;T's stock.
</P>
<P>
   So by spinning off all or part of its consumer long-distance
business, WorldCom could boost its growth and, at least as
important, increase the stability and predictability of its
financial results. Of course, regulatory constraints might limit
the pool of potential buyers, since neither AT&AMP;T or any of the Bell
companies would be likely to receive approval to buy WorldCom's
consumer long-distance business even if they wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves at least two likely options for dispatching the
consumer business, according to analysts and people close to
WorldCom. The first is a complete sale of the consumer subscribers
to a financial buyer like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co., Forstmann
Little &AMP; Co., or Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst Inc. WorldCom would
become a wholesale supplier to that unit, providing the network
operation but shedding the marketing costs. One of the buyout
companies could enjoy billions of dollars in cash flow from the
unit, and as a private company it could ignore the stock market's
distaste for the consumer long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   Another, even more intriguing possibility, would be a sale of a
big stake in the consumer long-distance business to a
consumer-oriented company that could market the service more
efficiently than WorldCom does now. One person close to WorldCom
mentioned, ``people like Disney, Microsoft or AOL'' as potential
partners. The same person, who asked that he not be identified,
estimated that the chance of WorldCom's announcing some sort of
consumer long-distance spin-off in the next six months or so at
between 50 and 80 percent, no matter the fate of the Sprint deal.
</P>
<P>
   Even if such a spin-off becomes the consolation prize of an
aborted Sprint merger, Ebbers would still have to make peace with
the realization that his hard-bargain approach to the
communications industry might have finally caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason that the Justice Department has balked at the
WorldCom-Sprint deal is because Ebbers left a bad taste in
regulators' mouths the last time they approved one of his big deals
_ the acquisition of MCI two years ago. In that case, Ebbers agreed
to sell MCI's Internet business to Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC.
</P>
<P>
   But afterward, Cable &AMP; Wireless contended that WorldCom did not
transfer all of the customers and assets that their deal specified.
At least as important, in the United States, Cable &AMP; Wireless was
also left in the position of buying capacity on WorldCom's
fiber-optic network to connect the MCI Internet switches. That made
it very difficult for Cable &AMP; Wireless to make money on the MCI
Internet operation.
</P>
<P>
   For WorldCom, driving a bargain so hard that it almost looked
unfair was just business as usual. It was the style that had made
WorldCom and it was why investors have generally loved Ebbers.
</P>
<P>
   But the regulators were not favorably impressed. And so Ebbers
had no good will waiting for him when his lawyers went back to the
same regulatory agencies last fall seeking approval for the Sprint
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's live by the sword, die by the sword,'' Strumingher said.
``WorldCom has a take-no-prisoners approach, which has rewarded
shareholders handsomely over the years. But that approach is not
without risks.''

chain that Los Angeles magazine says is worn by  &UR; Jenna Elfman &LR; ,
 &UR; Lauren Holly &LR;  and  &UR; Courtney Love &LR; , said his epiphany came one day
when he was stuck in traffic. ``Here I was in DKNY this and Prada

E-COMMERCE: PRINCIPLES OF CONSUMER PRIVACY ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the online privacy debate reached its peak earlier this
year, the watchwords were ``notice'' and ``choice.'' Consumer
groups demanded that online advertising companies like DoubleClick
give consumers more notice when tracking their behavior, and give
them the choice to avoid such tracking.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two other core privacy principles: giving
consumers ``access'' to data collected on them and providing them
with the ``security'' that the data is kept private.
</P>
<P>
   The first two terms continue to be volleyed back-and-forth by
legislators scoring points in this year's campaign, but the latter
two have received scant air time.
</P>
<P>
   That may change, as companies have begun heeding the call of
privacy advocates to increase access to profiling data.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is, the techniques of the companies that offer
solutions on data access may actually run afoul of some privacy
groups. The resulting conflict could shift the debate to a new
front and make strange bedfellows of privacy advocates and the
advertising networks and other companies that have until now been
their prime targets.
</P>
<P>
   Access has been a sleeper issue primarily because it is so
complex. It seems obvious that consumers should be able to check
the files that others keep on them and to change anything that is
wrong. But articulating the boundaries of such a policy is no easy
task.
</P>
<P>
   Should businesses give consumers access to transactions made
years ago, data that the company has on a computer tape sitting in
the back of a storage closet? Should they be forced to spend
millions of dollars updating their computer systems so consumers
can see and change that information? And what right do consumers
have to data that is collected not about them, per se, but on the
computers they share with others at work or at home?
</P>
<P>
   These questions have led advertising networks like DoubleClick
and Engage, among others, which gather information on users
anonymously, to hold off on giving users access to data.
</P>
<P>
   Still, recent steps within the industry suggest that some
companies are heeding the call for access.
</P>
<P>
   One such company is BeFree, which, among other things,
distributes software that helps online businesses tailor their
content to the user's interest. This so-called personalization
software has become increasingly common among e-commerce companies
this year, as they vie to improve their profit margins by showing
customers merchandise they are more likely to buy.
</P>
<P>
   This software also raises privacy issues, as it relies on
tracking a user's behavior on a site, or a group of sites, to
determine a consumer's buying preferences. As with other companies
that track user activities, BeFree inserts a ``cookie,'' or a
number within a small text file, on the user's hard drive, to track
activity.
</P>
<P>
   BeFree says it requires the sites that use the software to
inform customers how it works, and give them a way to opt out of
the tracking. The company also goes one step further, by giving
users access to the information gathered on them.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on SuperGo.com, a bicycle store, users can click
on a link within the site's privacy statement and go to another
site set up by BeFree, which then discloses information compiled
about the user's behavior on SuperGo. Later this year, when BeFree
tracks user activity across multiple sites, it will disclose the
user's information from all the sites on one page.
</P>
<P>
   To authenticate the identity of the user who asks for his online
dossier, BeFree checks the user's cookie number, then retrieves
only the browsing and purchasing information associated with that
cookie.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, BeFree does not have full control over how that
information is displayed. At the moment, for example, SuperGo
customers can view only the stock numbers of the products they
looked at or purchased. Steven Laff, who designed the SuperGo site,
said the company would translate those numbers to text soon.
</P>
<P>
   Laff said that giving consumers access to data gathered on them
was a common sense approach. ``It's a nice, respectful thing to
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Executives of other companies facing the same access questions
said the BeFree approach was flawed. Daniel J. Jaye, co-founder of
Engage, an online advertising company that tracks consumers
anonymously, said BeFree ``may be well-intentioned, but it could
lead to a security breach.'' Jaye said the technique jeopardized
users' privacy, because it could disclose their information to
someone else who uses the same computer.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a person visited the SuperGo site while at work,
an employer or a co-worker could sit at the same computer and see
that a person used it to shop for bikes, or easily view that
person's BeFree profile.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Shen, policy analyst for the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, and a critic of companies like Engage that
track online users, said: ``I actually agree with Dan on this one.
You don't want that information to end up in the wrong hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas A. Gerace, BeFree's co-founder, said he considered that
argument when developing the software, but added that when two or
more people used the same computer, Web browser software allowed
users to control their information by erasing cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The user just has to be conscious about how they're using the
machine,'' Gerace said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the access issue is less problematic when companies
gather information, usually offline, that includes a person's
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike companies that only track users online anonymously _ and
therefore have no way to ensure that they are disclosing profile
information to the right person _ companies that track personally
identifiable information have alternatives. Because these
businesses usually have an address to go along with a name, they
can simply send a letter with the information requested, or send a
log-in and password so the consumer can view the information
online.
</P>
<P>
   Axciom Corp., which sells information on tens of millions of
U.S. households, allows users to get access to their information by
sending a letter and $5 to the company. More important, Axciom
released technology last year that allows companies with vast
amounts of consumer data to sift through it quickly and present it
for review or editing by consumers or a sales staff.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, dubbed AbiliTec, solves one aspect of the access
issue for companies that collect data on consumers from several
sources _ for instance, through mail order operations, retail
stores or the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Such companies often contend that it would be too burdensome to
offer consumers access to personal data, because it would be
technologically impossible to compile that data in one place
quickly and efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   AbiliTec and competing products may make it easier for companies
to do that, but such technology is not inexpensive. One Axciom
executive said it could cost a large retailer that sells through a
traditional store, a catalog and the Web more than a million
dollars to implement.
</P>
<P>
   Other solutions to the access problem are coming to market, as
well. ECustomers.com, for instance, has developed technology that
will soon allow e-tailers to use data about a person's offline
shopping habits to tailor their display of merchandise for
consumers who sign up for the ECustomers service. Like BeFree,
ECustomers plans to allow consumers to have access to the data it
compiles on them, by mailing a log-in number and password. If the
consumer's address matches the one ECustomers has on file, the
consumer's identity is all but assured.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for companies that continue to collect data
anonymously to preserve users' privacy _ but that do not want to
follow BeFree's example _ there are few, if any, technological
solutions to the access problem. ``We very much support the notion
of access,'' said Jaye of Engage, which places ads on Web sites
based on a user's online activity. ``But we can't do it securely.
It's kind of a devil-if-you-do, devil-if-you-don't situation.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So how did you spend the summer after seventh
grade?
</P>
<P>
   Mowing lawns? Rereading ``Born Free'' at summer school? Andrei
Cherny had grander plans for his vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1988, and he had recently read Theodore H. White's
``The Making of the President, 1960.'' No comic books for this
pre-teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by that portrait of John F. Kennedy, Cherny volunteered
to work on the Los Angeles campaign of another Massachusetts-bred,
Harvard-trained candidate for president, Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   A skeptical campaign official asked what he would like to work
on. ``Foreign policy,'' 12-year-old Andrei confidently replied. The
official offered a vacuum cleaner instead. By fall, he had
graduated from doing floors to stuffing envelopes and answering
phones.
</P>
<P>
   But from that modest beginning came more precocious things. By
his senior year at Harvard, Cherny was writing speeches for
President Clinton. A week after graduation, he became a senior
speech writer for Vice President Al Gore. At 23, he edited a
big-thought magazine for the Democratic Leadership Council, the
party's leading centrist organization. And at 24, he wrote a book
describing the politics of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a month from reaching the ripe old age of 25, Cherny is
writing the Democratic platform, a 20,000-word spiritual guide to
the party's political soul that dedicated Democrats will fuss and
bicker over all summer, whether or not voters pay any attention to
it in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of people who really do look at the
platform,'' Cherny said. ``Perhaps especially in this day and age,
it's an important way of saying: here's what the Democratic Party
stands for, here's what we've done and what we're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As platform director, Cherny joins the ranks of other platform
writers with silky prose and grand ideas who later became leading
policy makers within the party. In 1984, it was Susan Estrich, who
managed the 1988 Dukakis campaign. In 1992, it was Bruce Reed, now
a top domestic policy adviser to Clinton. And in 1996, it was Reed
and Elaine Kamarck, who is now policy director for the Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As any of those people could tell you, platform writing is its
own special art form. The prose must be pithy, elegant and
inspiring. And the wording must deftly skip across the ideological
minefields that have surrounded Democratic and Republican platforms
of the past.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when Sen. Edward M. &UR;  &LR; Kennedy challenged President
Jimmy Carter in 1980, a combative Kennedy team _ which included the
mayor of Cincinnati, Jerry Springer _ produced 25 minority reports
on the platform. Things got so testy that a Kennedy adviser named
Paul Tully nearly came to blows with a Carter delegate named Mario
Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   This year, after former Sen. Bill Bradley yielded early in the
primaries, the struggle within the party is much quieter. To be
sure, gay rights activists, environmentalists and union leaders are
laboring behind the scenes to insert pet phrases into Cherny's
draft. But the process, he insists, has been remarkably consensual
and free of acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly trade is one place where there's been some debate,''
he said. ``But it's not like you have these groups at each other's
throats. You have the single goal of winning in November.''
</P>
<P>
   A gentle platform process would befit Cherny's unassuming style.
Lanky and soft-spoken, he fills his spare time, what little there
is, with history books, films and, he confesses, ``junk TV'' shows
like ``Ally McBeal'' and ``Friends.'' In his cluttered office at
the Democratic National Committee, a photograph of his favorite
scholar-writer-politician, Winston Churchill, sternly stares down
from the white wall.
</P>
<P>
   The older of two sons born to immigrants from Czechoslovakia,
Cherny was raised in the Valley Village section of Los Angeles, a
heavily minority, working-class community. His father, a school
teacher, and his mother, a psychotherapist, are proud of his
achievements, he says, but not overly awed by the company he keeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still expect me to pick up my socks and wash the dishes
when I'm home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cherny first caught the eye of Democratic heavyweights during
his senior year at Harvard, when Donald Baer, then the White House
communications director, read an article he had written for the
student newspaper, The Crimson, analyzing President Clinton's
landslide victory of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Baer showed the article to the president, who liked it so much
he made it required reading for his cabinet and cribbed a sentence
from it for his second inaugural address. ``We need a new
government for a new century, a government humble enough not to try
to solve all our problems for us but strong enough to give us the
tools to solve our problems for ourselves,'' the line went.
</P>
<P>
   Baer commissioned Cherny to write speeches for Clinton during
Cherny's final semester at Harvard. After graduation, Cherny moved
to Washington to write for Gore, an author and former reporter whom
Cherny found to be a perfectionist about language.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would bring him drafts, he'd sit down and change every
word, and then some,'' Cherny said. ``In the end, they were his
speeches.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Cherny returned to California where he managed to
work as a part-time policy adviser to the speaker of the state
Assembly while attending Boalt Hall, the law school at Berkeley,
and writing a book. The book, ``The Next Deal,'' will be published
by Basic Books this winter.
</P>
<P>
   And what if there is a Gore administration? Cherny says he wants
to return to California, finish law school and become a criminal
prosecutor. ``When the convention approves the platform, my job is
done,'' he said. But the hesitation in his voice suggested that he
senses this will not be his last job in Washington.

 &HT;    Most women content to leave those skimpy tennis dresses to
Wimbledon stars
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Luv 'em, or hate 'em, those clingy little dresses that
some of the top young stars of women's tennis are wearing at
Wimbledon probably won't be overwhelming a court near you, though
you may see one here or there.
</P>
<P>
   Those who closely follow the game, and monitor the on-court
fashions of the Williams sisters (Venus and Serena) and Anna
Kournikova, say most women wouldn't dare wear the equivalent of an
oversized tank top during a match. And the supply of such outfits
isn't that great anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't as many of those dresses available as there are
(skirt and top) separates,'' said Howard Matthews, owner of the
Tennis Menace shop in Duluth, Ga. ``We do carry some things that
would look nice on a perfect body, but there aren't too many women
like that around. Most people who play recreationally have a little
extra weight here or an unwanted bulge there, and they want to
cover it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova and the Williamses have been wearing revealing tennis
dresses emblazoned with the logos of Adidas, Puma or Nike at
Wimbledon, which runs through Sunday. But, as Matthews maintains,
``Those are sneaker companies that mainly make those clothes for
the players for the exposure it'll bring to their brands. Most
stores don't carry much of it, or any at all, because (sneaker
makers) don't have extensive collections or wide enough
distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince, a major manufacturer of tennis equipment and apparel,
offers only two dress styles out of about 50 outfits for women in
its latest catalog. ``From what I gather, we're pretty much where
the industry is,'' said Sandy Connelly, production manager for
Prince Apparel. ``The market isn't asking for a whole lot more
dresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Buying separates, Connelly added, ``gives you more wardrobe
flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Dukes Wilburn of Lithonia, Ga., a 10-year veteran of ALTA
(Atlanta Ladies Tennis Association) league play, said she had to
search long and hard to find a dress similar to one she saw Venus
Williams wearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see how I'd look in it,'' said the 33-year-old
investment manager, who eventually found two among a small
selection at Phipps Plaza's Nike Town. ``I was concerned that they
would be tacky because they're so tight. But they actually fit
pretty well, because of the way the undergarments are sewn into the
dresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Has dressing like the Williams sisters improved her game any?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could say it has,'' Wilburn sighed. ``But at least I
look good.''

 &HT;    Somewhere over the rainbow there's dark side of the moon
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no place like home.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Dorothy Gale,
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Home, home again/
</P>
<P>
   I like to be here when I can.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Roger Waters,
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dark Side of the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how or when the legend began, the one that goes
like this: If you play Pink Floyd's ``Dark Side of the Moon'' while
watching ``The Wizard of Oz,'' the music and the movie appear to be
in sync, at times startlingly so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Side's'' songs change with the movie's scenes, offering
emotional underscoring and sometimes even specific connections.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of quick examples:
</P>
<P>
   When Dorothy's house is being spun by the tornado, the CD plays
the celestial scatting of ``The Great Gig in the Sky,'' which
sounds like it was written for the scene. As soon as Dorothy opens
the door to Oz and the film dramatically switches from black and
white to color, the CD switches at precisely that moment from
``Gig'' to ``Money.''
</P>
<P>
   The lyric ``black and blue'' (on the song ``Us and Them'') is
sung just as the camera pans between the Wicked Witch of the West
(in black) and Dorothy (in blue). Then the line ``And who knows
which is which?'' corresponds to a cut between the Wicked Witch and
Glinda the Good Witch.
</P>
<P>
   And folks who have spent vast amounts of time poring over these
coincidences list dozens of them, including the obvious connection
that ``Dark Side'' has a rainbow on its cover.
</P>
<P>
   To help people further explore the synchronicity (or maybe just
to offer up a really cool marketing gimmick), Turner Classic Movies
will air ``The Wizard of Oz'' at 11 tonight with ``Dark Side'' on
the SAP (Second Audio Program) feed. The cable channel also will
air ``Oz'' at 8 tonight (without ``Dark Side''), the first time
it's been on TV without commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything to this or is it all just the ravings of
addled adolescents staying up too late while ingesting too many
chemicals and frequently saying, ``Whoa, dude?''
</P>
<P>
   I cued ``Dark Side'' to ``Wizard'' (you have to start the CD
precisely on the third roar of the MGM lion) and there really are a
handful of times when the music and the film work together
magically, as if the movie (on mute) is a silent classic and ``Dark
Side'' is the score.
</P>
<P>
   But there are long passages where the music has nothing to do
with the film and the whole thing seems to be an exercise in the
power of suggestion more than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   That's also the conclusion of The Straight Dope, the reliably
skeptical newspaper column and website, which studied the
``synchronicity'' in May and concluded: ``This really isn't all
that different from receiving a psychic reading or looking at your
horoscope. You see the things that match and ignore those that
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to the ``Whoa, dude'' contingent, though, which is
convinced that Roger Waters, Floyd's lyricist and the guiding light
of ``Dark Side,'' arranged the whole thing as some sort of cosmic
in-joke. Waters reportedly has refused to comment on the hubbub,
but Alan Parsons, the album's producer who had a major hand in
arranging its complex sound effects (and, thus, its timing), has
denied any deliberate connection.
</P>
<P>
   As an underground legend, the Floyd/Oz link has spread and grown
since roughly the mid '90s, meaning it's lasted much longer than
the pop-cultural myth it most resembles, the ``Paul is Dead''
mania, circa 1969. That one came up fast and furious, then
sputtered. The Internet, which has been a major tool in spreading
the Floyd/Oz word, doesn't just move these things faster; it can
give them longer life. What it can't give them is truth.
</P>
<P>
   HOW DOES IT WORK?
</P>
<P>
   The Second Audio Program (SAP) is available on many newer TV
sets that are hooked to cable or satellite. You can access it
through your remote control, usually by pressing an audio or menu
button and following the prompts. The procedure may not be
available on some remotes.
</P>
<P>
   Media One will carry the SAP signal for Turner Classic Movie's
special airing of ``The Wizard of Oz'' as will DIRECTV (satellite).
</P>
<P>
   If you can't get the SAP, cue ``The Dark Side of the Moon'' in
your CD player and hit pause before it begins. When the MGM logo
comes on at the start of ``Oz,'' wait for the third roar of Leo the
Lion. On the third roar, hit play to start the CD.

`IN GOD WE TRUST' MOTTO IN COLORADO SCHOOLS RAISES CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Close on the heels of the Supreme Court's latest ruling
against officially sponsored prayer at public schools, the Colorado
state Board of Education is expected to pass a resolution Thursday
that encourages public schools to display the national motto ``In
God we trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure would be nonbinding, and its leading proponent, the
board chairman, said it highlighted ``civic virtue.'' But the
effort has drawn criticism as yet another attempt to bring religion
into the classroom in Colorado, even though courts have ruled that
the motto's appearance on U.S. currency does not violate the
establishment clause of the First Amendment, which defines the
constitutional principle of separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, state lawmakers considered a measure that
would have required the posting of the Ten Commandments in all
public school classrooms and the observation of a moment of silence
at the start of each school day. The measure was withdrawn when it
became clear that it would not pass, even after it was amended to
remove all references to God and the commandments and to recommend
only a moment of silence.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the state measure failed, local religious leaders
took up the cause, organizing a rally in support of the effort. The
bill's sponsor, state Sen. John Andrews, R-Englewood, said he might
introduce another Ten Commandments measure next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time `God' is involved in something, it's always tied to
religion,'' said Clair Orr of Kersey, Colo., the education board's
chairman and the sponsor of the measure. ``It has gotten so out of
balance in that perspective that the establishment clause has
sterilized the public domain for anything that has to do with
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Three states _ South Dakota, Indiana and Kentucky _ have passed
laws this year allowing schools to post the Ten Commandments in
larger displays that include other historical or religious
documents. And in Alabama last month, Roy S. Moore, a judge who won
fame for defending the display of the Ten Commandments in his
courtroom, won the Republican primary for chief justice of the
state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere has the public display of the commandments or the
motto been promoted more passionately than in Colorado, where many
state officials say the mass killings at Columbine High School 15
months ago symbolized the moral breakdown of American society.
While no one has argued that the two teen-age gunmen would have
been deterred by the posting of the Ten Commandments in a Columbine
hallway, many people contend that by displaying the commandments
and words like ``In God we trust,'' schools would have a chance to
reinforce precepts of moral rectitude. The issue has nothing to do
with religion, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbine has certainly caused us to take a closer look at the
relationship between values and culture and our society,'' said
Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican who supports posting the Ten
Commandments in public schools if it is voluntary. Rebutting those
who say such displays draw religion into the classroom, he said the
displays reflected simple Judeo-Christian values that have been
embraced by Americans since the country was founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we run the risk of moving so far away from the
values that helped make this country great,'' Owens said. ``The
neutrality issue of God should not be required.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet opponents of posting the Ten Commandments and the national
motto in classrooms argue that those who assert the words are
nonreligious are naive or disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Gully Stanford of Denver, the only Democrat on the seven-member
state education board and an opponent of Orr's resolution, said the
use of the words ``In God we trust'' in the schools ``potentially
alienates'' followers of other religions, like Hindus, Muslims and
Buddhists, as well as atheists and agnostics. ``To promote one
religion while ignoring others with a marquee slogan trivializes
the issue to the point it becomes offensive,'' Stanford said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he thought schools had a responsibility to teach
the role of religion and moral behavior in history and civics
classes. ``But to do it this way, by issuing a proclamation,'' he
said, ``is not the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The words ``In God we trust'' first appeared on American
currency when they were put on the 2-cent piece in 1864 after the
treasury secretary, Salmon P. Chase, received a letter from a
Pennsylvania clergyman asking that ``the Almighty God'' be
recognized in some way on U.S. coins. Chase took the request to
Congress, which passed legislation that President Abraham Lincoln
signed.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 100 years later, on July 30, 1956, another law confirmed
``In God we trust'' as ``the national motto'' _ even though
Congress also recognized the Latin phrase ``E pluribus unum'' (out
of many, one), which also appears on U.S. currency, as a national
motto.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four decades, three federal appeals courts have
found that the use of ``In God we trust'' on currency does not
violate the establishment clause. But seeking to remove the motto
in an appeal of the most recent case to the Supreme Court, Robert
R. Tiernan, a Denver lawyer, said that one of the appeals courts
erred in 1996 by interpreting the motto as ``ceremonial deism''
that does not convey governmental endorsement of religion.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for the
Separation of Church and State, a nonprofit organization, said the
proposal was clearly an effort to inject religion into public
schools and would not survive a constitutional challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is different from the challenge about coins,'' said Lynn,
who is both a lawyer and a minister in the United Church of Christ.
``In those cases, the courts ruled that because money is so
commonly used, the motto has lost any religious significance.
Posting `In God we trust' in public schools gives it a different
and new use for the promotion of religious ideas. To me, that new
use spells `unconstitutional.'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government is preparing to announce that the gray
wolf _ which was once nearly shot, trapped and poisoned out of
existence in the lower 48 states _ is abundant enough in a few
places that it no longer uniformly needs the strict protection
afforded the country's most endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Wildlife Service plans this month to propose
dropping the wolf a significant notch under the Endangered Species
Act, from endangered to threatened, in all but a small part of its
range.
</P>
<P>
   The change would mean that, in most areas, wolves that kill
livestock or otherwise pose a threat to human affairs could be
chased away or shot by government agents.
</P>
<P>
   It also represents the first step toward eventually turning over
management of the species, Canis lupus, in many places to state
wildlife agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Just about anything having to do with the wolf, which has been
both reviled and revered through much of human history, generates
fierce debate, and the proposed change in its status is no
different.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservation groups say the forthcoming plan would relax
protections too soon and would declare victory before wolves have
recolonized broad parts of their old range. Many ranchers and
conservative private groups, though, say the laws shielding wolves
wrongly limit property owners' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife officials acknowledge that, in part, the proposed
change _ by allowing shooting of livestock raiders _ is intended to
assuage opponents of wolf restoration, including ranchers and their
allies in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But they argue that the relaxation of rules would be a net
benefit for the species by diminishing the tendency of frustrated
property owners to resort to illegal, uncontrolled killing of
wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, the federal scientists said, the proposed
change signals their confidence that the comeback of the wolf,
although limited to less than 5 percent of its former range in this
country, constitutes an important ecological success story _ like
that of the American alligator, peregrine falcon and bald eagle
before it.
</P>
<P>
   They say that the lower 48 states had only about 400 wolves in
1973, when the Endangered Species Act was passed _ almost all of
them in Minnesota or Michigan. Now more than 3,500 animals roam
parts of eight states. Thousands more live in Alaska, Canada and
parts of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of the next decade, will not be how to save the
wolf, but rather how best to manage the animal,'' according to a
recent status report written by Dr. L. David Mech, a biologist for
the U.S. Geological Survey and a leading wolf expert.
</P>
<P>
   From coast to coast, conservation and property rights groups,
ranchers and wildlife watchers still heatedly debate the possible
reintroduction of a predator that is a first cousin of man's best
friend but also is an age-old antagonist.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, New Hampshire's Legislature approved a bill banning
the reintroduction of wolves. Oregon's congressional delegation has
repeatedly introduced language that would limit wolf protections or
bar even the natural migration of wolves from adjacent states.
</P>
<P>
   Two wolves wandered into Oregon in the last year from
experimental packs transplanted into central Idaho. One was
captured and sent home by federal officials and the other was
killed by a car. Environmental groups hailed the dispersing wolves
as pioneers returning the call of the wild to the state after a
50-year absence. Ranching groups said the state was well rid of
them and did not need them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have excessive numbers of cougars, coyotes and bears that
take a heavy toll on the other wildlife and livestock and we simply
cannot add another predator,'' said Sharon Beck, a past president
of the Oregon Cattlemen's Association.
</P>
<P>
   But in some places, there are signs that wolves are becoming an
accepted feature of the landscape outside of parks and preserves,
and conflicts are shifting from whether they should be there to how
they should be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   Some Montana ranchers have figured out high-tech ways of driving
them away instead of resorting to high-powered rifles and a
strategy popularly known as ``shoot, shovel and shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   On his 4,000-acre ranch in Montana's Bitterroot Valley, Tom
Ruffatto recently installed loud alarms that are triggered by the
radio tracking collars used to monitor most of the area's wolf
packs.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffatto's project was partly paid for by Defenders of Wildlife,
a private group that also writes checks to cover livestock losses
from wolf attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota and parts of Wisconsin and Michigan, wolves are so
abundant _ some have dens just 50 miles from Minneapolis _ that
they could theoretically be removed entirely from the endangered
list. The only impediment lies in Minnesota, which has yet to
follow the other two states and create its own wolf management
program _ a prerequisite if federal protection is to be ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what is done in Minnesota, there's no way of
threatening the wolf there anymore,'' said Mech (pronounced MEECH).
``I can't conceive of anything, excluding poison, that would
endanger this population.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agency's classification scheme, the only place wolves
would remain endangered would be portions of southern Arizona, New
Mexico and Texas, where efforts to bolster a particularly rare
subspecies have faltered, wildlife officials say.
</P>
<P>
   As drafts of the new wolf classification proposal have
circulated, private conservation groups, scientists, ranchers and
others with an interest in the animal have begun lobbying for
changes and girding for hearings and _ inevitably _ lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Once it is formally released, the proposed classification change
will be the subject of four months of public comment _ twice the
required length _ and eight months of internal discussions and
possible changes before it becomes a rule.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The tug of war now is between those who want wolves restored to
broader parts of their range, including the southern Rockies and
the Northeast, and those who say that the existing numbers are
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   The Endangered Species Act includes much flexibility on this
point, containing no clear guidance on how much of a species'
original range needs to be restored before it is declared saved.
</P>
<P>
   A recent draft of the proposal was provided to a reporter by
someone outside the Fish and Wildlife Service. Officials at the
agency said that almost all of the draft's major points would be
reflected in the final version.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, wolf habitat in the lower 48 states would be
divided into four regions, with separate recovery plans for each.
</P>
<P>
   The western Great Lakes region would encompass Minnesota,
Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota and South Dakota. The western
region would be Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah,
Colorado and parts of northern New Mexico and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The southwestern region, the only one where wolves would remain
endangered, would include some parts of New Mexico, Arizona and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The northeastern region would be New York, New Hampshire,
Vermont and Maine. Wolves have not been seen in the Adirondacks in
100 years and only two possible sightings have been made in Maine,
which is considered the likeliest spot for any future
reintroduction effort.
</P>
<P>
   But federal wildlife officials said they were not even sure what
kind of wolves inhabited the Northeast, with some genetic studies
suggesting that they were red wolves, a different species
altogether. In part because of those questions, no recovery effort
is likely in the Northeast for many years, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of the contiguous states, the proposal says, wolves
are never likely to be seen again, and thus in these areas _ 30
states in all _ the animals will be dropped from the list entirely,
leaving any future decisions about restoration up to state
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the impending plan is particularly acute in
Colorado, where private wildlife groups have banded together into a
coalition aimed at trying to replicate in the southern Rockies the
successes with wolf introduction in Yellowstone National Park and
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Arapkiles, a regional representative for the Sierra Club in
Boulder, Colo., said the Fish and Wildlife Service was trying to
wrap things up before the job was done. ``Their own studies said
that over 1,000 wolves could exist in 11 of the national forests in
Colorado alone,'' Arapkiles said.
</P>
<P>
   Private land owners, including Ted Turner, the media tycoon,
have offered expansive tracts of land, rich in elk and other prey,
that could serve as wolf habitat, she added. ``To ignore that kind
of potential is foolhardy,'' Arapkiles said.
</P>
<P>
   But federal wildlife officials are standing by their
conclusions, saying that the federal list of endangered species is
the ecological equivalent of a hospital's intensive care unit, and
that wolves are clearly ready for the recovery room.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Refsnider, a wolf biologist for the wildlife agency based in
Minnesota and the main author of the classification proposal, said
there was still plenty of work to do to nurture the wolves living
in the northern Rockies and especially in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``At best, those wolves have a tiny toehold on the landscape,''
Refsnider said, referring to areas along the Mexican border that
could support the Mexican subspecies. Right now, he said, fewer
than two dozen wolves roam there.
</P>
<P>
   Any significant new federal programs to expand the range of
wolves, he said, would come at the expense of other species that
might be just as important ecologically, but that do not have the
mystique and high profile of a legendary predator.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no intention that the act should be providing
long-term care for these species,'' Refsnider said. ``The intent is
to pull them back from the brink for the foreseeable future and
turn them over to normal management agencies. And that's what we're
proposing.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Armed with a spade, a $10 pine sapling and a
videocamera, Marvin Stabler of Richboro, Pa., descended a terraced
dirt path Sunday to take part in an age-old ritual for Jewish
tourists: planting a tree in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Sweating in the noon sun, Stabler hacked at the rocky soil of
his chosen patch of Holy Land, wondering aloud if there was not
``someone you could pay to do it for you.'' His family, who came
here for his daughter Gabrielle's bat mitzvah, urged him to do his
imitation of his grandfather while he dug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oy vay! Oy gevalt!'' he said, using a thick Yiddish accent, to
the great amusement of two boys from Alabama who wore ``Super Jew''
T-shirts. ``This has got to be a first _ me digging!''
</P>
<P>
   Though no agronomist, Stabler could look around him and tell
that this hillside in Jerusalem was not the most fertile ground. So
it came as no shock to him to learn that most of the saplings
planted by his family would not survive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is a fact not advertised by the sponsoring agency, the
Jewish National Fund. In fact, six of every 10 trees planted at the
hilly, arid, unirrigated site here die, a fund spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week an Israeli tabloid created a commotion when it ran an
investigative article, ``The Great Tree Fraud,'' suggesting that
workers cynically uproot the saplings planted by tourists to make
way for the next day's busloads.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, Maariv, printed three photographs taken from the
same vantage point on two consecutive days in late June. One showed
tourists busy at work surrounded by dozens of freshly planted
trees, the second showed the same site nude but pockmarked,
supposedly on the next morning, and the third revealed a nearby
pile of uprooted saplings.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis said life was imitating art. The tree-planting
ritual, a deeply rooted phenomenon in the culture of the Jewish
diaspora, has long been the subject of satirists. A well-known
Israeli film, ``Salah Shabati,'' features a scene in which the
dedication plaque at the entrance to a forest is changed when one
group of American Jewish benefactors leaves and another arrives to
see ``their'' trees.
</P>
<P>
   But Jewish National Fund officials were not amused. Late last
week, the fund suspended several workers, and Sunday it established
a public investigation committee headed by a former judge.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they would be horrified to learn that the charges
were true, but that if they were, they would represent an isolated
case of malfeasance. In a statement prepared by a public relations
firm in New York, the fund defended its good intentions and
declared that it would file a libel suit against Maariv for
maligning the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1901 in Switzerland to purchase land in
Palestine, the Jewish National Fund is the second-largest landowner
in Israel, after the government. Its tree-planting program long
epitomized the Zionist enterprise in its ambition to make the
desert bloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``JNF views its afforestation program as its crowning
achievement and respects each and every planter,'' the statement
from the fund said. ``Many tourists who years earlier had planted
saplings have returned to visit the section where they planted
their trees. These tourists have expressed to us in moving letters,
which we preserve and treasure, their excitement in seeing the
saplings that have grown into mature trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fund's spokeswoman here, Orly Doron, acknowledges
that many saplings planted at the Jerusalem site are routinely
removed by workers because they do not survive. That does not take
away from the program's track record, she said: Eighty thousand
trees are successfully planted by tourists every year, out of 2.5
million planted by the Jewish National Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not a point that the fund's literature or
representatives make clear to the tourists who pay $10 to honor or
memorialize a relative with a tree in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that the experience itself means so
much to people, and that their contribution helps support the
enterprise _ $50 million worth of plantation a year,'' said Doron.
``If Orly Doron pays $10 to plant a tree, and then it dies, and a
worker takes it out and plants a new one, that is not the important
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by Sunday's crowd at the planting site near Hadassah-Ein
Kerem Hospital, that is indeed the tourists' sentiment. All the
same, they said they found it a little silly that the reality was
not made clearer to them.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Swerdlin from Atlanta spent a substantial chunk of time
not only planting her sapling but landscaping it with the bounteous
rocks in the area. It was clear that she had bonded with the flimsy
little tree. And like many thousands of tourists before her, she
chose to believe that it would grow to be a mighty pine, her
personal, hands-on contribution to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Her 18-year-old son, Ryan, said, ``If 40 percent are going to
survive, that's all right for us.'' Still, he looked disappointed
to learn the Jewish National Fund's statistics.
</P>
<P>
   At other planting sites, outside Jerusalem, in better soil, the
survival rate is much higher _ close to 95 percent. But the the
convenient Hadassah-Ein Kerem site is the most popular.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Arnold M. Goodman, the leader of their congregation in
Georgia, called over a worker with a green garden hose to bless the
Swerdlins' tree with water. Without knowing anything about the
Maariv article, Goodman said, ``Chances are, they pull them out and
plant them again when the next group shows up.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he winced. ``Oh, don't write that down,'' he said.
``They'll take away my rabbinical credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Write that even if they do pull them out, the
JNF will prosper. And it's a great activity. The average youngster
who comes here has very little experience with dirt. It gives them
a sense of what the pioneers did.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the fund has been battling criticism that goes much
deeper than that published in Maariv, part of which suggests that
Israel might be better off if the pine saplings did not take root.
</P>
<P>
   In a petition to the High Court, the Union for Environmental
Defense has challenged the Jewish National Fund's method of
operations, contending that the organization is subject to only
minimal governmental and public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The group has also criticized the fund's forestry practices,
from its supposed overreliance on highly flammable pine trees to
accusations that it overuses toxic herbicides and that it has used
controlled burning to eliminate unwanted brush.
</P>
<P>
   Doron, the spokeswoman, dismisses such criticism by attacking
the environmentalists. ``They are very radical,'' she said. ``This
is a group that says everything that is not natural is wrong. For
example, foresting is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Philip Warburg, the environmental group's deputy
director, said, ``The JNF should get out of the business of
maligning others and look inward in a constructive manner at
forestry practices that have gone unquestioned for too long.''

 &HT;    CARTER SAYS MEXICO 'TRYING TO DO IT RIGHT'
 &HT;    With MEXICO-ELECTION.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Jimmy Carter remembers fighting fraud back in
Georgia in the 1960s, when one rival in a state election controlled
all the welfare checks in town and pulled ballots out of boxes at
his pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   It was with this background that Carter came to Mexico to watch
this country's historic presidential election Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Mexico,'' said surprised voters who recognized the
former U.S. president as he strode into the Museum of the School of
Medicine, a handsome stone colonial building in downtown Mexico
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was where the Spanish inquisition took place,'' Carter
said, gazing around the inner patio where a polling station was set
up.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Carter was witnessing a more progressive step in
Mexico's history.
</P>
<P>
   He and others from the Atlanta-based Carter Center observed what
is supposed to the cleanest and most competitive presidential
election ever in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The former president was invited by all of Mexico's major
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think they're trying to do it right,'' Carter said.
He praised the technical aspects of Mexico's new balloting system
and officials he met at the Federal Elections Institute, an
independent agency supervising the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Many here believe this could be an election too close to call.
Preliminary returns that could give even a hint of the winner are
not expected before early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which
has controlled this country's presidency for 71 years, is facing a
tough challenge from center-right candidate Vicente Fox. And the
PRI, as a Carter report on the elections noted, has been criticized
by opponents for coercing poor people and government workers to
vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any doubt there's been widespread
attempts by the PRI to use its incumbency,'' he said. ``But I know
incumbency can cut both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   A party that has long held power, he said, is vulnerable if
voters are dissatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, assessing the fairness of the vote, said that if voters
truly believe they can vote in secret, they turn to their
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   At the Museum of the School of Medicine, he noted the curtained
white booths where voters marked ballots only after checking in
with officials who compared their photo ID cards against
registration lists with copies of photos and names.
</P>
<P>
   Signs on the booths read, ``Your vote is free and secret.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how many favors they've been promised or how many
threats they've received, we hope the voters should know their vote
is secret,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Holding up thumbs smudged with indelible ink, voter Jose Luis
Jimenez rushed up to greet Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to have him here,'' the high school teacher
said. He said he voted for the PRI's Francisco Labastida because
its candidate has experience.
</P>
<P>
   After Carter left, voter Antonio Arreguin, 49, said, ``The
former president? I wished I had seen him.'' He said he voted for
Fox ``because Mexico really needs a change.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something strange has happened to the 10 p.m. newscast on
Chicago's Channel 2, WBBM-TV.
</P>
<P>
   It was in February that the health correspondent, Dr. Michael
Breen, stopped doing nightly health reports with titles like
``Potentially Deadly Fruit'' (grapefruit) and ``The Secret to a
Good Sex Life'' (exercise), to focus on topics like risks
associated with early prostate cancer screening (unnecessary
treatment). And the weatherman, Steve Baskerville, toned down his
chatty banter in favor of shorter meteorological reports.
</P>
<P>
   One night last month, when the other local newscasts opened with
live reports from a neighborhood where the power had briefly gone
out, WBBM devoted most of its early minutes to an accord between
the Environmental Protection Agency and chemical manufacturers,
limiting the use of a dangerous insecticide.
</P>
<P>
   And last Wednesday, when the other 10 p.m. programs led with
stories about a nonfatal shooting of an off-duty police officer and
Elian Gonzalez's return to Cuba, the Channel 2 newscast began with
a lengthy report on the day's Supreme Court decisions, including
one to strike down a law banning a controversial form of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the management at WBBM-TV has thrown out the local
news playbook of pizazz and sensationalism used at TV stations
throughout the country and replaced it with an on-air clinic in
no-frills journalism.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is a gimmick in all of this, it is that there is no
gimmick. For Channel 2, the CBS-owned station in Chicago, the
restructured news program represents not so much a bold move in
journalism as an attempt to increase revenue and crawl out of last
place in its local news market.
</P>
<P>
   But it also casts the national spotlight once again on Chicago,
the third-largest television market in the country _ where Jerry
Springer, Siskel and Ebert and Oprah Winfrey were made famous. The
no-gimmicks strategy is being studied across the nation by news
directors and station managers, who have sought ways to stem the
loss of viewers of their own local news programs, which can account
for as much as a third of a station's advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Some reasons for dwindling local news audiences are obvious:
with 24-hour news channels and information available over the
Internet at any time, the news market has simply become more
competitive. Yet there is a growing sense in local TV news that
another factor behind the ratings decline is a perception among
viewers that the newscasts have been gradually dumbed down.
</P>
<P>
   The people who devised the new 10 p.m. model at WBBM, where
ratings for the late evening news have plunged 70 percent since the
late 1980's and are far behind its competitors' on the NBC and ABC
stations, share that view. They set about developing a new 10 p.m.
program last year with an eye toward righting what they saw as the
wrongs of local TV journalism, hoping to prove that higher-quality
news would draw a higher-quality audience _ better educated, more
affluent _ worth more to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it is unclear if the experiment is working. Although the
program's ratings rose initially, they later dropped. But whether
their effort succeeds or fails, the station's journalists say the
reward has been in the journey, which has involved heavy doses of
journalistic soul-searching about local TV news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had lost our way, and we disappointed a lot of
people who counted on us,'' Carol Marin, the program's anchor, said
in an interview at her Chicago office. ``We stopped telling you
things that were particularly important and started just telling
you anything that we thought maybe offered you a little bit of eye
candy.''
</P>
<P>
   Marin, 51, said she believed that the quality of local news had
deteriorated gradually in recent decades. As entertainment
programming costs went up, news became a comparatively stronger
profit generator for station managers, who with the help of
consultants devised stunts and gimmicks to draw viewers.
</P>
<P>
   One such stunt, in fact, led Marin to leave her previous job, in
1997, as the lead anchor at WMAQ, Chicago's NBC station. In what
she considered a clear ploy to lure viewers, WMAQ hired Jerry
Springer, host of the daytime talk show, as an on-air commentator
for the newscast she co-anchored. After nearly 20 years at the
station, she quit in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Marin moved to WBBM, initially as a part-time correspondent
focusing on investigative pieces not only for the local news, but
also for the CBS network's new prime-time magazine show ``Public
Eye with Bryant Gumbel.'' She said at the time that she had sworn
off anchoring for good.
</P>
<P>
   But when the ratings for WBBM's late evening news program
slipped even further in May 1999, the station manager, Hank Price,
persuaded Marin to take the 10 p.m. anchor slot by promising that
she would be able to shape the local program as she saw fit.
</P>
<P>
   It was an offer she could not refuse. Along with station
executives and news department staffers, Marin set about devising a
wholly new 10 p.m. broadcast. She convened dozens of meetings over
six months in which they debated how news should be defined and how
it should be conveyed to viewers. The meetings became almost like
group therapy sessions, according to station staff members.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the group concluded that the conventional local news
format long used for Channel 2's late evening newscast was
unacceptable. So they decided that the revised 10 o'clock news
would not follow any rigid formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were questions that we asked like, `What do viewers want
from weather?''' said Pat Costello, the new WBBM news director.
``If there's the threat of a big storm, they want to know
everything. Otherwise, they want to know `How hot? How cold?' and
`What's it going to be like for the next five days?'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Baskerville, the weatherman, was told to shorten his reports,
although he was assured they would grow in length and prominence in
cases of severe weather. Tim Weigel, the sportscaster, was given
similar orders.
</P>
<P>
   Another philosophical question arose: If an abandoned warehouse
is burning brightly near the highway, making for great photography,
but no one is hurt and traffic has not been affected, is it a
story? Maybe, Marin said. But, she added, ``You don't stick a
reporter out there in front of it, eight hours later, and say,
`There was an unbelievable fire here earlier today where nobody got
hurt and nothing was lost.'''
</P>
<P>
   Breen, the health reporter, and staff members agreed that the
nightly health reports were among the worst offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd say, `Coming up: The fruit that kills you,''' Breen
recalled. ``And, it would be, `grapefruit _ if you combine it with
certain medications.''' The solution, they agreed, was for Breen to
present reports less frequently but on weightier issues.
</P>
<P>
   The team also decided the station would produce longer stories
and pass over those considered inconsequential. And any banter
between personalities that was not spontaneous was out, as were
plugs for sponsors or network shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the things that I said I couldn't ever do again,'' Marin
said, ``is to say, `Meet the real guy behind tonight's movie.'''
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, there would be no closing shots of animals _ or,
as the staff mantra had it, ``no water-skiing squirrels.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, at least, it was a completely new format for
television news. And Price signed off on the plan. With CBS so far
back in third place, there was nothing to lose. And here was a
program he could sell to advertisers as being geared to a more
upscale, sophisticated crowd. The sales staff did just that,
executives said, lifting the rate for a 30-second spot nearly 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   When the revamped format was introduced on Feb. 7, Marin, as a
lone female anchor, stood in marked contrast to the rival network
affiliates' male-female anchor teams. Her competitors led their
newscasts with stories about a water main break earlier that day in
downtown Chicago. Marin's newscast all but ignored it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she opened with a report about the deposed city
treasurer, Miriam Santons, who had spoken that day with reporters
for the first time since a judge had reversed her conviction on
charges of fraud and attempted extortion.
</P>
<P>
   For the first month, viewer reaction was positive. According to
Nielsen Media Research, the television ratings service, the program
was watched in 214,700 homes in February, a sweeps month in which
stations closely gauge ratings to set advertising rates. But while
the audience was 5 percent larger than it had been a year earlier,
viewership was still far smaller than for the 10 p.m. news programs
on ABC (474,295 households) and NBC (349,563).
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while there was a falloff among older viewers of Marin's
program, its audience of people between 25 and 54 _ who matter most
to the advertisers that sponsor news _ increased 33 percent over
the year-earlier period. And viewership among more affluent viewers
was also up for February.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings upturn seemed to be temporary, however. During the
May sweeps period, the program's viewership declined 13 percent in
total households, compared with the prior May, and was down by 25
percent among viewers in the 25-to-54 age range, according to
Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   The WBBM approach has come under fire from some media critics
and, not surprisingly, from competitors, who have taken to calling
it ``PBS on CBS.'' One of the newscast's more prominent critics is
Bill Kurtis, a former WBBM anchor who is now host of
``Investigative Reports'' on the A&AMP;E cable network.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Kurtis criticized the program for failing to
report all of the news of the day. ``I think they made a mistake,''
he said. ``You have to cover the news or you're a talk show.''
</P>
<P>
   At WBBM, Price said he intended to stay with the format adopted
for Marin's 10 p.m. program, which, he said, still needed time to
catch on with viewers.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems the people who matter, the people who buy ads, are
willing to stick with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really holding out,'' said Ross S. Currie, local broadcast
director of the Chicago branch of TN Media, a media buying firm.
``I really think 'BBM will come around.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Currie said he expected the ratings to go up soon, with
some help from CBS' new hit program in prime time: ``Survivor.''

SAVING ROMAN MOSAICS IN TURKEY SPURRING ARCHAEOLOGISTS, TOURISTS
AND TEMPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELKIS, Turkey _ As waters rise inexorably over the ruins of an
ancient Roman town here, an international team of archaeologists
has sprung into action to save whatever can be rescued in the next
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by a $5 million grant from an American charitable
foundation, the team hopes to dig up mosaics and artifacts, and to
create a historical park and resort.
</P>
<P>
   A new lake is being formed as water from the Euphrates River
backs up behind a new dam. Turkey is in the midst of a huge
dam-building project that is to provide electric power for the
country's booming economy and irrigation for parched farmland in
southeastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
   The ruins here are those of Zeugma, an important Roman garrison
town on the ancient Silk Road. Trade made many of its merchants
wealthy, and they decorated the floors of their villas with
elaborate mosaics.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there may be hundreds of exquisite mosaics under the
dusty hills, along with a rich trove of other artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Although archaeologists have been working here sporadically for
more than 20 years, they began intensive work only recently after
realizing that the inundation was imminent. It quickly became clear
that Zeugma was a far more bountiful site than most specialists had
realized, but by then it was too late to stop the flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Belkis, the town that once stood below the Zeugma site, has
already disappeared under the new lake. A new Belkis is being built
on a nearby hillside, but many residents are embittered by what
they say is the government's indifference to their plight.
</P>
<P>
   News accounts of the flooding of Zeugma have appeared in many
countries. Hardly a day goes by without a foreign journalist or
television team appearing here.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaziantep, the nearest city, more than 1,000 tourists have
arrived in the last few weeks, according to hotel managers,
restaurateurs and taxi drivers. Before the wave of publicity, they
said, it was a rare month when even a dozen tourists came.
</P>
<P>
   Some Turkish archaeologists and government officials seem
uncomfortable with the clamor from abroad, apparently viewing it as
a form of interference that borders on insult.
</P>
<P>
   Directors of the Gaziantep archaeology museum, where artifacts
dug up at Zeugma are piled high, scorned an American
philanthropist, Shawn Estes, who appeared here two weeks ago and
offered the museum a gift of $20,000. They also refused to allow
him to work as a volunteer at the site, and when he addressed the
local Rotary Club he was accused of harboring a secret plan to
steal mosaics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suggested that he ask permission from the Directorate of
Museums in Ankara if he wanted to work or donate money,'' said
Kemal Sertok, who is coordinating work at the site. ``In Turkey we
only employ staff archaeologists.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish authorities have, however, accepted a $5 million grant
from the California-based Packard Humanities Institute. Louise
Schofield, who represents the foundation here, said it might donate
more money in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our work is going to be in three phases,'' she said. ``First
is the rescue excavation of the area that will be covered by water
after Oct. 4. Then there will be a very large conservation program
in cooperation with the Turkish team. And then, in the long term,
there is a plan to turn this site into a major archaeological
park.''
</P>
<P>
   With at least 10 more dams scheduled to be built in southeastern
Turkey in the coming decades, conflict between advocates of
economic development and historical preservation may grow.
</P>
<P>
   The next focus of this conflict is likely to be Hasankeyf, a
historical town 260 miles east of here that is to be inundated in a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   A British company has won the contract to build the dam at
Hasankeyf, but opponents are waging a vocal campaign in Britain.
When they invited the mayor of Hasankeyf to attend one of their
protest rallies in London, the Turkish authorities advised him not
to go, and he canceled his trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to defuse this sense of confrontation,'' said
Richard Hodges, a British archaeologist who is helping to direct
the Zeugma excavation. ``I'm interested in preserving culture, but
I also like to drink water and use electricity. If we can make this
project work, it can be a model for Turkey's future.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Turkish preservationists reject the idea of such
compromises. ``The appropriate lessons should be drawn from this
and newly planned dam projects should be halted,'' said Asket
Tibet, general-secretary of the Archaeologists' Association.
</P>
<P>
   That call was echoed by the general-secretary of the History
Association, Orhan Silier. ``The world's leading historians are
trying to reinterpret history by using findings from these
regions,'' Silier said. ``Yet we leave them under water.''

   It is still unclear, and may be for years, how much of Zeugma is
being lost. Some specialists believe it may be less than 10
percent. Others say there is no way of being sure, since an unknown
portion of the city is already under water and no one is certain
how much remains buried beneath the adjacent hills.

COMMENTARY: BILLIE, BENNY AND THE DUKE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listen. Those sounds you hear are the first faint glorious notes
from the film ``Jazz,'' Ken Burns' wonderful 10-part, 19-hour
exploration of this nation's greatest music. The documentary will
debut on PBS in January, but last week I got an early look at some
excerpts and they're amazing.
</P>
<P>
   I once asked Dizzy Gillespie how close he had really been to
Charlie Parker. He replied, ``How close are two coats of paint?''
</P>
<P>
   That's how I feel about the relationship between this country
and the astonishing variety of music that we call jazz. Jazz is
more than a musical reflection of America _ it is the embodiment in
music of the quintessentially American idea of free and talented
and diverse individuals working, playing, frequently fighting, but
most of all improvising together to come up with something
beautiful and great. It is the truest artistic expression of who we
are.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Burns has captured this on film.
</P>
<P>
   Burns himself, in a telephone conversation a few days ago, said:
``I think it's the best thing I've ever done. I've never said that
before in any of my interviews. Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jazz'' is the third part of the trilogy of American life that
Burns began 16 years ago when he started work on his acclaimed
``Civil War'' series. The second part was the epic 18 1/2-hour
``Baseball'' documentary.
</P>
<P>
   For once, a film about jazz does not give the music short
shrift. The music is abundant and it's thrilling. But there is also
much more. With remarkable footage _ 2,000 archival film clips and
another 2,400 still photos _ ``Jazz'' carries the viewer on a
spellbinding tour of the personalities and the venues (the
speakeasies, the smoke-filled clubs, the ballrooms, the concert
halls) that gave us this extraordinary music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jazz is the story of the 20th century,'' said Burns. ``It's an
unusually objective witness to what we've been through _ two world
wars, massive dislocations in the Depression, the ever-present
question of race, that is to say, minstrelsy and Jim Crow and
lynchings and all of that. And it's about sex, the way men and
women talk to one another, the mating call of America. And it's
about drugs and their terrible cost. But mostly it's about these
terribly courageous men and women who created art on the spot _
something the rest of us can only dream of.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the people you meet on this 19-hour tour are, in the words
of the narrator:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The pampered son of middle-class parents who turned a whole
orchestra of extraordinary musicians into his own personal
instrument, wrote nearly 2,000 pieces for it to play, and in the
process became America's greatest composer.'' (That would be Duke
Ellington.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A Russian-Jewish immigrant's boy from the Chicago slums who
was taught the clarinet just to keep him out of trouble, but who
grew up to teach a whole country how to dance.'' (Benny Goodman.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The troubled daughter of a Baltimore housemaid whose
distinctive style of singing transcended the limitations of her own
voice and routinely transformed mediocre music into great art.''
(Billie Holiday.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The son of a pullman chef from Kansas City, Mo., who came to
New York to launch a musical revolution, proudly led it for a time,
and then destroyed himself at 34.'' (Charlie Parker.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The fatherless waif from the streets of New Orleans whose
unrivaled genius helped turn jazz into a soloist's art (and) who
influenced every singer, every instrumentalist, every artist who
came after him.'' (Louis Armstrong.)
</P>
<P>
   There is a moment in the film when the actor Ossie Davis
describes walking in on Louis Armstrong unexpectedly and seeing
``the saddest expression I've ever seen on a man's face.'' And
there is a moment when Dave Brubeck, reminiscing on camera, is
suddenly overcome by an ancient and horrible memory, and he breaks
down and begins to weep.
</P>
<P>
   With taste, and with his own sure and unerring artistic touch,
Burns guides us through this sacred cultural terrain. No one has
ever put jazz on film better than Ken Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Kudos must go to PBS and to the folks who carry the General
Motors ``Mark of Excellence'' banner for sponsoring this important
work. I seldom look forward to January. But this is different. This
is really special.

   FUTUROSCOPE, France _ For much of their 194-mile trek through
the rich farmland of the Loire Valley on Sunday afternoon, the
riders of the Tour de France _ the peloton as its called in cycling
lingo _ were content to stay basically intact.
</P>
<P>
   Two riders, France's Jacky Durand and the Netherlands' Erik
Dekker, made an early break to pick up valuable bonus seconds at
certain sprint stages, but the two gradually fell back, with Dekker
seeking medical attention for a cramp and Durand simply growing
leg-weary. Several others made solo dashes, but just as quickly as
they charged forward, they came back to the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the group reached the final stretch into Loudun, the
bravest of the group, the sport's top sprinters, readied for one
final push.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 194 miles and four hours and 45 minutes after the group
left Futuroscope, there was a photo finish to decide the victor.
Tom Steels _ teeth clinched, and his bicycle wobbling from side to
side as he furiously pumped the pedals for more speed _ got to the
finish line just ahead of Australia's Stuart O'Grady. During his
final push over about 1 1/2 miles, Steels averaged more than 39
miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the last-second flurry, the results of the second
stage had little effect on the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
   David Millar, a 23-year-old Scotsman and the lone rider from
Great Britain competing in the Tour, remained in first place
overall, despite finishing 17th Sunday. Millar, the winner of
Saturday's stage one prologue, has an overall time of 5 hours, 5
minutes and 9 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Four seconds behind in second place was Austin's Lance
Armstrong, the defending Tour champion. Armstrong, riding
conservatively, finished 38th.
</P>
<P>
   France's Laurent Jalabert remained in third, 15 seconds behind
Millar and 11 behind Armstrong. Jan Ullrich, the 1997 champion, was
fourth, 16 seconds behind the leader.
</P>
<P>
   Millar finished third Sunday at the third intermediary sprint
and picked up two bonus seconds, which allowed him to pad his
minimal margin over Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong stayed near the front of the peloton but away from the
kamikaze sprinters. His focus wasn't to win this flat stage or even
come close. Rather, he wanted to stay out of trouble and steer
clear of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who ride for the overall lead don't particularly get
into the first week,'' Armstrong said. ``You can absolutely lose
the Tour de France in this first week. Nobody's going to win it the
first week, but you can lose it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, our strategy is to stay out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble almost sidetracked Tyler Hamilton, one of Armstrong's
most valuable teammates. Hamilton crashed about one-quarter into
the race, but was able to get back on his bike with only slight
scrapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened in an instant,'' Hamilton said. ``The peloton was
going really fast. There was some sort of contact toward the front,
somebody laid on the brakes really hard and it had a domino effect
on the rest of the peloton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy to get off the pavement and get on my bike. It
could have been a lot worse. Lance was right beside me. It could
have just as easily been him. A crash like that, it's just like a
lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's conditions were a bit windy, but most of the stage was
completed under slightly overcast skies with temperatures in the
low 70s. All the riders returned to their hotels near Futuroscope,
although today's stage starts in Loudun, about 25 miles away, and
continues on to Nantes, in western France near the Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   The stage victory was Steels' eighth since 1998. At 28, he is
one of the top sprinters in the world and one of his sport's most
volatile competitors. Yet he also knows that even with his win
Sunday, he was unlikely to unseat Millar as the overall leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a chance I could catch Millar because Cofidis
(Millar's team) was too good,'' Steels said.
</P>
<P>
   Millar, the son of a Royal Air Force pilot, continues to remain
the big story in the international media, although the time trial
specialist is not expected to keep his overall lead once the Tour
leaves its flatter stages. In fact, the Cofidis team controlled the
peloton so well Sunday that they were able to keep the major
sprinters from kicking up the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Millar's eight teammates set up in a line in front of him, with
one rider each at his right and left. This way, the volatility of
the peloton would not cause him to crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Cofidis riders peeled away with about three miles to go and
allowed the sprinters from Mapei, Credit Agricole and Telekom to
finally take over the stage, setting up Steels' spectacular finish.

ZIMBABWE HAS A FRESH POPULIST BREEZE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ There were buses to hire, fliers to post,
people to rally. The country's newest opposition party was about to
be set in motion in Rufaro Stadium and time was running out.
</P>
<P>
   The new party had no slogan, no logo and no access to the
television or radio controlled by the government it hoped to
topple. ``We were all anxious,'' recalled Grace Kwinjeh, a member
of the party's executive board. ``We were asking ourselves, `How do
we get people there? How do we get the information out?'''
</P>
<P>
   But to the surprise of many onlookers, thousands flocked to the
township stadium for that first rally last September. And within
nine months, the new party, the Movement for Democratic Change, had
united black union activists and white corporate executives,
students and workers into a formidable movement that shook the
political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In the elections on June 24 and 25, voters here loosened
President Robert Mugabe's grip on parliament by electing opposition
party members to more than a third of the seats. Mugabe's governing
party kept its majority, but for the first time in more than a
decade, it lost its authority to change the Constitution
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   By almost any measure, the success of the Movement for
Democratic Change is astounding. And its rapid rise to power
reflects its attentiveness to the frustrations of urban voters at a
time when Mugabe and his party, who have ruled this country for 20
years, seemed detached from the needs of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Tsvangirai, 48, the leader of the Movement for Democratic
Change, promised to improve the economy, race relations and the
prospects for young people, a message that appealed to a nation
experiencing an economic crisis, a generation shift and an
increasing sense of alienation among whites.
</P>
<P>
   He put young people in prominent positions and adopted slogans
that borrowed from popular township slang. He referred to whites as
his ``cousins'' and offered them leadership roles in the party. And
he emphasized over and over again that his party intended to find a
way to reduce unemployment and skyrocketing inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But Mugabe, 76, who was considered a hero for fighting to end
decades of white minority rule here and a master of the art of
politics, never seemed to notice that the nation was changing under
his feet.
</P>
<P>
   He focused on the redistribution of white-owned farms to
landless blacks in a country that was increasingly urban and
preoccupied with joblessness and falling wages.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized the history of the liberation struggle when about
a third of the population now consists of young people who were
either children in 1980, when majority rule was won, or were born
shortly after. ( Mugabe helped lead the battle against white rule
that led to this country's first democratic elections twenty years
ago.)
</P>
<P>
   He attacked the tiny white minority, which still controls much
of the economy, and shook them out of political hibernation. It
was, in large measure, Mugabe's inflammatory racial rhetoric and
his support of violent invasions of white-owned farms that
persuaded many whites to bankroll the new opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, while inflation was soaring and civil servants
were struggling to feed their families, Mugabe gave his cabinet
members salary increases of up to 182 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Zimbabwe has never had opposition parties. The
party of Joshua Nkomo, the prominent nationalist, won 20 seats in
parliament in 1980 before it was absorbed by Mugabe's party in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the governing party, the Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front, has controlled all but three seats in
Parliament. And voters became so apathetic that only about 10
percent voted in the local elections last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People got tired of a one-party state, but they were never
really accorded an alternative,'' said Alfred Nhema, the chairman
of political science at the University of Zimbabwe. ``And then, the
MDC comes along as a real alternative.'' Tsvangirai, the country's
most important union leader, already had a strong record of
challenging the government. He brought the nation to a halt in 1997
with a general strike. And he led the battle for higher wages and
lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition candidates also appealed to the public. They were
teachers, butchers, lawyers and students who lacked political
experience but understood ordinary hardships and were willing to
risk their lives for change.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, at least 26 people were killed, most of
them opposition party supporters. But the opposition candidates
fought on, even though they lacked access to government-controlled
news media or public financing, which supports established parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I screwed up my courage,'' said Benni Tumbare Mutasa, 44, a
newly elected member of Parliament who runs a butcher shop and was
attacked by supporters of Mugabe. ``It was high risk, but sometimes
risks are worth taking.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, nearly 60 percent of registered voters turned out
for the election. And when it was all over, the new opposition
party had claimed 57 seats and Mugabe's party had won 62.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by their unprecedented showing, the opposition did
not hesitate to turn their slingshots on the giant of Zimbabwean
politics, Mugabe. And Tsvangirai announced that he would run for
president in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end of Robert Mugabe,'' Tsvangirai said. ``The
sooner they start planning his retirement the better.''

UGANDANS STAY WITH ONE-PARTY SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Voters in Uganda overwhelmingly endorsed the
nation's ``no-party'' political system, according to final results
released Sunday, though only half of registered voters went to the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the leaders of Uganda and neighboring Rwanda
met over the weekend to defuse tensions over one of the problems
that has most troubled Ugandans _ Uganda's role in the fighting in
Congo. Last month, Rwanda and Uganda, nominally fighting on the
same side, clashed for the third time in the Congolese city of
Kisangani. At least 600 people died, aid groups say, most of them
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, as the final votes in the referendum were tallied,
presidents Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Paul Kagame of Rwanda
issued a joint statement calling for renewed respect for the
cease-fire between their countries and, more broadly, in Congo
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations have been close allies, both fighting to
overthrow the government of the Congolese president, Laurent
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in Congo is unpopular in Uganda, and opponents of
Museveni had used the issue against him in the referendum on
whether to retain the current no-party state or to return to a
multiparty political system.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, 88 percent of Uganda's voters still favored
Museveni's no-party system, while 9 percent wanted a return to
traditional political parties. The balance, from voting on
Thursday, were voided ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout, however, was just 51 percent. As results trickled
in over the last three days, opposition leaders said that the low
turnout proved the success of a boycott they had organized and
indicated widespread discontent with Museveni. In 1996, the last
presidential race, three quarters of the voters went to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was, in many ways, a referendum on the popularity of
Museveni, who strongly opposes the return of more than one party.
</P>
<P>
   In campaign appearances around the country, he argued that
parties merely divide Uganda by tribe and religion and gave rise to
the dictators Idi Amin and Milton Obote in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In Uganda, political parties may exist in name only. Parties may
not hold conventions or rallies or field candidates for office.
Instead, all political activity takes place within what is known as
the Movement, a national umbrella political organization to which,
in theory, all candidates and voters belong.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of a multiple-party electoral system and government
say the Movement violates their freedom of association. They also
argue that Uganda is fast becoming a one-party state with Museveni,
in power since 1986, having inordinate power.
</P>
<P>
   That concern was echoed by a group of industrialized nations _
including the United States and many European nations _ which had
contributed $4.5 million for the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group of donors emphasizes the importance of ensuring that
the Movement system does not evolve into a de facto one-party
state,'' officials of those nations said in a statement released
Saturday. ``Experience shows that such development would not be in
the interest of transparent and accountable government in Uganda.''
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, both Rwanda and Uganda helped start a rebellion
against President Kabila of Congo, backing three competing rebel
groups at various times.
</P>
<P>
   On Kabila's side, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have joined in
the fighting. Last summer, Uganda and Rwanda turned on each other
in the northeastern city of Kisangani _ and they have now clashed
three times, all but destroying their once-close relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations had vowed to leave Kisangani, to make way for
U.N. peacekeepers. But it was only after the latest round of
fighting between Uganda and Rwanda, which drew criticism from the
United Nations as well as the United States, that the two nations
actually withdrew their troops from Kisangani. Both still have
troops inside Congo.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, the two nations ``reaffirmed their commitment
to a demilitarization of the city of Kisangani and called on other
parties to the cease-fire agreement to reciprocate and not take
advantage of Rwanda and Uganda's withdrawal from Kisangani.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lance Armstrong has made no secret of his distaste for
certain French publications since several French newspapers accused
him last year of using performance-enhancing drugs during his Tour
win.
</P>
<P>
   The innuendo hasn't stopped this year. It's simply taken another
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the Tour started, the newspaper L'Equipe, an
all-sports daily, wrote a story that said Armstrong has gotten so
money-hungry he is asking to get paid to give interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, to insinuate that I ask for money for interviews
is absurd,'' Armstrong said. ``But then, some things that are
written in certain publications are absurd. Interviews are free.
Appearances, personal endorsements, commercials _ they cost
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Stapleton, Armstrong's Austin-based agent, said that his
client is set to make $7 million this year, $5 million of which is
coming from endorsements. None of Armstrong's salary is being paid
by the media.

</P>
<P>
   A French rider did not win a Tour stage last year for the first
time in 83 years.
</P>
<P>
   Jacky Durand, though, tried to give his country something to
cheer about on Sunday. Durand, a 32-year-old who rides for the
Belgium team, Lotto-Mobistar, led the second stage for 70 miles.
</P>
<P>
   With his head wrapped in a red and blue kerchief to honor his
homeland, Durand got plenty of TV time as he built a lead of more
than four minutes. But he faded back into the peloton with about 50
miles to go.
</P>
<P>
   Durand is known as a rider who seeks attention. He has won three
Tour stages in his career and had the distinction of finishing last
in the 1999 Tour. Yet despite finishing 144th, Durand was selected
as ``Most Competitive Rider'' of the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVELOGUE
</P>
<P>
   Although the peloton actually rode 120.2 miles Sunday afternoon,
the riders didn't get that far from the initial starting line in
Futuroscope. The cyclists rode around Poitiers, starting northeast
of the city and continuing in a counterclockwise loop until they
headed north and then slightly west to Loudun, which is about a
30-minute drive via car from Poitiers. Loudun, nestled in the Loire
Valley, is known for the ancient cave dwellings of
Candes-Saint-Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Just to the north of Loudun lies the historic village of Chinon.
Those who saw the movie ``Joan of Arc,'' starring Ingrid Bergman,
might recognize this quaint town, known now for producing red wine.
Five hundred and seventy-one years ago, Joan of Arc, the
self-proclaimed messenger of God, sought out French King Charles
VII to ask him for an army. The seat of the French government
stayed here until 1450.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE DE JOUR
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a funny thing happen to me. First, I was stung by a bee.
I saw him on my leg and swatted him off. Then, there was a
spectator right in my line, trying to take my picture. I still had
the stinger in my leg when I finished. . . . It's an amazing scene
here at the Tour, unlike anything I have ever seen.''

JUSTICE, CLEMENS AND THE YANKEES SHED SOME ANXIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ David Justice did not bring an entourage
when he joined the Yankees. He seems more like a kid switching to a
new grade school, genial but quiet among new teammates. Justice
noticed that almost all of the Yankees have the cuffs of their
pants set just above the ankles, and before Sunday's game, Justice
had his pants adjusted as well.
</P>
<P>
   The conformity that matters most, however, will be in his run
production, and Justice had his first hit with the Yankees Sunday
and drove in two runs as they completed a turbulent 13-game trip by
beating Tampa Bay, 5-2. Roger Clemens was activated from the
disabled list and pitched efficiently and effectively, allowing
three hits, two walks and a run over seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   When they last played at home on June 18 they were five games
over .500 and a half-game behind the first-place Red Sox. They are
now four games over .500, at 40-36, and one game behind the Toronto
Blue Jays in the American League East. But they are a different
team, jettisoning Jim Leyritz, Ricky Ledee and Todd Erdos over the
last two weeks and adding infielder Jose Vizcaino, pitcher Ben Ford
and Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Justice said it was exciting being with a new team after
Sunday's game, ``and it's scary sometimes, no matter where you
go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in a comfort zone; I've been in the same type of
routine for the past three and a half years,'' he said. ``It's just
a matter of basically getting into another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice went hitless in his first two days with the Yankees, and
he admitted to being somewhat anxious, even at age 34, trying to
get that first hit for his new team, trying to fit in. He changed
his socks but put on his underwear backward, a mistake pointed out
by new teammate Felix Jose; Justice laughed along and decided to
keep it that way, just to see how it worked.
</P>
<P>
   And it worked well. Justice pulled a single to right-center in
the second inning, driving home Bernie Williams with the first run,
and with the bases loaded in the third, he hit a sharp grounder to
first, enabling Derek Jeter to cross the plate with the Yankees'
third run. ``He's a legitimate hitter and he is going to be a good
guy in big situations,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager.
</P>
<P>
   There was no telling how much run support Clemens would need, if
he would even last five innings. He went on the disabled list 18
days ago after straining his right groin muscle and spent most that
time training at the Yankees' facility in Tampa, Fla. Clemens
tracked the Yankees, feeling frustrated when they struggled. He
would see George Steinbrenner, who hit him with a good-natured
verbal jab, telling him he was needed back in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens seemed particularly anxious before Sunday's game,
teammates said, stalking through the clubhouse purposefully, no one
saying anything to him, giving him personal space. The pitcher
``walks around like Alfred Hitchcock'' in the clubhouse, Torre
said. ``He's in the movie, but nobody's supposed to know about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to the bullpen to warm up about 10 minutes before he
usually does, to get loose and to see how the muscles around his
legs felt, and to have a little extra time just in case he required
a little extra wrapping.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens felt great, threw hard and threw lots of strikes,
his pace steady from pitch to pitch, his mechanics smooth and
steady. Clemens usually averages about 18 pitches an inning, and
Sunday, he needed only 87 over seven innings, an average of 12 an
inning. ``Maybe this two week stint on the disabled list helped
more than just physically,'' said Torre. ``It helped him to
organize his thoughts and then get ready to pitch. Sunday he seemed
like he was very focused and very aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' outing marked the seventh time in the 13 games on this
trip that the Yankees got a good pitching effort, and they won six
of those seven games. The Yankees won the first two games of the
13-game trip, and the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   Torre felt a rebirth of energy in his players Saturday, right
after Jorge Posada was involved in a fight with Tampa Bay's Bobby
Smith. Immediately after play resumed, Derek Jeter made a diving
play to his left, and it was as if that intensity carried over into
Sunday's game. Scott Brosius, the third baseman, made three nice
plays, and Bernie Williams and Shane Spencer both had running
catches, and Clemens was focused, working fast.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' rotation had been in shambles because of injury,
but now four-fifths of the rotation is intact _ Clemens and Orlando
Hernandez, David Cone and Andy Pettitte in line; Ramiro Mendoza is
the only sidelined starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking to put something together,'' said Torre.
``Hopefully, this will start us into a good streak.''

 &HT;    Massachusetts fishing town finds Clooney movie perfect
opportunity to put itself on map
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLOUCESTER, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   To shamelessly use the most overused adjective here these days,
this particular morning is beginning to look perfect. The sun is
peeking from behind long white clouds, and dew is giving luster to
the bright yellow snapdragons and multicolored pansies in tiny
gardens dotting this small, 377-year-old harbor town on the rocky
Cape Ann coast 33 miles northeast of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It's the last day of what local officials have dubbed ``The
Perfect Month,'' which culminated with the debut of ``The Perfect
Storm,'' Warner Bros.' $100 million movie starring George Clooney
and Mark Wahlberg. The film, partly shot in Gloucester last year,
is based on Sebastian Junger's immensely popular nonfiction best
seller about the tragic loss of the Gloucester-based swordfishing
boat Andrea Gail, which in October 1991 sailed head on with its
crew of six into three ferocious weather systems that collided in
the Atlantic Ocean, churning up 100-foot waves and creating one of
the worst storms in recorded history.
</P>
<P>
   Along historic, red-bricked Main Street, shop owners are
embracing the town's connection to Hollywood's latest hoped-for
summer blockbuster. W.E. Blanchard Jeweler's storefront window
boasts that its trinkets make ``The Perfect Gifts.'' There's ``The
Perfect Cut'' (diamond-studded jewelry), ``The Perfect Storm
Ornament'' (chrome- or brass-plated Christmas tree decorations
priced from $34.95 to $49.95), and watches described as ``The
Perfect Timing.'' Nearby, at Cormorant Gloucester, staffers have
taken a life-size stand-up of a smiling George Clooney, dressed it
in a yellow rain hat, white T-shirt and starry night-scene tie, and
placed it with the store's linens in a claw-foot bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   All this salesmanship irritates some who live here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's being used in the wrong way,'' says Melissa Bach, 34. ``I
get so angry I can't be eloquent on it. This is a story about six
people who died. It's called 'Perfect' only because it couldn't get
any worse than it was at sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Bach is owner and operator of The Perfect Tour, a $15-per-person
guided walking venture along the harbor she started three years ago
in which she talks both about the making of the film and local
fishing history (more than 10,000 Gloucester fishermen have died at
sea since the 1600s). She says she called Junger and asked
permission to use the word ``perfect'' with her tour. ``I wanted to
be respectful,'' she says. ``Anyway, storm and tour kind of sound
alike. And they share a vowel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bach's movie-and-fishing tour is indicative of major change
brewing in Gloucester (most often pronounced ``Glosta'' by
long-time locals). Many in this port of 30,000 see the 1997 book
and especially the new film spurring tourism to all-time highs.
Others cling to the centuries-old fishing tradition that has been
the town's lifeblood.
</P>
<P>
   The fish industry has been taking a severe beating. In the last
six years; some 1,000 fishing jobs have reportedly been lost
(tourism employment, including hugely popular whale watching
excursions, now overpowers fishing). Locals talk about a struggle
with alcoholism among fishermen. Rogers Street alone once held 32
bars, Bach says. ``It's a hard-drinking town.'' Gorton's, the
frozen seafood food giant here since 1849, now uses much more
Alaskan pollock than seafood caught off Cape Ann.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fish here is just not hot right now,'' says Steve Dunn, 37, a
buyer for Captain Marden's Seafoods. He's inside the Gloucester
Seafood Display Auction with about a dozen other buyers clad mostly
in T-shirts and jeans from various regional firms. Gathered for the
five-day-a-week, 6 a.m. fish auction, they sit in plastic maroon
armchairs in a large, high-ceiling conference room with headsets
and cell phones, bidding on yellowtail, lobsters, skatewings and
other catches brought in overnight from vessels like the Star Dust,
Captain Dutch and Sasquatch. Prices reach $1.51 a pound for this
day's catch of nearly 9 tons of large cod.
</P>
<P>
   Auctioneer Gus ``Butch'' Maniscalo, a short, burly and tattooed
gusto of 53 who punctuates each highest bid with his trademark
verbal flourish, ``You bought 'em,'' says the town's fishermen talk
quite a bit about ``The Perfect Storm'' and what it might bring.
Maybe tourism will benefit, he concedes, but ``it doesn't help the
fishing part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the media is fueling ``The Perfect Storm'' mania. The
Associated Press, USA Today and many others have written about a
potential tourism boom here that could be overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will happen with the movie is really anybody's guess,''
says Mike Costello, executive director of the Cape Ann Chamber of
Commerce. ``People have already been coming to Gloucester to visit
for the last couple of centuries (upwards of 100,000 tourists
arrive each year). There's probably been some small impact from the
book and filming. It's a little more difficult getting around on
the streets. But is that 'The Perfect Storm' or the results of a
nice day?''
</P>
<P>
   He says the area's collection of small motels and inns was well
into the summer season and operating at 90 percent occupancy before
the movie opened. ``From this period on, all the major
accommodations are already booked. There are lots of weddings in
August and September and those have to be done a couple of years in
advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every tourist and not even those aware of the Hollywood
tie-in ride in to catch the ``Perfect Storm'' wave. ``My son just
read the book but we've come today to meet friends and visit,''
says Joann McEnerney, 52, of Philadelphia. She's sure they'll see
the movie at some point but have no plans to scour the town for
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Mayer and Elaina Carruth, of Cleveland, however, have
obtained a marriage license and plan to wed next weekend inside the
Crow's Nest, the one-time rowdy Gloucester bar depicted with great
fanfare in the book and film.
</P>
<P>
   The epicenter of the ``Perfect Storm'' migration, the Crow's
Nest is beginning to shed some of its rough, hard-drinking image.
On any given day, a small but steady stream of tourists in shorts
and T-shirts gingerly walk into the joint to sit on leather stools
next to the often unshaven, rough-skinned locals at the wooden bar
and dip plastic spoons into small lunchtime bowls of creamy chowder
spattered with squares of potato and bits of plump, juicy clams for
$3.50.
</P>
<P>
   It's here at the Nest with its single pool table, dart boards
and Keno machines that Bobby Shatford, the fisherman played by Mark
Wahlberg in the movie, hung out. Shatford lived in a small rented
room with stark white walls, a TV and shag carpet upstairs above
the bar (it now costs $35 a night). Wahlberg stayed there with
Shatford's brother weeks before filming to better understand
Bobby's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of dreams staying there,'' says Wahlberg, who
returned last week with Clooney and director Wolfgang Petersen for
a special screening of the movie in nearby Danvers to benefit The
Gloucester Fund, a confab of charities serving the port. ``I dreamt
about water and fishing and the town. It's the closest I've come to
a real-life family while making a movie. I wanted my portrayal to
be sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   At least three busloads of Gloucester citizens traveled to
Danvers for the screening. While many praised the film, they also
found it hard to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was speechless,'' says Michelle Talisman, 40, an extra in
the movie's recreation of the memorial service for the Andrea Gail
fishermen. ``It's going to take a while for the magnitude of it to
sink in. At the end of the movie the audience was pretty quiet and
somber. I bumped into a friend at the after-party and she said, 'I
feel like I just went to a funeral.'''
</P>
<P>
   Petersen, who also directed ``Das Boot'' and ``Air Force One,''
says he wanted the movie to accurately depict the hard life of a
fisherman. ``We want moviegoers to think (the next time they eat
out) what's behind the piece of swordfish on their plate.''
</P>
<P>
   There is much of the town's history that moviegoers won't learn
from the film. It's the place that inspired Rudyard Kipling to
write ``Captains Courageous.'' Nineteenth century artists Fitz Hugh
Lane and Winslow Homer painted here. The Cape Ann Historical Museum
includes several of Lane's harborscapes as well as an 1812 British
red coat, the only surviving example in the United States of an
enlisted man's uniform from the period. The Gloucester Town Hall,
built in 1870, with its creaky wooden floors, boasts past
appearances by Buffalo Bill and P.T. Barnum.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, a steady stream of Portuguese fishermen,
Italians, Brazilians and Cambodians have diversified the
population. A spattering of Italian bakeries downtown sell
melt-in-your-mouth Sicilian pastry and cookies, including pinoli,
farfaletti and baci di dama. In 1892, the Portuguese constructed
Our Lady of Good Voyage Church, rebuilt in 1915 after a fire. Its
sanctuary displays nearly two dozen elaborate wooden ship replicas,
carved at sea by local sailors.
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Perfect Storm'' hasn't fully overrun the town, its
presence is everywhere. Near the harbor, Joe's Bike Shop has become
Joe's Perfect Bike Shop. Another store has used blue wrapping paper
and a 2-foot-long boat in its window display to re-create the
film's ubiquitous poster, depicting the Andrea Gail riding the
movie's monstrous 100-foot wave. Through July 23, Leslie Harrell
Dillen, 53, a local who worked as an extra in ``The Perfect
Storm,'' is putting on her comedy play ``George and Me,'' about her
repeated failed attempts to talk to Clooney on the set.
</P>
<P>
   But at Valentino's Pan-Baked Pizza at the far west end of Main
Street there is perhaps the most perfect respite from everything
``Perfect Storm.'' To attract passers-by, its outdoor sound system
is blaring music.
</P>
<P>
   It's the theme from ``The Godfather.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tale begins in the middle of a swelteringly hot April night
in 1996 on a train meandering through the Indian countryside.
Pankaj Mishra, a 27-year-old editor at HarperCollins' India
division, was reading a manuscript, a first novel by a relatively
unknown Indian film writer.
</P>
<P>
   The writer was Arundhati Roy. The novel was ``The God of Small
Things,'' a story of love and caste in Kerala in tropical southwest
India. Mishra immediately championed her book in the West and
watched his instincts validated as it sold nearly 3 million copies
worldwide and won the prestigious Booker Prize in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Now, four years later, a young, critically praised generation of
Indian writers _ some of whom are now New Yorkers _ are following
in Roy's footsteps in their chosen language, English.
</P>
<P>
   And although their voices are being heard much more loudly in
the West than in India, they are ushering in a new era for Indian
literature in English. They are often called Midnight's
Grandchildren in homage to another seminal Indian novel, Salman
Rushdie's ``Midnight's Children,'' the dark parable of Indian
history since independence that won the Booker Prize in 1981 and in
1993 won a special Booker Prize as the best British novel of the
previous quarter century. Now the new generation of writers have in
many ways broken away from the magic realism that characterizes
much of Rushdie's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signal that young Indian writers got from the success of
`The God of Small Things' and the way the media dealt with the book
is that there are people out there willing to look at what you have
to say,'' said Raj Kamal Jha, a 33-year-old editor at The Indian
Express in New Delhi, whose first novel, ``The Blue Bedspread,''
has received strong reviews and an advance reported in the Indian
press to be more than $275,000.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon, publishers and writers say, is also a product of
a renewed interest in things Indian that began in 1997 with the
mammoth publicity for the 50th anniversary of the country's
independence and that has been enhanced by the growth of computers
and the Internet, which have increased contact between Indian
writers and Western influences.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Jha, the writers include Mishra, now 31, whose
first novel, ``The Romantics,'' was called ``resonant and highly
subtle'' by Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times; Amit Chaudhuri,
37, of Calcutta, whose writing has been described by Rushdie as
``languorous, elliptical, beautiful''; and Kiran Desai (daughter of
the renowned Indian fiction writer Anita Desai), 28, who won praise
two years ago for her first novel, ``Hullabaloo in the Guava
Orchard.''
</P>
<P>
   They also include Jhumpa Lahiri, a 33-year-old New Yorker, the
daughter of Bengali immigrants, who won the Pulitzer Prize in April
for her first book, a collection of short stories titled
``Interpreter of Maladies.'' The stories evoke the complex and
conflicted world of Indian immigrants in the United States. This
month Akhil Sharma, a 28-year-old investment banker in New York
whose stories have appeared in The New Yorker and The Atlantic,
will publish his first novel, ``An Obedient Father'' (Farrar,
Straus &AMP; Giroux). It is about corruption, decay and greed in the
Indian government and about an Indian family.
</P>
<P>
   Jha, who graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology in
New Delhi with a degree in mechanical engineering, went on to get a
master's degree in journalism at the University of Southern
California. Richard Bernstein said in The New York Times that ``The
Blue Bedspread,'' published in the United States by Random House,
is ``a brilliant beginning for a writer whose voice already shows a
maturity well beyond his years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the novel, an unnamed narrator is told that his sister has
died in childbirth and that he must care for her daughter for one
night, until the baby can be placed for adoption. As he watches the
infant in his home, he writes for her the stories he believes will
help her understand her place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Blue Bedspread' grew out of two things,'' Jha said. ``One
was my emotional, almost physical need to write. When I was young,
I had a very severe speech impediment. And when you sit down with
pen and paper, you don't visibly stutter. And the other is my
feelings about family life in India, what I call the silence of the
family. It is very difficult to express feelings, one's true
emotions, in an Indian family. My book is about the need to break
that silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Jha, like Roy, was discovered by Mishra, who has written
criticism for The Times Literary Supplement in London and The New
York Review of Books and has attracted attention for his criticism
of Rushdie's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magic realism was very popular with writers who came
immediately after Rushdie,'' he said, ``but the same writers have
turned away from it. I think it is because of the inherent
unsatisfactoriness of the form, the way in which its formulas
further confuse and complicate an already confused and complicated
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie, of course, still has many defenders. Michael Wood, a
professor of English at Princeton University who has written about
Rushdie, said that Rushdie ``is interested in reimagining reality
itself, not in just imagining alternatives to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no escape in Rushdie,'' Wood said. ``And confusing
and complicating things is quite often a way of understanding
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie, through his agent, declined to comment on the critique.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Mishra said that it was notable that Jha's work broke from the
magic realism _ the presentation of magical characters or events in
realistic settings _ that pervades much of Rushdie's work.
</P>
<P>
   Mishra's writing, in fact, bears a resemblance to Jha's. The
critic Akash Kapur wrote in The New York Times Book Review that
``The Romantics,'' also published by Random House, ``establishes
Mishra as the author of spare and reflective fiction that is a
welcome antidote'' to magic realism. The book is about Samar, a
young intellectual who visits Varanasi and the banks of the Ganges
and meets a politically active student, a group of bohemian
Westerners and a Frenchwoman with whom he has an affair. Samar is
both attracted to and mystified by the Westerners _ feelings that
Mishra says mirror in some ways the relationship of Indian writers
to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Jha said that the key fact in talking about Indians who write in
English ``is that 95 percent of Indians cannot read and write
comfortably in English and have no access to the works.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother can't read my book,'' he added. ``And while my book
has been bought by several European publishers, no
regional-language publisher in my country has bought it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lahiri, readership is not a problem. Not quite three months
after she won the Pulitzer, 175,000 copies of her book, originally
published by Mariner Books/Houghton Mifflin in paperback, are in
print, including 20,000 copies of a new hardcover edition. What is
more difficult, Lahiri says, is her sense of identity. Lahiri was
born in London and grew up in Rhode Island with her parents,
immigrants from Calcutta. She graduated from Barnard College and
holds three master's degrees _ in English, comparative literature
and creative writing _ and a Ph.D. in Renaissance studies, all from
Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   ``My connection with India is fundamental,'' she said in an
interview in her publisher's Manhattan office. ``But at the same
time it is very slippery and confusing. It has been a cause of
bewilderment and sometimes strife and frustration within me. It's a
messy thing. But it's been a blessing for me and my writing. I
would like to see myself as an American writer. When I was raised I
was told not to think of myself as an American. It was important to
my mother to raise her children as Indian, thinking and doing
things in an Indian way, whatever that means. Even now it is hard
for me to say I am American.''
</P>
<P>
   Her connection to India, she said, is ``in many layers _ from my
own encounters with the country, from my visits with my many
relatives in Calcutta, and also through my parents, by virtue of
being the child of parents who have remained so connected with a
place they haven't lived in for 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that kind of knowledge, she said, that propels her stories
of Indians in what for them is a strange land. But the writers who
have influenced her the most, she said, are not Indian. They are
instead also strangers in strange lands _ either immigrants or
writers who live or lived in a kind of self-imposed exile. They
include Vladimir Nabokov, James Joyce, Mavis Gallant and William
Trevor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love about these writers is their connection to place,
or at least their obsession with place, even if they don't feel
connected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma, the author of ``An Obedient Father,'' moved to New
Jersey from New Delhi with his parents when he was 9, but when it
comes to writing about India and Indians, he said, he views himself
as ``quite an insider.''
</P>
<P>
   His resume seems quintessentially American. He took Toni
Morrison's writing class at Princeton, was a Wallace Stegner Fellow
in creative writing at Stanford University, went to Harvard Law
School and is an investment banker in New York. But ``I've spent a
lot of time in India,'' he said. ``I've been back 10 to 15 times,
three months or so each visit, a total of three and a half years.
India has played a large role in my imagination, and I think I
write from an Indian point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Desai, whose novel focuses on the contradictions of modern life
in a small Indian town, has been compared by critics to an older
generation of Indian writers, among them her mother and R.K.
Narayan. Desai, who has lived in the United States since she was 14
and has a home in Manhattan, spends about half the year in New
Delhi. She said she considers herself ``an Indian writer who lives
in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My own relation to India is a very natural one,'' she said in
an interview. ``I find it very easy to reach into my past and write
about India, because it is my heritage. It's in my blood. My family
lives in both places. These days there's so much coming and going.
It's not the old style of immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   Jha and Mishra say that in the vastness of India, where their
middle-class lives have been the exception rather than the rule,
they feel that they are in some ways separate from the real country
and its overwhelming issues of poverty and class.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go home from work I see at every intersection
5-year-olds coming to my car and tapping on the window for some
loose change,'' Jha said. ``I can't escape that reality. It deeply
affects me. And at the same time I feel very impotent, because I
can't engage with it. And one simply must.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems and concerns, Chaudhuri, whose first
American book, ``Freedom Song,'' was praised by critics last year
and whose new novel, ``A New World,'' is being published by Knopf
in October, said he was confident about the future of Indian
writing in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the coming of age of a particular generation that
suddenly finds the novel an attractive form,'' Chaudhuri said. ``We
need time to witness the evolution, and see what develops.''

GIANTS REVISE THEIR OFFENSIVE LINE FOR MORE COHESION 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cruel, swirling wind at Giants Stadium, the harsh winters
and a desire to be linked forever to their Super Bowl past has
meant that the Giants in recent years have remained a pounding,
simplistic offensive team. Coach Jim Fassel has labored at
loosening that fixation, tossing in more multiple formations and
shifting tight ends and four-receiver sets. More screens and draws
and trickery. But what the San Francisco 49ers perfected in the
last 20 years on offense and what the St. Louis Rams exuded last
season in winning the Super Bowl has escaped the Giants. We are
talking speed and explosiveness, big plays and points and crispness
on offense.
</P>
<P>
   A personality. A presence.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants simply have not had either, and last season, with a
7-9 record, their offense nearly swallowed them whole. There has
long been a testy air among the Giants' offensive and defensive
players, a feeling that the defense rules and the offense sleeps.
Finger-pointing emerged last season. The Giants' offense needed an
infusion of talent and confidence. For Fassel and the team to be
ready for the 2000 season, changes were required. And the Giants
started at their core.
</P>
<P>
   They will line up this fall with four changes on the offensive
line. Only right guard Ron Stone returns at the same position. This
is like dumping the engine in a car or painting a white house a
bold red. The building has been gutted. The smoke is clearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that happens every year in the NFL
because consistency on your offensive line is supposed to be a
football requirement for success,'' Stone said last month as the
Giants concluded their last minicamp before training camp begins
later this month. ``We've got four changes on the line, and I don't
know how you would perceive that. I guess last year we all needed
to factor more as a group and obviously we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of last season it was Romen Oben at left tackle, Luke
Petitgout at left guard, Brian Williams at center, Stone at right
guard and Scott Gragg at right tackle. The lineup this season is
Lomas Brown, Glenn Parker, Dusty Zeigler, Stone and Petitgout, with
the first three players arriving as free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' offensive line has been symptomatic of the offense.
It would routinely engage in false starts. It was short on grit and
fight. Often when things went wrong, the linemen would stroll off
the field, heads down and defeated. It was a troublesome signature
for an offense on which the leading rusher for the entire season
(Joe Montgomery) gained only 348 yards. That was a focal point for
a team that scored only 299 points; in comparison, the Rams'
league-leading total was 526.
</P>
<P>
   Lomas Brown could play a pivotal role in changing that.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive linemen have rarely been glamorous, but the left
tackle position is the jewel among common stones. For a
right-handed quarterback, the left tackle protects a blind side.
The left tackle should be a player bred for battle. And that is
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   He is a rarity: a 37-year-old player who is a seven-time Pro
Bowler and who is entering his 16th pro season. Brown, whom Detroit
selected as the sixth player over all in the 1985 draft, blocked
for Barry Sanders during 11 seasons with the Lions. In the last
four seasons, Brown spent three in Arizona and last season in
Cleveland. He is 6 feet 4 inches and weighed 305 pounds as a rookie
in '85, weighed 275 when he arrived in Arizona in '96 and weighs
280 now. He has had one surgery _ a knee scoped in 1989 _ in his
pro career. He is a marvel at that age and experienced at his
position. A player of striking wisdom, desire and character.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever Lomas Brown has been, teammates have sought him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly everywhere I've been guys have asked me to be their
union representative,'' Brown said. ``They come to me with personal
problems, financial problems, family problems. It's flattering. But
now I am trying to focus more on me. I've been through a divorce.
I've had problems with my daughters. Who do I turn to for my
problems? Well, I'm turning to me. I am under the microscope now.
I'm in the media capital of the world with a team that is asking me
to help give this line and this offense some personality and
presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``On our schedule this year I've got ends Bruce Smith of
Washington twice, Simeon Rice of Arizona twice, Greg Ellis of
Dallas twice. We play Tennessee and I'll see Jevon Kearse. I'll get
Cleveland's Courtney Brown, and he was the No. 1 pick in the entire
draft this year. I've got some work to do. This is an opportunity
for me, a make or break year. I get a chance to really project my
name out there. If I ball, if I shut down some people and we win, a
lot of things can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never won a championship in high school, college or the
pros. Maybe this is the year I win a championship in the pros, in
my 16th year. This could be so very lovely.''
</P>
<P>
   Or it could all collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Will the aged veterans Brown and Parker, a four-time Super Bowl
player with the Bills who is 34 and in his 11th year, last the
entire season? Have the Giants added enough speed and scoring
ability at the skill positions? Will quarterback Kerry Collins
glow?
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the league has evolved, the key positions on your
offense are the skill-position people, at quarterback, running back
and receiver,'' said Jim McNally, the Giants' offensive-line coach.
``I don't think you can win with duds on the offensive line, but
you can win with average guys there. We're hoping this group will
far surpass that. Lomas gives us experience and leadership. He
knows how to play the left tackle position. He may not be like he
was in his third year or so in the league, but he has played
against a number of players and does not get rattled in games when
those fast ends come off the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in the league 22 years and had the chance to coach
Anthony Munoz at left tackle. I have seen the good times and the
bad times for players and teams. You come to work every day and do
your job and hope that injuries won't be a big factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone said of Brown: ``Lomas is like a coach. I give to him and
I take from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was told by the Giants' coaches that they wanted him to
show the other linemen how to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have some dogs up there on the line,'' Brown said.
``When I look at linemen, I look at build and temperament. I think
we have some of that. And with Ron Dayne running the ball, he
provides the force like an extra lineman. I call him R.D. There is
only one Barry Sanders, but R.D. has some of that Barry mystique.
He's got some quick feet on him. We've got the receivers and the
quarterback. We should be a scoring offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are counting on Lomas Brown to provide a lift. To
help give the team a face lift on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the type of player that even downfield I am there to pick
up my running back after a tackle,'' Brown said. ``At practice and
in games, I want guys whenever they get tired and feel like they
can't push any further to look over at me. I think they'll find me
doing the right things.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping to provide more Giants offensive personality and
presence. A welcome change. &QL;

<P>
   Lauriston Nunes takes sample SATs as if he was taking batting
practice, signing onto a Web site with practice questions a few
afternoons a week from his home near Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Chanel Meanor regularly startles awake past midnight, fretting
about overlapping assignments at her Silicon Valley school.
``Sometimes I'll wake up thinking something's due the next day,''
she said, ``and it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   After a Duke University basketball game a few months ago, Max
Mashore's father introduced him to a university admissions officer,
who told Max to take Spanish rather than Latin and sign up for
calculus as soon as possible at his school in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   These students have one thing in common: They are in
sixth-grade.
</P>
<P>
   On top of the timeless complications of being 12 years old, an
age of bubbling hormones and anti-authority stirrings,
sixth-graders today face a combination of pressures that their
parents never encountered.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how the country's continuing educational make-over
and the pace of U.S. society are transforming the lives of
students, The New York Times conducted round-table discussions over
the past six months with 221 sixth-graders, youngsters on the
bridge between childhood and adolescence. The conversations took
place at 21 schools _ public and private, cutthroat and coddling _
in 11 states and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews showed that with a college degree increasingly
seen as a prerequisite for a decent life _ and admission to
prestigious universities more competitive than ever _ higher
education has become a preoccupation for children even before they
reach puberty. At the same time, the students face new layers of
standardized tests that judge not only what they know _ and whether
they should be promoted _ but the performance of their teachers,
their schools and their towns.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the future of the nation's economy, U.S.
educators have over the past decade imported pages from the strict
curriculums of Asian schools and Europe's elite academies, imposing
the rigor and seriousness of high school on the lower grades.
Though the United States has surpassed its competitors
economically, public dissatisfaction with the preparation of U.S.
workers remains, heightening the hurdles for students.
</P>
<P>
   In this era of earlier and higher expectations, most of the
students interviewed said they were driven to excel by parents who
had seized on test scores and early college readiness as new
benchmarks for success.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the students suffer tension headaches and bouts of
anxiety, raising questions about the costs of growing up quickly.
But a number of the students embraced this intense focus on the
future, saying it gave more meaning and direction to their lives
than idle hours in front of the television.
</P>
<P>
   They drink in the challenges like a first sip of coffee, a
tantalizing if slightly bitter taste of adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to strive for stuff that I know I can't achieve right
now,'' said Yesenia Mendez, 13, of Boston. ``I read harder books
that I can't understand right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesenia attends the Academy of the Pacific Rim, a three-year-old
charter school that has adopted some Asian educational principles _
children take martial arts for gym, clean their own classrooms and
are often rewarded or disciplined as a group for an individual's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay in school longer than my mother goes to work
sometimes,'' Yesenia said of the 210-day calendar of classes
stretching from 8:05 a.m. to 4:10 p.m. ``I feel like I need to get
paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Though New York City's prestigious private schools are well
known for their pressure-cooker atmosphere, the interviews show
that similar stresses pervade students' lives regardless of
geography or socioeconomic station. In fact, students at the
nation's most expensive academies seemed among those most at ease,
perhaps confident that their course in life was assured.
</P>
<P>
   The level of anxiety prevalent in sixth-grade lunchrooms
appeared almost to grow in proportion to a school's distance from
the ivory towers of the Northeast. Middle-class children in
cookie-cutter subdivisions say they fear that attending no-name
local universities will consign them to mediocrity, while minority
students and those living in poverty are scrambling to prepare
themselves for any college, a path pursued by few of their
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   In affluent Newton, Mass., and suburban Orlando, Fla., children
are already drawing road maps to follow their parents' footsteps
into the Ivy League; in the hardscrabble neighborhoods of Milwaukee
and New York, there are also sixth &UR; - &LR; graders fixated on Harvard and
Yale as their ticket to surpass relatives who never finished high
school.
</P>
<P>
   At a Muslim school in Atlanta, just as at a Jewish school in Las
Vegas, preteen-age overachievers sweat even fractional fluctuations
in grade-point average. From Nogales, Ariz., on the Mexican border,
to East Palo Alto, Calif., a ghetto bordering the mansions of
Silicon Valley, tutors and resume-padding activities have
supplanted after-school play dates.
</P>
<P>
   That means 10 more years of hated piano lessons for Lucy
McDaniel, 12, whose mother tells her that music improves math
scores. ``I barely even get to go outside when I get home,'' said
Lucy, who attends the Westminster Schools in Atlanta, where tuition
is more than $12,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   As sixth-graders confront these challenges, they also worry that
the school shootings they see on television will invade their own
classrooms, and they are saddled with new responsibilities in
families overwhelmed by dual careers or damaged by divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Even educators are confounded by this precarious age. In some
districts, sixth-grade is elementary school's finale, with recess
and classrooms as comforting as warm milk; Elsewhere, it is the
opening act of middle school, where sixth-graders switch rooms for
every subject and fumble with locker combinations while jostled by
eighth-graders topping 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the setting, the sixth-grade curriculum is changing,
too, as teachers and parents push higher-level material like
geometry and geology, a trickle-down effect from high schools,
where enrollment in college-level advanced placement courses has
doubled over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much going on in sixth-grade,'' said Nora Farley,
12, of Pleasantville, N.Y., in Westchester County. ``It's all being
crammed in your brain. It's too much to take.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are sizable pockets of students at private and
public schools who say they feel little pressure in their lives,
and who have given no thought to college. But it was only at a
one-room schoolhouse in Montana that the sixth-graders _ both of
them _ seemed confused by the very notion of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Most schools were more like Mantua Elementary in Fairfax County,
Va., where the county requires a one-time class lesson on stress _
and how to deal with it _ for every sixth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to childhood?'' asked Ellen S. Schoetzau, 45,
Mantua's principal. ``The pressures on children are much greater
now than when I was teaching _ certainly than when I was in
school.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE VIEW: `IS THERE A BETTER SCHOOL THAN HARVARD?'
</P>
<P>
   One new chain of thought that runs nearly unbroken through
today's sixth-grade classrooms is the belief that a college degree
_ particularly a parchment from someplace with a pedigree _ comes
with a passkey to the good life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just see education as the way to get rich,'' said Keenan
Robinson, 12, the son of a tax appraiser and a secretary from
DeKalb County, Ga., outside Atlanta. ``You can't get a
multimillion-dollar entertainment company by being a bum on the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Keenan, who used to live in New York, wants to attend St. John's
University in Queens, N.Y. ``That's all that runs through my
mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With applications to four-year colleges, especially the most
selective, increasing every year, the intense competition over
admission is filtering all the way down to sixth-grade.
</P>
<P>
   Students like Keenan are not just ruminating about colleges;
they are researching them. In Las Vegas, Nogales, Atlanta and
Milwaukee, among other places, sixth-graders reported surfing
college home pages on the Web _ some with an eye on future majors,
others seeking scholarship opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really thinking so much about which college,'' said
Chelsea Hammack, 12, whose father is a Las Vegas police officer and
whose mother works in a casino. ``It's more, what am I going to do
when I get there?
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a while me and my parents talk about what I'm going to
take for my subject that could help me with the job I want to do,''
said Chelsea, an aspiring writer (``fiction, short stories,
mostly''). ``I want to take something I'm interested in, but not
something that's so easy I won't learn anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea has been using the Web to compare Brigham Young
University in Utah with a college in Hawaii. ``I'm sort of split
between the two,'' she said. ``I'm actually thinking of going to
UNLV for a year to get a better chance of getting into a good
school.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Lauriston Nunes, the 12-year-old Atlanta boy who
drills himself on the SATs, keeps going back to the Web site of the
College Board, www.collegeboard.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first few times I went there, I got every question
right,'' he said. ``It makes me feel smart. It lets me know that I
can do more than what I have to do right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauriston is already experimenting with a kind of higher
education: a school for models, Sundays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. ``I
like being on stage,'' he said. ``I like seeing people clap for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   For other students, particularly those with older siblings,
weekend activities include leafing through college guidebooks _ or
even visiting campuses. Kristen Summerall is getting advice from
her sister, a high school junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to Spelman, I wanted to go to Harvard,'' said
Kristen, 12, a 4.0 student at Stephenson Middle School outside
Atlanta. ``Then I was like, `Is there a school better than
Harvard?' She was like, `Its initials are MIT.' It's in Michigan or
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farthest I've ever been is Virginia,'' she added. ``I want
to see more of the United States. When I was little, I used to tell
my parents I wanted to leave the United States and go to school in
Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   Some children are clearly self-motivated, but more often the
prod is a parent or grandparent _ whose success in life has set an
example that students want to follow, or whose failures the
children hope to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Max Mashore's pilgrimages to Duke, his dad's alma mater, began
in second-grade. Max went to a basketball camp at Duke last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole year I've been thinking about college,'' said Max,
a B student at Sidwell Friends school in Washington who was wearing
his Duke sweatshirt, as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go to some small college in the middle of
Maine or something.'' he said. ``I heard someone say once, `C is
community college, B is state college, A is Ivy League school.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rahel Haile, 12, of the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in the
Bronx, said her parents, immigrants from Eritrea, were determined
that she achieve more than they have. Rahel's father, a grocery
store manager, went to Rutgers, but that ``isn't the best
college,'' Rahel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since third- and fifth-grade, I used to think I wanted to go
to Harvard, Harvard, Harvard,'' she said. ``I was looking at
Harvard. I don't want to sound harsh, but Harvard was just too
preppy for me. I'd rather go to NYU.''
</P>
<P>
   One might expect students at Fieldston, a feeder school to the
Ivy League, to have a college focus _ though perhaps not at age 12.
But what is striking is the nervous attention to college admission
_ fed by misinformation _ in schools elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth-graders in suburban Washington, Las Vegas, Nogales and
East Palo Alto all believe, mistakenly, that colleges will examine
elementary school transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to Stanford, they might look at your records and see
if you've been bad,'' said Tuuta Tuipulotu, 11, who is worried that
his one-day suspension at his northern California school, for
fighting, might result in a rejection letter.
</P>
<P>
   For the college class of 2010, it seems, it is never too early
to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Ivy League schools, my dad always says that to get
into them, it's like a race,'' said Joshua Bordin, 12, the son of a
Pleasantville businessman and nursery school teacher. ``Let's say
we could put the whole grade in a race. People have to fall. People
have to stop to tie a shoe. But if you keep getting good grades,
you race and race to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE TESTS: `I'M WORRIED IF I'LL GET HELD BACK'
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, it is AIMS. In Massachusetts, MCAS. Florida has the
FCAT. Virginia, the SOL. In East Palo Alto, there is the SAT-9 and
the R-SAT. Las Vegas spells it out: Terra Nova, which greets
sixth-graders just a month after they arrive at middle school.
</P>
<P>
   They are the standardized tests beloved by politicians, business
leaders and those who call themselves education reformers, and they
have sixth-graders nationwide chewing on their No. 2 pencils. The
tests are part of a concerted effort to elevate achievement,
leaving students far more worried than their predecessors that poor
marks could land them in remedial classes, in summer school or even
back to suffer sixth-grade all over again next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can feel the pressure,'' said Mark A. Valenzuela, the
principal of Desert Shadows Middle School in Nogales, ``from
teachers, administrators, parents, older siblings _ from older
students in the school.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be two years before Nogales sixth-graders face the new
state tests, the Arizona Instrument to Measure Standards, and four
years before they take a math exam required for a high school
diploma. Still, Valenzuela convened an assembly this spring to tell
sixth-graders, many of them the children of truckers and
distributors in the tomato industry, that their homework today is
critical to their AIMS performance.
</P>
<P>
   To Ben Larriva, 11, such warnings echo the daily mantra from his
teachers: ``This will be on the AIMS test.'' Ben, whose parents
unplug his computer if he slips off the honor roll, is warily
watching his brother's experience in eighth-grade. ``He can't keep
up,'' Ben said.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is more immediate at the Menlo Oaks School, where
the have-nots of Silicon Valley must pass a standardized state test
in three subjects to be promoted and take the Ravenswood Stanford
Achievement Tests, a set of district exams, for three days each
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I take a test, I get nervous,'' said Jeremiah
Sagote, 11, the son of a truck mechanic and a store clerk from
Samoa. ``Not like a spelling test _ I don't get nervous on those.
Like the R-SAT test. I'm worried if I'll get held back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah's expression of concern about promotion was repeated by
sixth-graders across the country. And, with scores published in
local newspapers, students in several districts said they were also
anxious about what the tests meant for the teachers they love (or
hate).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes the teachers have the tendency to stress
them out,'' said Clara Rice, the principal at Menlo Oaks. ``Because
the teachers will look bad if the students don't do well. Their
jobs are on the line. The principal's job. And the
superintendent's.''
</P>
<P>
   Private schools are not immune, either. At Fieldston,
sixth-graders have been taking standardized tests since
kindergarten, and they were frazzled by a recent math exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 30 minutes to do this test, which means we had like a
minute and five seconds to do each problem,'' Joseph DeJesus, 12,
said. ``Most of those problems took two to three minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Russo, 12, another Fieldston student, said he felt as if
he was being used. ``You think they could come up with a better way
to figure out if the teachers are doing their jobs correctly,''
Rocky said.
</P>
<P>
   In Fairfax County, students expressed frustration that a test on
Virginia history had squeezed other educational activities out of
the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to have an archaeological dig, make artifacts
and bury them, and another class would dig them up, and it would be
really cool,'' said Monica Kumar, 11, a student at Mantua
Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Monica's class spent two weeks reviewing for Virginia's
Standards of Learning test. ``The teachers stuck note cards from
every single event _ from when Jamestown was founded to Arthur Ashe
winning tennis tournaments _ they put them all around the walls,''
said Meredith Keller, 12, a classmate.
</P>
<P>
   With stakes so high, grades now count more than ever.
</P>

   ``I got a B on a homework assignment,'' said Julia Cohen of
Newton, Mass., a Boston suburb known for its stellar schools. ``It,
like, ruined it. I couldn't say I'd gotten all A's. Everyone was
making fun of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to get A's, then you might as well get them
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, many families have devised intricate incentive
plans borrowed from corporate America and pegged to even the most
mundane assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Lipinski of San Carlos, Calif., used to write one-sentence
responses to homework questions. Then his mother, an emergency
medical technician, started paying him 2 cents per word. Now, Jon
says he can pull down ``6 bucks'' an essay. His mother also pays 10
cents for every page he reads, and Jon says he is owed $44.

   At Sidwell Friends, where Chelsea Clinton is an alumna, Cameron
Pastrick is striving to reach a B average by employing tutors four
afternoons a week. To stay focused while doing her homework, she
uses an egg timer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom's always like, I can't get you any more tutors, unless
you want one Friday and Saturday and Sunday,'' said Cameron, who
has had tutors since third-grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom went here. Whenever I bring home, like, a C, she's
like, `When I was your age, I got an A,''' Cameron said. ``I keep
telling them this, and they say, `We don't pressure you, we
encourage you.'''

 &HT;    Early reports indicate structural problems caused terrace
collapse with 1 dead, 75 injured
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey

<P>
   MIDDLE BASS ISLAND, Ohio _ The parties had just started warming
up when the music stopped at 4:45 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A terrace overlooking Lake Erie at the Lonz Winery, crowded with
about 100 people, collapsed in an instant, falling 18 feet into an
old wine cellar and killing one Columbus man. At least 75 people
were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report indicates a structural problem, rather than
overloading, caused the collapse, said Ottowa County Sheriff Craig
Emahiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``An engineer got a quick look last night and said it looked
like a failed beam,'' Emahiser said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Reighard, 29, of Columbus was dead at the scene when
paramedics arrived, after crossing about four miles of water by
boat and helicopter to get to the island.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 people remained hospitalized Sunday, most in stable or
serious condition, at hospitals in Port Clinton, Sandusky, Toledo
and Cleveland. One was in critical but stable condition at St.
Vincent Medical Center in Toledo, according to Ottawa County
Sheriff Craig Emahiser. Names and hometowns of the injured were not
available at press time.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday police tape ringed the winery as detectives and civil
engineers looked for a cause of the accident, the worst in the
popular recreational area since the landmark Beer Barrel restaurant
burned to the ground in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators picked their way through giant chunks of
concrete, twisted metal, dust and dirt in the cellar, out of sight
of onlookers watching from the land and boats. The cellar
underneath the 20- by 25-foot terrace was empty except for some old
wine casks.
</P>
<P>
   The Lonz winery was originally constructed in 1870 and was
remodeled, with the addition of the terrace overlooking Lake Erie
in the 1960s, according to Put-In-Bay Police Chief Jim Lang.
</P>
<P>
   In the moments before the accident, people were singing the
Three Dog Night song, ``Joy to the World,'' said piano player Larry
Read. He was taking a break from the piano, turning it over to
Darrell Wallace of Columbus, when the terrace collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came running up and said, 'Stop playing, the terrace just
collapsed,''' said Read, who has played the piano for revelers at
the winery for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked down and there was this big hole,'' Read said. ``The
people down there seemed to be moving in slow motion. There was
blood everywhere. It was absolutely silent.''
</P>
<P>
   Read said that Lonz management and staff and patrons started a
line passing water and ice to the injured. A staff member made the
911 call. By the time emergency crews arrived 10 minutes later,
patrons had pulled the victims free of the debris in the cellar,
said Put-in-Bay Fire Chief Mark Wilhelm.
</P>
<P>
   Middle Bass Island has just one ambulance and no hospital.
Rescue crews were called in from Toledo and other areas to help.
The most seriously wounded were flown to St. Vincent Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Jet Express, which normally ferries people to Put-In-Bay on
South Bass Island, diverted its course to Middle Bass to help
evacuate the less seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were lots of broken bones,'' said Jet Express Captain
Joe Lamb.
</P>
<P>
   After emergency squads removed the last of the victims, Read
said the 70 to 80 customers who stayed and helped all stood and
recited the Lord's Prayer late into the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing you can say is to be thankful everyone wasn't
killed,'' Read said.
</P>
<P>
   A man, who asked not to be named, said that five of his friends
were injured. ``Four are still in the hospital, one is very
serious,'' he said. He said his friends injuries included a
fractured eye socket, pierced lung and kidney, broken ribs and a
broken pelvis.
</P>
<P>
   The 120-acre Lonz Winery, owned by Paramount Distilleries Inc.,
has been closed indefinitely.

   THE OUTSIDE FORCES: `SOMEONE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BRING A GUN TO
SCHOOL.'
</P>
<P>
   As high academic expectations hang over their young lives, this
year's sixth-graders have been distracted by outside forces that
did not buffet their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Five months after the massacre at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., Mia Grill stayed home from the first day at
Molasky Middle School in Las Vegas. She was nervous that it would
prove more violent than her elementary school because the pupils
were older.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom, she said not to worry,'' said Mia, 12, whose parents
sell tile. ``I'm still worried. Sooner or later, someone's probably
going to bring a gun to school.''
</P>
<P>
   In the New York borough of Queens, Christopher Bennett's mind
sometimes fills with doomsday scenarios as he moves through the
hallways of Public School 21, a tan-brick box of an elementary
school crammed with Eastern European and Asian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we do a silent meeting after lunch,'' said Chris, 11, ``I
always look at the door and imagine someone big and dressed all in
black coming through.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, though, the classroom is a respite from home lives
rendered turbulent by parents' work schedules or divorce.
</P>
<P>
   A cog in an increasingly mobile work force, Suzannah Mullen's
mother has been shuttled through four states in recent years, often
starting new jobs before her family can catch up. Suzannah, 11, and
her older sister stayed with their father in the Orlando suburbs
this spring while her mother, a human resources administrator,
commuted to Charlotte, N.C. ``Sometimes, I kind of search my house
for my mom and it's like, `Oh, she's in North Carolina,''' Suzannah
said.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin Vega lives with his mother in Milwaukee, but said he
might as well live alone. While Joaquin likes the DVD player and
big-screen television paid for by his mother's job at a car
dealership, he said those gifts ``can't pay for the time she's
gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like her to help me with my homework,'' Joaquin said,
adding that he has never met his father. ``If we have teacher
conferences, she can't come. I was on the basketball team. I got
first place, and she couldn't come to the ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   Kayleigh Wittman, 12, of Altamonte Springs, Fla., who is also a
child of divorce, gets a fat monthly allowance of $110 _ but she
said that had to cover all her expenses, from shampoo to school
supplies to tithing and saving for college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write down how much money I use, and what I use it on,'' she
said. When Kayleigh worried aloud about paying for her future
education, saying she expects no further subsidy from her family, a
classmate seated nearby wondered, ``Why don't you just save all
your money for college?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' Kayleigh said, ``I have to pay for lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   THE TOLL: SLEEPING BRINGS HER ONLY STRESS-FREE TIME
</P>
<P>
   At Mantua Elementary, a red-brick school a few miles down a
wooded road from Prosperity Avenue in Fairfax, Va., stress is part
of the curriculum: the county mandates a lesson on the subject for
every sixth-grade class.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent session, Suzzette Rodriguez's students easily
defined the word. ``A thought or something that you think about
that causes strain on your mind,'' Matt Wong explained. ``On your
body, too. Say you have a big test coming up. Your body stiffens.''
</P>
<P>
   But, echoing some educators, Jenny Drenkard said, ``A little bit
of stress is probably actually good for you. You shouldn't be so
laid-back that nothing matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranking the stresses in their lives on work sheets, most of the
students placed school difficulties and divorced parents highest.
(One boy offered a write-in candidate: ``Girls in general.'') When
talking in groups about their most stressful situations, every
cluster of children picked tests. As for the side effects, they
listed headaches, queasiness, anger, depression, insomnia,
exhaustion, lack of appetite and butterflies in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   At the San Carlos Charter Learning Center, an alternative public
school in the Silicon Valley that does not use letter grades, many
of the 15 students interviewed, including Chanel Meanor, said they
had at least two bouts of sleeplessness a month because of pending
schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
   A coast away in Atlanta, John Hobart said that while baseball
was ``probably my favorite thing in the world to do,'' he had so
much homework this year that ``I get really excited when I don't
have practice because I can relax.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sonia Dahliwal, a student at Teague Middle School in
Altamonte Springs, Fla., is so desperate to get into the English
class for gifted students that it is starting to show. ``As you can
see I don't like eating,'' Sonia, 13, said with a sour face. ``I
have better things to do than put stuff in my mouth and chew.''
</P>
<P>
   At Oaklands Elementary in Prince George's County, Md., Calisa
Carter just dreams, every day, about being back in fifth-grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time that I don't feel stressed out is nighttime,''
she said, ``when I'm sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as Calisa yearns for the past, other sixth-graders are
already looking beyond the summer to the fall _ and the pressures
next year will bring.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Park, 12, of Queens, recently toured her new junior high
school, No. 185, near the elementary school that has been her
security blanket, P.S. 21. ``I heard a group of people there
saying, `I can't wait till Freshman Friday,''' she said. ``I think
they beat you up.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, the new school year will be filled with firsts:
foreign language instruction, math and English classes sifted by
students' academic abilities and junior varsity athletic tryouts.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bartomioli, 12, plans to play football, which means he
will be required to attend practice daily until dusk even though he
is very likely to warm the bench behind the bigger boys on the
roster. He is already worried about starting his homework _ sure to
be heavier _ three hours later than he did this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard seventh-grade is the hardest grade,'' Michael said.

 &HT;    The invisible superstar
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He shares an apartment with his brother and mother,
spends hours playing video games in the clubhouse and seems
invisible to most of America.
</P>
<P>
   But Braves fans should learn this week what most French-speaking
Canadians already know: Montreal Expos outfielder Vladimir Guerrero
might be the best player in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the future superstar of this game,'' Chicago Cubs first
baseman Mark Grace said. ``He's the total package. He's a fabulous
right fielder, he's got a strong arm, and he's got great speed.
There's not one weakness in his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero, 24, enters this week's four-game series at Turner
Field among the National League leaders in nearly every offensive
category. Through 77 games, he is hitting .365 with 22 homers and
68 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe God reached out with a finger and touched him and
said, `You are a baseball player,' '' Expos outfielder Rondell
White said. ``He's blessed. God gave him everything to be a
baseball player. He's the best in the game _ by far.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Guerrero has played his first three seasons in the majors
in relative obscurity. He is the superstar television forgot as the
Expos aren't scheduled for any national telecasts in the U.S. this
season. Even the English-speaking citizens of Montreal are left to
watch only highlights of him _ the Expos don't have a local
television broadcast that comes with play-by-play in English.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero's inability to speak English and his natural shyness
have added to his obscurity. He speaks only Spanish and is
reluctant to be interviewed by the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Seattle when Ken Griffey Jr. first came into the
majors,'' Expos general manager Jim Beattie said, ``and they said
the same thing about Junior. They thought he was being overlooked
because he played in the northwest corner of the country and no one
ever saw him play. (Vladimir) will get his. Eventually, everyone
will know who he is, just like Griffey.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero is one of nine children raised on a farm in the
Dominican Republic. His father was a farmer and his mother a
housewife, until she moved to Montreal to join Guerrero and his
brother Wilton, an infielder for the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero dropped out of school before he was a teenager
and became a fisherman. At 16, he was invited to an extended tryout
by the Dodgers, who had signed Wilton two years earlier and another
older brother, Albino, before that. But Vladimir was sent home
after only eight weeks into the team's Dominican academy.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero got another tryout with the Rangers in 1992, but their
scouts reached the same conclusion as the Dodgers _ he was a slow
player with too long of a swing.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Ferreira, a Latin America scout for the Expos, gave
Guerrero another chance in February 1993 when he invited the
17-year-old to a tryout with 25 other players.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero hitched a ride on the back of a motorcycle and borrowed
spikes that didn't match, stuffing a sock into a shoe that was too
big. He pulled his hamstring after only one at-bat, but Ferreira
still gave him a $2,000 signing bonus and a minor-league contract.
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira might have been the first to notice Guerrero's
free-swinging hitting skills, which now have teammates and
opponents shaking their heads in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got tremendous plate coverage, both inside and outside,''
Cubs pitcher Rick Aguilera said. ``You think you've got a ball far
enough inside or far enough off the plate and he still seems to get
the bat on it. It's pretty incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pitch around him,'' Grace said. ``If you think
you've thrown the ball a foot outside, he whacks it. If you throw
it neck-high, he whacks it. I've never seen anything like it. He's
an amazing hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in his second full season in the majors, Guerrero
became only the fourth player in history to hit more than 30 home
runs and drive in more than 130 runs twice before the age of 24.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also are impressed with his arm, which some have
called the strongest in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Vladimir is in the game, you've got to be careful on the
bases,'' Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa said. ``He has a rocket.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 3 and 205 pounds, Guerrero also has a tremendously
long stride and good speed. But he's still learning how to steal
bases and needs to improve his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like his durability,'' Expos manager Felipe Alou said. ``He
shows up every day to play nine innings. He's a good late-inning
hitter. I know from when I played there are players who do get
tired. But he gets better as the game progresses, and he gets
better as the season progresses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Expos are betting that Guerrero improves as his career
progresses. But unlike Andres Galarraga, Larry Walker and Pedro
Martinez, who were all traded by the Expos before the prime of
their careers, the team is adamant that it'll keep Guerrero, who
has three years left on a five-year, $28 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's for real,'' Alou said. ``At this age, I haven't had
anybody better. Before a player like him is let go, the team itself
will go. If a guy like that is going to be moved, you might as well
pack the last baseball and the last fungo and move the whole
thing.''

SOME THINGS ABOUT SIXTH-GRADE HAVEN'T CHANGED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ga., Va., Ariz., Md., Fla.)  (With 6TH-GRADE-PRESSURES)  
 By JACQUES STEINBERG and JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raychelle Burwell and this boy were going out. They did not
actually go anywhere, of course. Just talked on the phone, passed
notes in class. Locked eyes. Held hands.
</P>
<P>
   But all their friends at the Academy of the Pacific Rim, a
charter school in the Hyde Park section of Boston, thought they
should kiss. On the lips. ``They pressured me so much,'' Raychelle
recalled. ``I was like, `No, no. ...'''
</P>
<P>
   Then one day Raychelle's sixth-grade class found itself alone in
the room, waiting for the teacher. She was out of excuses. Their
mouths met.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you know, the teacher walked in the classroom,''
Raychelle said, horrified even in the retelling. The 13-year-old
girl landed in front of the principal, who called her grandmother.
``I broke up,'' Raychelle said, ``because I figured he was bad
luck.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the more familiar pressures of sixth-grade, the
backdrop against which the new stresses from standardized tests and
college competition are set.
</P>
<P>
   There are raging hormones and new responsibilities, the fading
of old friendships and the unspoken formation of cliques. All of a
sudden, appearance counts. Girls are trying on bras, some getting
their periods. Boys, meanwhile, eagerly await promised growth
spurts. Peer pressure, whether to smoke or to cheat _ or just to
fit in _ is ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not a baby anymore,'' said Ebony Rosser, 12, a student
at Stephenson Middle School in DeKalb County, Ga., outside Atlanta.
``You're getting more experiences. Nobody's going to take you by
the hand.''
</P>
<P>
   They are reluctant romantics. On the one hand, sixth &UR; - &LR; graders
long for the simplicity of kindergarten, when, as Meredith Keller
of Fairfax County, Va., put it, the only thing anyone fought over
was who got the green crayon. At the same time, they are newly
curious about each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk down the hall, you see couples everywhere,'' Diane
Robles, 11, said of her middle school, Desert Shadows, on the
border with Mexico in Nogales, Ariz. Diane has even heard about a
relationship between a sixth-grader and an eighth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about to go very far,'' she said. ``Then they broke
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy-girl parties have begun, and truth or dare is alive and
well. In Queens, students were worried that on a coming school trip
to Hot Skates, a Long Island roller rink, you could not skate
without a date.
</P>
<P>
   The first French kiss, however awkward, remains a sixth-grade
institution _ but not for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had somebody,'' lamented Sean Ellis, Diane's
classmate at Desert Shadows.
</P>
<P>
   The budding relationships, such as they are, sometimes poison
longtime friendships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Patrick and Suzy's case,'' said Toni Grdovic, 12, who
attends Public School 21 in Flushing, Queens. ``They've been going
out for four months. And I think Tiffany did something with
Patrick.'' One morning before the bell, the girls hurled curses,
and a school security guard had to break things up. ``People were
screaming `Jerry, Jerry,' as if it was `The Jerry Springer Show,'''
Toni recalled.
</P>
<P>
   In sixth-grade, popularity is a varsity sport.
</P>
<P>
   At Oaklands Elementary in Prince George's County, Md., the boys
rate the girls, 1 to 10, and the 9s and 10s rule the school. It is
mostly about looks, but sense of humor counts. Elsewhere, the rich
kids with their Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch shirts are in charge. The
smartest students, once admired, begin their descent into geekdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's dorks and there's cool people,'' said Matthew
Goldstein, 12, of Teague Middle School in Altamonte Springs, Fla.,
outside Orlando. ``Before it was just you're friends with
whoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey Carmen's eyes were sad behind her glasses as she talked
about being picked on and left out. ``It's so difficult not being
popular,'' said Lindsey, an Oaklands student. ``It's one of the
most depressing things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of learning,'' Lindsey continued, ``that if they
don't like me the way I am, they can find their own friends.''

SPORTS COLUMN: BRAVES RECOVER IN METS' FANTASYLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After the Mets shocked the Atlanta Braves with their
incredible 10-run comeback Friday night and their early assault on
Greg Maddux Saturday, some of their fans created The Fantasy. The
Mets would win again Sunday, supplant the Braves in first place by
two percentage points and never look back.
</P>
<P>
   As if they were pricking a balloon with a pin, the Braves
shattered The Fantasy. By perpetrating a battering of their own,
the Braves retained their lead in the National League East and
served notice that they were not prepared to participate in a
changing of the guard just yet. The Mets will have to work harder
to deprive the Braves of their ninth consecutive division
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a reality and probably makes more sense than
not,'' said John Schuerholz, the Braves' general manager,
addressing the possibility of the streak ending. ``Who would ever
imagine a string this long occurring in this environment. If it was
that easy, a lot of clubs would have done it, at least a couple
others. I'm not saying as a result of how we're struggling that I
think it will end; I don't believe that. I think we're still as
strong as you need to be to win our division. But that's a
reasonable assumption to make, that some day this remarkable streak
will end. I'm just not prepared to concede that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at recent history:
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Aug. 22 last year, with only six weeks to
play, the Mets were in first place, leading the Braves by the same
two percentage points that would have served as a lead had they won
Sunday. Later that day the Mets won the first game of a
doubleheader with St. Louis. But Billy Taylor and Chuck McElroy
combined to botch the second game, and with the Braves beating San
Diego, the Mets' ephemeral tenure at the top evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   They would lose five of six games with the Braves the following
month, and they would be left to scamper for the playoffs as a
wild-card team.
</P>
<P>
   Until they demonstrate otherwise, the Mets are in that position
again this season. If they believe the Braves are vulnerable,
perhaps because the game's most vaunted pitching staff has
developed creaks and cracks, they need only to look within to see
similar shortcomings of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza, the league's most valuable player the first half of
the season, shunned a long-term view of the season in favor of
focusing on a positive development in the four-game series just
concluded, the last-game loss notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the Mets' experience with the Braves the past couple
of seasons, Piazza said: ``Since I've been here we just haven't
been able to get over a hump against them during the regular
season. It wasn't a goal to come in and establish that we can beat
this ball club. We just wanted to come in and play them better
during the regular season. Now we don't have to feel we have to
press against them. I think that's what we've done in the past.
We've come out and played tight. Now maybe psychologically we don't
have to feel we have to get a monkey off our back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were genuinely jolted by developments Friday night
and in the Saturday carryover. Not that another loss Sunday would
have sent them screaming out of Shea Stadium, but winning was
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we were going to go home tied or we were going to go
home two games up,'' said Tom Glavine, who limited the upstart Mets
to two runs and five hits in seven innings. ``We didn't want to go
home tied. From that standpoint it was a big game for us, but it's
still way too early to get overly excited about what did or didn't
happen. We're just at the halfway point of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine had the Mets shut out on two singles until Piazza
unloaded a one-out home run in the seventh inning that extended his
runs-batted-in streak to 15 games. Glavine's performance was the
kind he and Greg Maddux have produced frequently during the Braves'
championship seasons, the kind that let would-be dethroners know it
wasn't time.
</P>
<P>
   If the Braves' pitching staff is beginning to show cracks, a
result of injuries more than any other factor, it is to be
remembered that other teams have larger pitching problems and they
don't have Glavine and Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at our problems,'' Schuerholz said, ``and we have
these two cornerstones upon which to remedy them. It's pretty
comforting. The reality is that someday this comes to an end. The
way this roster looked this winter after it was assembled, we
didn't anticipate, and still don't, that it would be this year.
We're going through a tough time right now. It's frustrating and
it's sometimes aggravating, but it doesn't give me any trepidation
about our ability to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' pitching problems reached the depth Sunday where
they had to summon two unheralded pitchers from the minor leagues,
Dave Stevens and Ismael Villegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need somebody with a fresh arm,'' Manager Bobby Cox said.
``We have only one other guy, Jason Marquis. We want him to save
the game if we need him to.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine saw to it that Cox didn't need Stevens or Villegas.
Marquis, a rookie from Staten Island, pitched the last two innings
and allowed the Mets no hits, sending the team to Atlanta in first
place. That is, after all, the home of the Braves. &QL;

 &HT;    Rookie appointed in high-profile case
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Having just seen his client convicted, the young
lawyer left the courtroom and walked into yet another body blow.
</P>
<P>
   A stern-faced juror in the hallway told him: ``We thought you
could have done more work. You stumbled sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' sighed the blond-haired lawyer, ``it's my first jury
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Earwood isn't smooth yet. But that's not surprising. A
few weeks ago he was a law clerk in the Bartow County courthouse,
assisting the judges, digging into case law, at times feeling like
the office gofer wearing a ``Junior Lawyer'' badge.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly the 26-year-old had his own office in the
Cartersville, Ga. law firm of Harris and Helton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was strange,'' said Earwood, sitting behind his desk,
wearing the lawyer's standard _ a blue pinstripe suit. ``On Friday
I was a law clerk and then on Monday I was trying cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, inexperienced, still crafting a courtroom style, Earwood
knows he is not a defendant's dream attorney. ``I'm a work in
progress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd ``Bo'' Riddle knows it too. Riddle's 14-year-old son,
Thomas, has been charged with murder as an adult in the May 21
shooting of another boy. After the Riddle family saw they could not
afford a lawyer, the court appointed Earwood to represent the
eighth-grader, at no cost to them. Bo Riddle had hoped he could pay
a law firm out of his own pocket, thinking they would work harder
for his son. Now he is not only getting a public defender, but a
rookie.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bo Riddle has been pleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's called me and gone over quite a few things,'' Riddle
said. ``He does seem to have an interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Earwood, for his part, is taking great care with the
high-profile case, bouncing ideas off the firm's senior lawyers,
talking it over with his wife, weathering some sleepless nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I'm scared. I don't want to make a mistake,'' said
Earwood of his first big case. ``There's a lot at stake for
Thomas.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot at stake for Earwood, as well. If he wins, he
could score some hot-shot credentials. A failure, though, would be
long remembered.
</P>
<P>
   In their first meeting, Thomas Riddle told his lawyer that the
shooting was just an accident, that all the boys were playing with
the gun, that he didn't mean to kill 13-year-old Michael Wilbanks.
``He said that over and over - It was an accident,'' recalled
Earwood.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas remains locked up. Earwood's attempt at obtaining an
affordable bail failed; the judge set bond at $100,000. For the
next few weeks, the case remains in limbo while the district
attorney and judge decide whether to bump it down to juvenile
court, where the penalties drop significantly.
</P>
<P>
   But the media attention continues. Fresh into the big leagues,
Earwood has seen his face on the nightly news, his name under
banner headlines. Just the other day the news program ``20/20''
called him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stressful,'' he said. But he prides himself on keeping
his cool. Not one to deliver podium-pounding closing arguments, he
believes a jury should be reasoned with, that when you lose your
head in court, you lose, period.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true for anything,'' he said. ``Most mistakes occur
when people get too emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a philosophy that has served him well.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a department store manager, the even-tempered middle
child of three boys grew up in a small town in northwest North
Carolina, not far from the mountains. In Fairview, there were no
traffic lights, and his television had only two channels.
</P>
<P>
   So he loves to talk; ``If anything, I tend to ramble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing college as an economics major with a B average, he had
no plans for the future. But he'd always had a good memory, and the
ability to rise to an occasion. A friend was taking the entrance
test for law school and urged his soft-spoken buddy to give it a
shot. Earwood did, and did well. His friend choose another career
path.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating the University of Georgia Law School, Earwood
landed the job as a law clerk in the Bartow County courthouse.
While most law school grads head straight into private practice,
his unusual job choice has paid off. After two years of hustling
around this three-story courthouse - running down some court brief
for this judge, fetching a law book for another - he has earned the
good graces of the stewards who run this place.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just fit right in,'' said Melissa Walker, a judge's
secretary who acknowledged that when it comes to the fledgling law
clerks, ``I just sort of mother these folks.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, as Earwood strolls the hallways in a crisp blue suit
carrying his brown leather attache case, court deputy Bob Cauley
teases him, the secretaries make sure he has all his paperwork, and
the judges _ well, he keeps feeling like he's trying cases in front
of his dad.
</P>
<P>
   Earwood's first appearance before a jury was assisting on a case
a month ago in which a man was accused of fondling a child. The man
had denied every allegation to the police, only to finish by saying
that he did indeed touch the girl. To police, that's pretty much a
confession on a silver platter. But Earwood and his fellow attorney
argued that the touching was not intended to satisfy any sexual
desire. The jury set the man free.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty shocked,'' Earwood said.``It just goes to show,
you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest trial - the one in which the juror gave him a piece
of his mind - didn't fare as well. For the first time, Earwood was
on his own, presenting the entire case to a jury. He defended an
accused child molester, Charles Hudson, a 45-year-old man with
intense look and a habit of mumbling when he speaks. The biggest
hurdle was the videotaped police interviews with the two little
girls. The oldest, a frail-voiced 8 year old, cried as she pointed
out the places she had been touched.
</P>
<P>
   He may not get jittery, but Earwood gets nervous. While waiting
for the jury to render a decision in the fondling case, he sat in
the hallway across from the courtroom. Each time the door opened,
he was startled.
</P>
<P>
   But even these seemingly empty hours were not wasted. An older
attorney came over and passed on a tidbit of local lawyerly advice:
A courthouse secretary meets her old friends for lunch at Wendy's.
These women know everything about everybody in Cartersville. ``So
just bring your list of prospective jurors down to Wendy's,`` he
said, ``and they'll give you the rundown on every one of those
people.''
</P>
<P>
   As the jury returned to the courtroom, he watched whether any
glanced at the defendant. That's a trick he learned as a clerk
watching some 60 jury trials. If the jurors avoid the gaze of the
defendant, there's a good chance they've found him guilty.
</P>
<P>
   A few jurors stole some quick glances. The jury foreman
announced they had found the man guilty of three of the six charges
of child molestation.
</P>
<P>
   Outside in the sunlight, Earwood talked about the criticism from
the juror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did stumble,'' he said. ``I know I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking out loud, he wondered what else he might have done.
Maybe he should have focused more on one of the defendant's
excuses. But that probably wouldn't have mattered, he said,
considering the girl's tears.
</P>
<P>
   Learning to lose can be tough for a lawyer. But Earwood has
adopted a remarkably patient, if not forbearing, attitude toward
himself as he comes of age as an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a while,'' he added, ``before I'm smooth.''

A FRENZIED WEEKEND LIES AHEAD FOR FOURTH BOOK IN HARRY POTTER
SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., name Sage-EL in last graf is CQ) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Planes gliding over beaches on Long Island and the
Jersey Shore as well as in Los Angeles, Chicago and Hilton Head,
S.C., will carry banners this coming Saturday reading, ```Harry
Potter and the Goblet of Fire.' Read it Now!''
</P>
<P>
   At least 9,000 Federal Express trucks will be deployed around
the nation on that morning by Amazon.com to help deliver 250,000
presold copies of the fantasy novel.
</P>
<P>
   The Jumbotron screen in Times Square will herald the birth of
the fourth book in the hugely successful Harry Potter series about
an orphaned boy with wizard powers.
</P>
<P>
   And the staff at the Blue Marble bookshop in Fort Thomas, Ky.,
will dress up like wizards and witches and begin doling out
cinnamon oatmeal from a black cauldron at 6 a.m. to waiting
families. Compared with hundreds of other bookstores around the
nation, that's late. By all accounts there will be tens of
thousands of sleepless children and parents _ perhaps many more _
showing up in bookstores late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:01 a.m. Saturday, when the novel by the author of the
series, J.K. Rowling, officially goes on sale, small independent
bookshops and selected stores in chains like Borders are opening
their doors to Harry Potter theme parties with magic shows, costume
parties featuring characters from the book, stuffed and even live
owls, who are messengers in the novels, and at the Tattered Cover
bookstore in Denver, a brew of ginger ale and apple juice on dry
ice to imitate Harry's favorite butter bee.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are frenzied out there about this book,'' said Richard
Klein, owner with his brother, Bob, of the Book Revue in
Huntington, N.Y., one of the biggest independent bookstores in the
region. This Long Island shop already has an unusually high number
of copies of the book reserved _ 500 _ and the staff will unpack
hundreds of others just after midnight during a children's party at
the store. ``I have never seen anything like this,'' Richard Klein
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has anyone else in the publishing business.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first ``Harry Potter'' was published by Scholastic in
the United States in 1998, the series by Rowling has sold nearly 21
million copies, including the paperback of the first novel, ``Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.'' The other novels are ``Harry
Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' and ``Harry Potter and the
Prisoner of Azkaban.'' The newest ``Harry Potter,'' a 752-page
book, will be published simultaneously in the United States and
Britain with a first printing of 3.8 million copies in America, a
record. The books have been translated into 35 languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anticipation is beyond anything we imagined,'' said
Michael Jacobs, a senior vice president at Scholastic and the
executive in charge of marketing. ``The book has crossed over and
is now being read by adults now as well as children. The
anticipation has allowed us to have the biggest first printing in
the history of trade publishing.''
</P>
<P>
   The anticipation has also led to even more bruised relations
between bookstores and their main competitor, Internet retailers
like Amazon.com, which was allowed to essentially break the embargo
and open book crates on Friday to ship them by Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   More important, beyond the promotion and hoopla generated by
Scholastic, the book and its accompanying huge audio sale by Random
House's Listening Library has led, say various booksellers, to a
remarkable resurgence of interest in books among children in
elementary and middle schools who have previously ignored reading
in favor of the Internet, video games and watching television.
</P>
<P>
   What is fueling the instant success of the new book is a shrewd
campaign by Scholastic _ and, for that matter, Rowling, who is
involved in the marketing _ to keep everything about it secret
including the plot and the title. It was only after the title was
printed in the British press that Scholastic acknowledged it. In
keeping the book embargoed and under military-style secrecy,
Scholastic drew even more attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each book has just ratcheted up the anticipation for the next
one,'' said Jacobs of Scholastic. ``We wanted very much to have a
specific on-sale date. We felt we could build anticipation to a
certain frenzy. As soon as kids finished book three, they were
waiting for the next one. If there was one date, we knew we could
drive a lot of the anticipation, the advanced sales and give
booksellers a chance to promote it.''
</P>
<P>
   And they have. At the Politics and Prose bookstore in
Washington, Susan Dexter, who works in the children's department,
said many parents had told her that they were showing up with their
children at midnight on Friday to buy the book. ``The more I hear,
the more I know there's going to be a crowd,'' said Dexter, who
recalled the visit of Rowling for a book-signing in the late
afternoon last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``People started lining up early in the morning,'' she said.
``It was like a Rolling Stones concert.''

METS' STANDING DOES NOT CHANGE BUT THEIR ATTITUDE DOES 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets will meet the Atlanta Braves in less than
three weeks, and perhaps by then the standing will have changed.
The Braves won Sunday at Shea Stadium, 10-2, to split the four-game
series and maintain their two-game lead over the Mets in the
National League East.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is an important difference in the way the Mets
now see their biggest rival. In future meetings, Mike Piazza is
certain, the Mets will not press. These games are not so much about
the Braves, he said, as they are about the Mets themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happened is, we just felt like it didn't really
matter who we were playing,'' Piazza said. ``I don't think we
really saw them as the Braves or the `Team of the '90s' or anything
like that. We saw ourselves as playing good baseball. Whatever way
you want to take it, that's a positive thing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   There were not many positives Sunday for the Mets, who were
humbled by Tom Glavine. Mets starter Glendon Rusch allowed 13 hits
and seven runs. The best thing that happened for the Mets was
probably when John Rocker boarded the Braves' team bus and left
Shea. One and all were relieved to be done with that story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to deal with a lot of nonsense that wasn't part of the
game at all,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. ``And the game
came to the forefront.''
</P>
<P>
   It did, with a boost from Friday's dramatic Mets victory in
which they scored 10 runs in the eighth inning, although Sunday's
game offered the least for fans to savor.
</P>
<P>
   After Melvin Mora reached base in the first by bunting for a
leadoff single, he tried to advance two bases on a weakly hit
comebacker. Glavine tossed to Andres Galarraga at first base for
one out before Galarraga fired to third to get Mora easily. The
shortstop, who figures to be the Mets' leadoff hitter the rest of
the season, is daring on the bases and was running on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I play,'' Mora said. ``My job is to try to take
the other team out of concentration. Every time I hit a single, I
have to make it a double.''
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Mora's effort backfired. Instead of having a
runner at second, one out and the middle of the order coming up in
the inning in which Glavine is usually most vulnerable, the Mets
had two outs and the bases empty.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine retired Edgardo Alfonzo on a groundout, and the Atlanta
pitcher permitted only one single and one walk over the next five
innings. Piazza and Todd Zeile hit consecutive home runs in the
seventh, but those were the only runs allowed by Glavine (8-5). He
pitched seven innings, allowing five hits and one walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of pitchers that wish they could do what he
does, and they can't,'' Mets third baseman Robin Ventura said.
``That's a credit to him. It just shows you don't have to have a
98-mile-per-hour fastball to get people out.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparison between Glavine and Rusch is irresistible, and
when Rusch, the Mets' left-hander, is pitching well, his teammates
often note their similarities. Rusch (6-6) said he tries to model
himself after Glavine by throwing down and away consistently.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves were crowding the plate on Rusch, trying to take
away the outside pitch, and Rusch said he was probably too
conscious of that. He tried to come inside more than usual, to back
the Braves hitters off, but he left a few balls over the middle and
paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   With one out and runners at second and third in the second
inning, Rusch gave up a sacrifice fly to Walt Weiss and the Braves
led, 1-0. That began a stretch of five pitches that ended with the
Braves leading by 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lockhart swung at the first pitch and grounded a single to
right, scoring a run. Glavine lined a single to left, also on the
first pitch. Rusch threw a ball to Quilvio Veras, then gave up a
two-run double to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were aggressive early in the count,'' said Rusch, who did
not issue a walk. ``I think they knew that I'm going to be around
the plate and throwing strikes, and they tried to get pitches early
in the count so they didn't have to chase a pitch with two strikes.
They're a good, veteran team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves handed their lead to Glavine _ a good, veteran
pitcher _ and the Mets knew he would probably not let it go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glavine, when he's ahead out there, is very difficult to have
a big inning against when he's on,'' Zeile said. ``His first-inning
E.R.A. is high, and after that, it's down to microscopic numbers.
The further the game goes, the better chance he has to keep his
team in there.''
</P>
<P>
   It all might have been different if Derek Bell had held on to a
liner by Reggie Sanders in the second, before the scoring started.
Bell dove to his right and gloved the ball, but it popped out when
he hit the ground. Bell said he joked with the umpires that the
ground cannot cause a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you give me that?'' Bell asked.
</P>
<P>
   They could not, of course. The Mets do not get many gifts when
they play the Braves. For now, they are pleased to be right where
they were before this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically speaking, a split here is OK,'' Zeile said.
``It's not maybe what we would have loved, but given the types of
games we had, it's OK I think we can live with that and move
forward from here.'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Planes gliding over beaches on Long Island and the
Jersey Shore as well as in Los Angeles, Chicago and Hilton Head,
S.C., will carry banners this coming Saturday reading, ```Harry
Potter and the Goblet of Fire.' Read it Now!''
</P>
<P>
   At least 9,000 Federal Express trucks will be deployed around
the nation on that morning by Amazon.com to help deliver 250,000
presold copies of the fantasy novel.
</P>
<P>
   The Jumbotron screen in Times Square will herald the birth of
the fourth book in the hugely successful Harry Potter series about
an orphaned boy with wizard powers.
</P>
<P>
   And the staff at the Blue Marble bookshop in Fort Thomas, Ky.,
will dress up like wizards and witches and begin doling out
cinnamon oatmeal from a black cauldron at 6 a.m. to waiting
families. Compared with hundreds of other bookstores around the
nation, that's late. By all accounts there will be tens of
thousands of sleepless children and parents _ perhaps many more _
showing up in bookstores late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:01 a.m. Saturday, when the novel by the author of the
series, J.K. Rowling, officially goes on sale, small independent
bookshops and selected stores in chains like Borders are opening
their doors to Harry Potter theme parties with magic shows, costume
parties featuring characters from the book, stuffed and even live
owls, who are messengers in the novels, and at the Tattered Cover
bookstore in Denver, a brew of ginger ale and apple juice on dry
ice to imitate Harry's favorite butter bee.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are frenzied out there about this book,'' said Richard
Klein, owner with his brother, Bob, of the Book Revue in
Huntington, N.Y., one of the biggest independent bookstores in the
region. This Long Island shop already has an unusually high number
of copies of the book reserved _ 500 _ and the staff will unpack
hundreds of others just after midnight during a children's party at
the store. ``I have never seen anything like this,'' Richard Klein
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has anyone else in the publishing business.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first ``Harry Potter'' was published by Scholastic in
the United States in 1998, the series by Rowling has sold nearly 21
million copies, including the paperback of the first novel, ``Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.'' The other novels are ``Harry
Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' and ``Harry Potter and the
Prisoner of Azkaban.'' The newest ``Harry Potter,'' a 752-page
book, will be published simultaneously in the United States and
Britain with a first printing of 3.8 million copies in America, a
record. The books have been translated into 35 languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anticipation is beyond anything we imagined,'' said
Michael Jacobs, a senior vice president at Scholastic and the
executive in charge of marketing. ``The book has crossed over and
is now being read by adults now as well as children. The
anticipation has allowed us to have the biggest first printing in
the history of trade publishing.''
</P>
<P>
   The anticipation has also led to even more bruised relations
between bookstores and their main competitor, Internet retailers
like Amazon.com, which was allowed to essentially break the embargo
and open book crates on Friday to ship them by Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   More important, beyond the promotion and hoopla generated by
Scholastic, the book and its accompanying huge audio sale by Random
House's Listening Library has led, say various booksellers, to a
remarkable resurgence of interest in books among children in
elementary and middle schools who have previously ignored reading
in favor of the Internet, video games and watching television.
</P>
<P>
   What is fueling the instant success of the new book is a shrewd
campaign by Scholastic _ and, for that matter, Rowling, who is
involved in the marketing _ to keep everything about it secret
including the plot and the title. It was only after the title was
printed in the British press that Scholastic acknowledged it. In
keeping the book embargoed and under military-style secrecy,
Scholastic drew even more attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each book has just ratcheted up the anticipation for the next
one,'' said Jacobs of Scholastic. ``We wanted very much to have a
specific on-sale date. We felt we could build anticipation to a
certain frenzy. As soon as kids finished book three, they were
waiting for the next one. If there was one date, we knew we could
drive a lot of the anticipation, the advanced sales and give
booksellers a chance to promote it.''
</P>
<P>
   And they have. At the Politics and Prose bookstore in
Washington, Susan Dexter, who works in the children's department,
said many parents had told her that they were showing up with their
children at midnight on Friday to buy the book. ``The more I hear,
the more I know there's going to be a crowd,'' said Dexter, who
recalled the visit of Rowling for a book-signing in the late
afternoon last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``People started lining up early in the morning,'' she said.
``It was like a Rolling Stones concert.''

ANALYSIS: SHADES OF GLOOM AND GLEAMS OF CONFIDENCE WITH MILES TO
GO
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Mont.) By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He may be Al Gore's most ardent booster, but
President Clinton sounded rather tentative last week when he was
asked about the vice president's prospects in November. ``It's
still more likely than not that he will win,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that even with 130 days to go before the
election, Democrats are unsettled, even gloomy, while Republicans
are confident. Could the presidential race be over barely after it
started?
</P>
<P>
   Once again this past week, it seemed that Al Gore could not
catch a break: One national poll even had him 13 points behind Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas. Gore found himself again confronted by
questions over whether the Justice Department would investigate his
fund-raising practices. And Ralph Nader was elected the nominee of
the Green Party, leaving Democrats to fret that he would steal
votes from Gore's base. All this occurred within days after Gore
named a new campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But even Bush loyalists concede that Democrats should not
despair _ at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   No one should underestimate Gore's potential political potency:
Voters may, in the end, give him credit for helping preside over
the longest economic expansion in the nation's history. He is a
disciplined, if lackluster, campaigner who is known for performing
best in adversity. He displayed that ability when he toppled former
Sen. Bill Bradley in the primaries. Now, he plans to zero in on
Bush's support of a rather unpopular but enormous tax cut, as well
as the governor's stands on Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage for Gore is that no one questions his
competence to make decisions and to grasp issues _ and to
understand how to navigate the often befuddling world of government
and politics in Washington. If voters find they are not
sufficiently confident of Bush's preparedness for the Oval Office _
or his heft on the issues _ they could turn to Gore by default.
</P>
<P>
   There is truth to the spin from the Gore camp that the public
has yet to focus on the presidential race. In an ABC
News/Washington Post poll conducted in mid-June, only 13 percent of
expected voters said they were following the race very closely.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that many voters may be waiting for the
conventions or the fall debates to learn more about the contenders
and settle on a choice. That could be a plus for Gore, who has far
more extensive experience as a debater and is steeped much more
deeply in national and international issues. (One danger is that
the high expectations for Gore in debates could work against him if
Bush performs unexpectedly _ and reassuringly _ well.)
</P>
<P>
   One of Gore's biggest problems is, simply, that voters seem to
like Bush more and think the vice president is too politically
calculating and relentlessly ambitious. But Gore aides said they
hoped to turn that into a virtue by convincing voters that as
president he would channel that determination and energy into his
policy agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Another often neglected reality is that the race may be closer
than it now looks. Despite Gore's troubles in winning over loyal
Democrats, in the end the likelihood is that most Democrats will
side with him and most Republicans will side with Bush, leaving the
contest to turn on a relatively narrow swath of swing and
independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than dwell on current polls, Democrats can take heart
that in three of the last five presidential elections, the
candidate behind in the polls at this point won in November: Ronald
Reagan in 1980, George Bush in 1988 and Bill Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   It could be, of course, that Gore will never climb out of his
rut in the polls and that the electorate has settled early on Bush.
As one top Gore aide put it, voters ``might decide that they like
the other guy better and that's that.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on a flight from Cleveland to Austin, Texas, on
Wednesday, Bush was careful not to be overconfident _ or to raise
expectations for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a sitting vice president with an economy that seems like
it's doing pretty well,'' Bush said. ``He's going to be very
difficult to beat. I am not the favorite. Nor is he. I think it's
going to be a very close race. I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor went on to advise: ``I wouldn't be putting your
money anywhere right now. I'd be calling it too close to call. But
I'm going to nip him in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But some Republicans are not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polls that show Bush ahead are extremely soft and
misleading,'' said Mike Murphy, who was a top strategist for the
primary campaign of Sen. John McCain. Referring to Medicare and
Social Security, he said, ``Gore has a muddy bag full of ugly wedge
issues and he knows how to use them. It's very possible that this
race will snap back to near even after the conventions.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it could be that the dynamics of the national nominating
conventions this summer and the televised debates in the fall, not
to say tens of millions of dollars in commercials, could change
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seminal events of this campaign have yet to occur,'' said
Carter Eskew, one of Gore's closest advisers. ``There's been a lot
of early auditioning, but the race has not been engaged. We
continue to believe that this race is ultimately going to be over
stewardship of the economy and stewardship of the prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their public confidence, some Gore advisers privately
worry that Gore should be far ahead in the polls right now _ not
lagging _ given the robust economy and the fact that all seems well
in the world. They are concerned that as Bush reaches out to
moderates, Gore is still having trouble winning over reliable
Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   At their weekly meeting, top campaign strategists in Nashville
last week mulled over what could be going wrong. Everyone seemed to
have a suggestion: Some aides concluded that Gore was coming off as
too liberal and needed to be even more aggressively reaching out to
moderates. But, participants said, there was also a discussion of
what some strategists think is Gore's fundamental problem: that
people do not seem to like him as much as they like Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats may be uneasy, but they are not panicking because they
can still make quite a plausible case for Gore. And the news media
may be allies here: If the vice president demonstrates any glimmer
of a comeback, he is bound to draw upbeat coverage (outsized
perhaps) depicting him as on the rebound. That is because the news
media, by nature, thrive on the dramatic _ and a comeback meets
that standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very winnable race for him,'' said Fred Yang, a
Democratic pollster. ``Bush still hasn't proven that he can take
the heat. And Gore seems to shine the most when the pressure is
on.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York said he was confident that
both the healthy economy and Gore's deep command of issues would
assure him victory. It is certainly true that on many of the most
important issues, voters rate the Democrats more capable than
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the big policy issues, I think Gore wins,'' Cuomo said.
``By the time the debates are over, Bush is not going to be able to
dominate on any of these issues. The obvious issue is: `Didn't
these people produce the biggest and best economy in modern
history?' And Gore has an edge on the gravitas issue. It will be:
`Who is intelligent enough and who is competent enough to keep us
going the way we've been going?'''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana, a Republican, said he was
optimistic, but cautiously so. What could go wrong? ``I don't know
that there's anything specific,'' he said. ``It's just an
understanding of the dynamics of our human existence.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans simply refuse to buy the possibility of a
Gore triumph. ``There's very little that worries me about him,''
said Gov. John Engler of Michigan, who is working closely with the
Bush campaign. ``He's going to put together a scorched-earth
operation. And he's going to slash and burn.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, in a slip of the tongue, apparently was so confident
at an event earlier this month that he dispensed with the
formalities _ like the actual election. ``As president,'' he
declared, ``I'm here in Knoxville, Tennessee, to tell America I'll
set a new tone in Washington.''

OUTDOORS: CASTING EELS FOR STRIPED BASS 
</HEADLINE>
   By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The boulders that loom in the shallows of Point Judith, R.I.,
are debris from the last ice age, having been scoured off the
underlying stone some 12,000 years ago, only to be scattered, like
so much construction rubble, when the ice retreated from the mouth
of Narragansett Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Each summer schools of striped bass gather in the heavy waves
that wash over these rocks, completing migration routes they have
traveled since glaciers changed their world. They are mature, savvy
predators. Some are longer than a man's leg.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the darkness a week ago Friday night, my father
stood in a small boat that rose and fell just outside the point's
crashing surf. His rod was slumped over and bouncing. He was
fighting the sixth or seventh fish to come to the gunnel during a
busy, moonless hour.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Joe Pagano shined a light into the blackness, illuminating
the outline of a pale brute with flared gills and thrashing head.
He lifted the dripping bass and worked out the hook. A 21-pounder.
</P>
<P>
   As fishermen go, my father is extraordinarily finicky. Let it be
known that James Chivers doesn't want big fish. He doesn't want
little fish. He wants succulent keepers precisely at legal size,
which in Rhode Island is 29 inches. This fish was about 39 inches
long. No good. Pagano turned it back, sliding it headfirst into an
inky wave.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of striped bass stocks during the 1990s has
invigorated all manner of inshore fishing methods. Pagano, a
skipper for 21 years, has resurrected the most elemental: the
inshore eel-casting trip.
</P>
<P>
   Like the charter captains of yesteryear, Pagano weaves a 23-foot
boat in and out of the surf's edge, holding the hull tight to
submerged stones and ledges, hazarding the turbulent shallows where
bass roam at night. His work at the helm gives fishermen access to
a rich intermediate zone, a belt of water beyond the range of shore
fishermen and beyond the daring of most people in boats.
</P>
<P>
   He describes it like this: ``I've already hit all the rocks. So
I know where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Eel-casting at night is all fundamentals. You take a live eel, a
foot or more long, and slide a stout hook through its head. Pagano
holds the boat in position while you whisk long casts toward small
targets. The eels plop down and you reel them back, ever so slowly,
presenting them as easy victims for the big, migratory fish that
lie in ambush by the boulders.
</P>
<P>
   When a fish hits a footlong eel, usually it's a big fish, and
usually it smashes the eel. If you prefer 29-inchers, you might
have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone prefer 29-inchers? The truth is this: My father
is an unconverted meat fisherman with his own exacting standards.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 he fished the tidewaters of Virginia's Rappahannock
River. Back then small bass, 20- to 22-inchers, filled acres of the
river's wide surface, slashing at schools of bait under a wheeling
sky of gulls. There were so many fish in 1955 that my father, then
a teen-ager, did not have to bother giving casting directions to my
grandfather, who had been blinded in a hunting accident nine years
before.
</P>
<P>
   Once they found the schools, anywhere they threw lures there
were fish. Bass were everywhere. Even a blind man could catch them.
My father is a shy man, and he holds his emotions close, but when
he talks about the Rappahannock of 1955 his voice is tinged with
joy.
</P>
<P>
   He has seen his ideal, and he saw it young. And having acquired
his taste for striped bass on the small, tender fish of the
Rappahannock, he wants none of Point Judith's larger, tougher fish.
All he wants, a few times each year, is a sole 29-incher, the
sweetest catch he can bring home without risking a state summons.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the water with Pagano, the Point Judith bass were weak
for eels. They came readily to the boat. One by one we turned them
back: a 13-pounder (33 inches), a 17-pounder (36 inches) and five
clones at 21 and 22 pounds (39 or 40 inches). Finally, the fishing
slowed and we moved, heading north up the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 1 a.m., we eased up to a spot where a small
contingent of submerged boulders could be picked out by ripples in
the swells. The air was laced with the aroma of honeysuckle. Dad
was still at work. He is 61. His shoulders were stiff. His casts
were more conservative, low on snap and vigor. But soon he hooked
another large bass, which he fought halfway to the boat before it
slipped the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, he heaved the eel back to the same spot and _ wham! _
was on again. The fish seemed lighter. And as it raced by the boat,
its short, slender form was silhouetted by Pagano's light. Dad
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too small,'' I said, as it came out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   Pagano produced a measuring tape. There it was: the 29-incher.
The night's smallest bass, my father's perfect catch.
</P>
<P>
   We stowed the tackle. Pagano throttled the engine into gear. A
half hour later we were gliding over a salt pond's tranquil surface
when a tangerine-colored moon rose up out of the Atlantic and began
lighting up the night.
</P>
<P>
   Big eels. Shallow water. Forty-five years from the Rappahannock.
Fresh dinner on ice.

COMPUTER WHIZ HAS SERVED HIS TIME, BUT HE'S STILL A WANTED MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ Just five years ago, cyber-crime poster
boy Kevin Mitnick was on a desperate cross-country hacking spree,
using cellular telephones and his wits to avoid FBI agents and U.S.
Marshals.
</P>
<P>
   Now just several months out of prison, the man who authorities
feared could launch nuclear missiles with his computer insists he's
kicked his hacking addiction and wants to help rid the world of
digital criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before all this, everybody had the image that I was this
cyber-monster, the evil villain of the world,'' Mitnick said during
an interview last week at his dad's apartment in Thousand Oaks, a
bedroom community northwest of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these experiences, brushes with the law, ending up
in jail and doing things that are counterproductive to society, I'm
attempting to take my abilities and use them for the public's good.
I'm trying to use my background and expertise in helping others
prevent computer break-ins.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer pursued by government agents, he is a computer-age
folk hero courted by Congress, movie studios, radio talk shows and
Internet businesses who want to mine him for his cyber-world
insight.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles attorney David Schindler, who was chief prosecutor
on the Mitnick case until last year, said he does not begrudge
Mitnick the chance to make money off his talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would be of concern is the extent to which his notoriety
extends from his prior criminal activity,'' he said. ``And from
that end it is somewhat ironic and unfortunate that he should
become a purported expert when there are hundreds, if not thousands
of law-abiding, talented consultants who frankly know far more than
Mr. Mitnick about how to safeguard systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism aside, Mitnick is still a darling of the hacker
underground. His fans run a FreeKevin.com Web site and media critic
Steven Brill offered him a job as an online columnist for the
e-business venture ``Contentville.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been offered a job as the host of a Los Angeles radio talk
show and as a consultant for a cyber-crime movie. The television
show ``America's Most Wanted'' asked him to appear as an expert on
computer hacking. He was paid to write an article for Time
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not tempted to hack anymore,'' he said. ``It's weird. I've
kind of grown out of it. I'm not saying prison rehabilitated me.
That's a crock. All prison is is punishment. I'm 36 years old now.
Hackers tend to grow out of it in their early 30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the myth of Kevin Mitnick and the reality of Kevin
Mitnick. The reality is I did wrong. I broke into computers for the
fun, the thrill and the intellectual challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you have the myth of this guy who wants to screw with
anybody any way he can. He can get into your credit record, send a
virus, erase police records and break into the National Security
Agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty to various computer
crimes stemming from a scheme to obtain proprietary software
belonging to cellular telephone and computer software companies,
according to court documents. He was sentenced to 68 months in jail
and ordered to pay $4,525 in restitution and assessments, which he
has already paid.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, Mitnick was arrested four times and imprisoned for
six years, nine months. Although he admits to breaking the law, he
said government claims that he caused companies hundreds of
millions of dollars in damage were based on the costs of research
and development for the software he downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did the government justify treating me as the hacker
poster boy? They had to show how much damage I caused.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick's father, Alan, said he's elated that his son is out of
prison, but he's baffled by the government's reluctance to allow
him to take various jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about John Dillinger or Bonnie and Clyde,''
he said. ``We're talking about a white-collar, no-profit kind of
crime. More of a pain-in-the-ass type of crime. To say he should
get a job pounding nails in construction _ that's just a waste of a
very talented brain.''
</P>
<P>
   The terms of his probation are designed to control the
``compulsive and serial nature of his hacking,'' said Christopher
Painter, deputy chief of the Computer Crime and Intellectual
Property Section at the U.S. Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   His federal probation officer, Larry Hawley, said he leans
toward allowing Mitnick to take some of the offers to help society
stop cyber-villains.
</P>
<P>
   But Mitnick won't be allowed to travel outside the Southern
California area until his probation ends in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Since his release from federal prison in January, Mitnick has
been barred from using the computers he loves so much. But that
hasn't kept him from enjoying some of the same technology that gave
him his start in computers.
</P>
<P>
   He carries a cellular telephone and drives a fiery red Toyota
MR2 sports car, equipped with a HAM radio _ all approved by his
federal probation officer.
</P>
<P>
   The good-natured, articulate 36-year-old man whose high jinks
began as a teen-ager and gained intensity in his days at Los
Angeles Pierce College once was the FBI's most-wanted hacker. The
convicted cyber-bandit led the FBI on a three-year chase from
Denver to Seattle before he was apprehended in Raleigh, N.C., in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick said he spent those years using various aliases, working
on computer systems at a law firm in Denver and on a systems help
desk at a hospital in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The shy son of a waitress said his fascination with technology
began at age 11 when he swept the floors and did inventory at Radio
Shack in exchange for getting to tinker with their HAM radios.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always carried my HAM radio with me,'' he said. ``I wasn't
much into social relationships. As a kid, I was overweight. I
didn't make friends easy and one of the ways I could talk to people
was over the radio. Even today, I still use HAM radio.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his attorneys once said Mitnick was addicted to hacking,
a comment Mitnick says was a ploy to get him a lighter sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'd classify myself as an addict,'' he said.
``It fed my ego. That's one of the reasons I did it _ for the ego
boost. It made me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   The downside of that is prison, a place of bad memories where
Mitnick said he was held in solitary confinement for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let you out of the cell for an hour a day into another
small little area. In short, it's like torture. It's very dirty and
grim.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick said he was kept in solitary because the judge feared he
could access computers via the telephone, ``lest I launch nuclear
missiles by whistling into the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   But the upside were his fans, who staged protests at federal
courts around the country, sported ``Free Kevin'' bumper stickers
and sent him letters of encouragement, magazines and money to buy
items in the prison store.
</P>
<P>
   One friend in Michigan still sends him Faygo Redpop soda in the
can, a favorite drink he can't do without.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must be crazy to get my soda sent to me from Michigan,'' he
said.

ROCKER GETS CREDIT FOR RELIEVING SECURITY WORRIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Rocker appeared in only one of the four games
with the Mets at Shea Stadium _ the first one _ and one of his
teammates thought that was the perfect outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 300 media people here and he pitches Thursday night
and half the people aren't here the next day,'' said Tom Glavine,
the veteran starter. ``That alleviated a lot of it. I don't think
the fans here are going to give up on it. And that's fine. If the
fans want to do their things, we expect that. But I think a lot of
the extra emphasis that was put on this situation died down after
John pitched Thursday night.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker would have been called into Friday night's game, an 11-8
Mets victory, but a callus on his left thumb broke open, and he did
not pitch the rest of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be an ongoing process,'' Glavine said of the
attention Rocker receives from members of the news media. ``This is
going to be an all-year situation. We want to make it a better
situation for us to concentrate on what we should be concentrating
on, and that's baseball. Hopefully, he'll realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, his teammates hope Rocker will keep his thoughts
to himself the rest of the season and not stir the controversy
again, as he did a few weeks ago when he berated the Sports
Illustrated reporter who quoted Rocker's views on gays, foreigners,
unwed mothers and members of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker did make an on-field appearance Sunday, warming up left
fielder Reggie Sanders in the eighth inning, tossing a ball back
and forth while a stadium security guard stood behind him and
several police officers hovered outside the door to the visitors'
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   When Rocker was finished, he flipped the ball into the stands in
the left-field corner. Members of the crowd chanted, ``Throw it
back,'' and a fan fired a ball on to the field. It missed Rocker
and skipped across the outfield grass.
</P>
<P>
   The police arrested Gregory Sweeney, 25, of the Prospect Heights
section of Brooklyn, and charged him with reckless endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the arrest, Major League Baseball officials were pleased
that no serious incidents arose during the series. Kevin Hallinan,
baseball's security chief, said that he and his expanded staff kept
an inning-by-inning checklist to make sure they covered all
possible danger points. In addition, he said, his staff members
maintained what he called an area of control, from the bullpen to
the dugout, ``to make sure if he was in that area, we would have
things under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan said New York City police had been prepared to ring the
field after the games, but found that maneuver unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made that decision every night,'' he said. ``They were
lined up ready to go if necessary. But they didn't have to because
the crowd was great. There's so much to be said about New York
fans. They were terrific. They took the high ground.'' &QL;

 &HT;    WITH HOPES FOR A CLEAN ELECTION, MEXICANS GO TO POLLS
 &HT;    860&AMP;add. With MEXICO-CARTER.
 &HT;    Eds: Will be led.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ With passions running strong and hopes high for a
truly clean election, millions of Mexicans went to the polls Sunday
in the most competitive presidential election in their modern
history.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the 71-year reign of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI), which declared itself committed to free and fair
elections in a country long notorious for electoral fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In early exit polls by Mexican TV networks, the opposition
National Action Party (PAN) was winning governorships in the two
states where the offices were at stake, Morelos and Guanajuato.
</P>
<P>
   The polls also showed the leftist Democratic Revolution Party
holding on to the mayor's office in Mexico City's federal district,
the country's political heart.
</P>
<P>
   No polling results were available for the presidency or for the
two houses of the nation's Congress, also at stake Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Actual voting returns were not expected before early Monday, and
if the presidential race is close, a winner may not be declared
until midweek.
</P>
<P>
   There were mounting reports of angry would-be voters who didn't
get to cast ballots for president at special voting stations set up
for people who had recently moved or were in transit.
</P>
<P>
   Although election officials estimated that more than 99 percent
of all voting stations opened _ the best record ever for Mexico _
voters were enraged when special stations that could stock only a
limited number of ballots by law ran short.
</P>
<P>
   In the sprawling Mexico City working-class suburb of Ixtapaluca
in the state of Mexico, voters started shouting to cast votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't fair!'' said police officer Marco Hernandez, 23,
who was standing in a long line when officials said only 300
ballots were left out of 750 available for voters who had moved
since getting their voting credentials. Asked who he wanted to vote
for, Hernandez wrote on a piece of paper: ``I want change.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 58 million people were eligible to vote in the election,
which followed the most hotly contested and passionate campaign
season in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI candidate, Francisco Labastida, faced a strong challenge
from Vicente Fox of the PAN, running as the candidate of the
center-right Alliance for Change.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and Labastida were neck-and-neck in many pre-election
opinion polls, while another candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the
Democratic Revolution Party, was trailing in third.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters said change was a prime motive for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election has been the most publicized in the history of
Mexico, and most of us want change,'' said street vendor Alfonso
Garrido, 53, who voted for Fox in Ecatepec, a city near the capital
where almost 1 million voters reside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always voted for the PRI before, but the truth is, I'm tired
of poverty and I hope that Fox, if he wins, will fulfill his
promises,'' said Garrida.
</P>
<P>
   But many other voters said they preferred to stick with the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to let Fox win. I don't like his pompous
attitude,'' said Patricia Arias, 36, an Ixtapaluca housewife who
voted for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   But her sister, Edith Arias, 37, with whom she walked arm in
arm, voted for Cardenas because ``he cares about working people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Ramirez, 67, also voted for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think all three candidates put together can really
change much,'' he said. ``The PRI is part of society. It dominates
everything. The opposition could create problems.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same voting station, housewife Amapola Mendez voted with
her 2-year-old clinging to her leg. ``A lot of older people think
there will never be change,'' she said, explaining that she voted
for Fox. ``But many younger people are looking at other political
parties now.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an awning set up on Juarez Street in Ixtapaluca, people
crowded around tables stacked with color-coded ballots supervised
by a election officials and two people who counted votes and posted
results before shipping them to a district office.
</P>
<P>
   Each official was supposed to be selected by lottery and trained
by Mexico's independent Federal Elections Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Voters showed their photo ID voting credentials to these
officials, who matched them against a registration list that also
contained photos. Voters were given ballots to mark and instructed
to go into booths with curtains. Then they deposited the ballots in
color-coded boxes for federal elections and state and local races.
</P>
<P>
   Political parties were allowed to have two representatives per
table, but on Juarez Street, like other parts of the country, there
were complaints that too many PRI representatives wearing pins were
standing around or sitting at the tables.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, five women wearing PRI pins were crowded around
one table on Juarez Street, silently observing voters as they
approached to get their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Manuel Solorzano, a PAN representative, said he was filing
a complaint because some PRI members had been substituted at the
last minute as vote counters at one table.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, ``for the first time ever, we are seeing
an election where the government isn't sticking its hands in.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the Valle de Chalco, another state of Mexico area where PRI
loyalty tends to run strong, people trickled into voting precincts
along with stray dogs.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, heavy rains flooded out hundreds from their
homes. Federal aid arrived and the government paid many families
almost $1,000 in disaster relief. But many said the help was
inadequate and slow to come.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many here were bent on backing the party of tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the party of my parents _ even my grandparents,'' said
housewife Rosa Maria Perez, 35. The ruling party ``gives us
security. I still don't have confidence in the other parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting PRI is family-bound duty, explained Patricia Sanchez
Pacheco, 37.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother got her papers to become a PRI activist 25 years
ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other parties don't have experience to govern a country,''
said her sister, Hortencia Sanchez Pacheco.
</P>
<P>
   The two sisters gave their votes to the PRI because it came
through in ways that count _ bags of cement, sand and aluminum
scrap for roofs for their neighborhood, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago we started receiving the help,'' said Hortencia
Sanchez, carefully minding her step on a street of rocks and
rubble.
</P>
<P>
   But even in this staunch PRI town, there was opposition _ and
indignation _ at the PRI's campaign classic campaign gifts for
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a bucket and a T-shirt, they want our vote? Forget it,''
said one voter who declined to give her name.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big gap between what the PRI says and what it
does,'' said electrician Juan Jesus Moreno, 43, who voted for
Cardenas, just as he did in 1994 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can Labastida talk about computers and English classes for
Mexicans (a campaign proposal) when we don't have enough to eat?''
he asked.
</P>
<P>
   A reliable den of PRI support, Valle de Chalco sports monuments
to former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's government public
works project, Solidarity. The program paved roads, put in drainage
and electricity and built basketball courts in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But the June sewage flood may have provoked a lower turnout for
the PRI than in previous elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems there was a bit of anger and apathy out there among
people for the way the government handled the disaster,'' said
Arturo Morales Torres, a local resident.

TEACHERS UNION WILL WEIGH EXTRA YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., N.Y., Mass., Wis.)   By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Worried that the new academic standards required
for a diploma in many states are impossible for hundreds of
thousands of today's students to meet, the president of the
American Federation of Teachers plans to propose on Monday that
schools add an optional fifth year to high school.
</P>
<P>
   In her speech as the union opens its biennial convention here,
Sandra Feldman, the AFT president, will call for a
``transitional-year'' program, either before ninth grade or in high
school, in which adult-literacy specialists would help teen-agers
lacking basic skills catch up so they could confront more
challenging course work. She will suggest that the country's
educators borrow ideas from the military, which she said has
successfully trained even illiterate youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about a segment of kids who are just absolutely
falling through the cracks because no one's paying attention to
them,'' Feldman said in an interview last week as she prepared her
speech. ``Something's going to give here. Either people are going
to talk about lowering the standards, which I think would be
disastrous, or we're going to take it very seriously and provide
whatever those kids need to meet the standards.''
</P>
<P>
   After a decade in which every state but Iowa has adopted higher
standards for achievement _ and 26 states have decided to require
new tests for graduation by 2003 _ Feldman's proposal comes as many
are suggesting that the current school calendar is inadequate to
accomplish all the new goals.
</P>
<P>
   School districts have already expanded after-school programs and
summer school classes to address deficits in literacy and
mathematics, primarily in the early grades.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Education Richard Riley recommended this spring
that teachers begin to work year-round, spending part of the extra
time helping struggling students and part of it training to
implement the higher standards. And an increasing number of
upper-class students are taking a fifth year of high school at
elite preparatory academies to improve their grades and scores for
competitive colleges. (At the same time, Ontario, Canada, has
recently phased out its Grade 13.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only common sense to think that students are going to
need widely varying amounts of instructional time in order to
achieve the requisite standards,'' said Paul Reville, a professor
at the Harvard Graduate School of Education who was chairman of the
Massachusetts Commission on Time and Learning from 1993 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that children start with different levels of knowledge
and learn at different paces, Reville drew an analogy to a
hospital. ``No one would think of prescribing a term of treatment
for all conditions,'' he said. ``They're trying to bring you up to
a standard of health. Some people are going to be there for two
weeks and some will be there two hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman's idea is already on the agenda of the school board in
Rochester, N.Y., which is scheduled to vote July 20 on a proposal,
called Pathways, to create five- and three-year high school tracks
to reclaim some of the district's dropouts and accommodate
accelerated students who want to get a jump on college.
</P>
<P>
   ``With regard to high school, we used to hold time constant and
vary quality,'' Superintendent Clifford B. Janey wrote in a recent
essay explaining the idea. ``With the Pathways initiative, we will
hold quality constant and vary time.''
</P>
<P>
   While a current Rochester high school student typically takes
6.5 credits for each of four years, someone on the five-year plan
might earn only 4 or 5 credits in some years, taking double periods
of English or biology to go over the same material more slowly. A
student trying to finish in three years might take high school
level math, biology and foreign language while in eighth grade,
then load up with 7 or even 8.5 credits during the sophomore and
junior year to graduate early.
</P>
<P>
   Janey said he did not know how much such a program would cost to
implement or how many students would participate. The class of 2000
started with 2,255 students in 1996, but graduated just 1,247 this
spring, he noted, adding that a formal fifth-year program would
prevent dropouts by reducing the sense of failure associated with
not finishing in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, there are about 415,000 high school dropouts a year,
Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion over high school scheduling comes at the
beginnings of a backlash against the new standards and high-stakes
tests, as parents worry that their children will be denied diplomas
many had taken for granted. In Arizona last year, only 1 out of 10
sophomores passed a math test that soon will be required for
graduation. Wisconsin recently withdrew a graduation test after
protests swept the state.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman, whose 1-million-member organization is the smaller but
often more aggressive of the nation's two teachers unions, sees her
proposal for a transitional year as a temporary one, intended to
help a generation of students who were not subject to the rigorous
new curriculum in the lower grades but will be held accountable by
tests in high school. Others, though, think more flexible high
school schedules make sense if schools expect all students to meet
the new high standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids take longer to be potty trained than others, some
students take longer to talk than others, some students take longer
to ride a bike than others,'' said Amy T. Wilkins of the Education
Trust, a Washington organization that works to close the
achievement gap between minority and white students. ``If one of
your children takes longer to master any one of those skills, you
don't say, `Oh, she's a failure.' We can expect kids to acquire
certain skills over an academic career that may be 12 years, may be
13 years _ may be 11 or 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Johnson, deputy assistant secretary of the federal
Department of Education, noted that the portion of students
finishing college in four years has dropped from 45.4 percent in
1977 to 31.1 percent in 1993. She also said it took her longer than
most to learn how to drive a stick shift on the streets of New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, when I shift, you have no idea that it took me 20
lessons or 12 lessons _ you simply know that I know how to shift,''
Johnson said. ``The issue is acquiring and demonstrating, not how
long it takes to get there.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE INDEPENDENT WAYS OF THE WILLIAMS' SISTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Fixes typo in hedline.) 
By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON , England _ It was early in the fortnight, and Richard
Williams was crisscrossing the grounds with a cigarette dangling
from his lips, shaking random thoughts from his head like Tic-Tacs.
Did he mention his screenplay, his plans for a magazine, his
interests in cashing in on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm into Webcasting,'' Williams said. ``If Serena and Venus
went into that business, they'd make more money in two years than
they would in 50 of doing something else. If it was up to me, I'd
like to see them retire right now and move on. Let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just a suggestion, though. At the same time that tour
parents like Damir Dokic and Samantha Stevenson appeared on the
grounds of the All England Club like Svengalis for their children _
either feeding them answers to questions or hovering over their
every move during the first week of Wimbledon _it became more
apparent that Richard and Oracene Williams have raised two
independent thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   They still call Richard Williams Daddy, but as Serena and Venus
Williams exit their teens one by one, both have been encouraged to
inch into adulthood. With built-in filters for parental advice,
they have begun to make their own decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on what decision it is,'' said Venus Williams, who
turned 20 two weeks ago. ``My parents have taught us to make
decisions on our own, to be independent. But on certain things, we
still go, `Can we do this?' It's quite odd.''
</P>
<P>
   But normal, too. Sometimes, normal seems in short supply on the
tour. So does perspective, and this is a trait Venus and Serena
Williams use deftly when it comes to their father's techno-career
dreams for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're real good at something, it's tough to say goodbye,
especially if it's something you've done all your life,'' said
Venus Williams, who, like Serena, will begin Week 2 of Wimbledon
with a Round of 16 match today. ``I suppose I'll be around a little
while more. No more retirement scares at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd get bored in an office, just sitting around, eating
doughnuts.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows herself well. Early last week her father told a story
about how Venus used to stare out the window of her second-grade
classroom, with the sound of the lecture as background noise for
her daydreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teacher said to me, `Your daughter has no interest in
school; she's always looking out the window,''' Richard Williams
said. ``I thought she was kidding, but I got up on top of the
building and saw her looking out the window. I asked Venus why, and
she said, `Everything they're doing, I did in first grade.'''
</P>
<P>
   On a tour where education is sometimes squeezed in between photo
ops, practice time, travel schedules and matches, the articulate
Williams sisters do seem advanced. They enjoy the learning process
_ even on the court. They have heard past criticisms about their
games _ too much power, not enough strategy _ and have been open to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a different game than when we first came out,'' said
Serena Williams, who will be 19 in September. ``We have a lot of
power, whereas someone who doesn't have it has to do different
things. But I think now I have added strategy to my game.''
</P>
<P>
   They have not altered their flair, though. They are still as
free-spirited and shoulder high in self-esteem as when they arrived
on the scene, but they were a calm core amid the lunacy that
whirled around them last week. On the same day Jelena Dokic's
ranting father was led away by police, an accusation of a racial
slur was leveled by Alexandra Stevenson, and Alexandra's mother,
Samantha, described a physical confrontation with a French player,
the Williams sisters would not be baited into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Serena Williams has denied any encounters of overt
racism on the tour, but she was politically aware enough to take a
stand against the Confederate flag issue in South Carolina,
refusing to play in the state. On Friday night, a day after
Alexandra Stevenson's claim, Serena Williams was asked again if she
had been confronted with racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already covered that question,'' said. ``You can get the
transcripts.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters are quick-witted, sometimes coy, but often viewed as
aloof. Yet their standoffishness seems borne out of a survival
instinct. Last week, Stevenson described hazing she said she
received by fellow players whom she believed were jealous of her
celebrity. While the Williams sisters have been celebrated on
magazine covers and in television features, they do not take notes
on who loves or loathes them. Steering clear of gossip, they keep
their distance from other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always around my mom, my dad and Venus,'' Serena Williams
said. ``Just stick close to yourself and be not too friendly.
That's why a lot of people have a problem with us, because we're
not too friendly with anyone. We're cordial, say, `Hi,' and et
cetera.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not motivated by popularity, steered by cliques or
unnerved by sister envy. When Week 2 of Wimbledon begins, Venus and
Serena Williams will be on track to accomplish the same thing: win
at Wimbledon. Last summer, Serena won the United States Open title
while Venus sat emotionally detached from the moment. At that
point, the issue of sibling rivalry took root. On Saturday, Venus
Williams handled the issue the same way she does most others, with
maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even think we have sibling rivalry in our heart,'' she
said. ``Whatever we share, we share the best we can. I don't think
it's inside of us. Does it really matter who won a Grand Slam
first? She played better. It's my loss. It's her win. It's all in
the Williams family.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a family that is tight, and yet Richard and Oracene
Williams have given their daughters room to grow. Their daughters
recently moved into their own home. And during a week when parents
trampled the bounds of control, the sisters stood out as glowing
examples of independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad always talks about his mom,'' said Serena Williams,
whose grandmother was a sharecropper. ``He always talks about how
she helped him be the person that he is. He's a very positive
person. He's really outgoing and really he's like _ I wish I could
describe him. He's very determined. I just imagine my grandmother
to be the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really got a chance to know her very well, but from
all the stuff that he says and the things that he does, usually the
apple doesn't fall far from the tree.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALD KNOB, Ky. _ Scotty Baesler hates fund-raising. Driving all
day on the campaign trail wears him out. He's never had a real
passion for writing legislation. And when he worked in Washington a
few years ago, he longed for the weekends to return to his
sprawling 250-acre farm near here.
</P>
<P>
   So why is the 58-year-old former three-term Democratic
congressman, fresh from a bout with prostate cancer, running hard
to win back his old job on Capitol Hill?
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss it, and I miss setting the agenda,'' drawled Baesler,
after greeting old friends and wolfing down a ham-and-cheese
sandwich at Wright's Grocery in this tiny hamlet that's barely a
curve in the road. ``Democrats need six more folks to take back
control, and I want to be one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ernie Fletcher, the freshman Republican who holds the seat
Baesler gave up two years ago to run a failed Senate bid, has
another theory: ``It's clear this is a fallback position for him.
Scotty's getting a reputation for being a perennial candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the battle for control of Congress, three of the most hotly
contested House races this year involve former incumbents who quit
to run unsuccessfully for other offices, and are now trying to
reclaim their old seats.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Baesler's bid here, Jane Harman, a former three-term
Democrat, is challenging Rep. Steven Kuykendall, a freshman
Republican, in California. And in New Jersey, Republican Richard
Zimmer is trying to recapture the seat he relinquished in 1996, now
held by Democratic Rep. Rush Holt.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans clinging to a narrow six-seat margin in the
House, one or two of these tight races could spell the difference
between serving in the majority or serving in the minority. To
entice the former members, party leaders have promised to restore
their House seniority, dangled prized committee assignments and
recruited state officials to beg them to return.
</P>
<P>
   And for good reason. The powers of incumbency, including paid
government staff and free mail, are so potent that defeating a
sitting member of Congress has become almost impossible. In 1998,
98 percent of all incumbents seeking re-election won their races,
and only once in the last quarter century has the re-election rate
dipped below 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But in races pitting incumbents against former incumbents, the
odds for challengers jump sharply because they are often as well
known and well financed as the sitting members. Moreover, of all
incumbents, freshmen are the most vulnerable because they often
have not yet built reputations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Former incumbents know how to raise money, they know their
districts as well as anybody and they've been winners before,''
said Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., chairman of his party's
Congressional Campaign Committee. ``They're more sophisticated than
your average candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep, Thomas Davis III, R-Va., chairman of the National
Republican Campaign Committee, agreed but warned of a potential
pitfall: ``If they left a seat for another job, they're saying they
didn't like that job.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaping back into the fray of electoral politics was not an easy
choice for any of this year's comeback candidates.
</P>
<P>
   After losing a Democratic primary for governor two years ago,
Harman settled into an intellectually stimulating life teaching
public policy at University of California at Los Angeles. She spent
more time with her husband and teen-age children. She took up golf.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Gov. Gray Davis and party elders came calling, offering
her plum seats on the commerce and intelligence committees, and the
chance to help put Democrats back in charge, she said she couldn't
resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of life in the Congress stinks,'' said Harman,
recalling the red-eye flights from the West Coast, late work nights
and partisanship that has only worsened since she left.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other side of the ledger is the future of public policy
in this country. And I'm a policy addict.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign wars were also far from Zimmer's mind. Since losing a
bitter Senate race in 1996 to then-Rep. Robert Torricelli, Zimmer
has practiced law, taught politics at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson
School of Public and International Affairs, and spent time at his
farm in Hunterdon County.
</P>
<P>
   But two years ago, after Holt upset Rep. Mike Pappas, a
Republican, Zimmer said that Speaker Dennis Hastert and Republican
leaders in New Jersey urged him to run again. ``Denny told me that
control of the House was on a razor's edge,'' said Zimmer, who
defeated Pappas this month in a primary of former incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans see Holt's seat as one of their top priorities, and
each candidate expects to raise about $2.5 million in one of the
most expensive races. ``It's going to be difficult because Rush is
a bright, hard-working candidate,'' said Zimmer, a social moderate
who supports gun control and abortion rights. ``But I have a record
of being effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Back here in the rolling bluegrass country of central Kentucky,
Baesler and Fletcher offer a contrast in styles. Baesler, a former
University of Kentucky basketball star and mayor of Lexington for a
decade, has a country-boy manner and homespun humor. His favorite
jibe at Fletcher is that ``Ernie is all hat and no cattle.''
Baesler is so frugal that he slept on a cot in his Washington
office when he served in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher, 47, is a family doctor and former Air Force fighter
pilot with a polished presence. He concedes that Baesler is
well-known in the community, but more for what he did as mayor in
the 1980's than as a congressman in the 1990s. ``Folks see Scotty
as a fish out of water up here,'' Fletcher said.
</P>
<P>
   That's just a taste of the sniping in a rematch of a 1996 race
that Baesler won by 12 points. Even Baesler doesn't put much stock
in that margin. Fletcher was barely known and poorly financed then.
Now, he has built strong ties in his district and is amassing a
$1.5 million for his campaign. Baesler said he expected to raise
the same.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``You cannot imagine how nasty it's going to be or how expensive
it's going to be,'' Baesler told a $200-a-person reception in the
Governor's Mansion in Frankfort.
</P>
<P>
   The race has already taken a few weird twists. The state's
largest physicians group has supported a tobacco farmer (Baesler)
over a doctor (Fletcher). The doctors are angry at Fletcher because
he opposes the patients' bill of rights in Congress, but Fletcher
has the backing of cigarette manufacturers, whom Baesler has
criticized for buying foreign tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Baesler is a fiscal conservative who supports gun control and
abortion rights, two issues that Fletcher strongly opposes. The
National Rifle Association and religious conservatives have vowed
to defeat Baesler. Each side has traded radio ads, with a
television bombardment expected later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The election outcome will likely turn on rural areas like this.
Step inside Wright's Grocery, where Ronald Wright, the store's
61-year-old owner, recalls when Baesler made sure that Wright's
brother, stricken with leukemia, received his Social Security
checks on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I asked him for something and he helped,'' said
Wright. ``I'm going to vote for him.''

MOODIE WINS FIRST TITLE ON LPGA TOUR BY TWO STROKES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABSECON, N.J. _ Taking a two-shot lead into Sunday's final round
of the ShopRite LPGA Classic, Janice Moodie of Scotland remarked
that she had been ``chopping at the door'' on the tour without much
success.
</P>
<P>
   The door broke wide open Sunday afternoon when Moodie fended off
pursuit from a group of golfers, including Juli Inkster, and
captured her first tour victory. She shot two-under-par 69 in a
round that included three birdies and a bogey for a total of
10-under 203, winning $165,000 and leading the field each day.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Moodie won by two shots over Pat Hurst, who shot
64 to tie the lowest round of the final day, and Grace Park, who
had a 67.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday's victory in the $1.1 million tournament, the
richest 54-hole event on the LPGA tour, Moodie's best result in her
three years on tour was three second-place finishes.
</P>
<P>
   She gained her first victory by refusing to buckle when Inkster
tied her for the lead early in the round.
</P>
<P>
   After Inkster birdied the first hole and Moodie bogeyed the
second to bring about a three-way tie that included Hurst, Moodie
responded with consecutive birdies on the third and fourth hole and
never trailed after that. She had birdies in the 4-foot range at
Nos. 8 and 9 that put her ahead by two shots.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster, last week's winner of the McDonald's LPGA Championship
and twice the victor in this tournament, had bogeys on the fifth
and seventh holes. Moodie reached 10-under at the turn and had a
pleasant walk the rest of the way on the 6,051-yard Bay Course of
the Seaview Marriott resort.
</P>
<P>
   Her putter and short game were outstanding. She made a 4-foot
par saver at No. 10 and 6-footer at the next hole after blowing a
birdie attempt past a tough pin placement. Moodie also made par
savers in the 3- to 5-foot range at Nos. 13, 15 and 16. She pumped
her fist every time she made a putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I putted solidly the last eight or nine holes to save par,''
Moodie said. ``I just decided to ride with it. It was fantastic
walking up on 18 and getting that kind of reception by the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Inkster shot 70 and finished tied for fourth along with Michelle
Estill (68) and Vickie Odegard (70), who made the cut for only the
second time in her 16 events this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst, who won this year at the Electrolux USA Championship,
started the day at one-under, but birdies in five of the first
seven holes applied pressure on Moodie.
</P>
<P>
   The 64 by Hurst, the rookie of the year in 1995 after a
successful amateur career, was her best round of the year and tied
for lowest in the last round of this event, which celebrated its
15th anniversary. She had eight birdies and just one bogey, on the
second hole, the most difficult one on the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you told me at the start of the day I would finish in the
top 10 I would have been happy,'' Hurst said. ``To finish second is
really a bonus.''

WEAK NASDAQ DEBUT OF CHINESE STOCK DAMPENS INTERNET FEVER 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ The poor debut on Friday of the Chinese
Internet company Netease.com on the Nasdaq market has sent shudders
through China's young Internet entrepreneurs, many of whom see an
overseas listing as their only hope of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Opening at 15{, the American depositary receipts of Netease
floated modestly higher before dropping and eventually closing at
12[, a drop of nearly 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nasdaq isn't all golden as people had expected,'' said
Jennifer Lu, vice president of Stockstar.com, which operates an
online stock trading service in China.
</P>
<P>
   Droves of young Chinese have moved into online startups, hoping
that they will be able to list their companies on Nasdaq, the
market whose vast liquidity bolstered the development of the
Internet in the United States. And hundreds of millions of dollars
in foreign venture capital has poured into the country on the
strength of that same dream. But the dream may be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days when you can take a Chinese Internet concept and sell
it on Nasdaq are gone, gone, gone,'' said Michael Brownrigg, who
follows the Internet market in this country for Chinavest, a
venture capital firm based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Lu said China's Internet entrepreneurs were worried that their
companies' stocks, which had seemed to hold some value even amid
sour market periods for technology shares abroad, were being
scrutinized more closely. If so, many investors may not like what
they see.
</P>
<P>
   The message from Netease's offering is that U.S. investors are
not fooled by the smoke and mirrors that Chinese Internet companies
must use to sell their stock to foreigners. Netease was forced to
strip out its principal asset to win Chinese government approval to
list its shares abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers of the Nasdaq ADRs own a stake in a Cayman Islands shell
company with few assets beyond a handful of licensing agreements
with the Netease Web site, which offers e-commerce and information
services and is popular in China. The Web site itself is owned by
private investors, including Ding Lei, Netease's founder, who
recently resigned from the company.
</P>
<P>
   Lu said Chinese entrepreneurs were increasingly angry with
government regulators who have hobbled the young startups with such
byzantine rules, meant to prevent foreigners from owning stakes in
Chinese Internet content providers. The rules have slowed efforts
to list abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies were ready to list on Nasdaq months ago, when
investors' appetite for Internet stocks was still strong, but the
authorities in Beijing would not allow the companies to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the market opportunity was there, the policy wasn't,'' Lu
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, China's strict listing rules do not yet allow
profitless companies to sell shares on domestic stock markets, and
few private companies are granted approval to do so in any case.
That leaves China's fledgling Internet companies with few places to
raise capital.
</P>
<P>
   Netease's poor performance will most likely chill the already
cooling ardor among young, educated Chinese for the Internet
industry. Many companies have begun losing people who sense that
the future is not now. ``We see a lot of people beginning to worry
about the whole Internet world,'' Lu said. ``It's not easy to
attract people anymore from the traditional market.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before spinning off its chief asset, Netease lost $6.3
million last year on $2 million in revenue. By the end of March, it
had accumulated a loss of about $9.2 million, according to its
prospectus. One of the losers in Netease's initial offering is
Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corp. bought a 10 percent stake in the
company shortly before the offering.
</P>
<P>
   Netease's stock-price drop complicates the proposed offering of
a rival, Sohu.com, which raised the target price of its initial
public offering to a range of $16 to $19 a share from an earlier
range of $13 to $16. Like Netease, Sohu is incorporated outside the
country and has spun off its China-based assets to comply with the
rules effectively barring foreign investment in the Internet
content providers.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers in Hong Kong say that by raising its price
range, Sohu.com may be bluffing, hoping to give the impression of
strong investor demand and to create a buzz in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a dangerous gamble,'' said an Asian venture capitalist,
who suggested that with the initial experience of Netease, Sohu
would have to withdraw its offering or at least lower the price
range.

VIN SCULLY IS CERTIFIED CYBERSURFER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He works on a custom-made computer at his home
office, takes a laptop with him on the road and has access to more
Web-friendly hardware at the Dodger Stadium press box.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 72-year-old Vin Scully calls himself ``Internet dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, he understates his abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Four seasons ago, the Hall of Fame broadcaster started using the
Net as part of his research. He actually started Web surfing before
stats-driven partner Ross Porter broke down and joined the club.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe, but Scully, the master storyteller who
seemingly wouldn't need to even touch a mouse, has found a way to
use the Net to give him more material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, I don't have an addictive personality because I could
see going in there for information and never coming out,'' Scully
said before a recent Dodger game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not hooked. But it does come in handy. I can get on there
and in 10 minutes get as much as would usually take two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure this generation of announcers are the best informed
because of the Internet. When I started (in 1950), I'd walk into
the booth and the statistician would give me a yellow pad with the
lineup and next to that would be the player's average, his home
runs and RBI. And that's it. Not any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Platt, the Dodgers' Webmaster of the team's official site
(www.dodgers.com), has been Scully's Internet tutor from the
beginning, but it took some coaxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had been preparing the same way for 47 years and he said he
had it down pat,'' said Platt.
</P>
<P>
   But on Opening Day, 1997, the Dodgers were playing the Phillies.
Platt went to a few sites and printed out about 30 pages of
information on the opposing team within five minutes, then handed
the information to Scully. He was very impressed.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Platt was at Scully's home, hooking him up with a
computer and DSL line, then showing him how create bookmarks at all
the major sports sites in addition to Fastball.com and newspaper
Web sites across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Scully asked Platt for a laptop to take on the
road. Scully finds that he uses it more to research teams the
Dodgers don't often play _ such as Seattle, this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's very computer savvy now,'' said Platt. ``It's
testament to Vin's desire to always want to keep on top of things.
It's been a valuable tool for him.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Sharks not eating into tourism
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA BEACH, Fla. _ Wanda Boshers and her family arrived on
the sugar-white sands after an 8-hour drive from Nashville. As the
emerald-green water washed gently ashore, a wave of apprehension
swept over Boshers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always got into the ocean,'' said the 39-year-old
homemaker. ``But I'm not anymore. I'm not going to get ate up by no
shark. I'm keeping my arms and my legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not getting in it _ and neither are my babies,'' she said,
motioning toward her kids, 2-year-old Brandon and 5-year-old
Amber.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite two nearby shark attacks within the last month, marine
experts say the waters of the Gulf Coast are no more dangerous than
usual _ good news for beaches reliant on tourist revenue from the
Fourth of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a better chance of winning the Florida Lottery than
getting attacked by a shark,'' said George Burgess, director of the
International Shark Attack File at the University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Even Chuck Anderson agrees. He didn't hit the jackpot _ but a
bull shark ate part of his right arm June 9.
</P>
<P>
   While training for a series of summer triathlons, the
44-year-old assistant principal from south Alabama bumped into a
shark as he swam in the waters off Gulf Shores near the
Alabama-Florida line.
</P>
<P>
   Based on teeth marks left on Anderson, biologists estimate the
shark weighed 300 pounds and stretched more than 7 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's training partner, Richard Watley, also was bitten but
suffered lesser injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Warming up at 6:38 a.m., Anderson splashed past pier pilings
destroyed by a hurricane. He bumped into something. A log, maybe a
school of fish, he thought. He peered under the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see that fin coming at you and think, `Oh, shoot,' ''
Anderson recounted over the weekend. ``They tell you when a dog
chases you to holler, No! No! Well, I did that out of instinct and
thought, `Stupid, he can't hear you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson pushed off the shark's snout. He yelled to warn Watley
and another triathlete. On the first of three passes, the shark bit
the fingers off Anderson's right hand. The shark pushed the former
football coach to the bottom, 10 feet under water.
</P>
<P>
   On its final attack, the shark chomped down on Anderson's arm.
The bull shark pushed Anderson onto a sandbar, 15 yards from shore.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling on the sand and shallow water, the shark slowed its
advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually broke my own arm off,'' Anderson said. ``I heard
the snap of it. He was gnashing back and forth, like in the
``Jaws'' movie. Once it had broken off in his mouth, I made a
beeline for the shore.'' He'll have more surgery in about two
months, but he's kept his sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a Timex in his belly so when they do a commercial
about it I want my share of the royalties,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after Anderson and Watley were attacked, another bull
shark partially ripped the rear swim platform on a 22-foot pleasure
boat motoring west of Pensacola Beach. The boaters yelled at
swimmers to leave. Another bull shark beached itself 60 miles east
of Pensacola about the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of the attacks has made the rounds at the beach. But
tourists are undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   Inflatable dragons, pink water wings and silver air mattresses
bob on the waves with happy passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard about it but it didn't bother me. Most shark
attacks are overblown anyway,'' Alan Thompson, a 32-year-old sales
manager from Houston, said before paddling a rental kayak into the
Gulf with his toddler son.
</P>
<P>
   For the profitable Fourth of July weekend, the 1,200 hotel rooms
on Pensacola Beach are 99 percent booked, according to the chamber
of commerce. Nearly 60,000 people are expected to cross the bridge
from the mainland Tuesday for a day of frolic and a night of
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Pensacola Beach lifeguard Wes Holstman said his crew sees sharks
nearly every day from their salmon-colored wooden towers. Guards
see dark shark outlines cruise 40 to 50 yards from the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The locals know there are sharks out there,'' Holstman said.
``They're everywhere. Chances are real slim they'll attack. There's
some dispute whether shark sightings are more numerous than in
previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Drought in the Southeast may be luring sharks closer to shore.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of rain diminishes fresh water flow from rivers to the
Gulf. Water closer to shore is saltier than normal, meaning fish _
and sharks _ that prefer the salt of deeper waters can swim closer
to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement patrols, however, note no increase in shark
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Every year throughout the world, there are an average of 75
shark attacks, said Burgess, the marine expert. Of those, only
about 10 are fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Burgess said bull and tiger sharks are plentiful in the Gulf.
They're dangerous because their teeth ``have serrations like a
steak knife'' so they can carve up their prey.
</P>
<P>
   Villainous personalties popularized in ``Jaws,'' however, are
inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Jaws' movies were outstanding entertainment but
scientific flops,'' Burgess said. ``Sharks don't hold grudges. They
don't usually go after humans because they're not regular prey
items. There's no vendetta held by sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, remember as we use the sea, there's no guarantee that
it's going to be safe. It's not like the YMCA pool in Atlanta. It's
a wilderness. It's no different than going for a hike in the Rocky
Mountains and considering bears or going to the Serengeti Plain and
encountering a pride of lions. The ocean has its predators.''
</P>
<P>
   It's something Anderson considered every time he trained for a
triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I got in the Gulf, it still took five or 10 minutes
to get over the apprehension,'' Anderson said. ``It's like walking
across the street. You do it every day of your life and you know
someone could make a mistake and run you down. You just never think
it's going to be you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything wrong. I was just out swimming in his
house and he happened to bump into me.''

INDONESIAN RESCUERS FIND 10 PEOPLE THREE DAYS AFTER FERRY SINKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: No Byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ After nearly three days spent clinging to
floating debris, 10 survivors were rescued on Sunday after a
passenger ferry crammed with nearly 500 people sank off an
Indonesian island last week, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors, the only people found so far, were recovered in
waters off tiny Karakelong islet, about 125 miles northeast of
Manado, the port city where rescue operations were based.
</P>
<P>
   The six men and four women were exhausted, dehydrated and
sunburned, said Udiyanto, the chief of the National Search and
Rescue Agency's monitoring center in Manado, in North Sulawesi
Province.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were clinging to debris from the ship, and only some of
them were wearing life jackets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers also removed the body of one passenger who was part of
the survivor group but later died, Udiyanto said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 480 other passengers are still missing, and the
survivors said they feared that the rest must have gone down with
the ferry and drowned, according to Udiyanto.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors said the wooden hulled boat capsized on Thursday
afternoon after its captain radioed that it was taking on water in
a storm off the island of Sulawesi, about 1,440 miles northeast of
Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue ship picked up the survivors more than 60 miles north
of where contact with the ferry, the Cahaya Bahari, was lost, and
nearly 75 miles from shore.
</P>
<P>
   Navy ships steamed north Sunday evening toward the southern
Philippines hoping to find more survivors when rescue operations
resumed at daybreak Monday, said an official at the sea
communications monitoring center in Manado.
</P>
<P>
   The scores of relatives who have gathered at the Manado airport
awaiting news of the ferry were stricken on Sunday by the
confirmation that the ferry had actually sunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, we had been praying that the ship was still
afloat,'' John Girobus, whose mother was on board, told the
Associated Press. ``Now we know it has sunk and only a few people
have been rescued.''
</P>
<P>
   The ferry had set sail on Wednesday from the far eastern Maluku
islands with 492 passengers and crew, most of whom were refugees
fleeing fighting between Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry was licensed to carry about 250 passengers, Indonesian
search and rescue officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More than 2,500 people have died in an 18-month sectarian war
that prompted President Abdurrahman Wahid of Indonesia to declare a
civil emergency there a week ago. In addition, tens of thousands of
homes, buildings and places of worship have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Military and police units have been unable or unwilling to stop
the violence, and in some cases have joined the fighting, depending
on their religious affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   About 290 passengers aboard the Cahaya Bahari were Christians
who had survived an attack by Muslims on June 19 on the main island
of Halmahera.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 180 people were killed in that attack, the worst
massacre of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300,000 others have fled their homes since January
1999, prompting fears of a humanitarian disaster and prompting
calls from Washington and the Vatican for the Jakarta government to
stop the violence.

OFF THE WALL: SHAQ A HIT WITH JONATHAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   He sat on the sidelines with a cast on his left leg, the result
of a car accident the week before that killed his mother.
</P>
<P>
   But 12-year-old Jonathan Perez of Ventura, Calif., didn't want
to miss seeing Shaquille O'Neal on Thursday at the opening of his
Slam Basketball Camp for kids at Cal Lutheran University in
Thousand Oaks, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   When Shaq saw Perez, he pulled him aside and asked how he was
coping. Then he gave him a ride in his silver Lincoln Navigator _
one with a big ``S'' for Superman on the front grill and a vanity
plate that read MNOVSTL (translation: Man of Steel).
</P>
<P>
   Shaq also promised to send Perez a laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was amazing,'' the boy said. ``I was so nervous. But when
he asked about my cast, I knew he was a real nice person.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaq said it was what the Thousand Oaks camp was all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to put a smile of the faces of these kids,'' he said.

SCOUTS CANADA OK'S GAY TROOP AS LEGAL PROTECTION OF GAYS EXPANDS IN
CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ With knotted rainbow kerchiefs and maple leaf flag
patches on their khaki uniforms, members of Scouts Canada's Rover
Crew 129 stepped smartly down the route of this city's annual Gay
Pride Parade last week, drawing cheers from many of the 800,000
people here for the world's first official gay and lesbian scout
troop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our perspective that sexual orientation has no bearing on
the ability of a person to participate in or deliver our
programs,'' said Andy McLaughlin, spokesman for Scouts Canada, the
organization that authorized the gay troop's investiture two weeks
ago. He compared the new unit to other specialized troops in
Canada, such as ones for Mormons or Cantonese-speakers.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the United States Supreme Court ruled last
Wednesday that the Boy Scouts of America have a right to exclude
gays from their ranks because opposition to homosexuality was part
of the organization's ``expressive message.'' In the American
Scouts pledge, boys promise to be ``morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as the new gay and lesbian troop here indicates, the United
States shares North America with a country that is one of the
world's most tolerant regarding homosexuality. On Friday, a bill
became law in Canada that erases virtually all legal distinctions
between heterosexual marriages and same sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   Changing 68 federal statutes, the new law guarantees equality in
areas that include income tax filing, bankruptcy protection,
alimony, pension and veterans benefits for widowed spouses, and
prison conjugal visits. The bill does this by rewriting the legal
definition of ``common law marriage'' to include same sex and
heterosexual couples who have lived together for more than one
year. A separate bill, expected to be passed this fall, would
extend immigration privileges to same sex couples and their
dependents.
</P>
<P>
   In a concession to conservatives, the new omnibus law defines
marriage as ``the lawful union of one man and one woman to the
exclusion of all others.'' But today in Canada, the only remaining
privileges of marriage appear to be the ability to change family
names and to get divorced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation is about tolerance and fairness,'' Justice
Minister Anne McLellan said when she introduced the bill. ``Most
Canadians have decided that they want people in equal or the same
circumstances to be treated fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   The new laws came after five years of court decisions that were
largely based on a clause banning discrimination on the basis of
sexual orientation that is in Canada's Charter of Rights and
Freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative provincial governments, such as Ontario's, have
complied with these court decisions, erasing virtually all legal
distinctions between same sex common law unions and heterosexual
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually all differences are disappearing,'' said John
Fisher, executive director of Egale, Canada's largest gay and
lesbian lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Already, adoption by gay couples is legal in Canada's four most
populous provinces, Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec.
Last month, the city of Toronto went to court to seek a ruling on
whether it can issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Similar
court cases are under way in British Columbia, New Brunswick and
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, an Ontario judge ruled that a 1999 decision
allowing same-sex partners to request support payments may be
applied retroactively. The ruling came in a case of a gay couple
that split up in 1991 after 12 years living together.
</P>
<P>
   On the watch for anti-gay discrimination, the Ontario Human
Rights Commission in March fined a Toronto printer $3,350 for
refusing to print business cards and stationery for the Canadian
Lesbian and Gay Archives.
</P>
<P>
   On the Pacific coast, the Human Rights Tribunal of British
Columbia recently found Walter Gray, mayor of Kelowna, an interior
city, guilty of violating the province's human rights code for
omitting the word ``Pride'' when he proclaimed a municipal Lesbian
and Gay Day.
</P>
<P>
   A broadcast industry watchdog group recently ordered Canadian
radio stations to censor any anti-gay remarks by Laura
Schlessinger, a conservative family talk show host. In addition,
federal broadcast authorities are reviewing applications for a gay
and lesbian radio station and for a similar television station,
both to be located in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   These changes have met with only muted opposition in Canada,
with some of the most vociferous complaints coming from south of
the border.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Focus on the Family, the Colorado-based religious
group, published full-page ads in newspapers here criticizing the
bill providing for same-sex unions as ``an attack on every
traditional family and marriage in Canada,'' and warning that it
``would strip the institution of marriage of any special status in
Canadian law.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, about a dozen American followers of the Rev. Fred
Phelps, a preacher from Kansas, traveled to Ottawa to protest a
Supreme Court ruling that ordered Ontario to include same-sex
couples in the definition of spouse. The Americans burned a Maple
Leaf flag. When news first emerged six months ago that Scouts
Canada would authorize a gay troop, Phelps, a Baptist minister,
accused the Scouts of ``recruiting Canada's youth to filthy
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Scouts Canada and to members of the gay troop,
there have few complaints about the new unit. Scouts Canada, which
has about 150,000 members, said it got more negative reaction two
years ago when it admitted women. The only direct link between the
American and Canadian groups is their membership in the World
Organization of the Scout Movement, an umbrella group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bunch of people getting together to have fun, it's a
great way to meet new people,'' said Bonte Minnema, a 24-year-old
University of Toronto women's studies student who leads the Rovers
group, which is composed of a dozen men and women, aged 18 to 26.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the troop, or crew, recalled that when they
were teen-agers their scouting units ostracized them for being gay.
``After I had been out for a while, I started to feel uncomfortable
in Scouting,'' said Sara Evans, a 20-year-old documentary video
maker.
</P>
<P>
   Her partner, Elaina Evans, agreed, saying she spent 10 years in
the Girl Guides movement. ``When I was 16 and just coming out, I
had some severe homophobic experiences in Guiding,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple have a 4-year-old daughter whom they want to start
this fall in Scouts Canada's youngest program, Beavers.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiastic about Scouts Canada's plans to authorize a Beavers
group, known as a ``colony,'' for children of gay parents, Elaina
Evans added: ``It's important for her to be in contact with other
kids who have gay and lesbian parents.''

FORMER U.S. ARMS MONITOR NOW SAYS IRAQIS HAVE LITTLE TO CONCEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Scott Ritter, the former U.N. arms inspector
who quit two years ago charging that Secretary-General Kofi Annan
and American officials were undercutting efforts to disarm Saddam
Hussein, now says the Iraqis have no prohibited weapons of any
importance left.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the current issue of Arms Control Today, the journal
of the independent Arms Control Association in Washington, Ritter
says that the inspection team he served as an expert on concealment
had effectively rid Iraq of dangerous weapons by 1997. And he
argues that less aggressive monitoring of Iraq will now suffice and
that inspectors on any new team should not pursue access to Iraqi
presidential and security sites, which caused grave conflict with
Iraq in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter's article was written before American officials disclosed
that Iraq was rebuilding and testing a short-range missile system,
which is permitted under U.N. sanctions and does not appear to be
immediately threatening. But those reports appear to support
Ritter's thesis that while the missile tests may be legal, they are
the kind of activity that must be monitored on the ground to know
if the Iraqis are trying to go beyond what is permissible, or are
loading the missiles with prohibited warheads.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ritter said the purpose of his article was to
suggest a way to overcome a deadlock with Iraq that has left the
country without arms inspections for a year and half.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States has little support abroad for either
unseating Saddam, the Iraqi president, or continuing sanctions
indefinitely. The Russians, Chinese and French will no longer
follow America, he said, and Iraq is strengthened by the division
among the Security Council's five permanent members. ``I propose
that maybe people should take another look at the disarmament issue
in a way that's more satisfactory to all the parties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, the former executive chairman of the U.N.
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, which was responsible for monitoring
Iraq, said in a telephone interview that Ritter's assertions run
directly counter to the reports Ritter submitted when he was in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see one shred of evidence for these assertions,''
said Butler, an Australian arms control expert who is a diplomat in
residence at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Butler
has just published a book on his tenure at UNSCOM, ``The Greatest
Threat: Iraq, Weapons of Mass Destruction and the Growing Crisis in
Global Security'' (Public Affairs, 2000).
</P>
<P>
   ``Ritter's claim that it was evident then that nothing of any
importance remained is completely contrary to the advice that he
repeatedly and robustly gave me when he was on the staff,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Several expert panels formed by the U.N. inspection commission
as well as the Security Council also concluded that Iraq had not
adequately disarmed, particularly in biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, however, Ritter said that if he was considered
tough when he was an inspector, he was only carrying out a rigid
mandate from the Security Council. The days when international
inspectors could demand every scrap of Iraqi war materiel are over,
he added, and it is now time to adopt more pragmatic goals if there
is ever to be a resumption of inspections in Iraq. That meant
looking at what Iraq may have left qualitatively, rather than
quantitatively, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, who was routinely vilified by the Iraqis as the chief of
a band of ``cowboys'' who wanted to kick down doors, met with Iraqi
officials before writing the article. He said in the interview that
he never took the Iraqi vilification personally.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials themselves had told him that the sharp
criticisms were ``politics,'' he said. And he now adopts their
long-held demand that the lifting of economic sanctions should be
linked with the introduction of any new inspections.
</P>
<P>
   In his article, Ritter wrote that given the comprehensive nature
of the former monitoring regime, ``it was possible as early as 1997
to determine that, from a quantitative standpoint, Iraq had been
disarmed.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, Ritter's article says, ``Iraq no longer possessed any
meaningful quantities of chemical or biological agent, if it
possessed any at all, and the industrial means to produce these
agents had either been eliminated or were subject to stringent
monitoring. The same was true of Iraq's nuclear and ballistic
missile capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, however, a report after one of Ritter's visits
pointed to ``indisputable proof'' that Iraq was still concealing
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   In his article, Ritter uses the search for missing artillery
shells apparently filled with mustard gas as an example of the
wrong focus. ``A few hundred 155 mm mustard shells have very little
military value on the modern battlefield,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   His former boss, Butler, said in an interview that such a
critique of the inspections misses the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``UNSCOM never asserted that these shells were themselves
militarily significant,'' he said. ``What was made clear in our
reports to the Security Council was that so long as they remained
unaccounted for, the veracity of Iraq's overall declarations could
not be relied upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purpose in wanting those shells was to be able to bring to
final account, to verify, Iraq's overall claims,'' he added.
``Those shells represent a far wider question.''

BEGAY TAKES HARTFORD OPEN FOR SECOND CONSECUTIVE VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROMWELL, Conn. _ Notah Begay III accomplished something Sunday
that not even his former Stanford teammate Tiger Woods has done
this year on the PGA Tour. With a dramatic 23-foot birdie putt at
the 18th hole, Begay won the Greater Hartford Open to become the
first player to win tournaments in consecutive weeks this year.
Woods has won five over all and two consecutive starts, but none in
back-to-back weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It was Begay's fourth victory in less than two years on the PGA
Tour and followed his one-stroke triumph a week ago at the St. Jude
Classic in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   It was only appropriate that Begay, 27, whose four-under-par 64
Sunday gave him a 20-under-par 260 overall, a record for the
Tournament Players' Club at River Highlands course, would close out
his victory with a dazzling putt after Mark Calcavecchia had left
his 25-foot birdie attempt short by a foot. Begay's putter had been
a wondrous club throughout his round Sunday as he drained birdie
putts from 10 feet to his 23-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the highest of the high and the lowest of the low,''
said Begay, the only American Indian on the PGA Tour. ``To win two
tournaments in my first year on the tour last year and now two this
year _ that's been the high. The lowest of the low was the DUI
arrest and the week in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to Begay's arrest in his hometown of
Albuquerque, N.M., in January and a subsequent seven-day jail
sentence on a drunken-driving charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an uphill battle, and it's made me play with a lot
of spirit,'' said Begay, who played at No. 1, ahead of Woods, when
Stanford won the National Collegiate Athletic Association title in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Calcavecchia, the winner of nine PGA Tour events
and five international tournaments, including the 1989 British
Open, finished at 68. He had entered the final round three strokes
ahead of Begay, but Begay drew even with his fourth birdie at No.
7. Calcavecchia then fell behind by two strokes when he missed a
four-foot putt at No. 11 for a bogey and Begay knocked down a
20-foot birdie putt at No. 12.
</P>
<P>
   But Calcavecchia, playing with Begay, made up those two shots
when he eagled the 296-yard par-4 16th hole, which he drove with a
3-wood and then sank a 4-foot putt for an eagle. That put both
players even at 19 under par.
</P>
<P>
   After parring the 17th hole, both Begay and Calcavecchia pulled
their tee shots into a fairway bunker 171 feet from the 18th green.
But both recovered by drilling 7-irons to the green. Calcavecchia
then lagged his 25-foot putt short. Begay, putting right-handed _
he is the only player on the PGA Tour who putts from both sides,
depending on the lie _ then rolled in his 23-footer for his sixth
birdie of the day and for a victory worth $504,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in complete control today, and I played a very
well-rounded professional golf round,'' he said. ``And that last
putt was perfect _ it had perfect speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention perfect direction.
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia, who has not won since 1998, said he was
disappointed. ``But I don't feel I lost the tournament; he won
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Triplett, who fired a course-record 61 Saturday, shot a 67
to finish in third at 264.
</P>
<P>
   When Begay was asked if he would go for a third straight victory
next week in the Western Open _ something that has not been done
since Woods won three successive events last November _ he said,
``No, I'm going to Wimbledon to watch some guys play on the
grass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got to keep the Stanford streak going,'' he said,
adding that Woods ``won the U.S. Open and now I've won the last two
weeks, so he's got to win next week.''

TRIPPI SHOWS BREAKAWAY SPEED IN VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Trippi, the horse named for a onetime football star
who could run with breakaway speed, showed once more that he also
could run with breakaway speed when he rocketed past older
sprinters Sunday and swept the Tom Fool Handicap at Belmont Park by
4{ lengths.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sixth victory in seven starts this year for the
3-year-old son of End Sweep, his only loss coming when he finished
11th in the Kentucky Derby. After that, he came back to win the
Riva Ridge by nine lengths, and in the Tom Fool he dominated five
older horses with widening speed all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Among the rivals chasing him were two sons of Storm Cat: the
long-shot Cornish Snow and, another length back in third, Sailor's
Warning. And in fourth place came the second favorite, the
6-year-old Brutally Frank, making his 55th start after finishing
first or second in his previous seven races.
</P>
<P>
   Trippi, named for the Georgia running back Charley Trippi, is
owned by Cot Campbell's Dogwood Stable and trained by Todd
Pletcher. He also had a hot jockey aboard, Jerry Bailey, who won
his fourth race of the day in five starts and padded his lead in
the standing to 52 winners in 131 starts.
</P>
<P>
   The horses set some blazing fractions, too, dashing the first
quarter-mile in 22 seconds and the first half in 44 2/5 seconds.
And they completed the seven furlongs in 1:21 3/5, making Trippi 4
for 4 at the distance and 5 for 5 with Bailey in the saddle. They
were no surprise: Trippi paid $3.90 for a $2 bet to win, and went
home with $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't race as a 2-year-old because he had a virus in April
and then some shin problems in the fall,'' Pletcher said. ``But
he's getting bigger and stronger with each passing month.'' And
Bailey said, ``He's only 3, but he's got a lot of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 94th running of the Astoria, a sprint for 2-year-old
fillies, most of the sprinting was done by Raging Fever, who poured
it on for an 11\-length romp in a field of only four. At the
finish, they were spread out from here to there, with Rose Bay
second by 3 lengths over Best Mate, who had more than 9 on Zealous
Z.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hennig, who trains Raging Fever, scratched his other star
juvenile filly, With Ability, and kept both undefeated in four
starts. ``It's nice to keep With Ability in the barn and be
represented like this,'' he said in something of an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Raging Fever, a daughter of Storm Cat owned by Edward P. Evans,
ran the five and a half furlongs in 1:04 1/5 and paid $2.20 as the
favorite.

HUGE CROWDS TURN OUT IN CHALLENGE TO MEXICAN DYNASTY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Courted by a familiar but tainted dynasty yet
tempted by the prospect of historic change, Mexican voters turned
out in huge numbers Sunday to determine whether to jettison the
party that has dominated their country for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida Ochoa of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, was battling to become president and perpetuate his
party's rule, the longest in the world, against the challenge from
Vicente Fox Quesada of the National Action Party, a rough-spoken
rancher who appealed to Mexicans to opt for something different.
</P>
<P>
   Across Mexico, eager voters lined up before the polling stations
opened at 8 a.m. and often waited for hours in punishing heat. In
the most open elections ever held here, the balloting was generally
orderly but marred in several states by alleged pressure on voters
from the governing party _ which has a history of fraud _ and
disorganization that blocked many thousands of people from casting
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   After a fierce campaign that filled the television and other
media as never before, many voters said Sunday that they made their
decision only in recent days, suggesting that the undecided, who
were as much as 19 percent of the total in the most recent polls,
would determine the day.
</P>
<P>
   In many neighborhoods that long were PRI strongholds and among
working class Mexicans who were its most loyal followers, one theme
was recurrent: Mexico had to do something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a change, and I have been asking myself, when
is it going to happen?'' said Gustavo Sanchez, a 32-year-old auto
mechanic in Ecatepec, a huge proletarian suburb of Mexico City
where the PRI was once invincible. ``Our leaders need to know that
if they don't do the job right, we're going to get rid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   At mid-afternoon Jose Woldenberg, the president of the Federal
Elections Institute that is running the election, reported that
only 13 of 113,423 polling places nationwide failed to open because
of organizational problems, a historical record.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the presidential race, Mexicans also voted to renew the
Senate, with 128 seats, and all 500 seats in the congress, and to
elect two state governors and the mayor of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Based on surveys conducted by the polling firm Mitofsky
International with voters as they left the polls, Televisa, the
largest national television network, reported that Fox's party
crushed the PRI in the governor's race in central state of Morelos,
by 57 percent to 29 percent. The last campaign polls had showed
that the race was tied.
</P>
<P>
   Televisa's early polls also showed that Andres Manuel Lopez
Obrador, from the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, was _
as expected _ ahead in the contest for Mexico City mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, the leftist candidate in the
presidential contest, refused to unite with Fox in the battle to
oust the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo, voting in a public school near his
official residence, said, ``There's strong participation, a lot of
enthusiasm and great calm throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But things were not calm in the main square of the city of
Puebla, in central Mexico, where thousands of people lined up for
long hours at a special polling place set up for Mexicans who were
not in their home towns on election day.
</P>
<P>
   Before the polls opened, hundreds of army soldiers and
policemen, mostly in civilian clothes, crowded to the front of the
line at the one special station for out-of-town voters in Puebla's
crowded plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Since the special station had only 750 ballots to be cast, many
voters realized, after waiting for hours in line, that they were
not going to be able to vote. As the line stretched for six blocks
out of the plaza, angry and frustrated people began to suspect that
the PRI was pulling one of the election tricks for which it was
notorious in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fraud! Fraud!,'' the voters chanted as tensions mounted, ebbed
and mounted again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the PRI again,'' said Maria Guadalupe Corona Moreno, a
28-year-old manager of a textile factory from the state of
Guanajuato who was in Puebla on business. ``I've been waiting to
cast my vote for years,'' she said, waving her voter card, ``and
now it turns out this is just a piece of trash.''
</P>
<P>
   PRI voters in Puebla were also furious about being left out.
``Where is the democracy?'' said Maria Teresa Inclan Perez, who
said she supported the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   The special polling stations were set up for Mexicans who would
not appear on local rolls because they went to vote in places
different from where they registered. In regular polling places,
Mexicans were given ballots after matching their voter card with a
photograph against a list that included both their name and
picture. However, because of restrictions in the campaign laws,
only 715 special polling places were set up nationwide, with only
750 ballots each.
</P>
<P>
   In Iztapalapa, a vast working class borough of Mexico City,
dozens of policemen pushed into the front of the line at one
special polling place. The situation grew tense as voters behind
them realized that they were probably being squeezed out of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports from four states of registered voters whose
names did not appear on lists where they were supposed to, who were
sent to special stations. The lines were so long they never got to
vote.

U.S. PROBES AMERICAN OIL CONSULTANT'S ROLE IN PAYMENTS TO KAZAKH
OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal prosecutors are investigating whether an
American trade consultant funneled millions of dollars in payments
from major oil companies to Kazakhstan officials who are his
clients, according to a Justice Department document.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Justice Department asked Swiss authorities for
help in investigating the financial activities of James Giffen, a
consultant for trade deals in Russia and the former Soviet
republics.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, Giffen has been an important adviser to
President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, a role that has taken
on larger significance in recent talks between the oil-rich Central
Asian nation and the world's major energy companies. The inquiry
also comes as the United States, Russia and Iran are competing to
win Kazakh approval for oil export routes for the country's oil
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department suspects Giffen of depositing $60 million
in payments from units of major oil companies like Phillips
Petroleum, Amoco Corp. and Mobil Corp., into Swiss bank accounts on
behalf of Nazarbayev, as well as other Kazakh officials and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the money was then funneled to the officials
through shell companies in Switzerland and the British Virgin
Islands. The transfers took place between March 1997 and September
1998 and may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as
well as racketeering statutes, the document said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giffen was the intermediary in these transfers and used the
Mercator Corp., which he controls, to facilitate these transfers,''
according to a 17-page Justice Department document, signed by John
Harris, the acting director of the criminal division's
international affairs office.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department did not say whether the oil companies
themselves were also possible targets of the investigation, which
was first reported on Friday night on the Web site of The Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Giffen was traveling abroad Sunday and was not available for
comment. But Mark MacDougall, a lawyer at Akin, Gump, Strauss,
Hauer &AMP; Feld in Washington, who is representing Giffen, said he had
not been notified by the Justice Department of any inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mercator Corp. has had a long-standing official relationship
with the Republic of Kazakhstan and its emerging oil industry,''
MacDougall said in a statement. ``Although these transactions are
complicated, they have been documented in great detail and closed
with full disclosure to everyone involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Messages left at the Kazakh Embassy were not returned Sunday,
and no one answered at the Kazakh Consulate in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarbayev has been president of Kazahkstan since the huge but
sparsely populated former Soviet republic of 16.8 million people
gained independence in 1991. Under Nazarbayev's semiauthoritarian
rule, Kazakhstan has sought to exploit its large oil reserves to
build an economy independent from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, a consortium of nine foreign energy companies found
oil in a huge Caspian Sea field and began drilling to determine how
much exists. Nazarbayev was so optimistic at the time that he
predicted the field, called Kashagan, would help Kazakhstan export
as much oil as Saudi Arabia by 2015 _ 8 million barrels a day.

MICROSOFT TO REWARD ITS BEST AND BRIGHTEST ENGINEERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to reward its brightest technologists, Microsoft
plans to announce Monday that it has created a Distinguished
Engineer program, initially honoring 16 of the company's best
designers.
</P>
<P>
   Similar programs are already in place at Cisco Systems, IBM, Sun
Microsystems and Xerox as a way to reward engineers and scientists
who might otherwise leave research and development jobs for
management positions with greater financial rewards.
</P>
<P>
   In an electronic mail message sent to Microsoft employees on
Friday, the Microsoft chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, wrote,
``These appointments underscore Microsoft's commitment to our
technical people as key partners in the leadership of the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   The position entitles the Microsoft researchers to a financial
reward package that is similar to that received by the company's
vice presidents, said Deborah Willingham, the company's vice
president for human resources. ``We were trying to be sure that
great technical people know that they have the opportunity to
achieve the recognition that vice presidents receive inside the
company,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The company will add approximately four or five employees to the
list each year, she added.
</P>
<P>
   For Charles Thacker, a former Xerox and Digital Equipment
engineer who joined Microsoft three years ago and is now involved
in the company's effort to develop a tablet-like computer, the
program will have little effect on his day-to-day work activities.
</P>
<P>
   He said the program will principally be of value because it will
chart a path for technical employees at the company, which now has
a work force of more than 38,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It demonstrates to the technical people that you can stay on
the technical ladder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Thacker, who is the co-inventor of the Ethernet
office networking technology, those to be named Distinguished
Engineers include Butler Lampson, Charles Simonyi, Jim Gray and
David Cutler. All are well-known scientists and engineers who have
helped the company pursue advanced computer technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler, for example, came from Digital Equipment to lead a team
at Microsoft that developed the Windows NT operating system,
beginning in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The others who received appointments as Distinguished Engineers
are Mark Lucovsky, Wael Bahaa-El-Din, Anders Hejlsberg, Antoine
Leblond, Suryanarayanan Raman, Darryl Rubin, Brad Lovering, Lou
Perazzoli, Michael Toutonghi, Peter Spiro and Mohsen Al-Ghosein.

   NEW YORK _ After 25 years, my husband and I, who live in
Houston, decided to treat ourselves to a visit to New York. We made
reservations at the Plaza, packed our clothes and drove north. The
World Trade Center was looming on the horizon when I realized I was
still in travel jeans. ``I can't go into the Plaza dressed like
this,'' I wailed. My obliging husband steered into a service
station. I grabbed an overnight bag, darted into the restroom,
ripped off jeans and sneakers, donned navy suit, silk blouse,
heels.
</P>
<P>
   Later, we pulled up at the hotel's front entrance. As my husband
negotiated with liveried doormen, I pushed my way through the door
into the lobby, as elegant as I remembered it. Violin music wafted
from the Palm Court. The guests? Attired in jeans and cutoffs, they
looked more like delegates to a hobo convention than visitors to an
expensive hotel. The only person who was properly dressed was a man
with a badge pinned to his blazer pocket. Hurrying over, he thrust
an envelope at me and snapped, ``Take this to the manager's office
and then, for heaven's sake, go get your name tag.'' _ PAULINE M.

   BOOKSELLER'S ERRAND OF MERCY
</P>
<P>
   Linda Sterling received a frantic call from a cousin at St.
Vincent's Hospital. She asked for a particular inspirational book
to read before her operation, scheduled for that afternoon. Barnes
&AMP; Noble at Sixth Avenue and 21st Street had the book but delivery
wasn't possible that quickly. When the circumstances were
explained, the saleswoman said she lived near St. Vincent's and
would deliver the book herself on her way home. Sterling explained
that that, unfortunately, would be too late, at which point the
saleswoman said she would telephone the hospital and read some of
the book to the patient. She spent the next half-hour doing just
that. When Sterling's cousin returned to her room after surgery,
the book was awaiting her, together with a second book on the same
topic, inscribed from her new friend and a group of her Barnes &AMP;
Noble colleagues.

   SHOWING ON BROADWAY
</P>
<P>
   Fran Blazer got two shows for the price of one last month. She
was well ahead of curtain time for her Broadway show and stopped at
the corner of 45th Street where Broadway crosses Seventh Avenue. It
was early evening and in the middle of the intersection, a man was
on one knee, proposing to his girlfriend. That accomplished,
obviously with an acceptance, he placed a ring on her finger and
kissed her. A mounted policeman passing by stopped traffic and
another police officer on foot took the couple's camera and snapped
their picture. The happy couple then went on their way, Blazer went
on to her show, the policeman trotted off and traffic resumed. The
whole thing took place within the space of minutes.

   DUCK ROAMS GREENWICH VILLAGE
</P>
<P>
   Wolf Chanoff, my 2-year-old godson, and I first spotted the duck
the morning after a rainstorm in mid-June. He was standing on the
corner of 11th Street and Greenwich Avenue. He was not really a
very pretty duck, and he didn't do very much, like quack and waddle
_ which was the least Wolf was expecting from a real duck _ but
people seemed to go gaga over him. It was early on a work day, but
the duck gathered a concerned crowd. Bread crumbs were offered,
water was fetched, calls were made. Meanwhile passers-by would stop
and seemingly keep vigil as if the idea of spending time with the
duck before he was captured was important. Or they would just hang
out with the duck, kind of communing with nature. Wildlife at large
in the West Village.
</P>
<P>
   The duck, clearly an urban creature, then moved to Washington
Street between Bank and Perry. Wolf saves the soft inside of his
morning bagel to feed him; he's not the only one. The neighborhood
seems to be bonding over this duck. We discuss where he might have
come from, how he got here and why he stays, as well as what he's
eating and what will become of him. Every day there are missions
where the duck is officially stalked with a big net. This happens
while we watch, knowing it's best for the duck if he gets caught,
but fretting that the rescuers will be successful and take him
uptown to Central Park. Every time the duck escapes the net and
manages to fly away, there's a kind of silent cheer. Wolf shrieks,
``Duck, fly away.'' And I do myself, of course.

   GROWING GROCERIES
</P>
<P>
   Ronee Roffe is reconciled to the fact that her 3 1/2-year-old
granddaughter, Rebecca, will probably never be a farmer. Rebecca
and her father recently went out to the family's tiny patch of
green to plant seedlings. That evening, on the phone, Roffe asked
Rebecca what she had done that day. ``We were outside planting,''
she replied. ``What did you plant?'' Roffe asked. ``Groceries,''
Rebecca said.

   REMEMBERING BUTTONS
</P>
<P>
   One more button story: After my family migrated to this country
in 1938, one of my first jobs was working in a button factory _
dipping buttons. To supplement the family income, I took home
``homework.'' On steamy summer nights, the family went up to the
roof, equipped with a floor lamp with a long extension cord to be
plugged in at our apartment. Then we dipped buttons. The more
buttons we dipped, the more money we made. The buttons were white
and one part of the button was held between your fingers and the
bottom part was dipped in various colors of paint to achieve a
two-tone effect. The most memorable buttons were white with a
stamped red emblem we made for the New York World's Fair in 1939.

 &HT;    Voters in Mexico hoping for change
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Chihuahua _ Standing in a sun-baked parking lot
next to this border city's main bus terminal, Art and Claudia
Sotomayor spent their Sunday morning in what would be a failed
attempt to help choose Mexico's next president.
</P>
<P>
   They had left their home in El Paso, where they moved five years
ago for a better life, at 9 a.m. Sunday. Three hours later, simple
math told them they were too late: more than a thousand people were
in line ahead of them; the polling place had just 750 ballots.
</P>
<P>
   But like virtually everyone else in the snaking line _ mostly
Mexican citizens from somewhere else, drawn to Juarez or El Paso
for better-paying jobs _ they would not leave until the last ballot
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing you are seeing here is a lot of people wanting to
change the government,'' said Art Sotomayor, 28, who works as a
quality manager for one of the booming assembly plants, or
maquiladoras, that have sprouted in El Paso and Juarez. ``We're
going to stay until they say it's over. I tried.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard-fought presidential race had ignited Mexicans'
imagination as the frontrunners _ Francisco Labastida of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and Vicente Fox of the
right-leaning National Action Party (PAN) _ finished their
campaigns running neck-and-neck in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   In Juarez, roughly 750,000 registered voters filed into 1,379
polling places, each with 750 ballots. But only three of those were
so-called ``special'' polling places that accepted ``transitory''
voters casting ballots away from the district where they were
registered.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico does not allow absentee voting for its estimated 10
million citizens living in the United States and other countries.
Thousands were expected to make the trip across the border to vote
Sunday, but the fact that only 64 special polling places had been
placed along the border was expected to blunt their impact.
</P>
<P>
   At the bus terminal, the first voters arrived at 5:30 a.m., two
and a half hours before the polls opened, and waited up to five
hours to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of Mexicans in El Paso who want to come and
vote,'' Art Sotomayor said. ``There's a lot of people who want to
change things in this government, but you cannot because you can't
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   LIMITED POLLING SITES
</P>
<P>
   Under Mexican election law, up to 15 special election sites
could have been placed in Juarez _ enough to handle 11,250 voters.
But an agreement between the political parties left this city of
more than 1 million with just three sites. The sites closed by
early afternoon when their 2,250 ballots were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Javier Gonzalez, a PAN representative who monitored
polling places Sunday, said his party agreed to limit the number of
special polling places to reduce the chance of fraud by people
using fake voter cards. Regular polling places, unlike the special
locations, check voters against a list of people registered in that
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give the people from out of town the opportunity to
vote, but we don't trust the (PRI),'' Javier said.
</P>
<P>
   Across town at another special polling place, this one at a
graffiti-stained school with barred windows, a line that began with
50 people at 7:30 a.m. had swelled to more than 600 three hours
later. As the stacks of ballots dwindled, Hector Sandoval stood
patiently for his turn to cast a vote he hoped would change the
course of his country's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the young people want a change,'' said Sandoval, a
21-year-old student at the University of Texas-El Paso who was born
in Austin and has dual citizenship. ``Mexico is tired of corruption
with impunity, of fraud, of economic crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Those at the end of the line, which stretched for three blocks,
knew they had probably come for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know we're going to change the country with our vote, and
that's why I think they didn't want to expand the number of
ballots,'' said Emilio Lacedelli, 43, a native of Guanajuato state
who works in El Paso. ``Seven hundred and fifty ballots is
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther back in line, Servando Torres, 34, talked about leaving
his wife and three children in Oaxaca, a state in southern Mexico,
more than a year ago to look for work in Juarez. He sees them every
six months. Now he wanted to send a message to the government he
blames for Oaxaca's chronic poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want more of the same promises and promises,'' Torres
said. ``It's beautiful (in Oaxaca) but there's no work. My family
is disintegrating because of this, and it's the goverment's
fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the school, four election workers wrote down the name and
voter number of each person, handed them paper ballots, and pointed
them to a plastic voting stall with folding legs that could
accommodate two voters at a time.
</P>
<P>
   After marking their ballots, voters dropped them in the
appropriate boxes _ one for president, one for the Senate, one for
Congress _ before a worker punched a hole in their voter card and
marked their right thumb with indelible ink to discourage repeat
voting.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, tempers grew shorter in the sun. Inside, the
``president'' of the voting place, a volunteer named Adan Gamez
Tremillo, patiently listened to complaints about the snail's pace
and the hundreds of people baking outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be mad because there's not enough ballots,''
said Gamez, a baby-faced 27-year-old engineer at a Juarez
maquiladora. ``But there's nothing we can do.''

MEXICANS FROM THE U.S. LINE UP TO VOTE IN TIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>
   (With MEXICO-ELECTION)  
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico _ They began arriving before dawn, crossing
south over the border in cars and pickup trucks and small caravans,
with an unusual degree of optimism in their hearts and their voter
registration cards in their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   They were Mexicans who live in the United States returning to
elect a new president, drawn by the possibility that the somewhat
paradoxically named Institutional Revolutionary Party would lose
the presidency for the first time since it was founded 71 years
ago. Since Mexico does not have absentee ballots, they had to come
from as far away as San Francisco, Washington and Chicago to cast
their ballots at special polling places for out-of-district voters
that were set up here and in several other cities along the
2,000-mile border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want change,'' said Ramiro Ramirez, a 48-year-old
mechanic from Fontana, Calif., who arrived late Saturday night to
ensure that he would get a good spot in line at one of the special
polling sites Sunday. Ramirez, who left his home state of Michoacan
for the United States as a child, said he had made the trip Sunday
because he is thinking of his own future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all left because of the same problems,'' he said. ``But I
would like to go back someday. And if the government changes, if
things get better, if there's work, I will return.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time his turn came here, at 9 this morning, to pick up a
paper ballot, fill it out in a cardboard booth behind a plastic
curtain that said ``The Vote is Free and Secret,'' and stuff the
folded ballot into a cardboard box with a clear plastic window on
each side, roughly 250 people were waiting behind him, many of them
from California as well.
</P>
<P>
   Their polling place, outside an all-night drugstore, was one of
15 in Tijuana where Mexicans away from home could vote. They wore
cowboy hats and Dallas Cowboys hats, pearl-buttoned shirts and Hard
Rock Cafe T-shirts, cowboy boots and Air Jordans. They came, they
said, out of a belief that this year's election would be different
from those in the past that were tainted by fraud. An opposition
candidate, Vicente Fox Quesada, was virtually tied in the polls
with the nominee of the governing party, Francisco Labastida Ochoa.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is to be counted for the first time by an autonomous
group, the Federal Elections Institute, rather than by a branch of
the government controlled by the governing party. And many Mexicans
north of the border were the targets of advertising and even
campaign stops by the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think change is really possible this time,'' said Gabriel
Castellanos, 26, who arrived here at 6:30 a.m. after driving down
from Huntington Beach, Calif., with his wife, Miriam Sanchez, 19,
to vote for Fox. ``The government was pressured to hold elections
that everyone can believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Fausto Soriano, 60, who came from San Francisco with four
friends to vote for Fox, said, ``I think this will be a cleaner
election.''
</P>
<P>
   The election dominated Tijuana this weekend. There were the long
lines at polling places and the influx of voters from north of the
border, and most striking of all, there was no drinking allowed.
The government imposed a dry law until after the elections.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a switch for a place that began its rapid growth,
from a village to a city of 1.5 million people, during Prohibition,
when Californians made this a favorite place for a boozy weekend
getaway.
</P>
<P>
   Without the usual rowdy revelry, the voters stood out even more
than usual. The great fear expressed among them was that there
would not be enough ballots to go around; an old voting-law reform,
aimed at preventing fraud by ballot-stuffing, limits the number of
ballots at each polling place to 750.
</P>
<P>
   With only 15 sites in Tijuana where people could vote away from
home, the maximum number of ballots available to them here would be
11,250. And some of those would be cast by people who live in
Mexico _ soldiers, business travelers, people who moved but had not
registered their new addresses.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Jacqueline Vargas, 26, set her alarm clock at home
in Garden Grove, Calif., for 3:40 a.m. She was so worried about
oversleeping that she awakened on her own at 2:30. Vargas, who left
her home in Monterrey four years ago for a marketing job in the
United States, said she had followed the campaign online.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I graduated from the university, my aim was to move
abroad as soon as I could,'' she said. ``I didn't like the
situation either politically or economically. I didn't see much
future for myself there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans living in the United States were assiduously courted
for their votes this year for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The democratic process of Mexico is finally permeating north
of the border, making us Mexican citizens aware of what's happening
politically in our country,'' said Luis Pelayo, the president of
the Hispanic Council in Chicago, who helped organize several
caravans to cross the Texas border.
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated 10 million Mexicans who live in the United
States, 1.5 million are believed to be eligible to vote. No one
expected that many people to cross the border to vote _ in fact,
fewer than 75,000 ballots were available at the special polling
sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mexicans living in the United States were wooed not only
for their votes but for their influence. Many of them still hold
sway in the villages they left behind and with the families they
support with money each month. By some estimates, Mexicans abroad
send $7 billion home each year. They like to point out that this
makes them Mexico's third highest source of income, after petroleum
and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   When Vargas called home, she said, she was disappointed when her
father told her that he would vote for the governing party. ``He
just told me, `They've done so much for us,''' she said. ``I
couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a sore point among many Mexicans in the United States
that Mexico lacks an absentee ballot. A bill that would have
created one stalled last year in the Mexican Senate, which is
controlled by the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Ross Pineda, who lives in Chicago and is taking the unusual
step of running for the Mexican Congress this year to represent the
interests of Mexicans abroad, wrote a book on the issue called
``Vote Without Borders,'' to call for an absentee ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legally we are Mexican citizens; we have the right to vote, we
love Mexico, we have families there that we sustain,'' Ross said.
``We are not asking for any special privilege.
</P>
<P>
   But without the absentee ballot, many Mexicans living north of
the border simply took to the road. ``Look at this,'' said Hector
Alvarado, 45, a Cardenas supporter from Maywood, Calif., pointing
to a line of Mexicans from the United States that stretched nearly
an entire city block here. ``This isn't a rock concert or a
football match. These are people who want to vote.''

   ``How do you say the name?'' Sal Carr asked as he eased the
motorboat through the Marine Basin Marina in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
Saturday evening and out into Gravesend Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bat'kivshchyna,'' Taras Szczur said. ``Bat-keev-SHIYN-a.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr, a marina tenant who had agreed to take Szczur, the
Operation Sail 2000 liaison to the schooner Bat'kivshchyna, on a
reconnaissance ride around the harbor, tuned the radio to Channel
9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ummm, Bak-ta-chinn-ee,'' he called out to every vessel within
50 miles. ``Ukraine ship. Are you out there? Ukraine sail, are you
out there? Are you out there?''
</P>
<P>
   Carr released the talk button. ``They don't have a cell phone?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually they did. But it wasn't on. Or it wasn't working. Or _
come to think of it, Szczur (pronounced SHOOR) recalled, ``They
were asking me for a battery charger right before they left
Baltimore.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter. The Bat'kivshchyna would arrive. The captain,
Dmytro Biriukovich, would make sure of it. He had never lost faith,
not when the ship ran aground in the Dnieper River a few days into
the trip and lost a big chunk of its keel, as well as a toilet. Nor
when storms in the Mediterranean shredded the mainsail.
</P>
<P>
   Nor when the ship lost satellite phone service near Spain, nor
when the radio gave up the ghost somewhere in the Atlantic,
triggering a two-week oceanwide search by the Coast Guard. Nor when
a mysterious problem, either with the winds or with reading the
instructions for the Global Positioning System, caused the
Bat'kivshchyna to miss the opening parade of Operation Sail 2000 in
San Juan, Puerto Rico, by about 1,400 miles and end up in Norfolk,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's normal seaman problem,'' the captain, a courtly,
63-year-old in spotless whites and a skipper's hat, had said on
Wednesday as he stood on the deck in Baltimore. ``I don't like to
explain, `Oh, how it was hard, wah wah wah.' I found this way. I
have found it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's grand Parade of Sail through New York Harbor will
feature hundreds of the most imposing vessels on the planet, from a
371-foot Chilean barkentine to President Clinton's aircraft
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Bat'kivshchyna, the official, if utterly
unfunded, representative of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   A floating testament to either the indomitability of the human
spirit or the primacy of Murphy's Law, the Bat'kivshchyna, a
90-foot metal-hulled former fishing trawler dipped in cement and
topped with two masts, left Kiev on April 7 with a crew of 15,
counting the captain's wife and 14-year-old grandson. How it made
it across the Atlantic is still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``In yachting life,'' Biriukovich (beer-yoo-KOH-vich), a retired
civil engineer, had philosophized in Baltimore, ``some days bad and
some days good. We forget bad and remember good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bat'kivshchyna left Baltimore Thursday for a 200-mile run to
New York, a hop and a skip for a ship that had already covered
8,000 miles as the albatross flies. But though it was expected in
Brooklyn midday Saturday afternoon, there was still no sign of it
on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Kellogg, the captain's son-in-law, and (to his frequent
chagrin these last three months) the Bat'kivshchyna's one-man land
crew, was hardly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how it is with them,'' said Kellogg, 46. ``Everything
is ``Don't worry, be happy.' My father-in-law and his Jamaican
attitude.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ As the humane ``pillar'' of the U.N.
administration in Kosovo prepares to shut down, its job of
emergency relief deemed to be over, its director has some advice
for the next great international mission to rebuild a country: Be
prepared to invest as much money and effort in winning the peace as
in fighting the war.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis McNamara, the U.N. special envoy for humanitarian
affairs, regional director for the U.N. high commissioner for
refugees and a deputy to the U.N. chief administrator in Kosovo,
Bernard Kouchner, leaves Kosovo proud of the way the international
community saved lives here after the war, which ended a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara helped to coordinate nearly 300 private and government
organizations to provide emergency shelter, food, health care and
transport to nearly 1 million Kosovo Albanian refugees who have
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Despite delays in aid and reconstruction, including severe
shortages of electricity and running water, no one is known to have
died here last winter from exposure or hunger. Up to half of the
population _ 900,000 people a day _ was fed by international
agencies last winter and spring, and a program to clear land mines
and unexploded NATO ordnance is proceeding apace.
</P>
<P>
   But McNamara, 54, a New Zealander who began his U.N. refugee
work in 1975 with the exodus of the Vietnamese boat people, is
caustic about the continuing and worsening violence against
non-Albanian minorities in Kosovo, especially the remaining Serbs
and Roma, or Gypsies. He says the United Nations, Western
governments and NATO have been too slow and timid in their
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was from the start an environment of tolerance for
intolerance and revenge,'' he said. ``There was no real effort or
interest in trying to deter or stop it. There was an implicit
endorsement of it by everybody _ by the silence of the Albanian
political leadership and by the lack of active discouragement of it
by the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Action was needed, he said, in the first days and weeks, when
the old images of Albanians forced out of Kosovo on their tractors
were replaced by Serbs fleeing Kosovo on their tractors, and as it
became clear that the effort to push minorities out of Kosovo was
continuing and organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not why we fought the war,'' McNamara said. He noted
that in recent weeks there had been a new spate of comments by
Western leaders, including President Clinton, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and the NATO secretary-general, Lord Robertson,
warning the Albanians that the West would not continue its support
for Kosovo if violence against minorities continued at such a pace
and in organized fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But previous warnings and admonitions have not been followed by
any action, McNamara noted. In general, he and others suggested,
there is simply a tendency to put an optimistic gloss on events
here and to avoid confrontation with former guerrillas who fought
for independence for Kosovo, or with increasingly active gangs of
organized criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This violence against the minorities has been too prolonged
and too widespread not to be systematic,'' McNamara said, giving
voice to views that he has made known throughout his time here.
``We can't easily say who's behind it, but we can say we have not
seen any organized effort to stop it or any effort to back up the
rhetoric of tolerance from Albanian leaders with any meaningful
action.''
</P>
<P>
   In the year since NATO took over complete control of Kosovo and
Serbian troops and policemen left the province, there have been
some 500 killings, a disproportionate number of them committed
against Serbs and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But there has not been a single conviction. The judicial system
is still not functioning, and local and international officials
here say that witnesses are intimidated or killed and are afraid to
come forward, pressure has been put on some judges to quit, and
many of those arrested for murder and other serious crimes have
been released, either because of lack of prison space or the
inability to bring them to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently has the United Nations decided to bring in
international prosecutors and judges, but finding them and
persuading them to come to Kosovo has not been easy. And foreign
governments have been very slow to send the police officers they
promised to patrol the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some 3,100 of a promised 4,800 have arrived, although
Kouchner wanted 6,000. The big problem, McNamara said, is the
generally poor quality of the police officers who have come, some
of whom have had to be sent home because they could neither drive
nor handle their weapons. And coordination between the police and
the military has been haphazard and slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West should have started to build up institutions of a
civil society from day one,'' McNamara said. ``And there should
have been a wide use of emergency powers by the military at the
beginning to prevent the growth of this culture of impunity, where
no one is punished. I'm a human rights lawyer, but I'd break the
rules to establish order and security at the start, to get the word
out that it's not for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the NATO troops that form the backbone of the U.N.
peacekeeping force here were too cautious about breaking down the
artificial barrier created by the Serbs in the northern Kosovo town
of Mitrovica, McNamara said.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Mitrovica is now inhabited almost entirely by Serbs,
marking an informal partition of Kosovo that extends up to the
province's border with the rest of Serbia, creating a zone where
the Yugoslav government of President Slobodan Milosevic exercises
significant control and infuriating Kosovo's Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having allowed Mitrovica to slip away in the first days and
weeks, it's very hard to regain it now,'' McNamara said. ``Why
wasn't there strong action to take control of Mitrovica from the
outset? We're living with the consequences of that now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, as attacks on Serbs have increased again
in Kosovo, Serbs in northern Mitrovica have attacked U.N. aid
workers, equipment and offices, causing McNamara to temporarily
pull aid workers out of the town. After promises from the effective
leader of the northern Mitrovica Serbs, Oliver Ivanovic, those
workers returned.
</P>
<P>
   Another significant problem has been the lack of a ``unified
command'' of the peacekeeping troops, McNamara said. Their overall
commander, currently a Spanish general, cannot order around the
troops of constituent countries. Washington controls the American
troops, Paris the French ones, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   And there are no common rules of engagement or behavior in the
various countries' military sectors of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disparities in the sectors are real,'' McNamara said. And
after American troops were stoned as they tried to aid French
troops in Mitrovica last spring, the Pentagon ordered the American
commander here not to send his troops out of the American sector of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pentagon denies a blanket ban, officers in the Kosovo
peacekeeping operation support McNamara's assertion. They say no
commanders here want to risk their troops in the kind of
significant confrontation required to break down the ethnic
barriers of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has had difficulties of organization and
financing, McNamara readily acknowledges. ``But governments must
bear the main responsibility,'' he said. ``Governments decide what
the United Nations will be, and what resources governments commit
to the conflict they won't commit to the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Governments want to dump problems like Kosovo onto the United
Nations to avoid responsibility, he said. The United Nations should
develop ``a serious checklist'' of requirements and commitments
from governments before it agrees to another Kosovo, McNamara said,
``and the U.N. should be able to say no.''

AN ANXIOUS VIGIL IN MEXICO'S POLITICAL TRENCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MEXICO-ELECTION, MEXICO-BORDER) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORIZABA, Mexico _ Deep in the trenches of Sunday's elections,
Gerardo Mellado served his party as a sort of 911 operator, manning
a two-way radio that crackled with calls for help from the rural
communities in the mountains that surround this city of 120,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   The elections were expected to be the freest, most transparent
political contests in Mexican history. And Mellado, of the
opposition National Action Party, known as PAN, aimed to protect
each ballot cast for his side from the kind of chicanery that many
say has helped to keep the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, in power since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   ``I copy, I copy,'' Mellado told a caller from Mariano Escobedo,
a farming village. ``They are letting people vote without the
proper credentials? I am sending a lawyer with a videocamera right
away. Do you copy?''
</P>
<P>
   In the contest between the PAN candidate for president, Vicente
Fox, and the candidate for the PRI, Francisco Labastida, some of
the most ferocious conflicts have arisen in places like this,
situated at the western edge of the state of Veracruz. Most of the
cities in this state, including Orizaba, have PAN mayors. But due
to the steadfast support for the PRI in the rural communities, the
governor of Veracruz, Miguel Aleman, is a member of the PRI, as are
most members of the state's congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   For Fox and the PAN's candidates for Congress to win Veracruz _
the state with the third-highest number of eligible voters in
Mexico _ workers like Mellado focused on safeguarding their party's
small, but growing, rural support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The votes out there will mean the difference between winning
and losing for us,'' said Francisco Briseno Cortes, who is
president of the PAN in Orizaba. ``The PRI still has a lot of ways
to try to manipulate the people out there, because they are
isolated and afraid. So we have to make sure we watch over the
brave minority who support us.''
</P>
<P>
   Local leaders of the PRI, like Rudolfo Freeman, were just as
determined not to lose any of the territory that has been one of
their party's bastions of power _ the poor, little-educated
communities that live mostly on their crops and on government
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the PAN governs has not convinced the people in the
countryside,'' Freeman said, before hopping into a car full of PRI
campaign workers to go and monitor rural polling places. ``We are
going to win, and we are going to win by more votes than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many polls opened at least half an hour later than
scheduled, voting around Orizaba proceeded without any significant
disturbances reported. Over the radio, PAN and PRI officials
exchanged numerous accusations of coercion and manipulation of
voters, but when pressed for proof neither side had any to offer.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks prior to the election, however, the campaigns had
been explosive. Just over a week ago, the mayor of Orizaba, a
surgeon and PAN member named Angel Escudero, seized a truckload of
4,500 sheets of metal sent to the city by the PRI governor, Aleman.
The metal, marked for the attention of the ruling party's candidate
for Congress, was to be distributed to poor farmers for mending
their ramshackle homes.
</P>
<P>
   PRI officials called the delivery ``a coincidence.'' Escudero,
65, said: ``It was a crime. We had always known the PRI used
government supplies to try to buy votes, but now we had proof.''
</P>
<P>
   After Escudero intercepted the metal, local PRI leaders led
protests that shut down the city hall for two days. Demonstrators
threw eggs at the windows of Escudero's small hospital and another
angry mob tried to enter his home.
</P>
<P>
   Another heated clash erupted just hours before the polls were to
open Sunday over whether PAN members with radios and cameras had a
right to keep watch on the trucking company of a PRI candidate the
opposition suspected of shipping food and building materials to
poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
   By the time polls opened, officials in both parties had taken up
positions in even the farthest election outposts.
</P>
<P>
   Some 300,000 people live in the communities of brightly painted
concrete block houses _ known to residents by the color of their
exteriors rather than by addresses _ outside Orizaba and at the
base of the tallest volcano in Mexico. They are mostly farmers, who
grow flowers, potatoes and corn on a few acres. A few residents
work from home as butchers or seamstresses, or operating taco
stands or minimarkets. Most of those interviewed said they earned
less than $4 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Almost unanimously, they complain about living in poverty and
about feeling abandoned by the government _ except at election
time. In a sign of the growing popularity of opposition parties,
many of them expressed desires for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents have supported the PRI as long as I have been
alive, and we live in the same misery as always,'' said Alvaro
Gonzalez, 24, a member of the PAN who hopes to run for mayor of
Mariano Escobedo later this year. ``Most of us make just enough to
eat. So when our children say they want to go study at a
university, we know that such things are impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 400 residents of Mariano Escobedo started election day
at church, where the Rev. Ruben Gomez told the congregants that
their votes were worth much more than the bread, clothes or
construction materials they had been offered.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Quijano, a 32-year-old potato farmer, said he would
vote for the PAN. In front of the church, he pointed to a simple
block of a building with no windows and a collapsed roof. That, he
said, was where his two children went to school. He said he had
paid _ in vain _ at least $15 over the last six months to local
officials to help repair it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what promises the PRI will make, I will not vote for
them,'' he added. ``They cannot deceive me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   There seemed to be more support for the PRI a few miles away, in
La Perla. Many people leaving the polls said they supported the
ruling party. And Adrian Esteban Jimenez, the local mayor, was not
ashamed to say that government assistance was key.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a flat tire on my truck, and a friend came to help
me,'' he said, ``then I am obligated to help that friend when they
ask me, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Duran had walked six hours to vote in La Perla, and was
still unsure whom he would pick. He said he was frustrated by the
lack of technical support from the government to poor farmers like
him. Yet he was unconvinced that life would change if he voted
against the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people are talking about change,'' he said. ``But I do
not know if change is going to be good or bad. What if I vote for
change and our lives get worse?''

 &HT;    Hyperactive sun disrupts high-tech Earth
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The northern lights, including rare, red colored
auroras, have been seen as far south as Alabama. In Alaska and
Greenland, radio frequencies used by aviators and mariners have
suffered sudden fadeouts. NASA, worried that unusual heating of the
Earth's atmosphere was dragging down its space station, had to use
the space shuttle to boost it to a higher altitude.
</P>
<P>
   It is the summer of the hyperactive sun, solar maximum, Cycle
23. Every 11 years, the storms that rage across the superheated
surface of the sun reach a peak, flinging charged particles and hot
gases into space with predictable _ and sometimes unpredictable _
effects on the wired world that inhabits the third rock from the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solar activity is likely to peak in the next month or two,''
says Ernest Hildner, director of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration Space Environment center in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``But every cycle is different,'' Hildner says. ``We never know
for sure what's going to happen, but we do know for certain that,
with our growing dependence on satellites and wireless
communication, we are more vulnerable to this kind of activity than
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   When solar activity last reach its peak 11 years ago, fewer than
a million cell phones were used in the United States. Today, more
than 40 million are used. Back then, one million pagers were in
circulation. Today, 50 million are out there. And high above the
earth's protective atmosphere, exposed to the vagaries of the
storms on the sun, more than 600 commercial and military satellites
now provide the world with telephone service, television,
navigation, and weather reports.
</P>
<P>
   As July begins, more than 160 sunspots _ dark areas of
turbulence that provide a general indicator of what's happening
deeper inside the sun _ pimple the face of the sun. At the last
solar minimum in 1996, there were virtually none.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a scale from zero to nine, we've moved into the sevens,''
says David Speich, a solar physicist at the Space Environment
Center in Boulder, Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Activity is likely to continue _ perhaps even increase _ over
the next few months. Potentially disruptive activity often
continues for a year or two after the peak.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Earth has avoided any major effects from the sun's
sporadic eruptions, which can unleash the power of a million 100
megaton bomb. But what is merely a modest blip of energy on the
surface of the sun can have major effects on Earth, even across 93
million miles of space.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, for instance, a large prominence erupted on the
northwest edge of the sun, flinging a billion ton cloud of
electrified hydrogen gas _ known to scientists as a coronal mass
ejection _ off into space at a million miles an hour. Earth was
nowhere in its path, so the event was of interest only to solar
physicists.
</P>
<P>
   But Earth was in the path of two major solar flares on June 6 _
one of the few to be rated a maximum as Class X flare this year.
Because the burst of energy and billions of tons of electrified gas
took more than two days to reach the Earth, satellite operators
were able to take precautions to protect their satellites. Short
wave radio transmissions were disrupted for an hour or so, but no
other major effects were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the sun's effects are predicted. On April 6, a brief,
but intense geomagnetic storm send a surge of current rippling
through the New England power grid. Because it was brief, there
were no serious power outages.
</P>
<P>
   But electric utilities are watching the situation closely this
summer. With demand for power already straining capacity, any major
disruption could have far reaching effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they are closer to the Earth's north magnetic pole,
the utilities in New England and Canada are most likely to be
directly effected by one of these geomagenetic storms,'' says Bill
Feero, former head of the Electric Power Research Institute's
Sunburst project, which tracks the effects of solar disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the national grid is now so tightly tied,
that there is always the danger that if we lose a piece of it in,
say New England, we could be in danger of losing the whole thing.
If one of these hits, it will find our weak spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Utilities got a taste of what can happen during the last solar
maximum. On March 13, 1989, a magnetic storm triggered by a huge
solar flare disrupted the entire Hydro-Quebec electrical system,
knocking out power to six million customers and damaging electrical
transformers as far south as New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Hydro-Quebec has spent over $1 billion since then to prevent a
recurrence of the problem. Oak Ridge National Laboratory in
Tennessee has estimated that a slightly larger solar-induced outage
could cost the U.S. economy up to $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Disruptive space weather is blamed for about 150 malfunctions,
mostly minor ones, of government satellites a year. So far, no
major failures have been linked to fast moving, highly energetic
particles, ``killer electrons,'' unleashed by this year's solar
storms.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of even a single satellite, however, can have
far-reaching effects. When an unknown problem _ space debris, an
internal failure, or perhaps solar activity _ knocked out
PanAmSat's Galaxy IV communications satellite in 1998, it
interrupted network television feeds and more than half the
country's pagers.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of being ``fried'' by high-energy electronic isn't the
only risk that satellites face. As ultraviolet radiation increases
with the solar maximum, it heats the highest, thinnest layers of
the Earth's atmosphere, which puffs up like a balloon.
</P>
<P>
   As the atmosphere inflates, it exerts increased drag on orbiting
satellites, which eventually must be boosted to a higher altitude.
In May, the space shuttle was used to raise the orbit of the space
station, which had been slipping lower about two miles a week, by
27 miles _ enough to keep it safely circling the globe for several
months in spite of the denser upper atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's failure to anticipate the effect led to the premature of
its Skylab space station. Launched it 1973, it was supposed to stay
aloft until the 1980s. But increased drag caused by solar activity,
led to its premature rentry in 1979, raining 100 tons of debris
over the Indian Ocean and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   When astronauts take up permanent residence on the space
station, accurate forecasts of solar eruptions, which are
accompanied by potentially harmful increases in gamma and X-ray
radiation. On several occasions, NASA has rescheduled space walks
to avoid having its astronauts outside during such an event.
</P>
<P>
   In June, researchers announced a new model of solar activity,
used to predict the June 6 flares, will make it possible, for the
first time, to narrow the expected time when the gas cloud will
strike the earth to within a half day _ a big improvement over the
best previous estimates or two to five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new model will greatly benefit people who operate systems
affected by space storms,'' says Dr. Natchimuthuk Gopalswamy,
senior research associate the National Academy of Sciences. ``It
will allow operators of sensitive systems to take protective action
at the proper time and minimize the unproductive time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnetic signatures of sunspots can tell us which ones are
most likely to develop,'' says David Hathaway, a solar physicist at
the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. ``But it's
a little like trying to predict tornadoes. We recognize which
thunderstorms are apt to produce a tornado, but we still can't tell
ahead of time where or when it will strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists would also like to know what _ if any _ effect the
solar cycle has on Earth's weather. This year, for instance, saw
the warmest spring on record in the United States and a summer
drought that shows no signs of abating, but most researchers say
it's probably only a coincidence that it's happening during the
peak of solar activity.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term variations in the earth's climate, however, may be
linked to the solar cycle. Europe's unusually cool ``year without
summer'' in the 17th Century, for instance, coincided with a period
of extremely low sunspot activity -- and many researchers have
found hints of 11-year and 22-year fluctuations in climate that may
reflect the ebb and flow of activity on the sun.

<P>
   KFAR KILA, Lebanon _ It was a fine, sunny day Sunday and
thousands of people flocked to Lebanon's newest tourist attraction
_ the barbed wire fence at the new, official border with Israel _
for a stroll with the kids, a chance to pose for pictures and
videos or even throw a stone or two in the general direction of the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   By late morning, festive flag-bedecked cars and buses jammed the
narrow roads, pock-marked by artillery, that wind through the steep
stony hills of the strip of southern Lebanon that Israel and its
proxy militia had occupied for more than two decades. Lebanon,
alone in the Arab world, has Sunday as its day of rest, a tradition
of its Christian-led government.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way from Beirut, many of the village squares were
decorated with broken-down armored cars or old artillery pieces,
now plastered with Hezbollah posters, left behind when the South
Lebanese Army, the Israeli-sponsored militia, fled in the wake of
Israel's abrupt pullout in May.
</P>
<P>
   Bright yellow Hezbollah flags flew over all the old SLA and
Israeli strongholds and gun positions, but there was no sign in the
streets of armed militiamen or the once-common checkpoints. In the
past few days, new yellow roadside signs have sprouted, marking
places where Israeli patrols were ambushed by the Hezbollah, or
where it lost some of the 1,200 resistance ``martyrs,'' as the
Islamic militia calls the fighters lost doing battle here.
</P>
<P>
   A mock-up of a Katyusha multiple rocket launcher, made of
plastic piping with Sohat mineral water bottles painted red posing
as missile tips, has been set up by the entrance to the walk along
the border. The model was the subject of urgent phone calls between
military officials on both sides of the border and U.N.
peacekeepers before assurances were given that it was a fake.
</P>
<P>
   In true Lebanese fashion, merchants have sprung up around it: a
soft ice cream truck, a couple of makeshift restaurants, stands
selling clothing and watches and tapes of resistance songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God, business is good,'' said Mahmoud, a hefty, bearded
fighter turned merchant at what appeared to be the authorized
Hezbollah souvenir stand, directly across from the fortified
Israeli position at the Fatma Gate, where they used to let their
SLA allies enter Israel. ``Especially on Sunday. All the day is
like this, crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah baseball caps in yellow, red or blue were selling for
two U.S. dollars, the preferred currency. There were small yellow
Hezbollah flags for $2, bigger ones for $3, along with T-shirts,
key chains, recordings and other nicknacks. But even this shop had
no monopoly on framed pictures of the Hezbollah leader Sheik Sayyed
Hassan Nasrullah; They were everywhere, showing the sheik looking
thoughtful, waving a rifle or talking on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Near the gate, Jalal Hammoud _ who had grown up here, been
jailed and expelled by the SLA, and returned last month _ happily
tended the gas-fired oven in a cargo container marked ``Bakery of
Liberation'' that he had moved down from Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my village, I was born and lived here,'' he said, making
manoushee, a traditional thin, flat bread, topped with thyme,
cheese or meat. ``Now we are happy. And business is good,
especially Sunday because thousands of people come from Beirut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to Hezbollah,'' read a banner stretched near the
entrance, and the Shiite Moslems here, the constituency of the
Party of God, took particular pride in what the sheik and his men
have trumpeted as the sole Arab victory over the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, it is a kind of a promenade, a walk along the
barbed wire lined fence looking into the Israeli positions. There
were troops of Shiite Muslim boy and girl scouts, the girls with
light blue smocks and darker head coverings. For women, the styles
ranged from full black Iranian-style chadors to flashy open-toed
spike heels. People took pictures of each other along the fence,
videotaped everything in sight and climbed on buildings for a
better view.
</P>
<P>
   But someone _ apparently, a member of the Hezbollah _ had also
thoughtfully dumped piles of rocks at convenient intervals along
the walkway and many, particularly young men, hurled them over the
fence. Except for a rare Humvee on a quick patrol of the dirt road
next to the fence, there were no Israelis in sight. Still, the
stone-throwers seemed to find it a satisfying exercise. One 7-year
old girl, Tamara Hajji, came from near Zahle with a slingshot in
her back pocket, and her parents clustered around encouragingly as
she took aim.
</P>
<P>
   Among the crowd, there were also many Palestinians living in
Lebanon _ including one group of 234 from the Bekaa valley. Beneath
their stone-throwing bravado is a fear that they are being left out
of the maneuvering toward some sort of Middle East peace, as well
as a bitterness at the way they are treated here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out, get out,'' screamed an elderly Palestinian woman,
awkwardly heaving a rock at the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from Dearborn, Mich., Abed Hussein, a Ford Motor worker,
took in the scene with his daughters, Nancy, 19, who wore a white
headscarf with her red Tommy Hilfinger jersey, and Zinab, 17, in
tow. The whole scene, Zinab said, made her feel ``proud.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He had come with the girls to visit his 82-year-old father, Abed
Hussein, who had fled his home in Israel in 1949. The elder Hussein
still lives near Sidon, where he raised the next generation of his
Palestinian family.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen members of the extended family piled into a green
van, the girls trailing Hezbollah flags out the windows, and drove
through back roads until they found an old border post left over
from the days of the British and French mandates, Ali Hussein
videotaping all the while. By the old wrecked gate was a Hezbollah
outpost, manned by a couple of riflemen. Up the hill stood an
Israeli watchtower. Here, the old man could point to the village
where he grew up, Malkiya.
</P>
<P>
   One man dug up some of the soil and put it in a plastic bag to
take home. Another car pulled up to the lonely spot with another
Palestinian family from Dearborn. Someone put one of the resistance
cassettes they had just bought in the car's player and soon they
were all holding hands, dancing in a circle to the strong beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my father's father's father's land,'' the old man
said, pointing past the barbed wire. ``The fig and olive trees are
all the same. When I see it, it is like a knife cutting my
stomach.''

MEXICAN TV NETWORKS PREDICT CHALLENGER WILL WIN BY WIDE MARGIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Adds overall polling results showing Fox ahead. Expands from
earlier version.)  
 By JULIA PRESTON

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Courted by a familiar but tainted dynasty yet
tempted by the prospect of historic change, Mexican voters turned
out massively Sunday to determine whether to jettison the party
that has dominated their country for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the polls closed, the two major national
television networks, and the newspaper Reforma said Vicente Fox,
the main opposition challenger, was leading over Francisco
Labastida of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was
battling to become president and perpetuate his party's rule, the
longest in the world, against the challenge from Fox of the
National Action Party, a rough-spoken rancher who appealed to
Mexicans to opt for something different.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the results of surveys based on interviews with voters as
they left the balloting places all over Mexico, Televisa, the
largest television network, predicted at 8 p.m. that Fox would win
an upset triumph by a strong margin. In the survey, conducted by
the firm Consulta/Mitofksy, Mexico was divided into five regions,
and Fox was leading in four. In the Mexico City area, with the
largest number of voters of the five, Fox beat Labastida by 43 to
30 percent, and in northwestern Mexico he won by 49 to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from either Fox or the PRI. A
preliminary official tally, based on actual returns, was not
expected until later Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Across Mexico, eager voters lined up before the polling stations
opened at 8 a.m. and often waited for hours in punishing heat. In
the most open elections ever held here, the balloting was generally
orderly but marred in several states by alleged pressure on voters
from the governing party _ which has a history of fraud _ and
disorganization that blocked many thousands of people from casting
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   After a fierce campaign that filled the television and other
media as never before, many voters said Sunday that they made their
decision only in recent days, suggesting that the undecided, who
were as much as 19 percent of the total in the most recent polls,
would determine the day.
</P>
<P>
   In many neighborhoods that long were PRI strongholds and among
working class Mexicans who were its most loyal followers, one theme
was recurrent: Mexico had to do something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a change, and I have been asking myself, when
is it going to happen?'' said Gustavo Sanchez, a 32-year-old auto
mechanic in Ecatepec, a huge proletarian suburb of Mexico City
where the PRI was once invincible. ``Our leaders need to know that
if they don't do the job right, we're going to get rid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   At mid-afternoon, Jose Woldenberg, the president of the Federal
Elections Institute that is running the election, reported that
only 13 of 113,423 polling places nationwide failed to open because
of organizational problems, a historical record.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the presidential race, Mexicans also voted to renew the
Senate, with 128 seats, and all 500 seats in the congress, and to
elect two state governors and the mayor of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Based on surveys conducted by the polling firm Mitofsky
International with voters as they left the polls, Televisa, the
largest national television network, reported that Fox's party
crushed the PRI in the governor's race in central state of Morelos,
by 57 percent to 29 percent. The last campaign polls had showed
that the race was tied.
</P>
<P>
   Televisa's early polls also showed that Andres Manuel Lopez,
from the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, was _ as
expected _ ahead in the contest for Mexico City mayor. The trend
was going much more heavily against PRI than expected in that
election.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the leftist candidate in the presidential
contest, refused to unite with Fox in the battle to oust the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo, voting in a public school near his
official residence, said, ``There's strong participation, a lot of
enthusiasm and great calm throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Things were not calm, however, in the main square of the city of
Puebla, in central Mexico, where thousands of people lined up for
long hours at a special polling place set up for Mexicans who were
not in their home towns on election day.
</P>
<P>
   Before the polls opened, hundreds of army soldiers and
policemen, mostly in civilian clothes, crowded to the front of the
line at the one special station for out-of-town voters in Puebla's
crowded plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Since the special station had only 750 ballots to be cast, many
voters realized, after waiting for hours in line, that they were
not going to be able to vote. As the line stretched for six blocks
out of the plaza, angry and frustrated people began to suspect that
the PRI was pulling one of the election tricks for which it was
notorious in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fraud! Fraud!'' the voters chanted as tensions mounted, ebbed
and mounted again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the PRI again,'' said Maria Guadalupe Corona Moreno, a
28-year-old manager of a textile factory from the state of
Guanajuato who was in Puebla on business. ``I've been waiting to
cast my vote for years,'' she said, waving her voter card, ``and
now it turns out this is just a piece of trash.''
</P>
<P>
   PRI voters in Puebla were also furious about being left out.
``Where is the democracy?'' said Maria Teresa Inclan Perez, who
said she supported the governing party.

</P>
<P>
   The special polling stations were set up for Mexicans who would
not appear on local rolls because they went to vote in places
different from where they registered. In regular polling places,
Mexicans were given ballots after matching their voter card with a
photograph against a list that included both their names and
pictures. However, because of restrictions in the campaign laws,
only 715 special polling places were set up nationwide, with only
750 ballots each.
</P>
<P>
   In Iztapalapa, a vast working class borough of Mexico City,
dozens of policemen pushed into the front of the line at one
special polling place. The situation grew tense as voters behind
them realized that they were probably being squeezed out of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports from four states of registered voters whose
names did not appear on lists where they were supposed to, who were
sent to special stations. The lines were so long they never got to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The results of Televisa's polls were confirmed by similar
surveys by TV Azteca, the other national network.
</P>
<P>
   The voting Sunday was monitored by no less than 38,433 Mexican
observers and 860 foreigners. Everywhere they went, observers found
voters thrilled about being part of what felt like a bona fide
democratic exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was saying that this time their vote really
matters,'' said Pamela S. Falk, a law professor from the City
University of New York. ``They have a sense that it has been a
very, very long time since they have been able to say what they
wanted at the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   PRI leaders had promised that the party's vast machine would be
in full gear, with 2.5 million party followers working to deliver
its voters to the polls. But the power of the PRI apparatus was not
much in evidence nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In the state of Yucatan, state elections officials reported that
some voters who had taken handouts from the PRI ahead of the
election were showing their ballots to PRI poll watchers to prove
that they fulfilled their part of the deal. State government
employees were campaigning for the PRI outside the polling station
in some rural Yucatan towns.
</P>
<P>
   By and large the voters did not express support directly for Fox
or any other particular candidate. They spoke of a longing for
something other than the government the PRI has given them, a
regime which depressed workers' salaries for three decades and was
repeatedly involved in scandals in which it squandered or ran off
with the taxpayers' money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to me like the people have come out because they want
a change,'' said Ana Maria Mosqueda, 38, a secretary who was an
elections observer on behalf of a national teachers union, which
has been a bastion of the PRI. She made it clear that her PRI
sympathies had waned. ``We want to be treated better, and we can
make it happen today, one grain of sand at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   In many places the election split families in two, with the
older generation sticking with the PRI and the younger people going
for the opposition. Husbands and wives differed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Caballero Rivas, an office worker who is 39, said he
chose Labastida because ``we need someone who will help us.'' But
as they emerged from a polling station in Ecatepec, his wife,
Gabriela Alcazar, piped up to contradict him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to change,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the state of Chiapas, followers of the Zapatista rebels
burned the voting stations in two tiny rural communities, and
rebels wearing ski masks set up roadblocks to stop PRI followers
from voting in the town of Altamirano. The actions came even though
the Zapatista leader who calls himself Subcomandante Marcos, had
said the Zapatistas would not obstruct the election.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Opposition candidate Vicente Fox appeared headed
for a historic victory in Mexico's presidential election, exit
polls indicated Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys of voters leaving the polls are a new feature of
Mexican elections, and their reliability is uncertain. But if the
polls hold up, the 71-year reign of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) could be coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide poll for the leading Televisa television station
found Fox, of the National Action Party (PAN), with 44 percent to
38 percent for the PRI's Francisco Labastida. A third candidate,
leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, had 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Polls by other television outlets and the Democracy Watch group
also showed Fox leading by six or more percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls also showed PAN winning governorships in two
states, Morelos and Guanajuato, and the leftist Democratic
Revolution Party holding on to the mayor's office in Mexico City's
federal district, the country's political heart.
</P>
<P>
   No polling results were available for the two houses of the
nation's Congress, also at stake Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Actual voting returns were not available Sunday evening, and
Mexico's rural vote could swing votes toward the ruling party. It
may take days before all the votes can be gathered and counted in
this large and impoverished nation of 100 million people.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate indications of widespread election
fraud. Though Mexico is notorious for electoral corruption, the PRI
had promised the vote would be free and fair.
</P>
<P>
   There were mounting reports of angry would-be voters who didn't
get to cast ballots for president at special voting stations set up
for people who had recently moved or were in transit.
</P>
<P>
   Although election officials estimated that more than 99 percent
of all voting stations opened _ the best record ever for Mexico _
voters were enraged when special stations that could stock only a
limited number of ballots by law ran short.
</P>
<P>
   In the sprawling Mexico City working-class suburb of Ixtapaluca
in the state of Mexico, voters started shouting to cast votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't fair!'' said police officer Marco Hernandez, 23,
who was standing in a long line when officials said only 300
ballots were left out of 750 available for voters who had moved
since getting their voting credentials. Asked who he wanted to vote
for, Hernandez wrote on a piece of paper: ``I want change.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 58 million people were eligible to vote in the election,
which followed the most hotly contested and passionate campaign
season in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI candidate, Francisco Labastida, faced a strong challenge
from Vicente Fox of the PAN, running as the candidate of the
center-right Alliance for Change.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and Labastida were neck-and-neck in many pre-election
opinion polls, while another candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the
Democratic Revolution Party, was trailing in third.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters said change was a prime motive for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election has been the most publicized in the history of
Mexico, and most of us want change,'' said street vendor Alfonso
Garrido, 53, who voted for Fox in Ecatepec, a city near the capital
where almost 1 million voters reside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always voted for the PRI before, but the truth is, I'm tired
of poverty and I hope that Fox, if he wins, will fulfill his
promises,'' said Garrida.
</P>
<P>
   But many other voters said they preferred to stick with the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to let Fox win. I don't like his pompous
attitude,'' said Patricia Arias, 36, an Ixtapaluca housewife who
voted for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   But her sister, Edith Arias, 37, with whom she walked arm in
arm, voted for Cardenas because ``he cares about working people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Ramirez, 67, also voted for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think all three candidates put together can really
change much,'' he said. ``The PRI is part of society. It dominates
everything. The opposition could create problems.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same voting station, housewife Amapola Mendez voted with
her 2-year-old clinging to her leg. ``A lot of older people think
there will never be change,'' she said, explaining that she voted
for Fox. ``But many younger people are looking at other political
parties now.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an awning set up on Juarez Street in Ixtapaluca, people
crowded around tables stacked with color-coded ballots supervised
by a election officials and two people who counted votes and posted
results before shipping them to a district office.
</P>
<P>
   Each official was supposed to be selected by lottery and trained
by Mexico's independent Federal Elections Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Voters showed their photo ID voting credentials to these
officials, who matched them against a registration list that also
contained photos. Voters were given ballots to mark and instructed
to go into booths with curtains. Then they deposited the ballots in
color-coded boxes for federal elections and state and local races.
</P>
<P>
   Political parties were allowed to have two representatives per
table, but on Juarez Street, like other parts of the country, there
were complaints that too many PRI representatives wearing pins were
standing around or sitting at the tables.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, five women wearing PRI pins were crowded around
one table on Juarez Street, silently observing voters as they
approached to get their ballots.

<P>
   Juan Manuel Solorzano, a PAN representative, said he was filing
a complaint because some PRI members had been substituted at the
last minute as vote counters at one table.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, ``for the first time ever, we are seeing
an election where the government isn't sticking its hands in.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the Valle de Chalco, another state of Mexico area where PRI
loyalty tends to run strong, people trickled into voting precincts
along with stray dogs.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, heavy rains flooded out hundreds from their
homes. Federal aid arrived and the government paid many families
almost $1,000 in disaster relief. But many said the help was
inadequate and slow to come.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many here were bent on backing the party of tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the party of my parents _ even my grandparents,'' said
housewife Rosa Maria Perez, 35. The ruling party ``gives us
security. I still don't have confidence in the other parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting PRI is family-bound duty, explained Patricia Sanchez
Pacheco, 37.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother got her papers to become a PRI activist 25 years
ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other parties don't have experience to govern a country,''
said her sister, Hortencia Sanchez Pacheco.
</P>
<P>
   The two sisters gave their votes to the PRI because it came
through in ways that count _ bags of cement, sand and aluminum
scrap for roofs for their neighborhood, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago we started receiving the help,'' said Hortencia
Sanchez, carefully minding her step on a street of rocks and
rubble.
</P>
<P>
   But even in this staunch PRI town, there was opposition _ and
indignation _ at the PRI's campaign classic campaign gifts for
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a bucket and a T-shirt, they want our vote? Forget it,''
said one voter who declined to give her name.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big gap between what the PRI says and what it
does,'' said electrician Juan Jesus Moreno, 43, who voted for
Cardenas, just as he did in 1994 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can Labastida talk about computers and English classes for
Mexicans (a campaign proposal) when we don't have enough to eat?''
he asked.
</P>
<P>
   A reliable den of PRI support, Valle de Chalco sports monuments
to former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's government public
works project, Solidarity. The program paved roads, put in drainage
and electricity and built basketball courts in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But the June sewage flood may have provoked a lower turnout for
the PRI than in previous elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems there was a bit of anger and apathy out there among
people for the way the government handled the disaster,'' said
Arturo Morales Torres, a local resident.

AT 49, EARNHARDT PUTS THE THROTTLE TO CRITICS ABOUT HIM AGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: In 9th graf, adds victory for Earnhardt.) 
By DAVE CALDWELL   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ He is 49 years old and hates it that he
cannot quite get his gut to disappear. Otherwise, Dale Earnhardt is
as happy as he could possibly be. He will almost admit to having
fun. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone tells you I'm riding my years out,'' Earnhardt
said, pleasantly but firmly, ``they're not paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, pay attention to this: Earnhardt is back to running with
the whippersnappers, chasing an eighth Winston Cup championship.
Following an eighth-place finish in the Pepsi 400 on Saturday, he
remained in second place in the standing, just 52 points behind
Bobby Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton won the race by holding off Dale Jarrett at the
finish line, but the race to accumulate points has become more than
a sideshow. Before Saturday's race, Labonte led Earnhardt by 67
points. Jarrett, 129 points behind Labonte a week ago, is now only
76 points back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Dale Earnhardt driving harder and more aggressively than
I have seen him in the last three years,'' Burton said. ``I don't
see him bowing over by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who won his last championship six years ago and
finished second in 1995, never dropped too far off the pace. But he
dropped far enough for people to start noticing and delicately
making the point that he was getting passed by.
</P>
<P>
   That rankled Earnhardt almost as much as driving in a race like
the Pepsi 400 in which restrictor plates are mandated to keep
speeds down. This was never about age.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after breaking his collarbone and sternum in a
spectacular accident, Earnhardt is fully healthy. He also believes
he is driving for a team that has a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt has won one race this year _ the Cracker Barrel 500 in
Atlanta on March 12 _ and has finished in the top five seven times.
He likes winning more than almost anything else, even seeing his
son, Dale Jr., win a race, but he knows that consistency, not just
checkered flags, wins Winston Cup championships. Much of the
pressure will now come from chasing Labonte. Bring it on, Earnhardt
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy the pressure,'' he said. ``I thrive on it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Earnhardt does not like is Nascar continually coming up
with ways to slow drivers down. He misses the old days, which for
him were the 1980s, in which he and drivers like Darrell Waltrip
and Rusty Wallace did a lot of ``gouging and sticking.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not like what has developed on the track. Now, Earnhardt
said, the contenders run in a pack _ ``existing on the track
together,'' to use his words _ waiting for the perfect time to make
the one move that could win a race.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years ago, Bill Elliott won the pole for the Daytona
500 by turning a 210-mile-an-hour lap. The top qualifying speed for
Saturday's race, run on the same track, was 187.547 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only sport that ties the hands of the competitors
from going faster,'' Earnhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   He has foiled rules changes that might have handcuffed him.
Richard Childress, the owner of Earnhardt's black Chevrolet, said
before the Pepsi 500 that the race should be a showcase, for all
cars but the Chevies. Even after the race, Earnhardt grumbled, ``I
think the Chevrolets are all about 15th-place cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Earnhardt finds himself on Labonte's rear bumper midway
through the Winston Cup season. Labonte said Saturday that he still
felt confident. ``They beat us,'' Labonte said after finishing
12th, ``but it was not as bad as it could have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the top contenders are aware that Earnhardt has
more experience at winning championships than they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he has a lot more experience at winning
championships than Bobby and me put together,'' Jarrett, the
defending champion, said, ``and we could take a lot of other people
and add them to that mix, and he'd still have more experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that he's going to be tough as this goes on, as the
season winds down, and if he can hang around, and we certainly feel
that he will, it's going to be interesting to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Mayfield nudged aside Earnhardt on the last lap of a
victory June 19 at Long Pond, Pa., and Winston Cup fans instantly
saw delicious symbolism in a 31-year-old pushing aside a driver
closing hard on 50. Earnhardt said he was upset only that Mayfield
made a big deal about the bump after the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like he felt guilty about it,'' Earnhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt said he had forgotten about it. There are other things
to think about now, and for that, Earnhardt is glad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to come down to team and driver,''
Earnhardt said, and he made sure to emphasize the second part. &QL;

   A New York Times News Service article sent on Thursday, June 22
about historic theaters misstated the history of Ford's Theater in
Washington. The building was not torn down after the assassination
of President Abraham Lincoln. It was gutted and the interior became
office space in the 1930's, but the walls were left standing. A
restoration of the theater began in 1965, based on photographs
taken by Mathew Brady, and the new Ford's opened in 1968. &QL;

PROTESTERS ORGANIZE FOR DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The Democratic National Convention in August
could become the first party presidential nomination in more than
two decades overshadowed by street protests.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago has
any protest movement been strong enough to attract the 50,000 or
more expected for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   This new millennium movement has drawn disparate groups together
under a single ``big tent'' in just eight months, drawn by a
general concern for what they see social, economic and political
injustice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very interesting social movement that while reminiscent
of the 1960s, is also very distinct,'' said Margaret Levi,
professor of political science at the University of Washington in
Seattle, where the movement was born last December during the World
Trade Organization conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a movement that while very young is growing, changing and
consolidating. The networks are wider; the links stronger and
deeper. The protesters now have the capacity to convey their
messages in more sophisticated ways.''
</P>
<P>
   After Seattle and the protests at April's International Monetary
Fund summit in Washington, D.C., the conventions this summer in
Philadelphia and especially Los Angeles will test the alliance's
strength, and the public's receptivity to its message, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of energy is congealing here in Los Angeles around a lot
of the same issues raised at WTO and IMF,'' said Shawn McDougal,
who works for a Quaker-based organization in northwest Pasadena and
is volunteering to help organize the summer's protests.
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. protests are being coordinated by the umbrella group
D2KLA, whose leaders are among the country's most seasoned, many of
them coming out of leadership in labor, environmental, peace and
justice movements.
</P>
<P>
   A nucleus of about 200 are now putting together a logistics
framework for what's anticipated by police, protesters and city
officials to be an unprecedented number of demonstrations, street
marches, festivities and civil disobedience actions Aug. 14-17.
</P>
<P>
   They will be in the national spotlight, judged both for their
message and behavior. Los Angeles already is wary with LAPD and
Secret Service warnings that a small faction intends to engage in
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are out to demonstrate that there are other ways to make
things work,'' said Lisa Fithian, 39, whose says her job is to draw
maximum attention to the movement's goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are out to demonstrate that there are other ways to make
things work. This is direct democracy. We believe our strength and
our unity will be forged in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Convention organizers say they are trying to accommodate the
protesters as much as security will allow and don't want their
candidate, Al Gore, to be upstaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the real news will be made inside the convention hall
as Vice President Gore talks about his agenda for progress and
prosperity to the country,'' said DNC Committee spokesman Peter
Ragone.
</P>
<P>
   The debate in D2KLA now is how best to use the streets of Los
Angeles to create images that will be beamed around the world on
Web sites, and via satellite from an independent media center to be
set up near Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   As in Seattle, the Direct Action Network _ one of D2KLA's
splinter groups _ will lead small teams in intentional, nonviolent
civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters know they may be arrested, and they train for
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all kinds of direct actions from blockades (of
buildings, like police stations), to banner hangs, where people
climb a high structure and hang a banner. We don't have money for
advertising like corporations do, so it's free advertising,'' said
Direct Action organizer McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   Within the movement, there have been debates over what the role
of violence and property destruction should be, if any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the political systems that forces people to work two
or three jobs; look at people harassed by the police,'' Fithian
said. ``That's spiritual and emotional violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Direct Action's official position is that property destruction
sends the wrong message, and leaders have drawn up guidelines
encouraging all groups to refrain from violence, to carry no
weapons, to avoid drugs and alcohol, and to only destroy barricades
that are erected to interfere with free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we want to emphasize is that since people will
do civil disobedience, we want to ground it in nonviolence so that
it doesn't come to a confrontation,'' said Kevin Rudiger, a
26-year-old University of California, Los Angeles graduate student
from Simi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say they have given the guidelines to local
anarchists. In Seattle, black-hooded anarchists were blamed for
much of the $10 million in downtown property damage.
</P>
<P>
   They blame police for the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LAPD is putting out the threats of violent, chemical
terrorism and they're all unsubstantiated,'' Rudiger said.
``There's no credible reason that will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Cmdr. David Kalish said
the police only react to unlawful activities.
</P>

EXIT POLLS INDICATE MEXICAN POLITICAL UPHEAVAL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ National exit polls gave opposition presidential
candidate Vicente Fox Quesada a surprisingly wide lead Sunday
night, and Mexico appeared to be on the verge of ending more than
seven decades of one-party rule after a closely fought and
scrutinized election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although official results were not available, several exit polls
released after the end of voting Sunday night, showed Fox, the
boot-wearing, tart-tongued candidate of the opposition center-right
National Action Party holding a lead of 5 to 9 percentage point
over Francisco Labastida Ochoa, candidate of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has ruled since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   The historic vote was a referendum on the country's willingness
to change and a test of its recently strengthened democratic
institutions after decades of corruption-filled voting. Turnout
among the country's 59 million registered voters was
extraordinarily heavy, but official estimates were not available.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a sense of commitment and obligation among
people voting today that we've never seen before in Mexico,'' said
Carlos Monsivais, a prominent writer who cast his vote for a
center-left coalition led by former Mexico City mayor Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas. ``We've seen enthusiasm for voting here before, but never
the kind of discipline that we've had this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters had six candidates to choose from, but much of the
attention focused on Labastida, a former interior minister, and
Fox, the former Guanajuato state governor. Cardenas, son of a
legendary president, was a distant third, according to the exit
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Both leading parties and candidates claimed victory soon after
polls closed. Leaders of the coalition led by the National Action
Party, or PAN, said their exit polls showed Fox the winner by 6
percentage points. Labastida and the leaders of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, insisted they had won by the same
margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, we can't yet confirm officially that we've
won,'' Fox told a room packed with supporters Sunday night. ``But
the exit polls have given us a large enough margin that we can
present ourselves to the Mexican people.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting generally appeared to be calm at most of the country's
113,000 voting places, although there were sporadic reports of
logistical problems and some accounts of vote tampering.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best organized process legally that we've seen in
Mexico,'' said former US president Jimmy Carter, one of more than
10,000 Mexican and foreign observers who monitored the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The loudest and most frequent complaints from voters were a lack
of ballots, particularly at the special precincts located along the
US-Mexico border and in the capital, where residents could cast
ballots outside their home districts. By law, each special polling
place was supplied with 750 ballots, but most of them were swamped
with voters, whose numbers often exceeded 2,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a right to vote and am being told that I can't because
they've run out of ballots,'' said Irma Luengo, 55, while standing
in the middle of an angry crowd at a special polling site at an old
Olympic facility in southern Mexico City. ``Is this by accident or
a plan to keep some of us from voting? I have my suspicions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some precincts in the capital and southern Chiapas state lacked
enough ballots, forcing some resident to wait up to four hours to
cast their vote. Another polling place in the city of Toluca was
forced to close temporarily because a swarm of bees stung 40
people.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas of the country, there were reports by some
international observers of party representatives interfering with
voters as they cast their ballots. In some outlying areas as well
as in suburban Mexico City, some members of the ruling PRI were
spotted taking voters' ballots and placing them into the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not supposed to be handling ballots in any way,
because it could influence voters,'' said Eric Olson, Mexican
program director for the Washington Office on Latin America, who
witnessed some of these activities in the capital suburb of Valle
de Chalco. ``These kinds of incidents are going to be magnified if
the election is close.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters streamed to the polls all day with an unusual air of
seriousness about them. Many of them expressed confidence that, for
the first time, they were making a free choice and that their votes
would be counted fairly by the Federal Electoral Institute, an
independent agency created four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had many changes for more democracy here and that makes
me feel better about my vote,'' said Julia Gregorio, a housewife in
the middle class town of Atizapan in Mexico state, who supported
the ruling party. ``Even if another party wins, I think we've come
a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Sunday's vote appeared to answer the question of
whether to defang the political party that has ruled since its
creation in 1929, shortly after the end of the Mexican revolution.
The PRI has never lost a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   For generations of Mexicans, the PRI has been both hero and
villain. It nationalized key industries, built hospitals, schools
and roads and built strong economic ties with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the party and its heavy-handed tactics has also symbolized
Mexico's deep problems, like the widening gap between rich and
poor, rampant corruption and election fraud.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, and mounting frustration, Mexicans have
gradually grown more accustomed to the presence of opposition
parties, particluarly over the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   PAN was founded in 1938 by conservative Catholics but gained
little influence at first. The party began accumulating victories
for mayoralties and governorships in northern Mexico beginning in
the mid-1980s. Meanwhile, a major defection from the PRI in 1989
created a third major party, the center-left Party of the
Democratic Revolution, led by Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties won a majority of congressional seats for the
first time in 1997, the year that Cardenas was elected as the first
opposition mayor of the capital. Opposition parties now control
governorships in a dozen of Mexico's 31 states.
</P>
<P>
   But past presidential elections have always belonged to the PRI,
mostly because the party has benefited from its massive national
vote-gathering machine, its links to government resources and
because it has managed to divide opposition votes between the PAN
and PRD.
</P>
<P>
   Some specialists said that no matter who won the elections, the
vote was a turning point for Mexico, where increased competition
among political parties combined with the stronger electoral
institutions would likely lead to more responsive governments
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a hero in all of this, it's the Mexican people,''
said Richard Warren, director of the Latin American Studies Center
at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia. ``They've struggled
hard for years for a better political process, and they recognize
that this is an important step to make.''

LOS ANGELES: unlawful activities.

<P>
   Levi said from a strategic point of view, there are a lot of
different opinions on the effectiveness of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't support it, but it does bring media attention, and
sometimes leads to other voices being heard,'' she said. ``People
will hear about the violence, but then may begin to wonder about
the other 40,000 or so people who aren't violent, and what they
have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Fithian added: ``Will we shut down anything? Maybe we will and
maybe we won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers insist they don't want shut down the conventions as
they did the WTO and IMF. Rather, it's to protest the two-party
system as exclusive, nonresponsive and ultimately undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're deeply concerned that democracy is for sale to the
highest bidder,'' Rudiger said. ``There will be plenty of $10,000
dinners. So instead of being left out entirely, we'll be in the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups will have some central oversight and coordination
through what's known as the Action Spokes Council. The council, in
theory, discusses plans, but it's up to ``affinity groups'' who
share common interests, to carry them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our belief is that people need to take action on their own, to
speak in their own voices,'' Fithian said.
</P>
<P>
   Rudiger, the UCLA urban planning graduate student, said
``Decentralization lets people feel good about the process, that
decisions aren't coming down from somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Next weekend, a training session is planned, organizers said. In
addition to going over tactics for dealing with police _ including
whether to go limp or follow instructions if arrested _ the
protesters will make up street skits, and make giant puppets and
other artwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we're fighting back against is how even our public
spaces have been taken over by corporations,'' McDougal, the
nonprofit worker, said. ``We think taking over the streets in a
festive mood is really important.''

 INTERNET VIDEO TECHNOLOGY DISPLAYS WHOLE PICTURE  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Watching a football game on television is an
incomplete experience: You get limited views, all controlled by an
unseen director.
</P>
<P>
   But imagine watching the same game using immersive 360-degree
Internet technology, being able to watch the wide receiver grab a
pass by his fingertips and then turning to view the fans in the
stands hugging each other. You could even look up to see the blimp
flying overhead.
</P>
<P>
   A picture may be worth a thousand words, but two Bay Area
companies believe a 360-degree picture could be worth millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is 21st century video,'' said Ted Driscoll,
chief executive and president of Be Here Inc. of Cupertino, Calif.
``It's a whole new medium, participatory video.''
</P>
<P>
   Be Here and San Ramon, Calif.'s International Pictures Corp., or
iPIX, are the leading proponents of 360-degree video technology,
which lets Internet users to simultaneously select the angle or
viewpoint of a still photo or a moving video.
</P>
<P>
   The video technology has caught the eyes of such noted
filmmakers as Ron Howard and Steven Spielberg, as well as the
Discovery Channel, Fox Sports Net and even eBay.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said there are more reasons 360-degree video won't
turn in to another fad like 3-D movies, where audiences had to wear
special clunky glasses.
</P>
<P>
   IPIX, which ranked No. 4 on The Chronicle 500's list of
fastest-growing companies by percentage of sales, is already
changing the face of online real estate. With a computer and a
modem, homebuyers can explore a house without stepping out the
door.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ZipRealty.com lets homebuyers look at several still
views of the house taken with an iPIX camera, using a mouse to move
the view of the picture in any direction _ right, left, up and
down.
</P>
<P>
   They can also zoom in or out, and thousands of homebuyers can
look at the same photo of the living room at the same time, but
choose different views, such as a close-up of the fireplace or the
bay view windows.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, media companies are also looking to cash in on this
new technology by looking at how ``immersive'' Web casts of
ballgames, concerts and other live events can drive traffic to
their sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immersive images have a definite practical purpose,'' said
Lia Schubert, Internet imaging analyst with InfoTrends Research
Group Inc., a Boston firm that tracks digital imaging trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the advent of e-commerce, companies, individuals, rock
bands and sports teams are looking to reach a wider audience
through the Web and need to do that visually,'' she said.
``Immersive imaging provides a very rich and interactive way for
these companies to actually get Internet-viewing customers
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking 360-degree video one step further is the groundbreaking
four-minute film ``The New Arrival,'' which made its debut in May
at the Cannes Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Using Be Here's 360-degree technology, New York independent film
director Amy Talkington tells the story of a ``new arrival'' at a
retirement home. Be Here's camera plays the title character, which
enables viewers to jump into the role. Although the story line is
predetermined, Be Here's technology allows the audience to direct
the view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really natural way to tell stories on the Internet,''
Talkington said. ``All my filmmaker friends who have seen the short
seem really excited about working in a new medium.''
</P>
<P>
   The film has been streamed about 100,000 times so far on
AtomFilms.com, the Seattle Web site that offers short films and
animated features. AtomFilms is running a contest among its 1
million registered members to come up with the best idea for the
next 360-degree video. The site plans to debut more original
immersive productions later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Also getting into the act are entertainers Ellen Degeneres and
Anne Heche, who are posting weekly immersive Web casts of their
``Ellen: The Americana Tour'' through August 4 at  &LR; www.ellenz.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Moving even one more step further, Be Here and Fox Sports Net
stationed cameras atop the two neutral corner posts of the boxing
ring during the June 18 fight in Las Vegas between Hector Camacho
Jr. and Manard Reed.
</P>
<P>
   No longer at the mercy of an unseen television director calling
the shots, the test showed how Internet viewers could control the
view and pan the stands for screaming fans, then pan back in time
to watch Camacho knock Reed to the canvas right below the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Although the boxing match wasn't Webcast to the public, Fox
Sports said the test should lead to live Webcasts of sporting
events in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Technology from Be Here, which has Intel, Phillips and Kodak as
investors, was used to Webcast activities during Super Bowl XXXIV,
the NFL draft and cable network ESPN's X Games.
</P>
<P>
   Providers of broadband access also stand to benefit. Driscoll
said 360-degree video will bring the content that will push sales
of high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our belief is people will not pay for broadband just so they
can load Yahoo in two seconds,'' Driscoll said.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll said other markets, such as security and day care, may
also find use for 360-degree video technology. ``You can pop this
magic periscope anywhere in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have developed technology that operates with the
same premise, that a specially designed camera lens can capture one
seamless 360-degree image. Other companies, like Enroute Inc. of
Palo Alto, have introduced immersive video that uses software to
stitch together multiple shots.
</P>
<P>
   Be Here's technology is the only one that supports live
streaming video, although it does not capture the top and bottom of
a picture or scene. Driscoll said Be Here's camera lens captures an
image that looks like a doughnut, cutting unneeded parts of a scene
that would otherwise take up bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   So far, iPIX technology, originally developed for NASA, cannot
be used to stream live video on the Internet. But it does afford a
full 360-by-360-degree view so a user can, for example, look at
both the ceiling and floor of a room.
</P>
<P>
   Both iPIX and Be Here have developed fist-size lenses and
software that capture 360-degree images for digital cameras, and
the lens sizes could shrink in the future.
</P>
<P>
   While the privately held Be Here has concentrated on
entertainment and sports, financial analyst Andrew Wilcox said iPIX
already has a solid business foundation because of its firm
foothold in online real estate.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly traded iPIX, which earlier this year moved into new
offices in San Ramon, last month signed a $12.25 million deal with
Cendant Corp., parent company of real estate giants Coldwell
Banker, ERA and Century 21, to use iPIX's ``virtual tours'' service
for 360-degree photos of homes for sale.
</P>
<P>
   IPIX also sells tour packages, offering a national network of
about 700 photographers who can take a series of immersive photos
of a home or hotel room for a client. The most popular package,
which includes four 360-degree shots, sells for $100, said iPIX
Executive Vice President Don Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's visual content that drives e-commerce,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant agreed to buy 350,000 virtual tours. It was the most
lucrative deal for iPIX, which posted sales of $12.52 million in
1999, about 16,000 percent more than the year before. The company
reported first quarter 2000 revenue of $8.3 million, but a net loss
of $36.9 million that included charges from a merger with virtual
home tour provider bamboo.com of Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox, of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., projects iPIX revenues
to hit about $68.8 million this year and $177 million in 2001. The
company is expecting to be profitable in mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox said iPIX has a virtual lock on the online real estate
market, to the point where iPIX's immersive photos are fast
becoming a requirement for online home listings. But with an
estimated 7 million to 8 million existing home sale listings
already online, iPIX has only scratched the surface of revenue
opportunities in real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see iPIX virtual tours as a standard in real
estate in two or three years,'' Wilcox said. ``It's becoming
addictive technology. Once you have the ability to pan around back
and forth, when you don't have it, you feel like you're missing
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The company signed a deal with eBay in April to allow eBay
members to use iPIX's technology to add 360-degree photos with
their online auction listings.
</P>
<P>
   And like Be Here, iPIX is focusing on immersive video.
</P>
<P>
   In April, iPIX signed a deal with digital entertainment company
POP.com of Glendale to produce interactive short films for the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That was significant because POP.com is a collaboration of
Imagine Entertainment, co-founded by director Ron Howard, and
DreamWorks SKG, founded by entertainment industry legends Steven
Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen and funded by
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Vulcan Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance ``will enable us to create unique and fresh online
entertainment, which will be fun for us as filmmakers and should
provide an exciting interactive experience for our viewers,''
Howard said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, not enough households have high-speed
Internet connections to make immersive film and other forms of
entertainment commercially viable, said InfoTrends analyst Lia
Schubert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit early for it now, but (iPIX) will be in
position when the bandwidth is there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although iPIX is the leader in immersive imaging, it remains to
be seen which technology may be more pervasive in the future, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a consumer standpoint, they don't care about underlying
technology,'' she said. ``They just want to know if it's cool or
not.''

 TECH 21: P3P NEEDS TO BE BETTER AT PRIVACY  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From Bill Clinton to Bill Gates, the establishment is rallying
around a new Internet standard called P3P. It's an interesting
development, but watch out for the hype they're spinning about it.
</P>
<P>
   Although P3P (which stands for Platform for Privacy Preferences)
is still just a working draft _ even after more than three years of
development _ the White House, AOL, AT&AMP;T, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and
even Procter &AMP; Gamble have already implemented it on their Web
sites. Microsoft and Netscape plan to build support for it into the
next release of their respective browsers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the World Wide Web Consortium, the nonprofit but
industry-dominated body sponsoring the standard's development, its
purpose is to provide ``a simple, automated way for users to gain
more control over the use of personal information on Web sites they
visit.''
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the spec and accompanying documentation at the P3P
home page ( &LR; www.w3.org/P3P &LR; ), it will probably live up to that
claim _ in a way. Its purpose is to define a standard,
machine-readable language for describing privacy policies _ what
kind of personal information a Web site proposes to collect from
users and how it intends to use the data.
</P>
<P>
   This turns out to require a surprisingly complex vocabulary. In
addition to terms for many kinds of demographic information _ birth
date, gender, home address and so on _ it also covers several types
of dynamic data, such as the ``referrer'' (the site the user came
from), the ``clickstream'' (exactly what the user clicks on while
visiting a site) and what he or she may have searched for.
</P>
<P>
   That's the easy part, though. The real challenge was to reduce
the variety of ways a site might use such information to a handful
of variables _ for example, how long the site will retain the
information it collects, whether it will use the data to contact
the individual to promote a product or service, whether it will
compile data into profiles of user habits, whether such profiles
will be anonymous or linked to personal identifying information,
etc.
</P>
<P>
   On the user side, a P3P-enabled browser would store the user's
preferences about such matters, then compare those preferences to
the policies of sites he or she visits. When the user _ call her
Sally Surfer _ goes to a site whose policies match her preferences,
she could cruise through it just as she does today, except that her
browser might display an icon indicating that everything is
hunky-dory from a privacy perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what happens when Sally hits a site whose policies don't
correspond to her preferences isn't defined in the current P3P
spec; that's left up to the developer of the browser or other
P3P-compliant software she's using.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, though, the program would put up a dialog box
alerting Sally to the discrepancy and giving her a choice between
accepting the site's policies or giving up her plan to visit it.
Earlier drafts of the specification included a scheme for
electronic haggling over such matters _ a way for users to get more
benefits for providing more information _ as well as a mechanism
for automatically transmitting personal data authorized by the
user's preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Those provisions, however, have been dropped _ the first because
of its technical complexity, the second reportedly because polling
showed widespread user resistance to background transfer of their
personal information.
</P>
<P>
   What's left is pretty modest, considering how long the standard
has been in gestation and how many powerful players have been
involved. As far as it goes, it strikes me as a modest step in the
right direction.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also a far cry from what we so obviously need: clear
and enforceable rules about the collection and use of personal
information. As far as it goes, it strikes me as a modest step in
the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also a far cry from what we so obviously need: clear
and enforceable rules about the collection and use of personal
information. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   -- Web site operators won't be under any obligation to implement
P3P. Lots of them _ the sleazy, the lazy, those who lack the
technical skills or software required _ will undoubtedly just
ignore it. And it certainly doesn't address the problem of the
failed dot-coms, which, as Cnet reported last week, are cheerfully
auctioning off information about their former customers, possibly
including phone and credit-card numbers, home addresses and
purchase histories ( &LR; news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-200- &LR; 
 &LR; 2176430.html?tagst.ne.1002.tgif.ni &LR; )
</P>
<P>
   -- Even if they're machine-readable, privacy policies are
inevitably complex, so I suspect most users won't bother to
configure the software for their own considered preferences _
they'll just accept the default settings.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nothing in the standard says what those defaults should be.
Because no user wants to be turned away from a site she's already
navigated to, and most will find it burdensome and confusing to
have to reconfigure their preferences before they can get where
they're going, browsermakers will be under pressure from users as
well as site operators to keep the bar low. (Don't forget: These
are the same browsermakers who brought us the cookie _ and have
since provided only the crudest tools for controlling this
frightful mechanism.)
</P>
<P>
   -- Neither technical standard can guarantee that sites actually
do what they say they will, whether they state their policies in
bits and bytes or in B2C bureaucratese. Nor can a standard impose
any penalty on those who violate their commitments.
</P>
<P>
   -- By accepting and formalizing the idea of trading personal
data for access, P3P could have the effect of encouraging sites
that don't collect such data to start doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all these shortcomings, many proponents of P3P are using
it to justify their opposition to more meaningful solutions to the
Internet privacy, such as laws of the sort that just about every
other developed country already has _ and that we in the United
States have enacted to protect other kinds of personal information,
including telephone and video-rental records.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder, then, that many seasoned privacy advocates are
leery of P3P. The Electronic Privacy Information Center, a
Washington, D.C., public-interest group that's been working on the
issue for six years, and Junkbusters, an organization run by a
computer scientist with a doctorate in data mining, have just
issued a scathing critique under the title ``Pretty Poor Privacy''
( &LR; www.epic.org/reports/prettypoor &QL;  &LR; 
 &LR; privacy.html &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   And even groups that support P3P acknowledge its limitations _
see, for example, the assessment produced by the Center for
Democracy and Technology in cooperation with the office of
Ontario's Information and Privacy Commissioner, which is posted at
 &LR; www.cdt.org/privacy/pet/p3pprivacy.shtml &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   NIXON TO THE RESCUE? One irony about the sad state of privacy
protection in the United States: This country isn't just the home
of the Bill of Rights and what Justice Louis Brandeis called ``the
right to be let alone'' _ it's also the home of the principles on
which Europe's computer-era privacy regulations are based. Known as
the Code of Fair Information Practices, these guidelines were
developed by a commission set up by, would you believe, the Nixon
administration. (I owe that tidbit to ``Database Nation,'' Simson
Garfinkel's excellent new book on the privacy problem, published by
O'Reilly.)
</P>
<P>
   Here are the five key principles of the code, as articulated
(according to Garfinkel) in a 1973 report of the then Department of
Health, Education and Welfare:
</P>
<P>
   -- There must be no personal data record-keeping system whose
very existence is secret.
</P>
<P>
   -- There must be a way for a person to find out what information
about the person is in a record and how it is used.
</P>
<P>
   -- There must be a way for a person to prevent information about
the person that was obtained for one purpose from being used or
made available for other purposes without the person's consent.
</P>
<P>
   -- There must be a way for a person to correct or amend a record
of identifiable information about the person.
</P>
<P>
   -- Any organization creating, maintaining, using or
disseminating records of identifiable personal data must assure the
reliability of the data for their intended use and must take
precautions to prevent misuses of the data.
</P>
<P>
   Giving these principles the force of law is no privacy panacea _
there isn't one _ but at least it would get at the heart of the
problem, which is more than one can say about P3P.
</P>
<P>
   SELF-DEFENSE RESOURCES: Whether or not you share Junkbusters'
harsh assessment of P3P, the group's Web site
( &LR; www.junkbusters.com &LR; ) is a valuable source of tips, tricks, links
and software for combating abusive marketers online and off.
</P>
<P>
   Junkbusters has long run its own banner-ad-and-cookie-blocking
software, but now it's endorsing a new entry in that category
called Guidescope ( &LR; www.guidescope.com/home &LR; ). The program,
available for Windows, Linux and Solaris, is still in beta testing,
and I haven't compared it in detail to AdSubtract, WebWasher or the
other utilities of this genre Becky Waring covered in her very
useful survey in the May 11 Chronicle
( &LR; www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file &LR; 
 &LR; /chronicle/archive/2000/05/11/BU41819. &QL;  &LR; 
 &LR; DTL &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, though, Guidescope looks like an alternative
well worth considering, especially because it's free for use at
home and by nonprofit institutions.
</P>
<P>
   If telemarketers get your goat, you might find some relief on
the page Junkbusters devotes to dealing with them. For litigious
types, the group's ``anti-telemarketing script'' explains how you
can, at least in theory, collect $500 to $1,500 for every call that
violates the provisions of the federal Telephone Consumer
Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to fight back without going to court _ and in the
process have a little righteous fun _ check out
 &LR; www.antitelemarketer.com/indexd.htm &LR; , especially the
``Telemarketer Tormenting Techniques'' page linked there. If that's
not enough, head to your favorite search site and enter
``tormenting telemarketers.'' I tried Google and found hundreds of
sites devoted to this subject.
</P>
<P>
   FILE NOT FOUND.NET: At Microsoft's Forum 2000 last month, where
Gates and the gang rolled out their new .NET strategy, the PCs
lining the press room were all carefully configured to use a
special home page on the company's ``Presspass'' server. To judge
by the URL, it was dedicated to summarizing the .NET plan. As is so
often the case with Microsoft, the idea was nice, but the execution
fell a little short: When you opened Internet Explorer and it tried
to locate the page, all it found was a message explaining that the
page no longer existed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Watching a football game on television is an
incomplete experience: You get limited views, all controlled by an
unseen director.
</P>
<P>
   But imagine watching the same game using immersive 360-degree
Internet technology, being able to watch the wide receiver grab a
pass by his fingertips and then turning to view the fans in the
stands hugging each other. You could even look up to see the blimp
flying overhead.
</P>
<P>
   A picture may be worth a thousand words, but two Bay Area
companies believe a 360-degree picture could be worth millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is 21st century video,'' said Ted Driscoll,
chief executive and president of Be Here Inc. of Cupertino, Calif.
``It's a whole new medium, participatory video.''
</P>
<P>
   Be Here and San Ramon, Calif.'s International Pictures Corp., or
iPIX, are the leading proponents of 360-degree video technology,
which lets Internet users to simultaneously select the angle or
viewpoint of a still photo or a moving video.
</P>
<P>
   The video technology has caught the eyes of such noted
filmmakers as Ron Howard and Steven Spielberg, as well as the
Discovery Channel, Fox Sports Net and even eBay.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said there are more reasons 360-degree video won't
turn in to another fad like 3-D movies, where audiences had to wear
special clunky glasses.
</P>
<P>
   IPIX, which ranked No. 4 on The Chronicle 500's list of
fastest-growing companies by percentage of sales, is already
changing the face of online real estate. With a computer and a
modem, homebuyers can explore a house without stepping out the
door.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ZipRealty.com lets homebuyers look at several still
views of the house taken with an iPIX camera, using a mouse to move
the view of the picture in any direction _ right, left, up and
down.
</P>
<P>
   They can also zoom in or out, and thousands of homebuyers can
look at the same photo of the living room at the same time, but
choose different views, such as a close-up of the fireplace or the
bay view windows.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, media companies are also looking to cash in on this
new technology by looking at how ``immersive'' Web casts of
ballgames, concerts and other live events can drive traffic to
their sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immersive images have a definite practical purpose,'' said
Lia Schubert, Internet imaging analyst with InfoTrends Research
Group Inc., a Boston firm that tracks digital imaging trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the advent of e-commerce, companies, individuals, rock
bands and sports teams are looking to reach a wider audience
through the Web and need to do that visually,'' she said.
``Immersive imaging provides a very rich and interactive way for
these companies to actually get Internet-viewing customers
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking 360-degree video one step further is the groundbreaking
four-minute film ``The New Arrival,'' which made its debut in May
at the Cannes Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Using Be Here's 360-degree technology, New York independent film
director Amy Talkington tells the story of a ``new arrival'' at a
retirement home. Be Here's camera plays the title character, which
enables viewers to jump into the role. Although the story line is
predetermined, Be Here's technology allows the audience to direct
the view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really natural way to tell stories on the Internet,''
Talkington said. ``All my filmmaker friends who have seen the short
seem really excited about working in a new medium.''
</P>
<P>
   The film has been streamed about 100,000 times so far on
AtomFilms.com, the Seattle Web site that offers short films and
animated features. AtomFilms is running a contest among its 1
million registered members to come up with the best idea for the
next 360-degree video. The site plans to debut more original
immersive productions later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Also getting into the act are entertainers Ellen Degeneres and
Anne Heche, who are posting weekly immersive Web casts of their
``Ellen: The Americana Tour'' through August 4 at  &LR; www.ellenz.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Moving even one more step further, Be Here and Fox Sports Net
stationed cameras atop the two neutral corner posts of the boxing
ring during the June 18 fight in Las Vegas between Hector Camacho
Jr. and Manard Reed.
</P>
<P>
   No longer at the mercy of an unseen television director calling
the shots, the test showed how Internet viewers could control the
view and pan the stands for screaming fans, then pan back in time
to watch Camacho knock Reed to the canvas right below the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Although the boxing match wasn't Webcast to the public, Fox
Sports said the test should lead to live Webcasts of sporting
events in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Technology from Be Here, which has Intel, Phillips and Kodak as
investors, was used to Webcast activities during Super Bowl XXXIV,
the NFL draft and cable network ESPN's X Games.
</P>
<P>
   Providers of broadband access also stand to benefit. Driscoll
said 360-degree video will bring the content that will push sales
of high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our belief is people will not pay for broadband just so they
can load Yahoo in two seconds,'' Driscoll said.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll said other markets, such as security and day care, may
also find use for 360-degree video technology. ``You can pop this
magic periscope anywhere in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have developed technology that operates with the
same premise, that a specially designed camera lens can capture one
seamless 360-degree image. Other companies, like Enroute Inc. of
Palo Alto, have introduced immersive video that uses software to
stitch together multiple shots.
</P>
<P>
   Be Here's technology is the only one that supports live
streaming video, although it does not capture the top and bottom of
a picture or scene. Driscoll said Be Here's camera lens captures an
image that looks like a doughnut, cutting unneeded parts of a scene
that would otherwise take up bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   So far, iPIX technology, originally developed for NASA, cannot
be used to stream live video on the Internet. But it does afford a
full 360-by-360-degree view so a user can, for example, look at
both the ceiling and floor of a room.
</P>
<P>
   Both iPIX and Be Here have developed fist-size lenses and
software that capture 360-degree images for digital cameras, and
the lens sizes could shrink in the future.
</P>
<P>
   While the privately held Be Here has concentrated on
entertainment and sports, financial analyst Andrew Wilcox said iPIX
already has a solid business foundation because of its firm
foothold in online real estate.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly traded iPIX, which earlier this year moved into new
offices in San Ramon, last month signed a $12.25 million deal with
Cendant Corp., parent company of real estate giants Coldwell
Banker, ERA and Century 21, to use iPIX's ``virtual tours'' service
for 360-degree photos of homes for sale.
</P>
<P>
   IPIX also sells tour packages, offering a national network of
about 700 photographers who can take a series of immersive photos
of a home or hotel room for a client. The most popular package,
which includes four 360-degree shots, sells for $100, said iPIX
Executive Vice President Don Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's visual content that drives e-commerce,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant agreed to buy 350,000 virtual tours. It was the most
lucrative deal for iPIX, which posted sales of $12.52 million in
1999, about 16,000 percent more than the year before. The company
reported first quarter 2000 revenue of $8.3 million, but a net loss
of $36.9 million that included charges from a merger with virtual
home tour provider bamboo.com of Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox, of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., projects iPIX revenues
to hit about $68.8 million this year and $177 million in 2001. The
company is expecting to be profitable in mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox said iPIX has a virtual lock on the online real estate
market, to the point where iPIX's immersive photos are fast
becoming a requirement for online home listings. But with an
estimated 7 million to 8 million existing home sale listings
already online, iPIX has only scratched the surface of revenue
opportunities in real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see iPIX virtual tours as a standard in real
estate in two or three years,'' Wilcox said. ``It's becoming
addictive technology. Once you have the ability to pan around back
and forth, when you don't have it, you feel like you're missing
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The company signed a deal with eBay in April to allow eBay
members to use iPIX's technology to add 360-degree photos with
their online auction listings.
</P>
<P>
   And like Be Here, iPIX is focusing on immersive video.
</P>
<P>
   In April, iPIX signed a deal with digital entertainment company
POP.com of Glendale to produce interactive short films for the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That was significant because POP.com is a collaboration of
Imagine Entertainment, co-founded by director Ron Howard, and
DreamWorks SKG, founded by entertainment industry legends Steven
Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen and funded by
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Vulcan Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance ``will enable us to create unique and fresh online
entertainment, which will be fun for us as filmmakers and should
provide an exciting interactive experience for our viewers,''
Howard said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, not enough households have high-speed
Internet connections to make immersive film and other forms of
entertainment commercially viable, said InfoTrends analyst Lia
Schubert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit early for it now, but (iPIX) will be in
position when the bandwidth is there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although iPIX is the leader in immersive imaging, it remains to
be seen which technology may be more pervasive in the future, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a consumer standpoint, they don't care about underlying
technology,'' she said. ``They just want to know if it's cool or
not.''

 TECH 21: P3P NEEDS TO BE BETTER AT PRIVACY  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From Bill Clinton to Bill Gates, the establishment is rallying
around a new Internet standard called P3P. It's an interesting
development, but watch out for the hype they're spinning about it.
</P>
<P>
   Although P3P (which stands for Platform for Privacy Preferences)
is still just a working draft _ even after more than three years of
development _ the White House, AOL, AT&AMP;T, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and
even Procter &AMP; Gamble have already implemented it on their Web
sites. Microsoft and Netscape plan to build support for it into the
next release of their respective browsers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the World Wide Web Consortium, the nonprofit but
industry-dominated body sponsoring the standard's development, its
purpose is to provide ``a simple, automated way for users to gain
more control over the use of personal information on Web sites they
visit.''
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the spec and accompanying documentation at the P3P
home page ( &LR; www.w3.org/P3P &LR; ), it will probably live up to that
claim _ in a way. Its purpose is to define a standard,
machine-readable language for describing privacy policies _ what
kind of personal information a Web site proposes to collect from
users and how it intends to use the data.
</P>
<P>
   This turns out to require a surprisingly complex vocabulary. In
addition to terms for many kinds of demographic information _ birth
date, gender, home address and so on _ it also covers several types
of dynamic data, such as the ``referrer'' (the site the user came
from), the ``clickstream'' (exactly what the user clicks on while
visiting a site) and what he or she may have searched for.
</P>
<P>
   That's the easy part, though. The real challenge was to reduce
the variety of ways a site might use such information to a handful
of variables _ for example, how long the site will retain the
information it collects, whether it will use the data to contact
the individual to promote a product or service, whether it will
compile data into profiles of user habits, whether such profiles
will be anonymous or linked to personal identifying information,
etc.
</P>
<P>
   On the user side, a P3P-enabled browser would store the user's
preferences about such matters, then compare those preferences to
the policies of sites he or she visits. When the user _ call her
Sally Surfer _ goes to a site whose policies match her preferences,
she could cruise through it just as she does today, except that her
browser might display an icon indicating that everything is
hunky-dory from a privacy perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what happens when Sally hits a site whose policies don't
correspond to her preferences isn't defined in the current P3P
spec; that's left up to the developer of the browser or other
P3P-compliant software she's using.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, though, the program would put up a dialog box
alerting Sally to the discrepancy and giving her a choice between
accepting the site's policies or giving up her plan to visit it.
Earlier drafts of the specification included a scheme for
electronic haggling over such matters _ a way for users to get more
benefits for providing more information _ as well as a mechanism
for automatically transmitting personal data authorized by the
user's preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Those provisions, however, have been dropped _ the first because
of its technical complexity, the second reportedly because polling
showed widespread user resistance to background transfer of their
personal information.
</P>
<P>
   What's left is pretty modest, considering how long the standard
has been in gestation and how many powerful players have been
involved. As far as it goes, it strikes me as a modest step in the
right direction.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also a far cry from what we so obviously need: clear
and enforceable rules about the collection and use of personal
information. As far as it goes, it strikes me as a modest step in
the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also a far cry from what we so obviously need: clear
and enforceable rules about the collection and use of personal
information. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   -- Web site operators won't be under any obligation to implement
P3P. Lots of them _ the sleazy, the lazy, those who lack the
technical skills or software required _ will undoubtedly just
ignore it. And it certainly doesn't address the problem of the
failed dot-coms, which, as Cnet reported last week, are cheerfully
auctioning off information about their former customers, possibly
including phone and credit-card numbers, home addresses and
purchase histories ( &LR; news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-200- &LR; 
 &LR; 2176430.html?tagst.ne.1002.tgif.ni &LR; )
</P>
<P>
   -- Even if they're machine-readable, privacy policies are
inevitably complex, so I suspect most users won't bother to
configure the software for their own considered preferences _
they'll just accept the default settings.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nothing in the standard says what those defaults should be.
Because no user wants to be turned away from a site she's already
navigated to, and most will find it burdensome and confusing to
have to reconfigure their preferences before they can get where
they're going, browsermakers will be under pressure from users as
well as site operators to keep the bar low. (Don't forget: These
are the same browsermakers who brought us the cookie _ and have
since provided only the crudest tools for controlling this
frightful mechanism.)
</P>
<P>
   -- Neither technical standard can guarantee that sites actually
do what they say they will, whether they state their policies in
bits and bytes or in B2C bureaucratese. Nor can a standard impose
any penalty on those who violate their commitments.
</P>
<P>
   -- By accepting and formalizing the idea of trading personal
data for access, P3P could have the effect of encouraging sites
that don't collect such data to start doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all these shortcomings, many proponents of P3P are using
it to justify their opposition to more meaningful solutions to the
Internet privacy, such as laws of the sort that just about every
other developed country already has _ and that we in the United
States have enacted to protect other kinds of personal information,
including telephone and video-rental records.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder, then, that many seasoned privacy advocates are
leery of P3P. The Electronic Privacy Information Center, a
Washington, D.C., public-interest group that's been working on the
issue for six years, and Junkbusters, an organization run by a
computer scientist with a doctorate in data mining, have just
issued a scathing critique under the title ``Pretty Poor Privacy''
( &LR; www.epic.org/reports/prettypoor &QL;  &LR; 
 &LR; privacy.html &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   And even groups that support P3P acknowledge its limitations _
see, for example, the assessment produced by the Center for
Democracy and Technology in cooperation with the office of
Ontario's Information and Privacy Commissioner, which is posted at
 &LR; www.cdt.org/privacy/pet/p3pprivacy.shtml &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   NIXON TO THE RESCUE? One irony about the sad state of privacy
protection in the United States: This country isn't just the home
of the Bill of Rights and what Justice Louis Brandeis called ``the
right to be let alone'' _ it's also the home of the principles on
which Europe's computer-era privacy regulations are based. Known as
the Code of Fair Information Practices, these guidelines were
developed by a commission set up by, would you believe, the Nixon
administration. (I owe that tidbit to ``Database Nation,'' Simson
Garfinkel's excellent new book on the privacy problem, published by
O'Reilly.)
</P>
<P>
   Here are the five key principles of the code, as articulated
(according to Garfinkel) in a 1973 report of the then Department of
Health, Education and Welfare:
</P>
<P>
   -- There must be no personal data record-keeping system whose
very existence is secret.
</P>
<P>
   -- There must be a way for a person to find out what information
about the person is in a record and how it is used.
</P>
<P>
   -- There must be a way for a person to prevent information about
the person that was obtained for one purpose from being used or
made available for other purposes without the person's consent.
</P>
<P>
   -- There must be a way for a person to correct or amend a record
of identifiable information about the person.
</P>
<P>
   -- Any organization creating, maintaining, using or
disseminating records of identifiable personal data must assure the
reliability of the data for their intended use and must take
precautions to prevent misuses of the data.
</P>
<P>
   Giving these principles the force of law is no privacy panacea _
there isn't one _ but at least it would get at the heart of the
problem, which is more than one can say about P3P.
</P>
<P>
   SELF-DEFENSE RESOURCES: Whether or not you share Junkbusters'
harsh assessment of P3P, the group's Web site
( &LR; www.junkbusters.com &LR; ) is a valuable source of tips, tricks, links
and software for combating abusive marketers online and off.
</P>
<P>
   Junkbusters has long run its own banner-ad-and-cookie-blocking
software, but now it's endorsing a new entry in that category
called Guidescope ( &LR; www.guidescope.com/home &LR; ). The program,
available for Windows, Linux and Solaris, is still in beta testing,
and I haven't compared it in detail to AdSubtract, WebWasher or the
other utilities of this genre Becky Waring covered in her very
useful survey in the May 11 Chronicle
( &LR; www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file &LR; 
 &LR; /chronicle/archive/2000/05/11/BU41819. &QL;  &LR; 
 &LR; DTL &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, though, Guidescope looks like an alternative
well worth considering, especially because it's free for use at
home and by nonprofit institutions.
</P>
<P>
   If telemarketers get your goat, you might find some relief on
the page Junkbusters devotes to dealing with them. For litigious
types, the group's ``anti-telemarketing script'' explains how you
can, at least in theory, collect $500 to $1,500 for every call that
violates the provisions of the federal Telephone Consumer
Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to fight back without going to court _ and in the
process have a little righteous fun _ check out
 &LR; www.antitelemarketer.com/indexd.htm &LR; , especially the
``Telemarketer Tormenting Techniques'' page linked there. If that's
not enough, head to your favorite search site and enter
``tormenting telemarketers.'' I tried Google and found hundreds of
sites devoted to this subject.
</P>
<P>
   FILE NOT FOUND.NET: At Microsoft's Forum 2000 last month, where
Gates and the gang rolled out their new .NET strategy, the PCs
lining the press room were all carefully configured to use a
special home page on the company's ``Presspass'' server. To judge
by the URL, it was dedicated to summarizing the .NET plan. As is so
often the case with Microsoft, the idea was nice, but the execution
fell a little short: When you opened Internet Explorer and it tried
to locate the page, all it found was a message explaining that the
page no longer existed.

 BIOSCOPE: BIOTECH-DATA RESPONSIBILITY VS. PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Is the libertarian high-tech industry on the
verge of embracing government regulation?
</P>
<P>
   That's what it sounded like last week, when Bill Joy, chief
scientist for Sun Microsystems, told a conference at the University
of California at Berkeley that biotechnology had such great
potential for misuse by terrorists that geneticists ought to quit
posting some genome sequence data on the Internet and help create a
governmental body to regulate risky experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Joy, who achieved fame in computing for helping create the Unix
operating system, has emerged in recent months as the Cassandra of
self-inflicted technological peril.
</P>
<P>
   In an April article in Wired magazine, Joy warned that humans
are on the verge of creating powerful computers, genetically
enhanced organisms and microscopic robots that have the potential
to replicate and evolve _ creations that might one day turn on
their makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what happened to the other creatures on this planet
because of us,'' Joy said at last week's biotech conference. ``I
don't think we should expect to be treated any better'' if we allow
self-replicating technologies to develop uncontrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Joy's dinner speech, given to biotech executives and scientists
who had gathered for a conference at UC Berkeley last week, focused
on the dangers of studying infectious microbes.
</P>
<P>
   Joy suggested it was foolish for the biologists who determined
the sequence of the smallpox vaccine to post this data on the
central Web site where all genome data is shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make the tools (for analyzing genetic data) so powerful
that delusional people can use them,'' we could find ourselves
under attack one day by ``designer pathogens,'' Joy said. He
suggested that certain types of biological knowledge should be
restricted to medical professionals with a valid need to know.
</P>
<P>
   He ridiculed a similar project that is still under way.
Scientific teams in the United States and Britain are trying to
extract viral samples from corpses frozen during the 1918 flu
epidemic, to sequence that microbe and learn why it was so
contagious. This, Joy suggested, is the sort of experiment that
should be cleared by an ``international technology assessment
committee'' authorized to halt projects deemed dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   I located the U.S. scientist who sequenced the smallpox virus,
and the British researcher who is studying the 1918 flu bug, to
discuss Joy's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Esposito, a virologist with the Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta, said he undertook the smallpox project in the early
1990s to understand the virus in case it flares up again. Esposito
said he enlisted the aid of Craig Venter _ of human genome fame _
and after Venter's lab sequenced the virus, they posted the data on
the Web site where all genetic sequences are put for the world to
see.
</P>
<P>
   I explained Joy's concerns, and his suggestion that access to
such ``intrinsically dangerous'' data be restricted to authorized
medical Pros. Esposito disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put information under lock and key, it blocks
innovation,'' Esposito said. ``You're not gonna give a rookie
researcher the keys to the dangerous data, but it might be the
rookie who has the brainstorm.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sir John Skehel, director of the National Institute for
Medical Research in London, said he isn't sure he will publish the
sequence data if he is indeed able to reconstruct the genetic
material of the 1918 flu bug.
</P>
<P>
   Skehel's researchers are trying to extract viral genetic
material from plague victims frozen in the permafrost in Norway. So
far, they have been unsuccessful. But, Skehel said, U.S. viral
experts have had better luck. They've already isolated and
sequenced two of the eight genes in the flu bug and published their
data.
</P>
<P>
   However, subsequent criticisms, predating Joy's, have caused
scientists on both sides of the Atlantic to rethink whether they
should publish the rest of the flu genes, if they can indeed be
isolated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secrecy of information is a new thing for biologists,''
Skehel said in a telephone interview from London. ``People have
held meetings to talk about what should and should not be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Joy's message of self-censorship and self-restraint met with
polite applause from the biotech crowd at the UC Berkeley
conference. Attendees seemed to think he raised valid concerns,
even if some of his suggestions were antithetical to the scientific
norm of sharing information. (You can read Joy's recommendations in
an April 18 Op-Ed piece in the Washington Post.)
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of his comments resonated fairly well with many of the
people there,'' said David Kingsbury, a White House science adviser
during the 1980s and now a biotechnology consultant.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, meeting-goers liked Joy's suggestion that
biotechnologists create a code of ethics, or Hippocratic Oath.
However, the Biotechnology Industry Organization already asks
members to subscribe to such an ethics policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Kingsbury questioned Joy's comment that some forms of
knowledge carry such ``intrinsic danger'' that they must be
censored. ``Some of us felt Bill had taken a step beyond where we
need to go,'' Kingsbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Penhoet, dean of public health school at UC Berkeley and a
conference organizer, observed that Joy's suggestions were tough to
swallow given that ``he comes from a world that is resisting even
the smallest increment of regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the high-tech industry has just spent eight years
browbeating the Clinton administration to relax export controls on
encryption and supercomputing. U.S. criminal authorities have
sought to control code-making software for fear it will enable
terrorists to conceal their plots. Defense experts want to keep
supercomputers from foreign nations that might use them to design
nuclear weapons or missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems has said these restrictions steal sales from
Silicon Valley without improving security because firms in other
nations are free to export both technologies. When I e-mailed Joy
about this, he said he had always disagreed with his company on
encryption and felt that some controls on code-software were
needed.
</P>
<P>
   So even if Joy's new positions are consistent with his past
beliefs, he is still wrong to suggest that we'll be more secure by
wrapping aspects of biology in the sort of secrecy that surrounds
nuclear weapons. Who classifies biological facts? Who gets access?
Do we create a Livermore and Los Alamos for biotechnology?
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear weapons have not been controlled through secrecy.
Knowledge is not, as Joy suggests, intrinsically dangerous. Anyone
who cares to know how to build an atom bomb already knows what to
do. The fact that there aren't more members of the nuclear club
owes to the fact that few nations have the technological ability to
refine plutonium or build detonation triggers.
</P>
<P>
   Joy is correct in pointing out that it will be easier to misuse
biotech because the equipment and techniques are more readily
available. Any drug research lab is a potential center for
bio-terrorism. Should we equip them with surveillance cams, or
subject them to periodic random inspections?
</P>
<P>
   It's preposterous to assert that gene sequence data is
intrinsically dangerous. I've seen gene sequences. They're a
gibberish of ATGCs. It takes a trained microbiologist to see the
meaning. So if we're afraid of terrorists or other nations misusing
this knowledge, we must not only control the data. We must also
stop training the foreigners who make up roughly half of the
graduate student populace in U.S. universities.
</P>
<P>
   So, Bill, thank you for your concern. They worry all of us. But
putting barbed wire around biology isn't the solution.

 BIOSCOPE: BIOTECH-DATA RESPONSIBILITY VS. PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Is the libertarian high-tech industry on the
verge of embracing government regulation?
</P>
<P>
   That's what it sounded like last week, when Bill Joy, chief
scientist for Sun Microsystems, told a conference at the University
of California at Berkeley that biotechnology had such great
potential for misuse by terrorists that geneticists ought to quit
posting some genome sequence data on the Internet and help create a
governmental body to regulate risky experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Joy, who achieved fame in computing for helping create the Unix
operating system, has emerged in recent months as the Cassandra of
self-inflicted technological peril.
</P>
<P>
   In an April article in Wired magazine, Joy warned that humans
are on the verge of creating powerful computers, genetically
enhanced organisms and microscopic robots that have the potential
to replicate and evolve _ creations that might one day turn on
their makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what happened to the other creatures on this planet
because of us,'' Joy said at last week's biotech conference. ``I
don't think we should expect to be treated any better'' if we allow
self-replicating technologies to develop uncontrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Joy's dinner speech, given to biotech executives and scientists
who had gathered for a conference at UC Berkeley last week, focused
on the dangers of studying infectious microbes.
</P>
<P>
   Joy suggested it was foolish for the biologists who determined
the sequence of the smallpox vaccine to post this data on the
central Web site where all genome data is shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make the tools (for analyzing genetic data) so powerful
that delusional people can use them,'' we could find ourselves
under attack one day by ``designer pathogens,'' Joy said. He
suggested that certain types of biological knowledge should be
restricted to medical professionals with a valid need to know.
</P>
<P>
   He ridiculed a similar project that is still under way.
Scientific teams in the United States and Britain are trying to
extract viral samples from corpses frozen during the 1918 flu
epidemic, to sequence that microbe and learn why it was so
contagious. This, Joy suggested, is the sort of experiment that
should be cleared by an ``international technology assessment
committee'' authorized to halt projects deemed dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   I located the U.S. scientist who sequenced the smallpox virus,
and the British researcher who is studying the 1918 flu bug, to
discuss Joy's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Esposito, a virologist with the Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta, said he undertook the smallpox project in the early
1990s to understand the virus in case it flares up again. Esposito
said he enlisted the aid of Craig Venter _ of human genome fame _
and after Venter's lab sequenced the virus, they posted the data on
the Web site where all genetic sequences are put for the world to
see.
</P>
<P>
   I explained Joy's concerns, and his suggestion that access to
such ``intrinsically dangerous'' data be restricted to authorized
medical Pros. Esposito disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put information under lock and key, it blocks
innovation,'' Esposito said. ``You're not gonna give a rookie
researcher the keys to the dangerous data, but it might be the
rookie who has the brainstorm.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sir John Skehel, director of the National Institute for
Medical Research in London, said he isn't sure he will publish the
sequence data if he is indeed able to reconstruct the genetic
material of the 1918 flu bug.
</P>
<P>
   Skehel's researchers are trying to extract viral genetic
material from plague victims frozen in the permafrost in Norway. So
far, they have been unsuccessful. But, Skehel said, U.S. viral
experts have had better luck. They've already isolated and
sequenced two of the eight genes in the flu bug and published their
data.
</P>
<P>
   However, subsequent criticisms, predating Joy's, have caused
scientists on both sides of the Atlantic to rethink whether they
should publish the rest of the flu genes, if they can indeed be
isolated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secrecy of information is a new thing for biologists,''
Skehel said in a telephone interview from London. ``People have
held meetings to talk about what should and should not be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Joy's message of self-censorship and self-restraint met with
polite applause from the biotech crowd at the UC Berkeley
conference. Attendees seemed to think he raised valid concerns,
even if some of his suggestions were antithetical to the scientific
norm of sharing information. (You can read Joy's recommendations in
an April 18 Op-Ed piece in the Washington Post.)
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of his comments resonated fairly well with many of the
people there,'' said David Kingsbury, a White House science adviser
during the 1980s and now a biotechnology consultant.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, meeting-goers liked Joy's suggestion that
biotechnologists create a code of ethics, or Hippocratic Oath.
However, the Biotechnology Industry Organization already asks
members to subscribe to such an ethics policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Kingsbury questioned Joy's comment that some forms of
knowledge carry such ``intrinsic danger'' that they must be
censored. ``Some of us felt Bill had taken a step beyond where we
need to go,'' Kingsbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Penhoet, dean of public health school at UC Berkeley and a
conference organizer, observed that Joy's suggestions were tough to
swallow given that ``he comes from a world that is resisting even
the smallest increment of regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the high-tech industry has just spent eight years

sought to control code-making software for fear it will enable
terrorists to conceal their plots. Defense experts want to keep

<P>
   ``How do you say the name?'' Sal Carr asked as he eased the
motorboat through the Marine Basin Marina in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
Saturday evening and out into Gravesend Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bat'kivshchyna,'' Taras Szczur said. ``Bat-keev-SHIYN-a.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr, a marina tenant who had agreed to take Szczur, the OpSail
2000 liaison to the schooner Bat'kivshchyna, on a reconnaissance
ride around the harbor, tuned the radio to Channel 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ummm, Bak-ta-chinn-ee,'' he called out to every vessel within
50 miles. ``Ukraine ship. Are you out there? Ukraine sail, are you
out there? Are you out there?''
</P>
<P>
   Carr released the talk button. ``They don't have a cell phone?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually they did. But it wasn't on. Or it wasn't working. Or _
come to think of it, Szczur (pronounced shoor) recalled, ``They
were asking me for a battery charger right before they left
Baltimore.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter. The Bat'kivshchyna would arrive. The captain,
Dmytro Biriukovich, would make sure of it. He had never lost faith,
not when the ship ran aground in the Dnieper River a few days into
the trip and lost a big chunk of its keel, as well as a toilet. Nor
when storms in the Mediterranean shredded the mainsail.
</P>
<P>
   Nor when the ship lost satellite phone service near Spain, nor
when the radio gave up the ghost somewhere in the Atlantic,
triggering a two-week oceanwide search by the Coast Guard. Nor when
a mysterious problem, either with the winds or with reading the
instructions for the Global Positioning System, caused the
Bat'kivshchyna to miss the opening parade of OpSail 2000 in San
Juan, Puerto Rico, by about 1,400 miles and end up in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's normal seaman problem,'' the captain, a courtly,
63-year-old in spotless whites and a skipper's hat, had said on
Wednesday as he stood on the deck in Baltimore. ``I don't like to
explain, `Oh, how it was hard, wah wah wah.' I found this way. I
have found it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's grand Parade of Sail through New York Harbor will
feature hundreds of the most imposing vessels on the planet, from a
371-foot Chilean barkentine to President Clinton's aircraft
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Bat'kivshchyna, the official, if utterly
unfunded, representative of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   A floating testament to either the indomitability of the human
spirit or the primacy of Murphy's Law, the Bat'kivshchyna, a
90-foot metal-hulled former fishing trawler dipped in cement and
topped with two masts, left Kiev on April 7 with a crew of 15,
counting the captain's wife and 14-year-old grandson. How it made
it across the Atlantic is still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``In yachting life,'' Biriukovich (beer-yoo-KOH-vich), a retired
civil engineer, had philosophized in Baltimore, ``some days bad and
some days good. We forget bad and remember good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bat'kivshchyna left Baltimore Thursday for a 200-mile run to
New York, a hop and a skip for a ship that had already covered
8,000 miles as the albatross flies. But though it was expected in
Brooklyn midday Saturday afternoon, there was still no sign of it
on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Kellogg, the captain's son-in-law, and (to his frequent
chagrin these last three months) the Bat'kivshchyna's one-man land
crew, was hardly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how it is with them,'' said Kellogg, 46. ``Everything
is ``Don't worry, be happy.' My father-in-law and his Jamaican
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When OpSail's organizers were putting the event together, they
sent invitations to dozens of foreign governments. In January they
began getting calls from a man who wanted to teach the world about
the wonders of Ukraine from aboard a boat he had built called
Bat'kivshchyna. (It means ``motherland.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know they existed,'' said Alma Viator, OpSail 2000's
director of international and government affairs. ``They were not
on my radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
   At least she has a radar screen. The Bat'kivshchyna had no
radar, virtually no communication equipment, and no corporation or
nonprofit foundation willing to sponsor it. Asking the Ukrainian
government for a handout was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many problems now in our country,'' Biriukovich said.
``We must give assistance, not ask for it.''
</P>
<P>
   After several months and a trip to the United States, he had
raised about $5,500, mostly from OpSail itself, about a tenth of
what a voyage of this magnitude typically costs. (Donors and
sponsors may send e-mail messages to Cfue(at)webtv.net.)
</P>
<P>
   To make ends meet, the Bat'kivshchyna turns into a floating gift
shop when it hits port, doing a brisk business in ``McLenin''
T-shirts, fake fur hats, hand-lacquered refrigerator magnets, and
nesting wooden dolls of President Clinton containing Monica
Lewinsky containing Paula Jones containing the first lady
containing a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the cash flow problems, the Ukrainians found the State
Department leery of issuing entry visas, given the many Ukrainians
who come here as visitors and forget to leave.
</P>
<P>
   But Biriukovich was not to be deterred. On April 7, to a hero's
sendoff and much news media attention, the Bat'kivshchyna set sail
from Kiev, the first boat of the season to test the ice-clogged
Dnieper River. The next day, Biriukovich's house was burglarized.
</P>
<P>
   On Day 7, the boat slammed aground when the helmsman fell asleep
at the wheel. Minus a piece of its keel, Bat'kivshchyna soldiered
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks not so pretty,'' a crew member, Sergei Sklonchak,
said of the black-hulled gaff-rigged boat, ``but it is very strong.
It has big, heavy metal body. Like a tank.''
</P>
<P>
   The mishaps continued. There was a near-international incident
in Turkey, after the Ukrainian Coast Guard sank a Turkish fishing
ship it said had been poaching in Ukraine waters, and the Turks
vowed revenge. Keen to avoid Turkish gunfire, the Bat'kivshchyna
slipped through the Bosporus in the dead of night. There were
storms in the Mediterranean so severe that a crew member jumped
ship in Cadiz, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Now the communication problems began. The ship's satellite phone
stopped working after the phone company was sold and the customers
were not automatically switched over. And on May 13, shortly after
the ship transmitted a position 250 miles west of the Canary
Islands, the radio went dead.
</P>
<P>
   The seafaring community feared the worst. The Coast Guard sent
search planes clear to Africa. The first in a series of OpSail
events opened in San Juan, Puerto Rico, without the Bat'kivshchyna.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-Atlantic, Biriukovich, cut off from the world, made a
decision. The seas were freakishly calm, and he was running low on
fuel. He would skip Puerto Rico and Miami and make a beeline for
Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   At least that was the official story. Several crew members said
that in fact, someone on board had set the Global Positioning
System to take a reading off a European satellite rather than off
an U.S. satellite, with potentially disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we went to the south,'' said Katya Dorivchekno, 21,
the only woman in the crew other than the captain's wife, Nina.
``When we met another ship and we took coordinates from him, he
told us that we were 1,000 miles north. There was some joking that
we will go to Greenlandia and that we will see some icebergs.'' On
June 6, navigating without radar in heavy fog, the Bat'kivshchyna
pulled into Norfolk. It was either 17 days late for the start of
OpSail or eight days early for the festivities in Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   It did not matter. They were an immediate hit, and Virginians
fell over themselves to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore brought more of the same. People gave the crew with
coolers of beer, cartons of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Bat'kivshchyna pulled anchor. Late Sunday
afternoon, Kellogg said he suspected that the captain was doing
some more discovering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if he was just sailing around the
harbor looking at New York City,'' Kellogg said. ``That's something
my mother-in-law always wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then at 6:20 p.m. Sunday, the sky-blue and wheat-yellow
Ukrainian flag appeared above the waters of Gravesend Bay. The
Bat'kivshchyna had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Biriukovich, looking very refreshed, explained that he and the
crew had stayed with friends in Chesapeake City, Md., for two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not in a hurry,'' he said. ``We have breakfast and we
have lunch and we have dinner there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful,'' he added, giving two thumbs up.

GROUP DRIVES LONG DISTANCE TO WITNESS MEXICO ELECTION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MATAMOROS, Mexico _ When Alfredo Castaneda of Dallas asked why a
Matamoros resident was allowed to vote in a polling place that was
supposed to be off limits to him, the representative of Mexico's
Federal Electoral Institute ordered him and the media out.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda said that exchange illustrates why he and other
independent observers were needed as witnesses to Sunday's voting
in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to safeguard the vote of the Mexican coming from
abroad,'' Castaneda said, noting that special voting booths along
the border had only 750 ballots each reserved for the use of those
coming home from abroad to vote. ``If somebody else uses his
ballot, he's left without a vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the special polling places for Mexicans from abroad
were in Matamoros, meaning they had 2,250 votes in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Although Castaneda holds dual citizenship and as such was not
eligible to vote in the election, his desire to help fight fraud at
polling places was so strong that he and two other colleagues drove
nine hours from Dallas just to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an historic election,'' he said. ``The whole world is
paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda, Eduardo Banda and Gregorio Ibanez were organizers of
a caravan that was to have brought Mexican citizens from the
Dallas-Fort Worth area to the border to vote, but no one showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people didn't come because there was a lot of
misinformation on the number of ballots available in the special
voting booths,'' Castaneda said. ``Many canceled at the last minute
because they (mistakenly) believed that only 50 of the 750 ballots
at booths were (for) voters outside their electoral district.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds lined up at the municipal plaza before 8 a.m.,
concerned that they wouldn't get a ballot unless they arrived
early. Among them were dozens of Mexican citizens who live in the
United States, most from cities such as Houston and Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here for change,'' said Jorge Gomez, 31, of Houston.
Originally from the Mexican state of Sonora, Gomez and five friends
and family members drove six hours to cast their vote for Vicente
Fox of the National Action Party, who was leading in early poll
results.
</P>
<P>
   Hector and Margarita Miranda of Brownsville also said a desire
for change drew them across the border early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons we left Mexico was because of the
government,'' said Margarita Miranda, referring to the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, also known as PRI, which has
governed the country for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair that they continue to stay in power,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hector Miranda was disappointed that only 750 ballots
were allotted, he grudgingly acknowledged that the limited number
of ballots was also a safeguard against fraud by not leaving a
large number of unused ballots that could easily be stolen or
manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   Some did not get to vote because ballots ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda said that's just the type of thing he and his
colleagues hope to improve. ``The government never expects a large
turnout from Mexicans living in the U.S.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``Mexicans abroad are going to play a large role
because we love our country, we love our culture and now we are
more informed.''

 &HT;    CARTER SAYS MEXICO 'TRYING TO DO IT RIGHT'
 &HT;    Eds: Adds details of 1962 Carter race in first 3 grafs.
 &HT;    With MEXICO-ELECTION.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Jimmy Carter remembers fighting fraud back in
Georgia in 1962, when one rival in a state election took extreme
measures in an attempt to keep the young reformer out of office.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Turning Point,'' Carter writes that the minions of
Joe Hurst, the political boss of tiny Quitman County, voted the
dead in alphabetical order, deposited ballots in bundles to make
counting easier, and intimidated voters at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   After a long battle fought in the courts and in the press,
Carter finally prevailed to take his seat in the state Senate,
although with his confidence in the democratic process shaken.
</P>
<P>
   It was with this background that Carter came to Mexico to watch
this country's historic presidential election Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Mexico,'' said surprised voters who recognized the
former U.S. president as he strode into the Museum of the School of
Medicine, a handsome stone colonial building in downtown Mexico
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was where the Spanish inquisition took place,'' Carter
said, gazing around the inner patio where a polling station was set
up.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Carter was witnessing a more progressive step in
Mexico's history.
</P>
<P>
   He and others from the Atlanta-based Carter Center observed what
is supposed to the cleanest and most competitive presidential
election ever in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The former president was invited by all of Mexico's major
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think they're trying to do it right,'' Carter said.
He praised the technical aspects of Mexico's new balloting system
and officials he met at the Federal Elections Institute, an
independent agency supervising the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Many here believe this could be an election too close to call.
Preliminary returns that could give even a hint of the winner are
not expected before early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which
has controlled this country's presidency for 71 years, is facing a
tough challenge from center-right candidate Vicente Fox. And the
PRI, as a Carter report on the elections noted, has been criticized
by opponents for coercing poor people and government workers to
vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any doubt there's been widespread
attempts by the PRI to use its incumbency,'' he said. ``But I know
incumbency can cut both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   A party that has long held power, he said, is vulnerable if
voters are dissatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, assessing the fairness of the vote, said that if voters
truly believe they can vote in secret, they turn to their
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   At the Museum of the School of Medicine, he noted the curtained
white booths where voters marked ballots only after checking in
with officials who compared their photo ID cards against
registration lists with copies of photos and names.
</P>
<P>
   Signs on the booths read, ``Your vote is free and secret.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how many favors they've been promised or how many
threats they've received, we hope the voters should know their vote
is secret,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Holding up thumbs smudged with indelible ink, voter Jose Luis
Jimenez rushed up to greet Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to have him here,'' the high school teacher
said. He said he voted for the PRI's Francisco Labastida because
its candidate has experience.
</P>
<P>
   After Carter left, voter Antonio Arreguin, 49, said, ``The
former president? I wished I had seen him.'' He said he voted for
Fox ``because Mexico really needs a change.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE UNSEEN SOFTENS A METS' LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Baseball is a numbers game: batting averages, earned
run averages, games ahead, games behind. Monday morning, the
numbers show that, for all the excitement of a wild four-game
series that was framed by waves of police officers, the Mets still
trail the Braves by two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way,'' Mike Piazza said after Sunday's 10-2 shellacking
by Atlanta at Shea Stadium, ``it was a wash. But there was a lot of
excitement for the fans and players. I'm glad it's behind us. But
we're where we were coming into the series.''
</P>
<P>
   Are they really?
</P>
<P>
   As players spoke after Sunday's game, there was the distinct
sense _ from each team's hard-core veterans _ that numbers don't
begin to tell the story of this rivalry or this race. That the
distance that separates these two teams can no longer be measured
by games, but by intangibles.
</P>
<P>
   As Derek Bell, the Mets' right fielder, left the clubhouse
Sunday, he was asked if he thought Atlanta's two-game lead was as
daunting now as it was on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' Bell said. ``We showed today that we're not
going anywhere, that we're going to keep coming at them.''
</P>
<P>
   When the series opened, the 31-year-old Bell cautioned that the
season was like a war, with long months of ebbs and flows. What
mattered was surviving the war and winning the crucial playoff
battles in October.
</P>
<P>
   What mattered less were personal streaks, and Bell had two of
those stopped Sunday. His 12-game hitting streak was snapped and
his team record of scoring at least one run in 11 straight games
came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said that in the long view of a baseball season, streaks
can be restarted and losses can be absorbed. The important thing is
that the Mets had introduced an element of doubt to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed Atlanta that we can play with them,'' Bell said.
``We showed them that we can score runs off their pitchers. They
know we're here and that we're not moving.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were defeated Thursday, staged one of the greatest
comebacks in franchise history Friday, and walloped Greg Maddux on
Saturday. Sunday, they were victimized by Tom Glavine, who pitched
one of his best games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But back-to-back home runs by Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile _
despite coming in a losing effort _ were yet more signals that the
older-sibling/younger-sibling relationship between Atlanta and the
Mets had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people only look at numbers,'' Zeile said about the
standing. ``We came in the series two games behind and we're still
two games behind. But if you take anything out of this, it's that
we don't have that same feeling of the Braves being invincible.''
</P>
<P>
   There was an unusual sense of relief in the Atlanta clubhouse.
Glavine, surrounded by a flock of news media representatives, said
he was simply happy that he gave his team a chance to win. Someone
asked if the split with New York helped Atlanta reaffirm its
position as the dominant team in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that we need affirmation of who we are,'' Glavine
said. ``But to split this series and go home is nice from a
psychological standpoint. But even if we lost three out of four, we
wouldn't have panicked about that, either.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a series of lessons. Glendon Rusch, the Mets'
26-year-old starter, was battered Sunday. The Braves, sobered by
two consecutive defeats, attacked Rusch from the beginning and
never let up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were aggressive,'' Rusch said. ``When they saw a pitch to
hit, they went after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusch, the youngster, watched the veteran Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't give in _ that's one thing I learned from him today.
He didn't give in. He gave up some hits, but he kept coming back.
It was good for me to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets should also be buoyed by the fact that the Braves have
to pull around the added weight of a silly young relief pitcher who
can't leave well enough alone. John Rocker has painted a unerasable
bull's-eye on Atlanta's collective back. While reaction to Rocker
boiled over in New York, his attitude has offended millions of
people nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The bad blood will follow the Braves for the next three months.
Sunday, Rocker went out onto the field before the eighth inning and
warmed up the left fielder. When the warm-up was over, Rocker
tossed the ball into the stands. The fan who caught it threw it
back _ fortunately, not hard; fortunately, not at Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   You can argue that the Braves had escaped once again after the
Mets had them cornered. But the Mets' miracle on Friday and the
pummeling on Saturday served notice that the escape routes are
disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Bell said Sunday: ``We've got a serious window of
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   How much space separates Atlanta from the Mets? Baseball is a
game of numbers, but this race is one of intangibles. A two-game
lead doesn't begin to tell the story.

IRWIN TAKES SENIOR OPEN WITH ANOTHER 65 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL ARKUSH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, Pa. _ Hale Irwin turned 55 years old last month,
which is about the age at which golfers on the Senior PGA Tour are
supposed to begin their decline. They are supposed to hit a wall as
their younger peers to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin must be an exception. Instead of hitting a wall, he shot a
second consecutive six-under 65 at Saucon Valley Country Club
Sunday to capture his second U.S. Senior Open championship in three
years, outdueling the overnight leader, Bruce Fleisher, by three
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an early blunder from Fleisher, Irwin wasted no time
in overcoming a two-stroke deficit. He birdied the par-5 first
hole, converting a 6-foot putt, as Fleisher, going for the green in
two, pushed his 3-wood approach from 270 yards into a bunker on the
right. With a tree in his way, Fleisher was unable to get his third
shot on the green, leading to a bogey and a tone-setting, two-shot
swing. Three holes later, Irwin made another birdie, the first of
three straight, to seize a lead he never relinquished. He finished
at 17-under 267.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a stupid play,'' conceded Fleisher. ``I felt if I could
put some heat on him early, things may work the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin appreciated Fleisher's aggressive strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' said Irwin, who earned $400,000. ``I don't
know what his thinking was. I just felt like he was so far away
that awfully early in the day with a two-shot lead to try that
shot. It just brought trouble into play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't work this time; it may next time. But I dare say, I
bet if he was in the same position, he won't do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The mistake amplified a significant difference between Irwin and
Fleisher.
</P>
<P>
   For all his excellence on the Senior Tour since he joined in
1999 _ 10 victories and nearly $4 million in earnings _ Fleisher
has yet to secure a major championship. Irwin, a three-time U.S.
Open winner, has been known as a player who performs best under the
most demanding pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks earlier, in the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, Irwin
was the only player besides Tiger Woods to record two rounds in the
60s. He finished tied for 27th.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't go train for it, you don't go practice it,'' said
Irwin, referring to the matter of experience. ``You don't go buy
some at the store. It's immeasurable. Only way you get experience
is to be there and to make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Experience, however, wasn't the only factor that aided Irwin. He
also played extremely well, hitting one outstanding approach after
another on the front nine. All four of his birdies on the front
came in putts of 7 feet or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played super today,'' said Fleisher. ``There is nothing I
could have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody else was able to challenge Irwin. Tom Kite, who trailed
by just three strokes entering the day, made only three birdies,
shooting a 69 to finish five back, while Hubert Green and Allen
Doyle, both within range, failed to break 70. Only Raymond Floyd,
who shot a 67, made a move. He finished fourth, seven strokes
behind Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   For Irwin, the victory means a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career has been defined by USGA championships,'' said
Irwin, who automatically earns a trip to next year's U.S. Senior
Open in Tulsa, Okla. ``If there is a tournament to win on the
Senior Tour, this is it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It also proves that Irwin, who takes over as the season's
leading money-winner with nearly $1.5 million, may be a long way
from the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is certainly a time period that you may be less
effective than you were before,'' said Irwin, who won his first
U.S. Senior Open in 1998 at Riviera Country Club in Pacific
Palisades, Calif. ``But if somebody is going to tell me at the age
of 55 you are not going to play golf anymore, I just don't buy into
that.''

ONLY TWO NAMES TO BE ON REFORM BALLOT  
 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When balloting begins Wednesday in the Reform Party presidential
primary, voters will have only two choices: Pat Buchanan, the
former conservative television commentator, and John Hagelin, a
physicist.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform presidential nominations committee has denied a
request by Ross Perot, the party founder _ who won a spot in the
primary through signature petitions _ that he be allowed to
substitute ``No Endorsement'' for his name on the ballot to let
voters protest the quality of the other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not consistent with the rules,'' said Michael Farris,
the committee chairman. ``We felt that his name would have to
appear on the ballot in some semblance of his legal name.
Otherwise, it would lead to confusion, and that was the long and
the short of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris said the committee also denied an appeal by the Buchanan
campaign to bar Hagelin from seeking the presidency under the
banner of another party if he lost to Buchanan. Hagelin was the
nominee of the Natural Law Party in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Farris said it was not within the province of the party's
leaders to tell Hagelin what he could or could not do if Buchanan
won the Reform nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to bring it up in the course of their campaign,
that's up to them,'' he said of Buchanan's supporters. ``We don't
feel we had the discretion to tell Hagelin what to do.''

COAST GUARD CHOREOGRAPHS HARBOR'S BIGGEST SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Precisely at 11 a.m. Saturday, the USS Nassau, an
amphibious-helicopter carrier, passed under the Verrazano-Narrows
Bridge into Upper New York Bay. The ship was headed for its turn at
the diesel ballet, a maneuver in which four tugboats nudge their
hulking gray partner into its appointed anchorage southwest of Red
Hook, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The low-slung black tugs, engines thrumming and wakes bulging,
pushed and spun the 820-feet-long ship against a light breeze and
tide until it could tie down, one link at a time, to four buoys,
completing a procedure called a four-point mooring.
</P>
<P>
   The routine was repeated again Sunday with the aircraft carrier
John F. Kennedy, 990 feet long, and the USS Mount Whitney, a
620-feet-long command and control ship. The procedures,
particularly with such enormous ships in congested tidal waters,
required a degree of choreographic precision that makes young deck
officers pace.
</P>
<P>
   Far from this action, in a small room at Fort Wadsworth on
Staten Island, a team of Coast Guard men and women paced as well,
observing the maneuvers on television monitors and radar screens.
After years of Coast Guard preparation, the harbor traffic for
OpSail 2000 had begun, and the people in the Vessel Traffic Center,
as the room is known, were in the early stages of the most
demanding test in the center's history.
</P>
<P>
   The Vessel Traffic Center is one of four major command posts in
place for the OpSail celebrations on Independence Day. Others will
be at the command and control center inside One Police Plaza, the
City Office of Emergency Management's so-called bunker on the 23rd
floor of 7 World Trade Center and a temporary Navy center on Pier
94 on the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Of all these command posts, the Coast Guard's is the only one
that functions at full strength all year, every hour. It is the
maritime counterpart of an airport air traffic control tower, a
place from which the comings and goings of all vessels in the Port
of New York are assisted, supervised and meticulously recorded. It
monitors harbor traffic by remote radar and live television cameras
mounted along the waterways, and keeps in touch with each vessel by
VHF radio or cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   The center's core purpose is to prevent nautical disasters like
the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska in 1989 or the most notorious case
in recent decades in New York, the crash of a container ship, Sea
Witch, with the oil tanker Esso Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Witch struck the tanker at night in the Narrows and the
two ships locked together, creating a drifting inferno that
eventually grounded in Gravesend Bay, Brooklyn. The collision
occurred in 1973, before the port's Vessel Traffic Center opened.
</P>
<P>
   The center was first used in 1976, and during the OpSail events
of the next few days, it will try to maintain order over what is
expected to be the largest number of ships and boats ever to gather
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical day, the operators help on about 750 port crossings
by large vessels as they pass through New York, serving as a sort
of information clearinghouse on events in the port. But that's a
typical day. As the OpSail celebration gains momentum, the Coast
Guard expects to see something unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty more naval vessels are to pass through the Narrows
Monday, as well as a number of tall sailing ships will also be
making their way into Upper New York Bay, and all these vessels
will be converging Tuesday with hundreds of security vessels and
tens of thousands of pleasure craft.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the radar signatures of the pleasure craft _
tiny white blips _ will overwhelm the center's radar monitors with
a solid field of interference. ``You'll have virtually complete
whiteout,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Christopher Nichols, the Vessel Traffic
Center's supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   To help maintain order, the Coast Guard will complement the
center with a strong presence on the water: more than 200 boats or
cutters, supervised by a command ship, the buoy tender Willow,
anchored just south of Governors Island. The Vessel Traffic Center
will also receive a video transmission from a blimp.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard also hopes that routine port traffic _ the
container ships, oil tankers and fuel barges _ will stay away until
the celebrations end. It has issued a 24-hour restriction against
commercial traffic, beginning at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the center on Saturday, three operators peered at the
radar screens for a finely detailed overview of more than 40
nautical square miles, an area that includes New York City, Perth
Amboy, Newark and Elizabethport, and extends from Sandy Hook, N.J.,
to the Throgs Neck Bridge on the East River and to the Holland
Tunnel ventilators on the lower Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   On the screens, the outline of each segment of waterway glowed
brightly. The water showed up as black. Each of the dozens of
vessels traveling through the port was illuminated by its own
computerized icon, which, with a click, revealed the vessel's
course, speed and destination.
</P>
<P>
   The operators passed along all manner of nautical information in
quick, dispassionate bits: floating debris in this channel, proceed
with care; two vessels approaching Hell Gate, both will wait for
you to pass; and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Although similar to an air traffic control tower, the Vessel
Traffic Center has a key difference: it cannot ordinarily tell
vessels what to do. Ultimate responsibility for a ship and its
actions rests with each skipper and crew.
</P>
<P>
   As the Nassau wheeled slowly in the bay outside, Petty Officer
1st Class Matthew Starace watched the screens closely. He was
midway through a 12-hour shift, simultaneously monitoring and
talking with 13 ships and tugs traversing the East River, as well
as nine more at anchor.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, his clean screen will be a mass of white. Talking to
a tug-and-barge as it approached Hell Gate, he spoke into his
headset with the practiced composure of a mortician. It was a tone
of voice, Coast Guard officials say, they hope continues through
OpSail.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the secrets of this job,'' Starace said between
conversations with skippers out on the harbor, ``is just staying
calm.''

   (NYT15) NEW YORK -- July 2, 2000 -- OPSAIL-UNDERDOG-2 -- A
floating testament to either the indomitability of the human spirit
or the primacy of Murphy's Law, the Bat'kivshchyna, a 90-foot
metal-hulled former fishing trawler from the Ukraine dipped in
cement and topped with two masts, left Kiev on April 7. How it made
it across the Atlantic is still unclear. From running aground in
the Dnieper River a few days into the trip and losing a big chunk
of its keel, to storms in the Mediterranean shredding the mainsail,
to presumably getting lost somewhere in the somewhere in the
Atlantic, Dmytro Biriukovich, captain of the Bat'kivshchyna, never

On top of the timeless complications of being 12 years old, an age
of bubbling hormones and anti-authority stirrings, sixth-graders
today face a combination of pressures that their parents never
encountered. In this era of earlier and higher expectations, many
students say they are driven to excel by parents who had seized on
test scores and early college readiness as new benchmarks for
success. Max Mashore, a sixth grader at Sidwell Friends school in
Washington, D.C., wants to go to Duke University, his father's alma
mater. ``I don't want to go to some small college in the middle of
Maine or something,'' says Mashore. (Paul Hosefros/The New York

On top of the timeless complications of being 12 years old, an age

today face a combination of pressures that their parents never

students say they are driven to excel by parents who had seized on
test scores and early college readiness as new benchmarks for
success. Max Mashore, a sixth grader at Sidwell Friends school in
Washington, D.C., wants to go to Duke University, his father's alma

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Opposition candidate Vicente Fox appeared headed
for a historic presidential election victory that could usher in a
new era for Mexico, exit polls indicated Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys of voters leaving the polls are a new feature of
Mexican elections, and their reliability is uncertain. But if the
polls hold up, the 71-year reign of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) could be coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a towering and charismatic businessman who turned 58
Sunday, delivered a virtual victory speech at the headquarters of
his National Action Party (PAN).
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't yet confirm officially we've won the presidency of
the republic,'' Fox told cheering supporters. He said he would wait
until Mexico's Federal Elections Institute announced results of a
``quick count'' of the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   But he praised election officials and said, ``We're going
through a moment of transition to a new political state in a
peaceful and stable and tranquil manner. ... We have to
congratulate ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Significant voting returns were not available Sunday evening,
and Mexico's rural vote could swing votes toward the ruling party.
Turnout was high, and it may take days before all the votes can be
gathered and counted in this large and impoverished nation of 100
million people.
</P>
<P>
   PRI officials made no statement, but the streets of the capital
began to fill with Fox supporters celebrating his apparent victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that the era of the dinosaurs is over,'' said
a jubilant Sonia Suarez, 26, an electrical engineer in Mexico City,
referring to the pejorative name often employed for the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   A Fox victory would end an era of one-party rule that is all
that a vast majority of Mexicans has ever known. The populist and
agrarian PRI would give way to a pro-business party that is
urban-oriented and inclined to let markets do more of what
government has done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide poll for the leading Televisa television station
found Fox, of the National Action Party (PAN), with 44 percent to
38 percent for the PRI's Francisco Labastida. A third candidate,
leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, had 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Polls by other television outlets and the Democracy Watch group
also showed Fox leading by six or more percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls also showed PAN winning governorships in two
states, Morelos and Guanajuato, and the leftist Democratic
Revolution Party holding on to the mayor's office in Mexico City's
federal district, the country's political heart.
</P>
<P>
   No polling results were available for the two houses of the
nation's Congress, also at stake Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate indications of widespread election
fraud. Though Mexico is notorious for electoral corruption, the PRI
had promised the vote would be free and fair.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of angry would-be voters who didn't get to
cast ballots for president at special voting stations set up for
people who had recently moved or were in transit.
</P>
<P>
   Although election officials estimated that more than 99 percent
of all voting stations opened _ the best record ever for Mexico _
voters were enraged when special stations that could stock only a
limited number of ballots by law ran short.
</P>
<P>
   In the sprawling Mexico City working-class suburb of Ixtapaluca
in the state of Mexico, voters started shouting to cast votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't fair!'' said police officer Marco Hernandez, 23,
who was standing in a long line when officials said only 300
ballots were left out of 750 available for voters who had moved
since getting their voting credentials. Asked who he wanted to vote
for, Hernandez wrote on a piece of paper: ``I want change.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 58 million people were eligible to vote in the election,
which followed the most hotly contested and passionate campaign
season in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida faced a strong challenge from Fox, running as the
candidate of the center-right Alliance for Change. Fox and
Labastida were neck-and-neck in many pre-election opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters said change was a prime motive for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election has been the most publicized in the history of
Mexico, and most of us want change,'' said street vendor Alfonso
Garrido, 53, who voted for Fox in Ecatepec, a city near the capital
where almost 1 million voters reside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always voted for the PRI before, but the truth is, I'm tired
of poverty and I hope that Fox, if he wins, will fulfill his
promises,'' said Garrido.
</P>
<P>
   But many other voters said they preferred to stick with the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to let Fox win. I don't like his pompous
attitude,'' said Patricia Arias, 36, an Ixtapaluca housewife who
voted for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   But her sister, Edith Arias, 37, with whom she walked arm in
arm, voted for Cardenas because ``he cares about working people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Ramirez, 67, also voted for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think all three candidates put together can really
change much,'' he said. ``The PRI is part of society. It dominates
everything. The opposition could create problems.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same voting station, housewife Amapola Mendez voted with
her 2-year-old clinging to her leg. ``A lot of older people think
there will never be change,'' she said, explaining that she voted
for Fox. ``But many younger people are looking at other political
parties now.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an awning set up on Juarez Street in Ixtapaluca, people
crowded around tables stacked with color-coded ballots supervised
by a election officials and two people who counted votes and posted
results before shipping them to a district office.
</P>
<P>
   Each official was supposed to be selected by lottery and trained
by Mexico's independent Federal Elections Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Voters showed their photo ID voting credentials to these
officials, who matched them against a registration list that also
contained photos. Voters were given ballots to mark and instructed
to go into booths with curtains. Then they deposited the ballots in
color-coded boxes for federal elections and state and local races.
</P>
<P>
   Political parties were allowed to have two representatives per
table, but on Juarez Street, like other parts of the country, there
were complaints that too many PRI representatives wearing pins were
standing around or sitting at the tables.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, five women wearing PRI pins were crowded around
one table on Juarez Street, silently observing voters as they
approached to get their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Manuel Solorzano, a PAN representative, said he was filing
a complaint because some PRI members had been substituted at the
last minute as vote counters at one table.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, ``for the first time ever, we are seeing
an election where the government isn't sticking its hands in.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the Valle de Chalco, another state of Mexico area where PRI
loyalty tends to run strong, people trickled into voting precincts
along with stray dogs.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, heavy rains flooded out hundreds from their
homes. Federal aid arrived and the government paid many families
almost $1,000 in disaster relief. But many said the help was
inadequate and slow to come.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many here were bent on backing the party of tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the party of my parents _ even my grandparents,'' said
housewife Rosa Maria Perez, 35. The ruling party ``gives us
security. I still don't have confidence in the other parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting PRI is family-bound duty, explained Patricia Sanchez
Pacheco, 37.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother got her papers to become a PRI activist 25 years
ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other parties don't have experience to govern a country,''
said her sister, Hortencia Sanchez Pacheco.
</P>
<P>
   The two sisters gave their votes to the PRI because it came
through in ways that count _ bags of cement, sand and aluminum
scrap for roofs for their neighborhood, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago we started receiving the help,'' said Hortencia
Sanchez, carefully minding her step on a street of rocks and
rubble.
</P>
<P>
   But even in this staunch PRI town, there was opposition _ and
indignation _ at the PRI's campaign classic campaign gifts for
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a bucket and a T-shirt, they want our vote? Forget it,''
said one voter who declined to give her name.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big gap between what the PRI says and what it
does,'' said electrician Juan Jesus Moreno, 43, who voted for
Cardenas, just as he did in 1994 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can Labastida talk about computers and English classes for
Mexicans (a campaign proposal) when we don't have enough to eat?''
he asked.
</P>
<P>
   A reliable den of PRI support, Valle de Chalco sports monuments
to former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's government public
works project, Solidarity. The program paved roads, put in drainage
and electricity and built basketball courts in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But the June sewage flood may have provoked a lower turnout for
the PRI than in previous elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems there was a bit of anger and apathy out there among
people for the way the government handled the disaster,'' said
Arturo Morales Torres, a local resident.

   (NYT15) NEW YORK -- July 2, 2000 -- OPSAIL-UNDERDOG-2 -- A
floating testament to either the indomitability of the human spirit
or the primacy of Murphy's Law, the Bat'kivshchyna, a 90-foot
metal-hulled former fishing trawler from the Ukraine dipped in
cement and topped with two masts, left Kiev on April 7. How it made
it across the Atlantic is still unclear. From running aground in
the Dnieper River a few days into the trip and losing a big chunk
of its keel, to storms in the Mediterranean shredding the mainsail,
to presumably getting lost somewhere in the somewhere in the
Atlantic, Dmytro Biriukovich, captain of the Bat'kivshchyna, never
lost faith that the ship would arrive for OpSail 2000. (Vincent

   (NYT14) NEW YORK -- July 2, 2000 -- OPSAIL-UNDERDOG-1 -- The
Bat'kivshchyna, a 90-foot metal-hulled former fishing trawler from
the Ukraine, will not be the largest ship in OpSail 2000, but it
may be the most persistent one. From running aground in the Dnieper
River a few days into the trip and losing a big chunk of its keel,
to storms in the Mediterranean shredding the mainsail, to
presumably getting lost somewhere in the somewhere in the Atlantic,
the Bat'kivshchyna is a floating testament to either the
indomitability of the human spirit or the primacy of Murphy's Law.

Kerem in the hills of Jerusalem, Marvin Stabler, front, was among a
bunch of tourists on their way to plant $10 pine saplings in the
hills of Jerusalem, a deeply rooted phenomenon in the culture of
the Jewish diaspora. Though no agronomist, Stabler could look
around him and tell that the hillside area in Jerusalem was not the
most fertile ground. So it came as no shock to him to learn that
most of the saplings planted by his family would not survive. (Rina

   (NYT12) WASHINGTON -- July 2, 2000 -- 6TH-GRADE-PRESSURES-2 --
On top of the timeless complications of being 12 years old, an age
of bubbling hormones and anti-authority stirrings, sixth-graders
today face a combination of pressures that their parents never
encountered. In this era of earlier and higher expectations, many
students say they are driven to excel by parents who had seized on
test scores and early college readiness as new benchmarks for
success. Max Mashore, a sixth grader at Sidwell Friends school in
Washington, D.C., wants to go to Duke University, his father's alma
mater. ``I don't want to go to some small college in the middle of
Maine or something,'' says Mashore. (Paul Hosefros/The New York

face a combination of pressures that their parents never
encountered. Today, students face new layers of standardized tests
that judge not only what they know, and whether they should be
promoted, but the performance of their teachers, their schools and
their towns. At the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in the Bronx,

   (NYT7) NEW YORK -- July 2, 2000 -- HARRY-POTTER-FRENZY -- Since
the first ``Harry Potter'' was published by Scholastic in the
United States in 1998, the series has sold nearly 21 million
copies, including the paperback of the first novel, ``Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone.'' The newest ``Harry Potter,'' a 752-page
book, will be published simultaneously in the U.S. and Britain with
a first printing of 3.8 million copies in America, a record. Ben
Allen, 9, of Dallas, was worried that visiting New York would make
him miss the release of the new Harry Potter book on July 8, so Ben
and his mother went to Books of Wonder in Manhattan to reserve a
copy, Sunday. (Richard Perry/The New York Times)

Tree-planting rituals, a deeply rooted phenomenon in the culture of

tourists. Now, an Israeli tabloid has created a commotion by
running an investigative article, ``The Great Tree Fraud,''

agency) workers cynically uproot the $10 pine saplings planted by
tourists. In fact, six of every 10 trees planted at the hilly,

TIES BINDING BROOKLYN AND MIAMI INCLUDE MOBSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ One summer day in 1999, three men sat on the
sun-splashed deck of Shooters Restaurant in Miami Beach, flipping
through their menus and gazing at the lazy currents of the
Intracoastal Waterway.
</P>
<P>
   They had arrived that day, the authorities say, on the
glistening yacht of their host, Chris Paciello, a handsome South
Beach nightclub owner as famous for his sun-tanned biceps as for
his glamorous friendships with celebrities like Madonna. Throughout
the meal, his boat _ a bright, white 50-footer _ bobbed at its
berth in gentle waves.
</P>
<P>
   The scene, as described by an internal Miami Beach Police
Department memorandum, was so quintessentially South Florida, with
its idling power boat and alfresco lunch, that it could have been
photographed for a Dade County travel brochure. But through the
eyes of the investigators watching that day, it was all about a
place on the water farther up the coast: Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Paciello was soon to be charged with abetting murder as a member
of a vicious Bensonhurst Mafia crew. One of his guests that day was
Alphonse Persico, who the authorities say is the acting boss of the
Colombo crime family and keeps an apartment in Park Slope. The
second guest was yet another Brooklyn transplant: Andrew Dohler, an
undercover agent posing as a crooked Florida police officer, who
had started his career in, all of places, the 75th Precinct station
house in East New York.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn mobsters _ and the officers who chase them _ have been
flocking to Miami ever since the first palm trees were planted here
on Ocean Drive. As anyone who has seen ``The Godfather'' knows, the
criminal link between the two locales has been tightly woven since
at least the 1950s, when Meyer Lansky established his illicit
beachhead on the Atlantic in hopes of cracking the Cuban gambling
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Paciello and his friends, the authorities say there
are many notorious and recent examples of Brooklyn gangsters
heading south. In December 1996, Nicholas Corozzo, the heir to the
Gambino family throne, was arrested near a beach resort in Key
Biscayne in nothing more than his bathing trunks. And on June 22 of
this year, more than a dozen members of what is known as the South
Florida crew of the Colombo family were arrested in the Miami area
on charges of extortion, money laundering, illegal gambling, credit
card fraud and dealing in counterfeit drivers' licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a gangster point of view, they just can't help themselves
_ they have to go,'' said Tom Cash, the former special agent in
charge of both the Miami and New York offices of the Drug
Enforcement Administration. ``Miami is everything Brooklyn is not.
It's sunny. The water is warm. The imported cannolis aren't as good
as on 18th Avenue in the old neighborhood, but, really, they're not
that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami has become such a destination for Brooklyn mobsters _
``it's their second stop after Bensonhurst,'' said one federal
prosecutor _ that it even has a local restaurant said to be favored
by New York wise guys and their retinues. According to former and
current mob investigators, gangsters vacationing or doing business
in Miami are likely to wind up at a velvet-roped, steak-and-lobster
place called the Forge.
</P>
<P>
   The Forge, which attracts what one investigator called ``men
with big cigars and women with tiny resumes,'' was opened in the
1950s by Alvin Malnick, a lawyer who worked closely with Lansky.
These days, the Forge is owned by Malnick's son, Shareef, who
appeared in federal court in Miami last year at a detention hearing
to show his support for his good friend Chris Paciello. Neither
Shareef Malnick nor his father returned telephone calls seeking
comment about the Forge.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday nights, in particular, the Forge is packed with
fleshy, older men in silk shirts or double-breasted suits who spend
good money buying drinks for the women who hover around them like
hummingbirds. On a recent night, after a couple of salsa numbers,
the disc jockey spun ``Volare.'' The big-screen television showed
the New York-Miami playoff basketball game. The customers cheered
for the Knicks each time they put one through the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Forge is sort of like Sparks Steak House South,'' Cash
said, referring to the New York mob landmark where Paul Castellano,
the Gambino family boss, was killed in 1986. ``It's been absolutely
infamous over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the Brooklyn mob presence in Miami was
strictly La Cosa Nostra _ guys whose pinky rings clinked on their
daiquiri glasses _ but in recent years, Russian and Israeli
criminals with ties to neighborhoods like Brighton Beach and
Borough Park have also made the trip, investigators say. The faces
may be new, but the offenses they are said to commit _ money
laundering, cigarette and drug smuggling, extortion, promoting
prostitution _ have long been staples of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   According to federal agents, a noted Russian mobster once
bragged that he had as many as 600 soldiers in southern Florida, a
great number of whom had passed through Brooklyn. Until two or
three years ago, according to a federal indictment, the point man
for the Russian Mafia in Miami was a onetime Brighton Beach
furniture store owner named Ludwig Fainberg.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers say that Fainberg, who moved from Brooklyn to
Florida in 1989, ran a remarkably eclectic criminal empire out of
two businesses he owned in Miami: a strip club near Miami
International Airport called Porky's and a borscht-and-blini
restaurant in North Miami Beach called Babushka.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 indictment charged Fainberg with drug trafficking,
money laundering, counterfeiting, even with trying to secure a
decommissioned Russian submarine for the drug lords of the Cali
cartel of Colombia. But while many of the crimes he is said to have
committed _ shipping bootleg cigarettes from Miami to New York, for
example _ are a testament to his roots in both places, the long
investigation that eventually led to his racketeering conviction in
1998 was the strongest evidence.
</P>
<P>
   When the government began to move against Fainberg in 1995,
there was no place better than New York to turn for help. To
infiltrate his cadre of Russian-speaking friends, investigators
recruited a Brooklyn informer named Gregory Roizis to work in
tandem with an undercover DEA agent, Alexander Yasevich, who also
hailed from Brighton Beach. As luck would have it, said Brent
Eaton, the agent who ran the investigation for the DEA, the two men
already knew each other from New York. As a child, Yasevich had
attended a summer camp that Roizis ran in Brighton Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks after the partners were reunited, the government sprang
its Brooklyn-based trap. Roizis was instructed to hang out in
Babushka, and on the appointed night, Yasevich walked in. Then, the
government says, as Fainberg watched, the two men greeted each
other in mock surprise. They bear-hugged, speaking Russian, and
loudly reminisced about Brighton Beach. Fainberg fell for the act
completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the perfect introduction,'' Eaton said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli gangsters have also made their presence felt in Florida,
prosecutors and federal agents said. The Israelis are said to be
specialists in the illegal importation of the nightclub drug
Ecstasy and, according to a recent DEA intelligence brief, ``tend
to recruit couriers within their own ethnic and religious
communities,'' in neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Borough Park.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent case, two young Hasidic men, Shimon Levita, 19,
and Simcha Roth, 20, were found guilty of organizing a stable of
Hasidic couriers from Brooklyn for an Israeli man named Sean Erez,
who ran a ring that routinely shipped thousands of Ecstasy pills
from manufacturers in Amsterdam to distributors in Miami Beach. In
a similar but unrelated case being prosecuted in Brooklyn courts,
Israeli mobsters have been charged with using strippers from New
York bars like Scores and Tens to shuttle Ecstasy from Europe to
Miami and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators suggest several reasons for the long-standing
criminal connection between Brooklyn and Miami. They say that
Miami, long an ``open city'' where no one criminal enterprise has
exercised complete control, is an easy place for out-of-towners to
set up shop. They say that the city's lucrative night life has long
attracted criminal types. And they say the police departments that
patrol the shore have a fractured and unfocused approach to
attacking organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   But the most persuasive reason may also be the simplest,
investigators say. New Yorkers _ from Donald Trump to everyone's
Aunt Frieda _ have always traveled to Miami in winter for a dose of
ultraviolet rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is heaven for these guys,'' said Diana Fernandez,
an assistant U.S. attorney in Miami, who prosecuted Fainberg.
``They consider their apartments in Miami to be like dachas. It has
palm trees and sand. It's like vacationland to them.''

YANKS' MARTINEZ MIFFED AT TORRE FOR SUGGESTING A DAY OFF ;  ERDOS
REASSIGNED ;  TURNER MENDS , KNOBLAUCH SITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., _ Joe Torre thought about giving Tino
Martinez a day off Sunday, but Martinez was in the lineup against
the Devil Rays. Martinez had two hits Saturday, and Torre said he
wanted to give his first baseman _ who has struggled this season _
a chance to build on that success.
</P>
<P>
   But keeping Martinez on the field was probably an adept way of
addressing and perhaps defusing the comments Martinez made after
Saturday's game. Martinez bristled when reporters conveyed Torre's
opinion that the first baseman sometimes pushes himself too hard,
and that Saturday's performance might serve to ease some of that
self-imposed pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a sense of relief,'' Martinez said Saturday. ``I
expect it of myself. You're battling your own beliefs, and you're
battling your own manager. I never take a day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always, `I'm pressing.' It's never, `Let's work on your
swing.' Am I pressing? That's the easy way out.''
</P>
<P>
   When Martinez's comments were relayed to Torre before Sunday's
game, the manager said: ``I give my opinion. It looks to me like
he's fighting himself. It's not easy to follow up the years he's
had year in and year out. In that regard, I'm sure he's frustrated
with the fact that it's not happening for him. He's a very proud
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez drove in 117 runs in 1996, 141 in 1997, 123 in 1998 and
105 last year.
</P>
<P>
   He went 0 for 4 in Sunday's 5-2 victory and, with 45 runs batted
in and seven home runs is on a pace to drive in 96 runs and hit 15
homers.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez began his professional career with Seattle, and the
Mariners place great emphasis on batting practice, on working
endlessly on hitting; he likes to go through extra rounds of
hitting, to go through repetitions with his swing.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' approach _ essentially dictated by Torre and the
hitting coach Chris Chambliss _ is more measured. When the team is
slumping offensively, Torre and Chambliss will sometimes give the
hitters a day off, in an effort to relax them.
</P>
<P>
   Teams don't uniformly take batting practice before most Sunday
games, but the Yankees did Sunday _ and the perception of other
players is that it was done to placate the likes of Martinez and
right fielder Paul O'Neill, who like to put in as much work as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Torre would not say whether Martinez has said the same thing to
him as he did to reporters. ``We talk,'' Torre said. ``I don't go
into things that we say behind closed doors. The only thing can do
is offer support where I can help, and basically, that's all I can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   YARNALL MIGHT START  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will play seven games in six days from July 4-9, and
they are unsure who will start two of those games. Ed Yarnall, who
had a poor spring and missed a chance to open the season in the
rotation, has a good chance of being promoted to pitch Thursday
against the Orioles. He was removed from Columbus' game Sunday
after throwing only 59 pitches against Toledo. Yarnall has pitched
much better for the Triple-A Clippers recently.
</P>
<P>
   If Yarnall does not start Thursday, Jason Grimsley, coming back
from an ear infection, could make that start, or be held back to
pitch in Saturday's day-night doubleheader against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles' lineup is stocked with left-handed batters and
Grimsley has fared very well against lefties this year, limiting
them to a .217 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ERDOS REASSIGNED
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Roger Clemens on the 25-man roster, the Yankees
designated pitcher Todd Erdos for assignment, a move debated at
length by the team's staff this morning. The Yankees could have
optioned Ben Ford or Craig Dingman to the minors without
complication, but Erdos is out of options and cannot be sent to
Triple-A without being passed through waivers.
</P>
<P>
   There is the possibility, then, that the Yankees will lose
Erdos. But the right-hander had been relegated to mop-up duty,
compiling a 5.04 earned run average in only 14 appearances; it had
become apparent that Torre was not going to trust Erdos more than
that.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, both Dingman and Ford have had impressive
outings in the last 10 days, and the consensus might have been that
either had more of a chance of succeeding in a crucial role than
Erdos. ``We feel right now that maybe the other guys can help us
better,'' said Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TURNER MENDS, KNOBLAUCH SITS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chris Turner, the Yankees' backup catcher, was nursing a stiff
shoulder Sunday, a problem that probably began in Saturday's brawl.
Turner was one of the players who wrestled Tampa Bay's Bobby Smith
away from Jorge Posada after those two started fighting. Turner
took some medication Sunday and believes he will be ready to play
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, the second baseman, was not in the lineup for
the second consecutive day because of an ear infection, the same
problem that has plagued Grimsley. The air-conditioning was out in
most rooms in the Yankees' team hotel in Detroit last week, and for
that reason, Knoblauch stayed in Grimsley's room, where the
air-conditioning was freezing cold. Both got sick.

WITH CHANGES TO NEW YORK SENATE RACE, VOTERS POSTPONING DECISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This is the part of a series following a group of New York
voters from diverse backgrounds as they decide which candidate to
support for the U.S. Senate.) By JANE GROSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than a month into what is essentially a new race
for the U.S. Senate, Cathy Harrison and Dave Temkin, both party
stalwarts, have just about climbed off the fence of indecision and
chosen the candidate they will vote for in November, barring
scandal or surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison and Temkin _ she now set on Rep. Rick Lazio of Suffolk
County and he set on Hillary Rodham Clinton _ are part of a panel
of nine voters that The New York Times is following as they make
their decisions in this pivotal Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   They were culled from respondents to early New York Times/CBS
News Polls, back when Rudolph Giuliani was the Republican candidate
in the race, when the number of undecided voters was unusually
small and their indecision was based not on ignorance of the
candidates but rather on antipathy for them.
</P>
<P>
   All that has now changed, with Giuliani out of the contest
because of prostate cancer, and Clinton, in the eyes of these
voters, a less contentious figure than she was a year ago. But
except for Harrison and Temkin _ and Tom Beck, a Long Island
guidance counselor familiar with Lazio's record who embraced his
candidacy_ the six other voters continue to watch and wait.
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Barbara Smith, a struggling working-class couple from
Saugerties, say they still do not feel that they know enough about
the candidates, partly because they live in a part of the state
without the saturation news coverage of New York City, Albany,
Syracuse, Rochester or Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Clinton, a single mother in Buffalo who recently lost
her first job since leaving the welfare rolls, says she pays no
attention to politics, did not know Lazio had entered the race and
would make up her mind at the last minute, as she always does.
</P>
<P>
   Other voters on the panel have pet issues that will determine
their vote. Doug Taggart, vice president of a financial services
concern and a resident of Cortlandt Manor in Westchester, wants to
know how each candidate would spend the growing budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Schwartz, a computer consultant on Staten Island whose wife
is undergoing experimental cancer treatment, wants a senator who
cares about the disease, its causes and its cures.
</P>
<P>
   And Bob Harrison, a high school social studies teacher from
Amsterdam, who is Cathy Harrison's husband, wants to know how Lazio
and Clinton plan to invigorate the failing upstate economy.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Harrison, a nurse and a lifelong Republican, had a hard
time supporting Giuliani, despite party affiliation, because she
found him too harsh and autocratic, too focused on downstate
concerns and too indelicate in his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio is another story, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've been seeing and hearing, I like the family
feeling he gives off,'' Harrison said. ``He's a Republican
candidate and now I don't feel any need to cross over.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice is also simple now for Temkin, a telecommunications
expert from Flushing, Queens, and a lifelong Democrat. His
reservations about Clinton remain real, Temkin said. And he would
vote Republican if the candidate had the stature and courage to
cross his party when it was in the interest of New York state, as
Jacob Javits did when he was senator, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio's defining act so far, in Temkin's mind, was deferring
to New York's Republican governor, George Pataki, by abandoning the
race in favor of Giuliani and then jumping back in on command.
``He's too loyal to the party,'' Temkin concluded.
</P>
<P>
   All these voters are learning about the candidates amid the din
of their daily lives, generally more compelling for them than
politics. There are gaps in what they know, and they have little
spare time to fill them.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths, for instance, have been preoccupied with the birth
of a grandchild, the search for a new apartment and plans to paint
and hang bookshelves. Clinton, the single mother in Buffalo, lost a
job as a monitor at a school that was stripped of its
certification. She is back in the bureaucratic maze of welfare and
faced with a shut-off notice for an unpaid water bill. The
Harrisons just celebrated their son's high school graduation,
helped him choose a community college and left for a family
vacation in Hawaii, which took two years of savings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of them are aware of certain policy announcements,
gaffes and tiffs. They agree that mudslinging, a word used by many,
has increased since Giuliani's withdrawal. They agree that Clinton
has been more visible in the metropolitan region and less visible
upstate, where she has less chance of winning with Lazio as her
opponent. They all are hoping for debates and better elaboration of
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the sniping between the candidates is of no interest,
these voters said, except to irritate them. The accusations that
Lazio had inappropriately profited from a securities deal, for
instance, drew ridicule because equivalent accusations have been
made against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's posturing and pandering,'' Temkin said. ``It's like Dr.
Strangelove. They're afraid if the other guy does it and they
don't. We're not given enough credit for intelligence as voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith had a theory on why there was less negative campaigning
when the mayor was still in the race. ``Maybe she didn't feel as
threatened,'' he said of Clinton. ``Lazio is young and energetic
and he exploded out of the block. Maybe that shook her up.''
</P>
<P>
   These voters seem unmoved by the barrage of television
advertising. In nine interviews, only the Harrisons were able even
to describe a television commercial for a candidate _ one in which
Lazio is surrounded by his wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family values and such,'' Harrison said of the Lazio
commercials. ``Upstate, that's a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Lazio's attractive family won over Harrison, her
husband, who comes from less conservative Republican family, says
he needs something more. ``On the economy, I haven't heard much
from either candidate,'' he said. ``That's an important issue up
here, to make sure New York state prospers. So I'm waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Taggart, who has been impressed with Lazio's energy, said he is
waiting to hear Lazio's plans, and Clinton's, for the national
budget surplus. Large tax cuts, a common Republican lure, would be
both foolish and selfish, in Taggart's view. First, cuts put very
little money in any individual's pocket, he said. And second,
prosperous times are an opportunity to be magnanimous.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the ways we define ourselves as a people,'' he said,
``is how we get through the best of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, a former school teacher, is quick to acknowledge that
these days he has become a myopic voter, with only one thing on his
mind: his wife's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He has learned on the
Internet, from his lymphoma news group, that Lazio last year won
the Paul Tsongas Memorial Award from the Lymphoma Research
Foundation of America.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Normally a Democrat, and aware of Clinton's focus on health care
issues, he has offered the first lady a chance to weigh in, sending
an e-mail message to her campaign office that has not been
answered. ``I would like to get her viewpoint,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz is abashed to be so self-centered. ``I do understand
there are other issues for other people,'' he said. ``But for us,
this is life and death.'' In addition, he said concern about the
increased incidence of certain cancers ``branches into respect for
the environment and your position regarding corporate power and the
responsibility of big business for the mess they create.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Clinton, who said she has voted in all but one election
since she was eligible, has been consistently unaware of campaign
developments, including Giuliani's cancer diagnosis, the
announcement of his planned marital separation, his withdrawal from
the race and Lazio's entry.
</P>
<P>
   In elections past, she has relied on an elderly neighbor, an
avid newspaper reader, to keep her informed. Lately, that neighbor
has been ill. In addition, there has been a change of pastors at
the Cedar Grove Missionary Baptist Church. The former paster talked
a lot about politics, and the new one does not, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she has never voted for a Republican, nor have her
parents, Clinton said. Yet she insisted that she remained
undecided. ``I'm not that into politics,'' she said. ``But issues
do concern me.''

AN ANXIOUS VIGIL IN MEXICO'S POLITICAL TRENCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS graf 5-7 with quotes, preliminary results; Picks up with
``The vote...''; DELETES next 2 grafs) 
 (With MEXICO-ELECTION, MEXICO-BORDER) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORIZABA, Mexico _ Deep in the trenches of Sunday's elections,
Gerardo Mellado served his party as a sort of 911 operator, manning
a two-way radio that crackled with calls for help from the rural
communities in the mountains that surround this city of 120,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   The elections were expected to be the freest, most transparent
political contests in Mexican history. And Mellado, of the
opposition National Action Party, known as PAN, aimed to protect
each ballot cast for his side from the kind of chicanery that many
say has helped to keep the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, in power since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   ``I copy, I copy,'' Mellado told a caller from Mariano Escobedo,
a farming village. ``They are letting people vote without the
proper credentials? I am sending a lawyer with a videocamera right
away. Do you copy?''
</P>
<P>
   In the contest between the PAN candidate for president, Vicente
Fox, and the candidate for the PRI, Francisco Labastida, some of
the most ferocious conflicts have arisen in places like this,
situated at the western edge of the state of Veracruz. Most of the
cities in this state, including Orizaba, have PAN mayors. But due
to the steadfast support for the PRI in the rural communities, the
governor of Veracruz, Miguel Aleman, is a member of the PRI, as are
most members of the state's congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   But according to early returns across Veracruz _ the state with
the third-highest number of eligible vot- ers in Mexico _ the PRI's
support among peasants had begun to erode. The PRI's power among
peasants _ who live mostly on their crops and government assistance
_ could not quash a palpable desire for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been feeding the PRI for a long time with our votes and
they left us with nothing,'' said Celia Gon- zalez Hernandez, a
mother of three in Mariano Escobedo. ``Now there will be more power
for poor people.''
</P>
<P>
   The PAN's strong showing in the villages represented a
significant tri- umph for Fox's party, whose workers watched
carefully all day over their newest, and most vulnera- ble,
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The votes out there will mean the difference between winning
and losing for us,'' said Francisco Briseno Cortes, who is
president of the PAN in Orizaba. ``The PRI still has a lot of ways
to try to manipulate the people out there, because they are
isolated and afraid. So we have to make sure we watch over the
brave minority who support us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many polls opened at least half an hour later than
scheduled, voting around Orizaba proceeded without any significant
disturbances reported. Over the radio, PAN and PRI officials
exchanged numerous accusations of coercion and manipulation of
voters, but when pressed for proof neither side had any to offer.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks prior to the election, however, the campaigns had
been explosive. Just over a week ago, the mayor of Orizaba, a
surgeon and PAN member named Angel Escudero, seized a truckload of
4,500 sheets of metal sent to the city by the PRI governor, Aleman.
The metal, marked for the attention of the ruling party's candidate
for Congress, was to be distributed to poor farmers for mending
their ramshackle homes.
</P>
<P>
   PRI officials called the delivery ``a coincidence.'' Escudero,
65, said: ``It was a crime. We had always known the PRI used
government supplies to try to buy votes, but now we had proof.''
</P>
<P>
   After Escudero intercepted the metal, local PRI leaders led
protests that shut down the city hall for two days. Demonstrators
threw eggs at the windows of Escudero's small hospital and another
angry mob tried to enter his home.
</P>
<P>
   Another heated clash erupted just hours before the polls were to
open Sunday over whether PAN members with radios and cameras had a
right to keep watch on the trucking company of a PRI candidate the
opposition suspected of shipping food and building materials to
poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
   By the time polls opened, officials in both parties had taken up
positions in even the farthest election outposts.
</P>
<P>
   Some 300,000 people live in the communities of brightly painted
concrete block houses _ known to residents by the color of their
exteriors rather than by addresses _ outside Orizaba and at the
base of the tallest volcano in Mexico. They are mostly farmers, who
grow flowers, potatoes and corn on a few acres. A few residents
work from home as butchers or seamstresses, or operating taco
stands or minimarkets. Most of those interviewed said they earned
less than $4 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Almost unanimously, they complain about living in poverty and
about feeling abandoned by the government _ except at election
time. In a sign of the growing popularity of opposition parties,
many of them expressed desires for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents have supported the PRI as long as I have been
alive, and we live in the same misery as always,'' said Alvaro
Gonzalez, 24, a member of the PAN who hopes to run for mayor of
Mariano Escobedo later this year. ``Most of us make just enough to
eat. So when our children say they want to go study at a
university, we know that such things are impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 400 residents of Mariano Escobedo started election day
at church, where the Rev. Ruben Gomez told the congregants that
their votes were worth much more than the bread, clothes or
construction materials they had been offered.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Quijano, a 32-year-old potato farmer, said he would
vote for the PAN. In front of the church, he pointed to a simple
block of a building with no windows and a collapsed roof. That, he
said, was where his two children went to school. He said he had
paid _ in vain _ at least $15 over the last six months to local
officials to help repair it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what promises the PRI will make, I will not vote for
them,'' he added. ``They cannot deceive me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   There seemed to be more support for the PRI a few miles away, in
La Perla. Many people leaving the polls said they supported the
ruling party. And Adrian Esteban Jimenez, the local mayor, was not
ashamed to say that government assistance was key.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a flat tire on my truck, and a friend came to help
me,'' he said, ``then I am obligated to help that friend when they
ask me, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Duran had walked six hours to vote in La Perla, and was
still unsure whom he would pick. He said he was frustrated by the
lack of technical support from the government to poor farmers like
him. Yet he was unconvinced that life would change if he voted
against the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people are talking about change,'' he said. ``But I do
not know if change is going to be good or bad. What if I vote for
change and our lives get worse?''

HASKELL COHEN, 86, PUBLICIST WHO CREATED NBA'S ALL-STAR GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN 
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Haskell Cohen, a longtime publicity director for the National
Basketball Association, who helped create the league's All-Star
Game _ a once-modest affair that has become an annual weekend
spectacle _ died June 28 at his home in Fort Lee, N.J. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1951, when Cohen joined the NBA office, college
basketball was reeling from point-shaving scandals, giving the
professionals an opportunity to attract new fans. Cohen and NBA
Commissioner Maurice Podoloff, the league's two-man office, met
with Walter Brown, the Boston Celtics' owner, to think up a way to
gain attention.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen would recall suggesting: ``Why not an All-Star Game?
Baseball does it and people like it.'' Brown put the game in Boston
Garden, and on March 2, 1951, the first NBA All-Star Game drew
10,094 fans who saw the East defeat the West, 111-94.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Cohen played a supporting role in another
pioneering moment. With teams often content to dribble out the
clock, keeping scores low and games frequently tedious, Danny
Biasone, the owner of the Syracuse Nationals, proposed a 24-second
time limit for teams to attempt a shot.
</P>
<P>
   But when the idea was tried in an exhibition game at a Syracuse
gym in August 1954, a 24-second clock had not yet been devised.
Cohen kept his eye on the second hand of his wristwatch along the
sideline. Whenever 24 seconds had gone by without a shot, he would
shout, ``Time!''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen helped create the annual Stokes benefit game at Kutsher's
Country Club in Monticello, N.Y., in the Catskills. After Maurice
Stokes, the Cincinnati Royals' star, contracted encephalitis in
1958, Cohen joined with Jack Twyman, a teammate of Stokes', and
Milton Kutsher, the owner of the hotel, to stage a game each summer
featuring NBA stars to raise money for Stokes' medical bills and
for other former players in financial need.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who was born in Worcester, Mass., and graduated from
Boston University, served as the NBA's publicist from 1951 to 1969.
He was a founder, in 1948, and later president of the United States
Committee Sports for Israel, the sponsor of U.S. participation in
the World Maccabiah Games in Israel, an Olympic-style competition
for Jewish athletes. As a contributing editor to Parade magazine,
he created its high school all-American teams in football,
basketball and soccer. He was also sports editor of the Jewish
Telegraphic Agency.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two daughters, Irene Komet, of Fair Lawn,
N.J., and Evelyn Cohen, of Manhattan; three grandchildren; and five
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Long after leaving the NBA, Cohen reminisced about that first
All-Star Game, telling of how he had suggested to Podoloff that the
league give the players gifts for participating.
</P>
<P>
   As Cohen remembered it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Podoloff said, `What do you have in mind?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Maybe a pin or a ring.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Whatever it is, don't spend more than $2.25 each.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was no way for a publicist to treat the dream teams of
their day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We later were able to cut a deal with a local store,'' Cohen
recalled, ``and each of the players received a television set.'' &QL;
