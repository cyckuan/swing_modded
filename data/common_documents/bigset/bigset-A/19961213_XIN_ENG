<HEADLINE> Preparatory Committee's Decision on Article 23 of Basic Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Seventh Plenary Session
of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) passed a decision on the legislation
concerning Article 23 of the Basic Law here today.
</P>
<P>
The decision said that Article 23 of the Basic Law stipulates
that "the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall enact laws
on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition,
subversion against the Central People's Government, or theft of
state secrets, to prohibit foreign political organizations or
bodies from conducting political activities in the Region, and to
prohibit political organizations or bodies of the Region from
establishing ties with foreign political organizations or bodies."
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR holds that the related
laws stipulated by the Article 23 of the Basic Law should be
enacted by the HKSAR. Before the HKSAR starts to legislate, the
original Crimes Ordinance of Hong Kong can be applied as the law
of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The applying and explaining of the law must be in line with
Hong Kong's status after China resumes its exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong and with the related stipulation of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
However, the decision said that on November 29 1996, the
British Hong Kong Authorities unilaterally announced amendments to
the first and second chapters of "Crimes Ordinance," claiming that
before July 1, 1997, some laws related to Article 23 of Basic Law
can be drafted, even though the future HKSAR will legislate in the
category.
</P>
<P>
The decision said that the British Hong Kong Authorities'
action openly violates the stipulations of the Basic Law and
grossly infringes upon the HKSAR's legislative power.
</P>
<P>
It said that should the British Hong Kong Authorities force
through the above amendments, the Preparatory Committee suggests
that the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's
Congress, in accordance with Article 160 of the Basic Law,
announce at proper time that the amendments to the first and
second chapters of "Crimes Ordinance" go against Article 23 of the
Basic Law, will be invalid from July 1, 1997 and will not be
adopted as the law of the HKSAR.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen's Speech at 7th Session of Preparatory Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Qian Qichen, chairman of the
Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR), said here today that the smooth election of the
candidate for the Chief Executive of HKSAR is an important event
that deserves congratulations and celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the seventh plenary session of the Preparatory
Committee, Qian said that this morning the session approved the
report on asking for appointment by the State Council of the first
Chief Executive of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
He said that upon appointment, the first Chief Executive
designate will be responsible of the preparation of the formation
of the first government of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
He sent congratulations to Tung Chee Hwa on winning the race
for the candidate for the Chief Executive of the HKSAR at the
Third Plenary Session of the Selection Committee in Hong Kong
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the first Chief Executive of the HKSAR shoulders
heavy responsibilities, adding, "We are convinced that he will
live up to the people's expectations and fulfill the historical
mission upon him."
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the meeting of the chairman and vice-chairmen of
the Preparatory Committee confirmed and published the namelist of
the candidates for the membership of the Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) of the HKSAR. The Selection Committee will soon
begin the election work for the 60-member council.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there are still some people who have reservations
about the establishment of the Provisional Legislative Council,
Qian again pointed out that the setting up of the PLC is not the
original idea of the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
It is a measure the Chinese side has to adopt after the British
side unilaterally carried out its so-called "Constitutional
Package", which has destroyed the "through train", he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the absence of the "through train," it is
necessary to establish a provisional legislative council to avoid
a legal vacuum after July 1, 1997, thus ensuring the normal
functioning of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
He said that many Hong Kong citizens from various sectors have
applied to join the election of the provisional Legislature,
including more than 30 members of the existing Legislative Council
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation shows that most of the Hong Kong people
adopt favorable attitudes toward the Provisional Legislative
Council and support the council.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Selection Committee to take into account Hong
Kong's overall and long-term interests in the election of the
members of the council.
</P>
<P>
On the question of Article 23 of the Basic Law, Qian said that
one of the basic principles stipulated by the Sino-British Joint
Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong is keeping Hong Kong's
existing law basically unchanged.
</P>
<P>
He said the legislation concerning the content of the Article
23 of the Basic Law is the responsibility of the HKSAR, stressing
that the British side has no right to legislate for the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
He urged the British side to do more for Hong Kong's stability
and prosperity and stop making troubles.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong will surely have a bright future and no
one can stop the trend.

<HEADLINE> S.African Traffic Accidents Claim More Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, December 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 234 people have
been killed on South African roads since the beginning of the
holiday season on December 3, the National Traffic Information
Center (NTIC) said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A NTIC statement attributed the fatalities mainly to vehicles
overturning and head-on collisions in addition to
pedestrian-related accidents.
</P>
<P>
Of all the traffic accidents in the past 10 days, Eastern Cape
Province took the lead with 50 people being killed, the NTIC
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the latest soaring of traffic accidents across
the country, NTIC official Christa Van der Walt called on people
of all walks of life to abide by traffic laws and to "take all
possible action to promote traffic safety".
</P>
<P>
South Africa, well-known for its large amount of automobiles
and advanced express highways, has been making great efforts to
keep national traffic in good order. However, despite the
authority's efforts, overspeed driving as well as drunk-driving
are still very popular in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the local press, the one-month Christmas vacation
every year is the bloodiest and the busiest period for the
traffic department, because road accidents remarkably increase in
these days, causing the society and families millions of U.S.
Dollars of losses. enditem

<HEADLINE> France Condemns Washington Post Report on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- France today condemned as
"scheming" a report by U.S. daily Washington Post that French
Foreign Minister Herve de Charette humiliated his U.S. counterpart
Warren Christopher at a dinner of NATO foreign ministers Tuesday
in NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, published today by Washington Post and
the International Herald Tribune, de Charette left the dinner
table when NATO Secretary General Javier Solana suggested that all
NATO foreign ministers toast for the health of Christopher, who is
retiring from the post of U.S. Secretary of State.
</P>
<P>
"I severely condemn the maneuverings of this type. I don't
doubt that it is a scheming," de Charette told the press this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt described
the report as "lying and malicious", and said the French
government would order the International Herald Tribune, which is
published by Washington Post and New York Times in Paris, to
publish a statement to correct the report.
</P>
<P>
Rummelhardt said that the objective of spreading such
disinformation is apparently aimed at harming Franco-American
relations.
</P>
<P>
The NATO also denied that there had been such an incident
during Tuesday gathering of NATO foreign ministers, according to
Agence France Presse (AFP), which contacted a NATO spokesman in
Brussels on telephone today.
</P>
<P>
"This article is false. After having checked with attendants
of this dinner, I can say very clearly and officially that this
story is without basis," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that there was no toasting for Christopher during the
dinner, because NATO foreign ministers had already paid their
homage to him at their formal session.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said that the seat of de Charette, who was
sitting next to Christopher at the dinner table, had to be filled
by French ambassador to NATO Gerard Errera, who tried to talk with
Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Rummelhardt said that de Charette was sitting at the table
"from the beginning till the end" and that "the courtesy (of the
foreign minister) toward his colleagues has never been found fault
with."
</P>
<P>
France and the United States have been clashing over the South
Command of NATO, after France asked Washington to hand over the
Naples-based regional commanding seat to a European country as a
pre-condition for its full return to the integrated military
commanding structure of NATO in 1997.
</P>
<P>
France also came under strong attacks recently from the media
of the United States and Britain, which jeered at Paris's decision
to suspend the privatization of the Thomson SA electronics group,
and the yielding by the French government to striking truckers
last month.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The key to maintaining a
stable growth of grain output for next year lies in increasing the
role of science and technology in agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Chunyun, vice-premier and member of the Political Bureau
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made this
remark Tuesday at a panel attended by 32 agricultural scientists
to discuss ways to realize stable growth in the farming sector
next year.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to reap another good harvest next year
on the basis of this year's bumper harvest, by displaying the
comprehensive role of all factors, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that all advanced farming techniques should be spread
in accordance with local conditions, and priority should be given
to ten major agricultural technologies, such as popularizing fine
seed strains, dry-nursing rice seedling, water conserving and
applying fertilizers scientifically.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he called on the agricultural scientists to work
still harder to make new contributions to the country.

<HEADLINE> Stiff Punishment of ZANU PF Deviants Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Ruling ZANU PF National
Secretary for the Commissariat and Culture Moven Mahachi said today
the party's national conference, which begins on Friday, should
devise firm and decisive measures of punishing members who turn
independent once they lose elections.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi said members who stood as independents contributed to
factionalism that has haunted the party since the 1995 parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking ahead of the conference, to be attended by over 5,000
delegates, he said members who supported those who had turned
independent should also be punished to ensure party structures
remained intact.
</P>
<P>
''The party's Disciplinary Committee should find ways of putting a
stop to these deviants who pretend to be democrats but when they lose
elections, they want to divide the party,'' said Mahachi.
</P>
<P>
Several ZANU PF members have stood as independents in local
government and parliamentary elections, some of them winning against
party-sponsored candidates, he said.
</P>
<P>
''They are just refusing to abide by the rules of the party. So
far we have said they must quit because they are better out of the
party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Party President Robert Mugabe said on Wednesday factionalism was
one of the items on the agenda of the conference. enditem

<HEADLINE> EU, US to Resume Talks on Veterinary Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union(EU) and
the United States are expected to resume their negotiations for an
agreement on the mutual recognition of veterinary standards on
December 18, an EU official said today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Brussels was scheduled to last tow days. The
last round of talks ended on December 6.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, if there is no deal, providing
sufficient progress had been made, there could be a "gentleman's
agreement" under which the EU would extend current import
arrangements for up to three months.
</P>
<P>
The EU farm ministers may discuss the issue when they meet on
December 16-17.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been concerned that an estimated two
billion US dollars trade in veterinary and phytosanitary products
could be disrupted when the EU harmonizes import rules in the 15
member states on January 1, 1997, resulting in stricter standards.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Prices Up by 0.3 Percent in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices in the U.S.
increased by 0.3 percent in November mainly because of a big jump
in energy costs, U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The gain of consumer prices index (CPI) in the month marked the
third straight month of a 0.3 percent increase in the country.
</P>
<P>
The rise in CPI was led by a 1.2 percent jump in energy prices,
the biggest one-month gain since a 3.2 percent surge last April.
Gasoline costs were up by 1.8 percent while natural gas prices
soared by 3.4 percent, the biggest increase since a 4.7 percent
jump in October 1982.
</P>
<P>
With one month to go, energy prices in U.S. have been rising at
an annual rate of 7.5 percent this year after having posted an
actual decline in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Food costs were up by 0.3 percent in November, just half the
0.6 percent increase in October.
</P>
<P>
Food prices have been rising at an annual rate of 4.6 percent
this year after having risen 2.1 percent for all of 1995.
</P>
<P>
But excluding food and energy, the so-called core rate prices
increased only by 0.2 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months of this year, U.S. CPI have risen at an
annual rate of 3.3 percent, much higher than last year's 2.5
percent increase. Almost all of the acceleration has come in food
and energy costs.
</P>
<P>
Excluding food and energy, inflation has been rising at an
annual rate of 2.7 percent this year, even better than the 3
percent pace for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the U.S. Federal Reserve would leave the
interest rates unchanged in the policy-making meeting next week as
the inflation has been under control.
</P>
<P>
Last week, an advisory panel of U.S. Congress reported that it
believed the current CPI was overstating U.S. inflation by 1.1
percentage points annually and recommended a correction of flaws
in the CPI.

<P>
GENEVA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States calls for a
"fair use" of copyrighted materials on the Internet and elsewhere
within the digital environment in a public statement to a WIPO
conference.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement made available today, the U.S. wants
it to be clear that two new copyright treaties under negotiation
in Geneva "will permit application of fair use in the digital
environment".
</P>
<P>
WIPO, the World Intellectual Property Organization, is having
the diplomatic conference on certain copyright and neighboring
rights questions from December 2 to 20. The three draft treaties
on Certain Questions Concerning the Protection of Literary and
Artistic Works, on the Protection of the Rights of Performers and
Producers of Phonograms, and on Intellectual Property in Respect
of Databases are under talks by over 850 participants.
</P>
<P>
Bruce Lehman, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce and
Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, said he made the call in
response to the concerns of librarians, educators, and on-line
service providers in the U.S. "We want to make it clear that the
treaties we are negotiating are not going to restrict their
appropriate use of copyrighted works," he stressed.
</P>

leadership. On December 9, they began work in substance on the
reading of the treaties. Consensus through consultations should be
reached before the treaties are adopted.

<HEADLINE> US Retail Sales Down by 0.4 Percent in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. retail sales fell 0.4
percent in November resulting from declines in general merchandise
and apparel sales, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that retail sales totaled a seasonally
adjusted 206.1 billion dollars in November, down from a revised
206.8 billion in October.
</P>
<P>
The revised 0.3 percent increase of U.S. retail sales in
October was higher than the initial estimate of 0.2 percent
reported last month.
</P>
<P>
The report said that sales of durable goods -- items expected
to last more than three years -- decreased by 1.1 percent after a
0.3 percent gain in October, the largest loss in seven months.
</P>
<P>
The decline was led by a sharp drop of automobile sales in the
month, which slipped by 2.6 percent, the steepest since last April
when it was down by 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales of nondurable goods such as clothing and groceries inched
up by 0.1 percent, less than the 0.4 percent gain a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
General merchandise sales, including those in department
stores, fell 0.6 percent, wiping out a 0.4 percent increase in
October. Apparel sales plunged 0.9 percent on top of a 0.6 percent
drop a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
U.S. newspapers reported that evidence suggested that retail
sales picked up beginning the day after Thanksgiving, the
traditional beginning of the shopping season in the country.
</P>
<P>
The year-end shopping season usually accounts for as much as
half of yearly sales and profits for U.S. retailers.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Unshakable on Labor Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia remained unshakable
in its stand against any linkage between trade and labor standards
on the fourth day of the first World Trade Organization (WTO)
Ministerial Conference here today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the ministers of some WTO members, Malaysian
Minister of International Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz said
that Malaysia takes "an unshakable and no-compromise" position on
labor standards.
</P>
<P>
"Labor standards belong in the ILO (International Labor
Organization). We reject use of any form of trade measure [good or
bad] to dictate and enforce labor standards. We don't want anyone
to question our competitive advantages," she said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
She demands that labor standards never be linked to trade, nor
discussed in the WTO in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian minister wants the five-day conference to issue
an official endorsement of her country's position on the issue of
labor standards tomorrow when the Singapore meeting closes.
</P>
<P>
Later in the evening, she told the Malaysian press that many
countries including India, Indonesia, Bangladesh and even the
United States have expressed support for Malaysia's stand.
</P>
<P>
During the past four days at the WTO conference, Malaysia has
been resisting very hard against the U.S. attempt to make trade
with developing countries conditional on the improvement of labor
standards.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide general strike
called by a group of leftist parties in Nepal today affected the
normal life of the general public throughout the country, official
sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Some accidents, including stone pelting at vehicles and
gasoline bomb  explosion, were reported, mostly in the Kathmandu
valley, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Six persons were injured and about 180 others arrested but

Business activities in Kathmandu and other major cities were
stopped for the whole day while shops, schools and public offices

The Nepali parliament approved the Nepal-India Mahakali treaty
with a two-third majority despite strong opposition to the treaty
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nepali officials hailed the Mahakali treaty as a watershed in
Nepal-India cooperation in water resources development, saying it
laid down benefit- and cost-sharing principles for the development
of the Mahakali border river, about 400 km west of the capital, on
an equitable basis.

<HEADLINE> Donor Community Pledges 2.5 Billion Dollars for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The donor community at
the Third Consultative Group (CG) Meeting for Ethiopia here has
indicated their willingness to provide the country 2.5 billion US
Dollars over the 1996-99 period.
</P>
<P>
This was announced this afternoon at a news briefing at the
Conference Hall of the UN Economic Commission for Africa by
Callisto E. Madavo, World Bank Regional Vice-President for Africa
and Chairman of the Third CG Meeting for Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Madavo said, the just ended three-day meeting is ''very
successful'' and ''almost of all the pledged assistance is in the
form of grants or loans on highly concessional terms''.
</P>
<P>
Madavo said, the government of Ethiopia presented its
strategies on improving food security, education and health at
the meeting and the meeting held discussions in these three
strategic areas.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that ''Ethiopia became the first country in Africa
to host the CG meeting on its own soil.'' On the reason for
having the meeting in Addis Ababa instead of in Paris, where CG
meetings are usually held, Madavo said, ''I think it is a good
idea to bring the CG to the country from time to time. It enables
us to see and appreciate the reality on the ground and to have an
opportunity to exchange views with the highest level of political
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
According to Madavo, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
attended the opening and closing sessions of these meetings and
had wide-ranging exchange of views on Ethiopia's ongoing
development agenda.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting was held in camera and closed this
afternoon. It was attended by about 100 representatives of the
donor governments and international organizations that are
partners in Ethiopia's development.
</P>
<P>
The last CG meeting for Ethiopia was held in Paris in March
1994 and donors pledged 1.1 billion dollars. enditem

<HEADLINE> UK Lagges Behind in Investment, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's investment
performance has been weaker than that of its main competitors,
according to a new report.
</P>
<P>
The Government's White Paper in June claimed that British
industry compares well with other industrial countries. However,
it is now strongly challenged by the joint report of the Machine
Tool Technologies Association(MTTA) and Oxford Economic
Forecasting.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper's comparison of the share of business
investment in GDP in Britain and other countries is criticised as
misleading.
</P>
<P>
Comparing a broader measure of investment shares, such as total
public and private investment in machinery and equipment, shows
Britain lagging behind all its main competitors.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the share of investment in GDP is lower
in Britain than elsewhere, and that spending on research and
development is lower too.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that the accumulation of a dismal investment
performance over the years means the amount of capital per worker
in Britain is less than half the German level, lower than in
Taiwan and not much better than in Korea.
</P>
<P>
The report concludes that the British problem is therefore not
just a matter of a low investment share keeping trend growth low.
It is also that investment has not been high enough to raise the
level of capital per worker to the international norm, it adds.
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Taylor, president of the MTTA, who presented the report
to Treasury on Wednesday said, the association had been concerned
for some time about Britain's poor performance compared with other
nations, and especially about the absence of any action to
encourage innovation.

<HEADLINE> UNCF Calls for Immediate End to Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Work that endangers children's
physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development must end
immediately, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNCF) says in a
report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled The State of the World's Children 1997,
which was launched here Wednesday on the 50th anniversary of UNCF,
says that hazardous child labor is a betrayal of every child's
rights as a human being and is an offense against our
civilization.
</P>
<P>
With a comprehensive look at the plight of children working
around the world, the report calls for an immediate end to
hazardous and intolerable child labor, such as child prostitution
and bonded labor.
</P>
<P>
In examining this troubling subject, the report explores the
misconceptions and myths about it and describes the many efforts
being made around the world to end the abuses and exploitation
children endure.
</P>
<P>
It closes by calling for a series of actions that are feasible,
practical and long overdue.
</P>
<P>
The reports points out that child labor is not only found in
the developing world, but in all countries, rich or poor. Child
labor exists primarily because there are people willing to use
children for profit, to exploit their poverty.
</P>
<P>
That's why the effort to eliminate all forms of child labor
must go hand-in-hand with measures to reduce extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
"The lives of working children will not change unless the world
backs its words with action," says the UNCF.
</P>
<P>
"It is time morality prevailed. As we step into the next
millennium, hazardous child labor must be left behind, consigned
to history as completely as those other forms of slavery that it
so closely resembles", it adds.

<HEADLINE> Greek Government Releases Name-List of Tax Evaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The finance ministry of greece
today released a list containing the names of 481 companies which,
according to the fiscal and customs authorities, were involved in
instances of tax evasion or smuggling.
</P>
<P>
According to the list, which states the violation committed by
and the penalty imposed on each company, 53 undertakings were
penalized for tax evasion by being closed down for several days.
</P>
<P>
A total of 165 companies evaded tax by receiving or issuing
false or forged invoices, while 189 undertakings violated the law
on smuggling and their cases are pending before the administrative
or judicial authorities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the list shows that 36 companies unlawfully
received agricultural subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Describing the tax and smuggling violations as "serious", the
ministry said it was obliged to give the list to parliament and
the press under the provisions of relative law.
</P>
<P>
Today's list includes three leasing companies which belong to
the Agricultural Bank of Greece, the Alpha Credit Bank and the
Hellenic Industrial Development Bank respectively.

<HEADLINE> Child Labor Exists in Britain: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Child labor still exists in
Britain, with some children working for as little as 0.1 pound
(0.16 US dollars) an hour, in some cases in dangerous locations
such as sawmills and building sites, the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNCF) said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The report entitled The State of the World's Children 1997,
which was launched in London Wednesday, estimated that more than a
quarter of 11-year-olds in Britain worked illegally.
</P>
<P>
According to research presented to the UNCF, seven out of ten
British children worked for money outside the family by the age of
16.
</P>
<P>
Of those, 90 percent were involved in work that breached the
Children and Young Persons Act, which requires child workers to
have a work permit, limits their hours, bans work between 7:00pm
and 7:00am and forbids employment of under-13s.
</P>
<P>
Jim McKechnie, a lecturer at Paisley University, who has done
six years of research in Scotland, Northern England and the
Midlands, said children were working in adult jobs, not just the
traditional milk and newspaper deliveries.
</P>
<P>
They could be found in shops, hotels, catering and hawking.
Some were employed as cleaners, gardeners, garage mechanics and on
building sites.
</P>
<P>
Children under 16 earned an average of one to two pounds (3.3
US dollars) an hour. The increasing motivation for children was
that they should have disposable income at all cost, instead of
helping their families.
</P>
<P>
"Most of these children are feeling the pressure of a consumer
society to have the latest video games, CDs or trainers," said
Mckechie.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Vows to Strengthen Jewish Presence in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- In a strong reaction to
the shooting attack that killed a Jewish mother and her son,
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu vowed today to
strengthen Jewish presence in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, together with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
and Foreign Minister David Levy, was among several thousand
people who attended the funeral held in Beit El settlement near
the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old mother and her 12-year-old son were killed
and four other children wounded Wednesday night by three
Palestinian gunmen in a drive-by shooting attack. The incident
sparked unprecedented strong reaction from Israel, as many
right-wing activists even demanded the government to stop the
peace talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In his eulogizing speech, Netanyahu said the funeral was the
first response from the Israeli government and people to the
terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
"We are building here, we are living here, and you (the
terrorists) will not ablate us from here," he said.
</P>
<P>
Praising the settlers as "pioneers and heroes," Netanyahu
said they should not worry about their future because his
government would make supreme efforts to ensure their continued
existence and safety.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu added that, although he remained committed to
attaining real peace, but such peace could be only achieved
after the Palestinian Authority (PA) fulfilled its commitments
to the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Netanyahu chaired a high-level meeting with
security officials and decided to demand the PA to extradite 19
Palestinian militants under arrest to Israel for trial.
</P>
<P>
The Council for Settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
today issued a strong call on the government to build more
settlements and ensure their prosperity in response to
terrorism. It claimed that, if the government failed to do so,
the settlers themselves would do so soon.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel Radio and State-run Television reported that the
anti-peace radical Palestinian group Popular Front for Liberation
of Palestine (PFLP), which is based in the Syrian capital of
Damascus, has claimed responsibility for the attack. The group
has launched several similar drive-by shooting attacks in the
past.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the strong reaction by the Israeli side, the PA's
response was almost silent. PA President Yasser Arafat refused to
comment when asked to respond by reporters in Gaza today.
</P>
<P>
The only reaction is a declaration broadcast by the official
Wafa News Agency, saying that such attack was in contrary to the
interests of the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the shooting attack Wednesday night, Israeli
security officers escorted by the Palestinian police entered the
PA-controlled Ramallah area to investigate a burnt-up car
abandoned by the attackers.
</P>
<P>
The curfew in the Beit El area and closure of Ramallah
imposed by Israeli troops continued today as part of the efforts
to catch the attackers.
</P>
<P>
The shooting attack occurred at a time that cannot be worse
for the already difficult Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations
on Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
After over two months of intensive negotiations, the talks
are originally expected to end with a deal before the upcoming
Christmas, but the incident could toughen Israel's position once
again, leading to further delay in signing the Hebron agreement
and greater tension between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In a condolence message, U.S. President Bill Clinton echoed
the concern. While condemning the terrorist attack, Clinton
appealed to both the Israelis and Palestinians no to allow
terrorism to "ruin the efforts by so many people who want to live
side by side."

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration has ordered U.S. airlines to inspect their
later-model Boeing 747s for cracks in the center fuel tank wall.
</P>
<P>
The order was made after cracks in the center fuel tank wall
had been found on several earlier-model planes.
</P>
<P>
The FAA said about 485 of the later-model jets worldwide would
be affected, including 105 planes operated by U.S. carriers.
</P>
<P>
The fatigue cracks in the later-model planes, 747-200s, -300s
and -400s, could pose a more serious risk of fire, although none
large enough to cause a leak have been found, Boeing spokesman
Doug Webb said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Israel Held Responsible for Wounding of Lebanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A committee monitoring a
limited truce in south Lebanon today said Israel is held
responsible for the wounding of six civilians in bombardment on
south Lebanese villages last weekend.
</P>
<P>
In a statement distributed this afternoon, the five-nation
cease-fire committee, which groups France, the United States,
Syria, Lebanon and Israel, said it found the Jewish state
"responsible for the wounding of six civilians at Kfar Tibnit last
Saturday."
</P>
<P>
But the committee fell short of condemning Israel for the
incident as demanded by the Lebanon and Syria, according to
Foreign Ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued following a Marathon meeting the
committee held in the headquarters of the U.N. peace-keeping
forces in the south Lebanese coastal town of Naqoura only a
couple of kilometers north of Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the committee "regretted" for the wounding
of civilians and the damages of properties caused by the Israeli
bombardment, and urged the combating sides to prevent similar
incidents.
</P>
<P>
The committee was established in August under a cease-fire
understanding negotiated by U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher between Lebanon and the Jewish state, which ended a
17-day Israeli blitz in south Lebanon in April.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in south Lebanon in 1985 to prevent border-crossing attacks in
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five Israeli soldiers have been killed by Hezbollah
guerrillas on the last battle front of the Arab-Israeli conflict
so far this year.

said here today that the foreign forces are cause of tension
in the Persian Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Rezaee, Commander of the Islamic Revolution's Guards
Corps (IRGC), said that the IRGC serves as a deterrent force to
the threats posed by the enemies of Iran.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC commander made the remarks at a ceremony marking the
anniversary of its formation. However, he did not pointed his
finger to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IRGC Deputy Commander Rahim Safavi said that the
foreign forces are cause of tension in the region and the
security of the Persian Gulf can be guaranteed through joint
cooperation of the regional countries.
</P>
<P>
Safavi said the IRGC, which was formed soon after the Islamic
revolution in 1979, is ready to defend the Islamic Republic
and Iran's territorial integrity, adding that the IRGC will
strongly respond to any threat or action threatening Iran's
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He said that the IRGC is carefully watching any military or
political developments in the Persian Gulf region and is fully

security.

<HEADLINE> Consensus Reached On Declaration at WTO MC: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) have reached a working consensus on the
declaration for the WTO Ministerial Conference, WTO spokesman
Keith Rockwell said at a press conference late tonight.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the final agreement goes, we are not there yet, but
we are very close," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Yeo Cheow Tong, minister of trade and industry of
Singapore, will call for another heads of the delegations meeting
on Friday morning, at which time he will ask the WTO members to
adopt this declaration, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeo also announced that a working consensus had been achieved
on three provisions pertaining to government procurement,
investment competition, and core labor standards, Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
The government procurement provision calls for the
establishment of a study group to conduct a study of government
procurement practices, taking into account national policies, and
based on that study, to develop elements for inclusion in an
appropriate agreement.
</P>
<P>
Working groups will be established to conduct studies of both
trade and investment and trade and competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
The provisions state very clearly that any future negotiations
in the areas would be launched only if there is a split consensus
among all WTO members.
</P>
<P>
The provision on core labor standards stresses a renewed
commitment to the observance of core labor standards and the
International Labor Organization (ILO) as the competent body to
set and deal with the standards.
</P>
<P>
The provision also states that the economic growth and
development fostered by increased trade and further trade
liberalization contribute to the promotion of these standards.
</P>
<P>
The revised provision states that any use of labor standards
for protectionist purposes would be rejected. And comparative
advantage of low wage countries would not be put into question.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers urged the WTO and ILO secretariats continue
their existing collaboration," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The chairman invited the members to reflect on these
provisional agreements and decide on them tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Rockwell also told reporters that a number of developing
countries managed to express their support for the effort of the
Chairman and the Director-General of the WTO in helping broker
this working consensus.
</P>
<P>
They expressed support for the text, but each of them also
expressed concern over what they have referred to as a lack of
transparency in the process through which these provisional
agreements have been struck, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both the Chairman and the Director-General agreed with these
concerns and the two men pledged to work toward improving the
transparency of the system without rendering it any less
efficient, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya To Speed up Privatization Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi said today that the government plans to divest about 64
public enterprises next year in view of "consideral progress" has
been made in implementing the privatization program.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a mass rally celebrating the 33rd independence day,
the president said that the government had got about 100 million
U.S. Dollars proceeds from the sale of public enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Of the 207 public enterprises earmarked for divestiture, the
Kenyan government has either completely divested its holdings or
reduced its shares in a total of 140 enterprises since the
beginning of the privatization exercise in 1991.
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, Moi noted, the Kenyan government has
adopted a program to reduce the number of civil servants in
governmnt departments in its efforts to enhance efficiency of
government departments.
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of 52,000 civil servants have retired in the
East African country since the first group of 700 retired in
April 1994, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Steps has been taken to provide better working conditions to
the remaining civil servants.
</P>
<P>
The president today appointed three committees to review the
working conditions of civil servants.
</P>
<P>
The committees are to start their work immediately and
required to present their reports by the end of next March, Moi
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Moi reaffirmed Kenya's commitment to the
success of the East African Cooperation and the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the current crisis in eastern Zaire, the
president said that the crisis in Eastern Zaire and particularly
the growing tension between Zaire and her neighbors continue to
worsen day by day.
</P>
<P>
He also called on all parties involving in the civil war in
Sudan to resume peace talks so that a negotiated settlement to
the conflict can be achieved.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Holds Third Round of Voting on Top UN Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council held on Thursday the third round of voting for the post of
secretary-general, with Kofi Annan of Ghana gaining momentum in
the contest.
</P>
<P>
Two straw votes were conducted in the morning. The result of
the second voting was 14 to one for Kofi Annan of Ghana; seven to
four for Amara Essy of Cote d'Ivoire; four to four for Hamid
Algabid of Niger and five to three for Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah of
Mauritania.
</P>
<P>
Although Annan is picking up momentum in the contest for the
post, he has been unable to avoid a negative vote from one
permanent member of the Security Council, which diplomats said was
France.
</P>
<P>
Amara Essay got two negative votes from the permanent members
of the council. Hamid Algabid and Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah received
no negative votes from the permanent members, but because of the
less support they got from the council, chances for them to be
approved by the council have been reduced to minimum.
</P>
<P>
James Rubin, spokesman for the U.S. mission, said the United
States received more encouragement from today's straw vote,
probably referring to the 14 "yes votes" Annan obtained.
</P>
<P>
French Permanent Representative to the United Nations Dejammet
Alain said: "We want a secretary-general who is African and who
will speak his position. " He added that the secretary-general
must speak French.
</P>
<P>
Council President Francesco Paolo Fulci told press that since
there is no decision reached in the meeting, the council will
continue have straw votes on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 19, the United States cast the lone negative vote
against the incumbent Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for
a second five-year term, saying that he was slow in reforming the
world organization.
</P>
<P>
On December 4, Boutros-Ghali told the Security Council that he
intended to suspend his candidacy for the time being, which opened
door for the nomination of other candidates.
</P>
<P>
But Boutros-Ghali insisted that he remained a candidate for the
top U.N. post and that he would join in the contest when situation
is clarified in the Security Council.

DAMASCUS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Minister of Defense
Mustafa Tlass said today that Israel's hardline policy towards
Mideast peace will not dissuade Syria's determination to carry on
the struggle for the liberation of the occupied land.
</P>
<P>
Addressing military officers at the Syrian political-military

occupation of Syria's Golan Heights since the 1967 Middle East war
as a fait accompli.
</P>
<P>
He said the practices undertaken by Israel's extremist Likud
government are responsible of driving the peace process to a dead
end.
</P>
<P>
He added that Syria has opted for just and comprehensive peace
on the basis of international resolutions and the land-for-peace
principle. Such peace, he said, will provide the appropriate

<HEADLINE> Rwandese Vice President on Regional Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Rwandese Vice President Paul
Kagame said here today that although Rwanda does not give
material support to Zaire's Banyamulenge rebels, Rwanda
sympathizes with their plight.
</P>
<P>
Kagame made the remarks at a press conference while answering
questions on the situation in Rwanda as well as Rwanda's position
on various issues in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
He said, the Banyamulenge are citizens of Zaire who have a
culture of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Unforfunately, he said, the Zaire authorities have been trying
to kick them out of Zaire, because of their culture.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of returning Rwandese refugees, he said that many
returnees have gone back to their properties while the
authorities sort out property ownership.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the dismantling of refugees camps in Zaire,
the threat from the former Rwanda government soldiers and the
Hutu militiamen has been reduced significantly.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the sanctions against Burundi, Kagame said
that the sanctions were imposed with specific objectives.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Rwanda is implementing the sanctions in the
same way as other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the best way to manage the sanctions is to
keep evaluating them so as to see whether to tighten or ease them
depending on the performance of burundi in meeting the conditions
of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Kagame defended the performance of Mwalimu Nyerere, saying
that Nyerere has been doing a lot to help the people of burundi
and he has done it in an honest and upright manner.
</P>
<P>
On the performance of the Rwanda economy, Kagame explained
that Rwanda is emphasizing to its people that the country must
rely on itself.
</P>
<P>
He said it was unfortunate that much of the donations pledged
after the genocide in 1994 have not come in but the economy is
reviving because the Rwanda government has imposed discipline in
spending and in the general management of the economy. enditem

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Shooting Attack Further Clouds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Wednesday shooting
attack came at a time that cannot be worse for the difficult
Israeli-Palestinian Hebron talks which could otherwise be
wrapped up soon.
</P>
<P>
The drive-by shooting near Ramallah, which killed a
42-year-old mother and her 12-year-old son and wounded four other
children, has prompted nationwide outrage and unprecedented
strong reaction from the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu today attended the funeral
in the Beit El settlement near the West Bank city of Ramallah and
made an emotional speech.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the attack, Netanyahu and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai sent a strong message to Palestinian Authority
(PA) President Yasser Arafat, demanding his efforts to catch and
extradite the murderers to Israel for trial.
</P>
<P>
A curfew in the murder site area and a closure on Ramallah
were imposed by Israeli security forces. For the first time,
Israeli troops, though escorted by Palestinian police, entered
the PA-controlled Ramallah to locate the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
The Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine, a radical
Palestinian group based in the Syrian capital of Damascus and
opposed to the peace process, claimed responsibility for the
attack and linked it to Israel's settlement policies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a chorus of condemnation was directed at the PA by
right-wing government officials and radical groups which even
demanded an end to the peace process with the PA.
</P>
<P>
Uzi Landau, Chairman of Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs
and Defense Committee, denounced the Oslo peace process as one
smeared with blood.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan stressed the attack offered
a lesson that Israel should never compromise its security
demands in talks with the Palestinians. Hanan Porat, the
Oxthodox National Religious Party's Knesset faction leader, urged
the government to halt the Hebron talks.
</P>
<P>
The tough reaction from the Israeli government underlined
Israel's deep security concerns and indicated the possible
toughening of its position in future negotiations, especially
the Hebron talks.
</P>
<P>
For Netanyahu, who was elected on the promise of bringing
security to Israeli people, the latest incident could serve as
the second excuse to justify his hard line toward the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed that killed
over 70 people in late September, Netanyahu immediately demanded
making security changes to the Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israel's insistence on its right to conduct hot pursuits
of terrorists into PA-controlled areas in Hebron has rendered the
two months of intensive talks fruitless. It is not until
recently that Netanyahu has signaled flexibility on his demand,
creating optimism for reaching a deal before the upcoming
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest attack and the mounting domestic pressure
could justify Netanyahu's returning to his hard line in the
Hebron talks, leading to further delays in signing an agreement
and renewed tension.
</P>
<P>
Further delays in the talks and renewed Israeli-Palestinian
tension could spark more and larger-scale Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor party offered a better prescription for
solving the current stalemate the Likud government is
facing: speeding up the peace talks in order to conduct joint
campaigns against terror.
</P>
<P>
Former Labor health minister Ephraim Sneh believed it was the
crisis in the peace talks that enabled terror to "raise its
head." Labor Secretary General Nissim Zvilli called for speeding
up the peace process, saying "it is the only way that peace will
prevail."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Jack Quinn, U.S. President
Bill Clinton's fourth White House counsel in four years, said
today that he will resign.
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, Mr. President, only my obligations to my family
could bring me to this decision," he said in a letter submitted to
Clinton Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
In an Associated Press interview, Quinn said his decision had
nothing to do with ghitewater or other controversies that his
office is in charge of controlling.
</P>
<P>
"It's truly personal. It's significantly financial," he said.
Quinn said he wants to spend more time with his younger children.
</P>
<P>
"I don't anticipate any bad news down the road" on the
controversies, Quinn said. "Even if I did, one of the things I've
become known for around here is not shrinking away from tough
situations."
</P>
<P>
He will remain at the White House until a successor is named.
</P>
<P>
Quinn, 46, had been considered a safe bet to remain in his post
as the president's top lawyer had he wished.

Quinn's departure adds to a sweeping turnover at the top levels
of the White House staff. Chief of Staff Leon Panetta and senior
adviser George Stephanopoulos had earlier announced they would not
serve in a second term.
</P>
<P>
In his 15 months on the job, Quinn has dealt with a number of
thorny legal issues, including the fallout from the disclosure
that low-ranking White House staff members had requested FBI files
on former Republican White House staff members.

Clinton named Quinn to replace Abner Mikva in September 1995.
He has some 20 years of experience in Democratic presidential

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Minister: Donors' Conference Important to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Bouiez today attached importance to next week's donor's conference
for his country by noting that it is the first world conference on
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister made the remark here this morning upon his
departure for Paris on his way to Washington, the venue of the
one-day Lebanon's Friends Conference on December 16.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the airport, Bouiez said the conference
marks a "turning point" in the United States' Lebanon policy as it
is the first time for Washington to regard Lebanon "without taking
the Middle East peace process into account."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese minister added that the issue of cooperation
between Lebanon and other countries will be "basically" raised
in the conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference was called for by the United States and designed
to compensate the damages done to Lebanon by a 17-day Israeli
blitz in April. But the aim has been re-set to rallying financial
assistance to Lebanon's ambitious reconstruction plan.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has extended invitations to some 30
countries, including all European Union members and other
European states, most Arab countries, especially the Gulf oil-rich
states, and some Asian countries like Japan and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Fuad Sinyoura, the state minister for financial affairs, said
today that the conference will serve to "enable (Lebanon) to heal
the wounds left by the civil war and repeated Israeli aggressions."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Paris-based Orient Radio, Sinyoura
said his country will present to the conference 31 projects with a
total cost of 5 billion U.S. dollars. They pertain to the sectors
of housing, education, environment, water, communication and
electricity.

<HEADLINE> Monitoring of Medical Staff for Ebola Ends in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The monitoring of
medical staff for symptoms of the deadly Ebola virus, since the
positive confirmation of South Africa's first Ebola victim
Marilyn Lahana last month, has ended without new cases reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here on Thursday, a senior official from
Gauteng Provincial Health Department said all the laboratory
workers and medical staff, who had had contact with Lahana and a
Gabonese doctor, had been placed on a 21-day monitoring program
of temperature checks and blood tests for the symptoms of the
deadly virus.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, no more infection cases were reported thus far
and the regular monitoring was therefore terminated, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
Lahana, a 46-year-old nurse at a private clinic in northern
Johannesburg, contracted the deadly virus while nursing the
Gabonese doctor, who had treated Ebola patients in his own
country.
</P>
<P>
Lahana died from a combination of organ disfunction caused by
the deadly virus last month after a week-long fight for her life
at an isolation ward in Johannesburg Hospital.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Initiates Ban on Mercenary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has initiated new legislation to tighten existing law
banning its citizens from participating in mercenary activities,
said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria on Thursday, National
Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC) Chairman Kader Asmal
said recent reports about the alleged involvement of South
Africans in mercenary activities in the Great Lakes region of
Africa had been noted with grave concern.
</P>
<P>
Asmal, who doubles as Water Affairs and Forestry Minister,
said the government is opposed to its citizens being involved in
the internal conflicts of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The promulgation of the new law, which forbids the offer or
sale of services of a military or intelligence nature by South
African citizens or organizations to a foreign country, is
expected early next year, said Asmal.
</P>
<P>
Under the new legislation, authorization by the NCACC and the
Minister of Defense will be given for bona fide arrangements with
foreign governments for the provision of training and other
services in these fields, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
South African mercenaries were once very active in Angola
during its civil war in 1980s, as they did in Sierra Leone in
west Africa in the 1990s.

HONG KONG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The No. 2 Long March cluster
rocket will be exhibited in Hong Kong tomorrow, reports a local
Chinese newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
The 52-m-long and 30-odd-ton rocket was shipped Wednesday from
Zhuhai, a coastal city in south China's Guangdong Province, to
Hong Kong for a nine-day exhibition, said Ming Pao.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper quotes a Chinese officer as saying that
the rocket to be on display was the first cluster rocket produced
by China. It was first exhibited in Hong Kong in 1991, without
the second-stage booster and with a total length of 32 meters.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday the entire rocket, with four boosters, will make a
debut at the Hong Kong Stadium. According to the paper, each
booster has a caliber of 2.25 meters and a weight of three to four
tons; the total length of the four adds up to 15.7 meters.
</P>
<P>
The rocket will be for the first time exhibited horizontally,
instead of vertically as before.

<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in a
meeting with Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Bolshakov,
said that high-level visits by China and Russia are important in
developing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy that President Yeltsin will return to work
in the Kremlin later this month," Jiang noted, adding, "I am
looking forward to meeting with him next spring."
</P>
<P>
A Russian delegation had positive results in talks with their
Chinese counterparts, which, Jiang said, embodys the desire of
both sides to increase cooperation and also lays a solid
foundation for a successful visit to Russia by Premier Li Peng
later this month.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the two sides decided to establish a strategic
and cooperative partnership when President Yeltsin visited China
last April, and that this serves the basic interests of the people
of both countries, and is in line with international
trends. Sino-Russian relations have good prospects, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side has been busy with preparations for Jiang's
Russia visit, Bolshakov said, and that it will raise bilateral
ties to a new high.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sino-Russian relations have gone smoothly this
year and that the enhancement of bilateral cooperation is in the
fundamental interests of the two countries and will have broad
prospects.

Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin to President Jiang. Jiang asked
Bolshakov to convey his regards to Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin.

<HEADLINE> India-Bangladesh Water Sharing Treaty Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina today described the just-signed water sharing treaty
with India as a "milestone" in the history of bilateral ties and
hoped it would create a new era of cooperation in the region and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a crowded press conference here this morning, the
prime minister, who returned last night after signing the water
sharing accord in New Delhi with her Indian counterpart H.D. Deve
Gowda, said that "the historic treaty has not only opened horizon
of cooperation with India but with SAARC (South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation) member states and other countries."
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh and India signed the 30-year Ganges water sharing
treaty Thursday morning to resolve the long-standing problem
between the two close neighbors, by which Bangladeshis have
claimed that they had suffered a lot due to India's withdrawal of
the Ganges water on the upstream during the dry season of
March-May. Under the treaty, the minimum flow of 35,000 cusec
(cubic foot per second) of water has been guaranteed for
Bangladesh during the leanest period.
</P>
<P>
There was no agreement on water sharing of the common Ganges
river during 1988 and 1996. The two countries signed a
water-sharing treaty in 1977 and 1982.
</P>
<P>
The long-standing problem needed an immediate solution and it
was her election pledge to solve the crisis if voted to power,
Hasina said proudly, adding that "as such we took up the issue
after forming the government on June 23 following the June 12
elections."

<HEADLINE> Road May Be Bumpy But China's Auto Industry Moving Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- After three slow years,
China's automobile industry is expected to make a turn for the
better in 1997, experts now said.
</P>
<P>
China's car market had been moving at a slower pace since the
second half of 1993, but it has recovered somewhat this year,
according to Zhang Lianyou, general manager of the China
Automotive Trade Corporation. And it is widely believed that the
15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the
return of Hong Kong to the embrace of the motherland next year
will boost the country's economy and automobile industry along
with it.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the production-marketing ratio of domestic vehicles
has maintained an annual growth rate of over 96 percent in the
past few years, and sales have risen steadily with the increase in
production.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters of this year, the number of motor
vehicles still on the lots fell from 98,000 to 94,000. Car sales
have maintained a 22.98 percent growth rate, and small vans and
compact car sales have been growing at 8.46 percent and 23.27
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
But heavy and light-duty trucks, whose sales have been sluggish
for years, are unlikely to bounce back in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
Cars used by officials or businesses have been competitive,
with the former being a major force in the auto market, while
private cars, which are still in the initial stages of
development, have been growing in popularity.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, China imported 350,000 cars a year, but that has
fallen to 100,000 to 120,000 in the 1990s. This year, it is
expected to manufacture 1.55 million motor vehicles and to import
80,000.
</P>
<P>
Although the domestic situation is widely believed to be
favorable the the automobile industry, experts are still cautious
about next year's market situation.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chuanfu, deputy general manager of the China Automotive
Industry Corporation, said that next year's auto market will be
better than this year's, but that prospects of an all-round
recovery are still dim.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China has had a 9.6 percent growth rate in its
economy, and has brought the inflation rate down to 6.5
percent. It has also built up 100 billion US dollars worth of
foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
However, many automobile manufacturers or marketers are finding
it hard to extricate themselves from the mess that has accumulated
over the past three years, and the structure of purchasing
automobiles, which is heavily institutional, is unlikely to
change. Because of that, the automobile industry still faces a
fairly dull market.
</P>
<P>
Liu said China is expected to have two million motor vehicles
for the market in 1997, with 1.65 million new ones, 100,000 to
120,000 imported, and 250,000 left over from this year.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that total market demand is estimated at 1.66
million units in 1997, up around eight percent from this
year. Because the price of automobiles has hit bottom this year,
the downward movement in prices is expected to be checked next
year, and may increase slightly.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts of the past 40 years, China's automobile
industry has an annual production capacity of two million vehicles
and a gross output value of 200 billion yuan, accounting for one
percent in the country's gross national product.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Machine-building Industry, which
is in charge of the country's automotive industry, China is
expected to produce 2.7 million motor vehicles, with the total
number of cars likely to hit 20 million, by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
But, traffic has become a big problem for large cities such as
Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, and the question of whether or
not to continue encouraging citizens to buy their own cars has
become a focus of attention this year.

NEW DELHI, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in India's
worst massacre of the year has risen to 23 while 25 others were
injured when unknown tribal miscreants fired indiscriminately at a
market in Tripura State early today.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two people died on the spot while another succumbed to
his injury in hospital, local police said.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial sources, however, put the death toll much higher,
the Press Trust of India (PTI) said.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen seriously injured people were rushed to a local
hospital, where the condition of some was stated to be critical.
</P>
<P>
Tension prevailed in the Kalyanpur area of the eastern Indian
state where the tragedy took place. A local police officer said
the situation was "tense but under control."
</P>
<P>
Armed forces have been deployed in the area as a precautionary
measure, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
According to police sources, tribal militants raided the market
in a planned manner around three o'clock in the morning and first
set the houses on fire while people were asleep. As they rushed
out, the militants opened fire indiscriminately using
sophisticated weapons and killing innocent people.
</P>
<P>
Investigations into the incident were still continuing.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry
Rawlings has been officially declared re-elected by the country's
Electoral Commission, a latest report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The report did not say when this was announced, but quoted
Chairman of the commission Kwadwo Afari-Gyan as stating that
Rawlings secured a total of 4,024,253 votes, or 57.2 percent of
the total valid votes cast on last Saturday's presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
John Kufuor, the main opposition candidate of the New
Patriotic Party got 2,805,498 votes, or 39.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The third candidate, Edward Mahama of the People's National
Convention took 210,003 votes, or 3.0 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Kufuor has reportedly accused Rawlings of vote-buying and
using state-funds to finance his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
He noted that whereas the opposition faced severe difficulties
in moving around the entire campaign for the elections, "the
incumbent hops around in helicopters, state helicopters, fuelled
and serviced by the state."
</P>
<P>
The votes secured by Rawlings should not be seen as a test of
his popularity, but rather as the amount of state funds that
passed into people's hands illegally, he reportedly observed.

<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress, Qiao Shi, met
here this afternoon with Esteban Lazo, Cuba's vice-president of
the Council of State.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Qiao said that the Chinese government and
people will always support the just struggle of the Cuban people
to safeguard their national independence and state sovereignty,
and to oppose foreign interference.
</P>
<P>
Cuba is the first Latin American country that established
diplomatic ties with China, he noted, and the Chinese government
and people have always valued their friendship with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries have many similar views on
international issues and that China thanks Cuba for its support on
international issues and human rights. Bilateral cooperation and
exchanges have been growing in recent years, and high-level
exchanges have come more frequently, while mutual understanding
increases.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party's Central
Committee, said that the Party is willing to increase ties with
the Cuban Communist Party on the basis of the four principles
governing inter-party relations.

<P>
Lazo, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of Cuba, said that he hopes his visit will give him a
broader understanding of China's reform. He said that Cuba, which

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has initiated new legislation to tighten existing law
banning its citizens from participating in mercenary activities,
said a source obtained here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria on Thursday, National
Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC) Chairman, Kader
Asmal, said recent reports about the alleged involvement of South
Africans in mercenary activities in the Great Lakes region of
Africa had been noted with grave concern.
</P>
<P>
Asmal, also Water Affairs and Forestry Minister, said the
government is opposed to its citizens being involved in the
internal conflicts of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The promulgation of the new law, which forbids the offer or
sale of services of a military or intelligence nature by South
African citizens or organizations to a foreign country, is
expected early next year, said Asmal.
</P>
<P>
Under the new legislation, authorization by the NCACC and the
Minister of Defense will be given for bona fide arrangements with
foreign governments for the provision of training and other
services in these fields, said the statement.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Singapore
today agreed to work harder to achieve and maintain recreational
water quality standard in the Johor Strait by the year 2006.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached by the Malaysia-Singapore Joint
Committee on Environment at its one-day annual meeting in Pulau
Pinang today, according to the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Besides having common programs, both countries would also carry
out their own programs to clean up the polluted strait between
them, Malaysian Science, Technology and Environment Minister Law
Hieng Ding was quoted as saying at a joint news conference after
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Law led a 13-member Malaysian delegation to the meeting while
the Singapore side was headed by Environment Minister Rear
Admiral Teo Chee Hean.
</P>
<P>
On the part of Malaysia, the Department of Environment will be
asked to step up enforcement and to take constant and tough action
on the source of the pollution. The Johor government has embarked
on plans to control the amount of waste discharged from the
1,000-odd pig farms in the state, Law said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore hopes to reduce the flow of its faecal coliform and
other effluents into the strait, besides further tightening its
enforcement and regulations on industrial pollution in the island,
Teo said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed matters relating to the control of
motor vehicle emission, the possible expansion of the role of the
Singapore- based ASEAN Specialized Meteorological Center (AMC),
harmonization of air quality index among Asean countries as well
as management of hazardous chemicals, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
On efforts to control exhaust emitted by motor vehicles, both
parties have agreed to work towards further improving fuel
quality.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed ways to expand the functions of the AMC so
that its functions are not only limited to haze but cover
volcanoes, earthquakes and typhoons which are also matters of
concern to other ASEAN countries.

<P>
JERUSALEM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel's current-account
deficit grew by 34 percent to 4.7 billion U.S. dollars in the
first nine months of the year, the Central Statistics Bureau
announced today.
</P>
<P>
During the corresponding period of last year, the
current-account deficit, or the gap between imports and exports
of goods, services and unilateral transfers, stood at 3.5 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Excluding defense-related merchandise, imports were 8.2 billion
dollars as opposed to 7 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the overall external debt during the first three
quarters rose by 1.8 billion dollars, while Israeli-held assets
abroad dropped by 1.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments in Israel grew by 300 million dollars to 1.6
billion dollars, while Israeli investments overseas rose by more
than 50 percent, from 0.5 billion to 0.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports of goods and services in the first three quarters
totaled 31.9 billion dollars, from 29.2 billion dollars of the
same period last year, said the bureau, adding imports grew
mainly due to the accelerated civilian imports, which expanded by
1.2 billion dollars.

dollars in the nine-month period, a 1.3-billion-dollar increase

<HEADLINE> Israeli Researchers Link Bone Aging to Single </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have
discovered that the aging of the bone is caused by rather a single
gene than the large number of genes previously believed to be
involved.
</P>
<P>
This conclusion was drawn by two Israeli anthropologists who
have been studying residents of rural Turkmenia and Chuvishi in
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
Professors Zvi Livshits and Yair Ben-David of Tel Aviv
University's Shackler School of Medicine conducted the research
funded by the Science Ministry and with support from genome labs
in Berlin and Heidelberg of Germany and Madrid, Spain.
</P>
<P>
They described the finding as an "important breakthrough,"
because it will lead not only to the identification and mapping
of the gene, but also to understanding the biochemical chain
reactions that lead from the gene itself to the breakdown of the
bones.
</P>
<P>
Livshits, who was born in Russia, and Ben-David studied blood
and urine samples from 800 residents of Turkmenistan and 600
Chuvashis who live in central Russia. They took samples from
several generations of 100 families and performed scans with a
mobile bone density scanner, in cooperation with a professor from
Moscow University.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the data, they conducted epidemiological,
genetic, and statistical analysis, which all pointed to the fact
that one gene was responsible for the breakdown of bones over a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
Osteoporosis, in which bones lose density, is a normal
process after the age of 70. But among 10 percent of women and a
smaller percentage of men, their bones lose calcium and become
spongy in their 60s or even their 50s. Certain drugs can slow
and reduce the loss of bone mass if taken before most of the
damage is done.

PARIS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time since his last television speech on July
14, and after an intensive preparation by the media of France,
President Jacques Chirac appeared on television Thursday evening
and engaged himself in a tireless defense of his policies. He
deplored the "conservatism" of the French nation, and hinted at a
reform of France's judicial system by separating the public
prosecutor's office from the Ministry of Justice.
</P>
<P>
-- In the wake of the attack on a bus of Jewish settlers near
Ramallah Wednesday evening which cost the lives of a woman and her
12-year-old son, Israeli and Palestinian authorities have been
engaged in a trial of force. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has refused to lift the siege of Ramallah as long as the
attackers, believed to be members of the People's Liberation Front
of Palestine, are not handed over to Israel by Palestinian
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Speaking on television Thursday evening, President Jacques
Chirac denied that he went back on his promises he made to the
French people during his presidential campaign in 1995. He said
that he is calling on the French people to conquer the field of a
"new humanism". Chirac also announced his intention to reform
France's judicial system, reaffirmed his belief in a single
European currency, and renewed his support to Prime Minister Alain
Juppe.
</P>
<P>
-- Fifteen heads of state and government of the European Union
countries are meeting today and Saturday in the Irish capital
Dublin on two crucial issues for the future of Europe: the single
European currency and reform of European institutions, which are
preconditions for economic integration of the union and its
expansion to Central and Eastern Europe.

<HEADLINE> Thai Bank to Readjust Retail Rate Calculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand will
change its method of calculation of the minimum retail rate (MRR)
to mirror the country's money market better and set a clear
lending margin between small and large borrowers.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is considering two formulas for the
readjustment: fixing the MRR with the movement of the minimum
lending rate (MLR) or simply improving the current MRR formula,
according to local newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
The central bank considers that the current formula, which has
been in place for two years, is based on monthly deposit rates and
operating costs and margins and it does not include the interbank
rate.
</P>
<P>
When the interbank rate surges or drops, the MRR moves
accordingly, central bank officials said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the formula creates discrepancies between banks with
different operating costs and a bank with low operating costs can
quote a low MRR rate to attract more borrowers, the officials
noted.
</P>
<P>
The MRR, a reference rate for small borrowers, is actually
close or equal to the MLR and small borrowers, who should be
charged more, are actually charged almost the same as large
borrowers, they said.
</P>
<P>
Rerngchai Marakanond, governor of the central bank, said the
new formula is expected to be implemented next year.
</P>
<P>
Siri Ganjarerndee, assistant director of the bank, said the
central bank is likely to adopt the formula which links the MRR
with the MLR, maintaining the rate at an exact margin above the
MLR.

<HEADLINE> Israel Presents PA List of Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel has presented the
Palestinian Authority (PA) a list of suspects involved in the
Wednesday drive-by attack that killed two people, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The list was offered in a bid to press the Palestinian police
to catch the murderers who shot at a car near the West Bank town
of Ramallah and killed a Jewish woman and her 12 year-old
son. Four other children in the car were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security forces have been cooperating well with
their Israeli counterparts in search for the assailants. Israel
Radio said Palestinian police have arrested 17 suspects, 15 in
Ramallah and two in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the attack, the Palestinian police reacted
quickly and located the abandoned car in Ramallah used by the
attackers. Israeli security officials, escorted by Palestinian
policemen, entered the PA-controlled city for the first time to
conduct investigation.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai praised the
Palestinian police for their cooperation, but he demanded the PA
and its security forces to wage a war against the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) which claimed
responsibility for the attack. The PFLP group, based in the
Syrian capital Damascus, has launched six similar attacks in the
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai made it clear that Israel wanted not words but deeds
from the PA in its efforts to crack down all extremist groups.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security officials claimed that they had given the PA
numerous warnings against possible terrorist attacks by the PFLP,
but Palestinian police only took actions against the Islamic
Resistance Movement Hamas and not the PFLP.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government Thursday condemned the PFLP for launching
the attack, but said it had detected no linkage between the
incident and Syria which is often blamed for alleged "sponsoring
terrorism."

<HEADLINE> Israel's Privatization Plan Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Five months after the
formation of the new Israeli government, which has put the
privatization program on top of its agenda, the list of
companies to be privatized has yet to be finalized.
</P>
<P>
Today's Hebrew Daily Ha'aretz quoted prime minister's office
Deputy Director-General Moshe Leon as saying that the list
only would be ready "in the coming weeks."
</P>
<P>
Immediately after assuming power in last July, the government
had confirmed that the list of firms to be privatized would
be made public by the first week in December.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's office has said the reason for the
delay is the heavy workload on the diplomatic front, with
talks on the Hebron redeployment taking far longer than
expected time.
</P>
<P>
However, this is not the first delay in announcing which
companies will be sold to the private sector next year, and
during the rest of the coalition's term in office.
</P>
<P>
In late July, a special cabinet meeting to discuss reform
proposals was put off because of protracted peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It also took Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu longer than
expected time to move responsibility for privatization from the
Treasury to his own office and then to recruit the relevant team.
</P>
<P>
Zvi Alderoti, former director-general of the prime minister's
office, was asked to head an embryonic privatization authority.
</P>
<P>
However, Alderoti, a Labor Party member who served under
former Prime Ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, decided not
to work with the new government.
</P>
<P>
The government is eager to act promptly to push ahead with the
privatization program. But obstacles stand in its way.

conference in Qatar in March, 1998.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Largest Light Globe Factory Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Electric Lamp
Manufacturers of South Africa (Elmosa), the largest makers of
incandescent lamps in the country, has closed down with all the
200 workers losing their jobs, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Port Elizabeth, the Elmosa said the
factory had suffered heavy losses because of the failure of
Customs Administration to implement the phase-down of tariffs
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
</P>
<P>
The shareholders believed, however, the shut-down of Elmosa
was a tragedy, and the closure which fell on Thursday was the
only option under the present environment, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Elmosa, which has operated in Port Elizabeth since 1948,
was running quite profitably for four years until the beginning
of 1995 when Customs failure to implement the GATT phase-down did
terrible damage to the business, according to a company
spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Urges Talented Overseas Filipinos to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today urged talented overseas Filipino workers to return and
contribute to the country's economy with their expertise.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the call at an awarding ceremony for 45 outstanding
overseas Filipinos and organizations at the presidential house
here.
</P>
<P>
He hailed overseas Filipino workers as "modern heroes" and paid
tribute to them for their huge remittances to home every year.
</P>
<P>
"Those remittances have created new businesses and new jobs in
many of our remote and poorest communities," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
"It is now possible to attract most of our best workers,
managers, scientists and technical people back -- so that they
could contribute more directly to Philippine economic growth and
social progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that overseas Filipinos have reaped experience in their
work abroad and that "in a sense, they have prepared us for the
process of globalization we are now undergoing."
</P>
<P>
Some 4.2 million Filipinos are now working abroad as engineers,
doctors, managers, scientists, computer experts, nurses,
construction workers, drivers, domestic helpers and others.
</P>
<P>
Every year, these workers remit billions of U.S. dollars to the
Philippines through banks, which is a major source of the
country's foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, they remitted 4.9 billion U.S. dollars. The figure hit
3.48 billion U.S. dollars in the first six months this year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Central Bank earlier estimated that remittances
from overseas workers could reach a record 7 billion U.S. dollars
this year.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Livelihood and composition
of government should be the first priority of the first Chief
Executive of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), as shown in an opinion poll released here today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research
Center Limited, covers nearly 800 Hong Kong residents. One third
of the respondents said that pressing issues in housing and
education should be on the immediate timetable of the top
administrative leader.
</P>
<P>
On the formation of the future SAR government, more than one
third replied that the Chief Executive should give priority to
communications with the present Hong Kong government. The other
important task is to build confidence of civil servants, according
to the survey.
</P>
<P>
It shows that most residents are concerned about whether a
successful transition from the current administration to the SAR
government can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Regarding economic affairs, the survey found that employment
and cost of living are two major concerns. As to political
affairs, more than one third of the respondents believed that the
Chief Executive should first implement the principle of "Hong Kong
People governing Hong Kong" and "a high degree of autonomy".

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Receive More German Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- For the next two years,
Tanzania will be the biggest recipient of German financial
support for development projects in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Business Times reported today that Germany has set aside a
total of about 57 million U.S. Dollars for supporting Tanzania,
out of which about 32.7 million U.S. Dollars will be released for
financial assistance and the remaining will be granted under
technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout Africa there is no any other country which will
receive such a big sum over two years," said a diplomat in the
German embassy here today.
</P>
<P>
The German official told the independent newspaper that the
decision to support development projects followed Tanzania's
current pace of economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to continue supporting development projects
to the extent that Tanzania becomes a reciprocal business partner
in the future. This has been our goal for every country that we
support," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the import and export trade between Tanzania and
Germany, the official said Germany has been importing more and
more from Tanzania while exporting less to this country.
</P>
<P>
Figures indicated that the country's exports to Germany in
1994 were valued at about 51.6 million U.S. Dollars and had
increased by 31 percent to about 67.7 million U.S. Dollars in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Coffee contributed 70.4 percent of the country's exports to
Germany. German exports to Tanzania in the same period have
been low or none.

<HEADLINE> WTO Ministers Promise to Address Challenges as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Ministers of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) members concluded their five-day conference
here today with a hard-bargained declaration, pledging their
commitment to addressing the challenges facing the world trading
system.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the scope and pace of change in the
international economy, including the growth in trade in services
and direct investment, and the increasing integration of economies
offer unprecedented opportunities for improved growth, job
creation, and development," the ministers said in what they called
the Singapore Ministerial Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said that the developments, which require
adjustment in economies and societies, also pose challenges to the
trading system.
</P>
<P>
"We commit ourselves to address these challenges," they
pledged.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the most controversial issue of the relationship
between trade and labor standards, the ministers said they renewed
"commitment to the observance of internationally recognized core
labor standards" while acknowledging that the International Labor
Organization (ILO) is the competent body to set and deal with
these standards.
</P>
<P>
The ministers affirmed rejection to the use of labor standards
for protectionist purposes and agreed that the comparative
advantage of countries, particularly low-wage developing
countries, must in no way be put into question.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged commitment to addressing the problem of
marginalization for least-developed countries, and the risk of it
for certain developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The ministers reaffirmed commitment to a "far, equitable and
more open rule-based system" in the eight-page declaration, which
touched upon trade-related issues ranging from textiles to trade
and environment, from trade of services to trade of information
technology products, and from investment and competition policy to
government procurement.
</P>
<P>
They also renewed their commitment to progressive
liberalization and elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers
to trade in goods and services, and to rejection of all forms of
protectionism.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry Yeo Cheow Tong, who
chaired the inaugural WTO Ministerial Conference, said that the
ministers accomplished the task set upon them at the beginning of
the conference.
</P>
<P>
"We are now ready to carry out the tasks that the ministers in
their collective wisdom have entrusted to the WTO in pursuance of
its mandate to liberalize trade and promote development,
employment, stability and prosperity in all the members," he said.

<HEADLINE> Daqing Oilfield Advances Use of Polymers in Extracting Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Daqing, China's leading
oilfield has built the world's largest project for using polymers
to pump out oil.
</P>
<P>
According a senior engineer with the Daqing Oilfield
Administration, the project, which has begun production, is
expected to realize a recovery rate of 51.7 percent and will add
1.72 million tons of oil to China's total when it finishes its
operation term of seven years and three months.
</P>
<P>
Through the project, polymers are applied to an area of 14.13
sq km of of the land in the No. 3 oil production factory in
Daqing, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. The geological
oil reserve there is estimated at 27.56 million tons, and 218 oil
wells have been drilled specially for the application.
</P>
<P>
Ground facilities include one workshop for making polymers,
four stations for injecting polymers, and one center to treatment
liquefied oil.
</P>
<P>
Daqing has an annual output of 55 million tons, accounting for
40 percent of the nation's total, and is stepping up efforts to
maintain its strategic position in the nation's energy industry.
</P>
<P>
Polymers are believed to be an efficient technology for
extracting oil in areas of secondary recovery, which are capable
of increasing recoverable reserves by about 10 percent, or
increasing the annual output of crude oil by 10 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Researchers with Daqing Oilfield began to study the use of
polymers to extract oil in 1972. After more than two decades'
efforts, the technology has been applied to industrial operations,
proving to researchers that the technology is sophisticated enough
to be spread on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the No.3 oil production factory, workers have
also been using polymers to extract oil in the oilfield's No.1 and
No.6 factories.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Daqing Oilfield extracted one million tons of oil by
using polymers.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), using
polymers to extract oil will increase the oilfield's oil
production by six million tons a year.
</P>
<P>
This will be an important factor for stabilizing Daqing
Oilfield's annual production capacity of 50 million tons through
the year of 2010, according to the enginer.

BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Thursday was the final day of
a 43-day exhibition providing information on China's "Strike Hard"
crime-fighting campaign that has attracted some 450,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
The show, which was held in a military museum in Beijing, was
the biggest and longest show on crime ever held in China and got
quite a lot of attention. Yesterday alone, it drew some 15,000
people, according to Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
According to the Public Security Ministry, the seven-month
national crackdown on crime has brought China's rising crime rate
down, with 3.1 percent fewer crimes reported in the first ten
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
An accompanying "winter action" campaign has also started as a
move to put a stop to anyone who might want to take advantage of
the traditional Chinese Spring Festival, during the Chinese new
year, when many people go to visit family members elsewhere and
less public spirited people are driven to use that time to commit
crimes.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 12,435 criminal cases were handled in
Beijing last year, 6,426 of which were major cases, resulting in
arrests of 14,088 criminals, and 1,827 gangs being stopped.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Major Glassmakers to Have Profit Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Two of Japan's three major
glassmakers, Asahi Glass Co. and Nippon Sheet Glass Co., are
likely to post profit rises for fiscal 1996 ending next March, as
a result of restructuring efforts, a business daily said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The other major glassmaker -- Central Glass Co., however, is
expected to see its profit decline, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
Asahi Glass's unconsolidated pretax profit for the current year
is estimated to increase 4 percent from the previous year to 30
billion yen, thanks to a projected reduction of 7 billion yen in
labor and distribution costs, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Sheet Glass is expected to gain a pretax profit of 16
percent to 2.5 billion yen in view of an expected 2.2-fold jump in
operating profit backed by lower distribution costs, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Pretax profit at Central Glass is forecast to sag 36 percent to
2.5 billion yen, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
All three glassmakers are likely to see sales drop in the
current year due to falling product prices caused by an influx of
cheaper foreign products, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Unveils Design for Olympic Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Australia on Friday unveiled
the design for a "solar village" for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games
that will house all 15,300 athletes and officials.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in modern Olympic history all of the
athletes will be housed in one village," New South Wales state
premier Bob Carr said in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The village, which will cost about 371 million U.S. dollars,
would be designed to be energy efficient, Carr said.
</P>
<P>
Water use would be minimised and solar cells would cut
conventional energy consumption by as much as 60 percent compared
with ordinary buildings, he added.
</P>
<P>
The village will be built on a 90-hectare site just one
kilometer from the main stadium.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the village will start mid-1997 and is the last
major Olympic's infrastructure project to commence.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bangkok municipal
government will soon launch a purchase plan to eradicate cherry
snails from dinner tables, which are suspected of causing cancer
and paralysis, local newspaper The Nation said today.
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Administration has set aside 3 million baht
(120,000 U.S. dollars) to buy cherry snails and their eggs from
farmers who raise and sell them, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok's Deputy Governor Khajit Choopanya has also warned
people not to eat the meat of the snails or feed them to animals.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies showed that the meat of cherry snails contains
high levels of metal elements such as lead, mercury and arsenic,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has set up pilot projects to test four
chemicals as pesticides to kill cherry snails.

<HEADLINE> Special Solar Battery Launched in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean battery
manufacturing company, Battery World has manufactured a solar
battery for use in rural homes.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of Battery World Laurie Hoffman said
yesterday that the battery, called "solarbatt", was designed for
all solar operated equipment.
</P>
<P>
"The solar industry has been using the automotive battery for
energy storage," Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
"Although the automotive battery is reasonably priced, its
characteristics do not suit the requirements of solar
applications,"' said Director of Energy in the Ministry of
Transport and Energy Corneliu Mzezewa, who was a guest of honor
at the launch.
</P>
<P>
Solarbatt, which is already on the market, is being sold for
524 Zimbabwe Dollars (52.4 U.S. Dollars) and has a three-year
lifespan. It can also be used for leisure purposes such as
boating and camping.
</P>
<P>
Solarbatt comes at a time when the government is making
efforts to promote the use of solar energy, mostly in rural
areas, in line with the recently endorsed world solar program
launched at the world solar summit in Harare last September.

<HEADLINE> Bicycle Police Now Patrolling Northern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Police in the capital of
Hebei Province have been supplied with special bicycles as of
December 1.
</P>
<P>
Special police cars have been used in the Chinese capital of
Beijing since October, but this is the first case of police making
their rounds by bicycle.
</P>
<P>
The black-and-white bicycle has a light in front, something
most bicycles in this country of many bicycles don't have, and a
siren on the handlebars. It is also equipped with a water
container on the frame, a tool box, and lights in back, similar to
those now popular in the US.
</P>
<P>
Police say that the bicycle is very stable and good on rocky
roads, and that they move more efficiently, patrol larger areas,
and are more manoeuvrable with these bicycles.
</P>
<P>
All policemen in the province have by now been offered the
patrol bicycles, bringing their foot-patrol days to an end.
</P>
<P>
One senior officer explains that since their budget is limited,
they cannot afford a car for every patrolman, equipping them with
bicycles was a low-cost solution that allows them to go into
narrow lanes.
</P>
<P>
Beijing started a police patrol system in May of 1995 and the
practice began to spread throughout the country. A nationwide
seven-month crackdown on crime has helped reduce the country's
rising crime rate this year, and a "winter action" campaign
recently started, to combat crime during the upcoming holiday -
the Spring Festival, the Chinese lunar new year.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: U.S. Economy Optimistic But Facing Odds (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Working Americans are now
in a position to more than rest content with just keeping a job.
They can even afford to venture afresh for a decent one, thanks to
record low unemployment as the result of an optimistic economy.
</P>
<P>
However, underlying problems cast a shadow over their optimism.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in the United States has floated around
5.5 percent this year, with 5.1 percent in August, the lowest in
seven years. An unemployment rate below 5 percent is considered
"full employment" in the country.
</P>
<P>
The yearly unemployment rate of 1993, when President Bill
Clinton took office, was 6.8 percent. It has been dropping since,
to 6.1 percent in 1994 and 5.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation, another key economic indicator, has been contained
within 3 percent since 1993 and it is not expected to surpass that
this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. federal budget deficit, which was as high as 290
billion dollars in 1992, has been cut by more than half in the
past four years, resulting in a prosperous investment market.
</P>
<P>
Investors calculate that the unchanged political status quo
after the November elections -- a relative balance between
Democratic President Clinton, whose re-election was largely
ascribed to a continuing strong economy, and Republican-dominated
Congress -- will keep the economy growing, though slowly.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. economists even projected that the business cycle,
the continuous shifts of the economy from periods of expansion to
contraction and back again, is no longer inevitable in their
country.
</P>
<P>
"The old business cycle isn't as regular as it used to be. It
wouldn't surprise me if in fact we did get several years of modest
growth without a recession," said economist Lawrence Chimerine.
</P>
<P>
However, it seems impossible that the U.S. economy can be
permanently free from the business cycle.
</P>
<P>
"Nine or 10 years without a recession would be extraordinarily
unusual." added Chimerine, the managing director of the Economic
Strategy Institute, a research organization based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
First, the constant soaring of consumer credit in recent years
despite a decline in September, the first drop in more than three
years, would eventually curb consumer spending which amounts to
two-thirds of the U.S. gross national product.
</P>
<P>
The consumer debt in the first nine months this year amounted
to 1.17 trillion dollars, with an increase of 121 billion dollars
which almost reached the gain of the whole 1995 of 124 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for China's Early Entry into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- EU Trade Commissioner Sir
Leon Brittan said here today that the Quad (the European Union,
the United States, Japan and Canada) wanted to "secure Chinese
membership of WTO (the World Trade Organization) as quickly as
possible."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here at the end of the five-day WTO
Ministerial Conference, Brittan said that they planned to speed
the accession talks with China in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
"We all want to secure Chinese membership of the WTO as quickly
as possible and intend to intensify our bilateral as well as
Geneva-based talks in the months ahead," Brittan told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, he reiterated that the speed of negotiations also
hinges on China's offers.
</P>
<P>
"Speed of progress depends not only on us but also on China's
ability to produce new, more detailed and more ambitious
proposals," said Brittan, also vice president of the European
Commission.
</P>
<P>
"If China produces a commercially meaningful overall package,
we would be ready to see it implemented over a transitional
period," he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
Most economists believed that the slow increase in
productivity, measured as the value of goods or services produced
per hour of work, was another problem hampering the economic
expansion in the country.
</P>
<P>
The annual productivity growth rate in the third quarter of
this year came down to 0.3 percent, or 0.2 percentage points down
from the second quarter and 1.5 percentage points down from the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Unless this problem is solved, they say, the economy will not
be able to grow over the long run any faster than about 2.5
percent a year without triggering a rise in inflation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy in recent years has been growing on average
between 2 and 2.5 percent, compared with 4 percent in the 1960s
and more than 3 percent in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The rising trade deficit is also hindering growth.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit may well reach 114 billion dollars,
given the projection posted in the January-September period. The
deficit would be worse than the record 105 billion dollars of 1995.
</P>
<P>
While President Clinton has made foreign trade a top priority
of his foreign policy, and made great efforts in opening foreign
markets, the U.S. trade deficit has been increasing every year
since he took office.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration counters that it boosted
U.S. exports by signing market-opening trade agreements and that
the overall trade deficit was determined by broader economic
factors which were beyond government control.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the slow increase of incomes for most Americans and
the widening income gap between the haves and have-nots are also
thorny problems besetting the U.S. economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"Healthy people are ones who don't know what they're going to
die of," said U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers. "And a healthy expansion is one whose end is not
foreseeable."
</P>
<P>
It thus remains an unanswered question whether the current
economic growth which has entered its sixth year, the third
longest since World War II, can outlast the previous expansion
records that went from February 1961 to December 1969, and then
from November 1982 to July 1990.

<HEADLINE> Model of Africa's Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is among a few African
countries which have been praised as models by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) repeatedly for their effective and fruitful
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, Uganda's real gross domestic product
(GDP) has grown at an average annual rate of seven percent and
per capita GDP growth has averaged four percent a year in real
terms, ranking first in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, government revenues have risen by over one
percentage point of GDP annually, from seven percent of GDP in
1991-92 to over 11 percent in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, expenditures have been kept under
strict control and have averaged about 19 percent of GDP. As a
result, the overall fiscal deficit fell in the period from 15
percent of GDP to seven percent, and the external current account
deficit declined from 13 percent of GDP to about seven percent.
</P>
<P>
All these are good results of the implementation of structural
reform program which was launched by President Yoweri Museveni
together with the IMF in 1987.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the program, the local currency was
devalued and replaced with a new Shilling, trade in farm produce
once being monopolized by incompetent and heavily corrupt
state-owned firms was liberalized, and trade in foreign exchange
freed.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Ugandan government has accelerated the
structural reforms to deregulate the economy and increase private
investors' confidence: public enterprises have been privatized,
interest rates liberalized and the expropriated properties of the
Indians expelled by former president Idi Amin returned to their
former owners.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the government is now pursuing policies aimed at
poverty eradication, particularly by achieving a strong economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has decided to maintain
macroeconomic stability by pursuing sound fiscal and monetary
policies in a liberalized environment.
</P>
<P>
Its medium-term goals are to achieve a regionally balanced and
broad based annual real GDP growth rate of seven percent, to
contain inflation at five percent a year, to strengthen the
balance of payments, and to accumulate gross reserves equivalent
to more than five months of imports.
</P>
<P>
With what has been done by the government in the past nine
years, Uganda still has a long way to go to realize its economic
recovery program, because GDP per capita at present is still 25
percent lower than in 1970.
</P>
<P>
Experts here predicted that Uganda at least needs another five
years to reach its economic levels in 1970.

KAMPALA, December 13 (Xinhua)-- Uganda has seen a rapid growth
of motor vehicles plying on its roads in the past decade, with
cars increasing to 96,212 today from 29,394 in 1986, or a jump of
over 300 percent, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 statistics compiled by the Statistics Department in

It said the rapid growth in motor vehicles was registered
between 1988-1995, with the total number of newly registered cars
of all categories hitting the 79,811 mark.
</P>
<P>
The most remarkable increment, it said, was in the category of
mini-buses. That is why Uganda is one of the very few countries
that has no public transport problems in its capital city during
rush hours, said the paper.
</P>

SINGAPORE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The first Ministerial
Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) closed here today
with a ministerial declaration reflecting the achievements and
compromises made by ministers of WTO members during the week.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing session, Singapore Minister for Trade
and Industry Yeo Cheow Tong said that the conference represents an
important point in the continuum of the growth and evolution of
the multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
"At this first Ministerial Conference, the survey of the
achievements of the first two years of the WTO's existence and the
discussion of the challenges we face in the future have made clear
the importance of the issues that have been on the table," Yeo
said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of labor standards, the WTO ministers agreed on a
text which sets out a balanced framework for how this matter
should be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
The declaration has not included any relationship between trade
and core labor standards in the WTO agenda and gives no
authorization for any new work on this issue.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore minister noted that the collaboration between the
WTO and the International Labor Organization (ILO) will have to
respect fully the respective and separate mandates of the two
organizations.
</P>
<P>
In a gesture of solidarity with the least developed countries,
the declaration recognized the need to pay special attention to
the interests of these countries, mostly in Africa and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day meeting, some WTO members, including the
United States and the European Union, have agreed to eliminate
tariffs for trade in information technology products on the
most-favored-nation (MFN) basis.
</P>
<P>
The next WTO Ministerial Conference will be held in Geneva in
1998, with the exact dates and duration to be decided by the WTO
Secretariat.

<HEADLINE> ITA Biggest Tariff-Busting Deal, Says Brittan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
European Commission said here today that the Information
Technology Agreement (ITA) was the biggest tariff reduction deal
since the Uruguay Round.
</P>
<P>
"We have achieved the biggest tariff-busting deal since the
Uruguay Round," Sir Leon Brittan, vice-president of the European
Commission, told reporters at the end of the five-day Ministerial
Conference of WTO, which started on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that 13 countries, including EU as one, accounting for
82 percent of the world's information technology (IT) trade,
joined the Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Agreement, however, will not take effect until the
percentage of countries' IT trade in the world passes roughly 90
percent.
</P>
<P>
But Brittan was confident that "we will have passed the 90
percent threshold for entry into force of the ITA" by March 15
next year.
</P>
<P>
The IT sector represents a trillion U.S. dollars in global
production and a trade volume of 500 billion U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
On basic telecommunications, he also said that improved offers
that will be tabled by a dozen more key players in the coming
weeks will justify growing confidence in a conclusion of an accord
by the February 15, 1997, deadline.

NAIROBI, December 13 (Xinhua) -- President Daniel arap Moi has
said he will soon establish the Office of ombudsmen to collect

</P>
<P>
He noted that the Office of Ombudsman has to be established
through an Act of Parliament which is scheduled to re-open in
March next year.
</P>
<P>
Walter Mahler, outgoing resident representative of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to Kenya, told a press
conference here last month that the IMF and the World Bank are
still concerned by high level of corruption in Kenya, which would
remain at the top on the Fund's Kenya agenda.
</P>
<P>
"If this (corruption) is eliminated, Kenya can be an African
success story, and could easily register a growth rate of over 6
percent," the IMF official noted.
</P>
<P>
A Joint mission from the IMF and the World Bank is here on
routine business to review the progress in enterprise
privatization, discipline in public finance, budget deficit and

LUSAKA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- About 6,500 tons of compound D
fertilizer much needed by Zambian farmers have started arriving
in the country, according to the National Agricultural
Information Service (NAIS).
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that the shipment of the commodity was
moving on a slow pace.
</P>
<P>
NAIS quoted Agriculture, Food and Fisheries Permanent
Secretary Austin Sichinga as saying on Thursday that most of the
fertilizer is marooned at Zimbabwean border at Victoria Falls
town because of slow shipment on the Zambian side by appointed
transporters, the Zambia Railways.
</P>
<P>
Sichinga said that frantic efforts are being made to speed up
the process in the border town.
</P>
<P>
The rainy season began last month and the farmers are anxious

BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people's savings
deposits totalled 3.79 trillion yuan at the end of November, up
31.5 percent from the same period last year, according to China's
central bank.
</P>
<P>
An official of the People's Bank of China said that during the
May-November period, savings deposits of urban and rural residents
shot up 390 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that the curbed rate of inflation was the leading
factor behind the steady growth of individual bank deposits over
the past seven months.
</P>
<P>
"With the inflation effectively curbed, the yield on bank
deposits has been rising in real terms, in spite of the interest
rate cuts in May and August," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Due to China's moderately-tight monetary policy and other
measures against inflation, the nation's inflation rate was
brought down to 6.2 percent during the January-November period,
down from 21.7 in 1994 and 14.8 last year.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: U.S. Lacks Actions in Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The year 1996 witnessed the
Clinton administration's inaction in addressing Israel's defiance
of the peace accords signed by the former Israeli Labor government
and the Palestinians, showing Clinton's intention to keep the
status quo in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the
hard-line Likud group, has reversed his predecessors'
reconciliatory policies back to antagonism since he came to power
after he narrowly defeated Labor Prime Minister Shimon Peres in
the May general elections.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has denied the land-for-peace formula, the
corner-stone of reconciliation between the Arabs and Israelis, and
refused to withdraw Israeli troops from the West Bank town of
Hebron in accordance with an interim accord signed by Israel's
former Labor government and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's antagonist moves have threatened the Middle East
peace process launched after difficult negotiations between the
former Israeli Labor government and the Palestinians at the 1991
Madrid Middle East Peace Conference.
</P>
<P>
However, President Bill Clinton, who once brokered the peace
agreements between Israel and the Palestinians and between Israel
and Jordan, has let the Arabs down on two occasions, although the
Arabs, the Palestinians in particular, had considered him as their
supporter in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Clinton failed to exert pressures on Netanyahu during their
meeting in Washington in July and at the following Washington
emergency summit in October, when more than 50 Palestinians were
killed in violent conflicts between Israeli police and Palestinian
protesters over the Israeli opening of a controversial tunnel in
eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reacted mildly to the Israeli violence by merely
suggesting that Netanyahu implement the peace accords agreed by
his Labor predecessors, the key of which was to redeploy Israeli
troops in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu turned a deaf ear to Clinton's suggestions and
ruled out any possibility of immediate withdrawal of troops from
Hebron. The Israeli prime minister repeatedly claimed that the
first priority should be Israeli security rather than
land-for-peace deals with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
What's worse, Clinton echoed Netanyahu's stand on the issue of
security after U.S. servicemen deployed in Saudi Arabia were
killed in two bombings last year, which had helped strengthen
Netanyahu's position in talks with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
However, the Clinton administration has to push forward the
Middle East peace process in order to defend the U.S. interests in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process, traditional pro-Israel policy and
containment of Iraq constituted Washington's Middle East strategy,
with the latter two came first in terms of importance.
</P>
<P>
Washington's pro-Israel policy proved successful during the
Cold War era as it helped the United States establish an outpost
in the region as a thrust into the heart of the Arab world. The
containment of Iraq served to guarantee the smooth flow of Gulf
oil to the West.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Israel policy was seen to have played an even more
important role in the U.S. presidential election year of 1996, as
the Jewish Americans could not be ignored for their support both
in fund and in votes.
</P>
<P>
That may explain why the Clinton administration took a
laissez-faire attitude toward Israel's unrestrained moves in
reversing the peace trend, including expanding Jewish settlements
in the West Bank and building highways linking them.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Clinton administration did make some
gestures to soothe the frustrating Palestinians, who were outraged
at Netanyahu's continuous defiance of the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
But the gestures only aimed to avoid more violent conflicts
between the Palestinians and the Israelis, which Clinton feared
would tarnish his peace image in the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration's appeasement policy has led to
further deteriorating situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, still pinning their hopes on U.S. mediations,
are turning to Europe and Russia for help.
</P>
<P>
While the European Union has much investment in the Palestinian
West Bank and Gaza Strip, Russia, one of the co-sponsors of the
Madrid Peace Conference, has criticized the U.S. deviation from
its original stand on the peace process and voiced determination
to play its part in the region.
</P>
<P>
The moves by the European Union and Russia are expected to
break up the U.S. dominance over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
With the presidential election over, Clinton would have to take
some steps to break the stalement in the peace process, at least
to do something worthy of the name as a peace maker.
</P>
<P>
But observers said there could be few impressive alternatives,
if any, that Clinton would take, so long as the status quo in the
Middle East could be maintained while the Israeli government takes
no more drastic moves to trigger new violence.

<HEADLINE> Aviation Panel Recommends New Airport Security Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) advisory panel today proposed an overhaul of
the nation's airport security by new measures to prevent terrorist
activities.
</P>
<P>
The measures, ranging from new passenger and baggage screening
to tighter cargo security, will cost 9.9 billion U.S. dollars over
the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The panel said its recommendations were focused on "terrorist
attacks related to weapons and explosives introduced into the
civil aviation system".
</P>
<P>
The panel suggested greater use of high-tech equipment, sniffer
dogs and trained security managers to detect explosive devices and
material in cargo, mail, baggage, carry-ons and on passengers at
U.S. airports.
</P>
<P>
FAA also recommended certification of airport security workers
and better training of all airline and airport personnel.
</P>
<P>
Other major measures the panel proposed include: matching all
baggage to passengers and screening any bags from passengers under
surveillance by hand, X-ray, or explosive detection equipment;
testing reinforced cargo containers; and screening suspect
passengers.

<HEADLINE> Regenerated Rice, New Hope for China's Agriculture  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The practice of growing
regenerated rice has become increasingly popular in the southern
part of China in recent years, providing a new way to raise grain
output on limited areas of land.
</P>
<P>
Regenerated rice, known among scientists as "ratooning rice,"
is the second generation of rice grown from a single stalk.
</P>
<P>
In the past, rice was traditionally harvested in late autumn,
and the farmers did not plant a second crop before the end of the
year. Consequently, for many years, the country's vast paddy
fields lay idle for the entire winter.
</P>
<P>
Now, more farmers in the warmer southern provinces are applying
fertilizer on the first-crop stalks of rice in the autumn and
allowing for a 70-day growth period. This leaves a sufficient
period of time to harvest more grain from a second crop.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists have praised regenerated paddy rice as a
"miracle" that can make wealth out of waste. They expect the
practice to become a new trend in China's agriculture, replacing
the insufficient resources and funds with labor and technology.
</P>
<P>
Yang Rudai, former secretary of the Sichuan Provincial
Committee of the Communist Party of China, said cultivation of
regenerated rice is greatly significant, as it will help China
solve the problem of feeding its 1.2 billion people on limited
arable land.
</P>
<P>
The cultivation technique originated in Chongqing, a leading
industrial center in southwest China's Sichuan Province. As the
city has a population of 15 million, and its per capita share of
farmland averages an area no larger than a basketball court, it
must annually buy 600 million kg of grain from other provinces.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the city has been seeking new channels to
raise the per capita yield, following the footsteps of many other
regions.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, a farmer in a remote village of rural Chongqing
experimented with growing regenerated rice on 0.6 hectare of
paddy field. To his surprise, he harvested 2,000 kg of rice from
the second crop.
</P>
<P>
Greatly encouraged by his example, many other households in his
village followed suit and experienced initial success.

<P>
However, for years, the technique resulted in low regenerating
capacity and output, and was not widely adopted.
</P>
<P>
In a national drive to boost agricultural development,
agro-scientists in several provinces combined their efforts to
develop hybrid strains with strong regenerating capacity and high
yield.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they have invented a more scientific process for
growing regenerated rice, which includes ensuring the proper humid
environment for germination, the rational application of
fertilizer, and field management.
</P>
<P>
So far, regenerated rice has been grown on one million hectares
of land in Chongqing, turning this populous city into the largest
growing area for ratooning rice in the world. It results in an
additional output of 1.4 billion kg of grain a year.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, a dozen provinces including Hubei, Fujian, Hunan,
Yunnan, Guizhou and Jiangxi, are enthusiastically pushing the use
of regenerated rice. A total of 6.2 billion kg of grain can be
harvested a year from second crops of rice in these provinces.
</P>
<P>
An agronomist said the acreage sown with regenerated rice
accounts for only one third of the paddy fields in China. There is
hope that the technique will be applied to all the two million ha
of paddy fields suitable for the growth of regenerated rice.
</P>
<P>
To this end, techniques for growing regenerated rice have been
spread to rural households in many southern provinces via
television, radio broadcasts, newspapers and correspondence
courses.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Attacks Water Deal with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP), the country's main opposition, has accused the government
of impairing national interests by signing with India a treaty on
sharing the Ganges water.
</P>
<P>
"We have not yet received details of the agreement. But as far
as we could know from different sources, it seems the government
has sold out national interest through this agreement," BNP
Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan said here on Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the new accord gives Bangladesh less water than
the 1977 agreement did. The old treaty was signed by the then BNP
government.
</P>
<P>
Under the new 30-year water accord signed Thursday in New
Delhi, the two countries will evenly share the Ganges water during
a lean season in March-May.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Awami (People's) League and its alliance Jatiya
(National) Party have welcomed the new agreement, which they said
ensures the largest amount of water to Bangladesh since 1975.

<HEADLINE> New Shanghai Library to Open Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A new library built in
China's biggest city of Shanghai will allow readers access to not
only 1,400-year-old ancient books, but also the latest information
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The New Shanghai Library, scheduled to open next week, will be
the second largest in the country, after Beijing's National
Library.
</P>
<P>
It will also become one of the ten largest libraries in the
world, with a total floor space of 83,000 square meters, 10
million volumes, 30 million patent documents and a computerized
management network, according to Chen Xiejun, deputy curator of
the library.
</P>
<P>
A major cultural project, the new library is considered to be a
symbol of the progressive city.
</P>
<P>
The library has a stack room which can house 13 million
volumes, exhibition halls, and more than 20 reading rooms where
domestic and overseas publications, and electronic and audio-video
publications are available.
</P>
<P>
Among the library's rich collection are 1.7 million valuable
ancient books. The library also houses the largest amount of
rubbings and family trees in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We've designated several showrooms and reading rooms to
display our unique collections," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
And specially-designed physical facilities for the blind will
provide added conveniences for handicapped readers, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The new library, covering an area of 3.1 hectares, has two
major buildings, one with 24 floors and another with 11, both
featuring European-style architecture design.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Shanghai has 557 libraries for its 13 million
people. The building of the 44-year-old Shanghai Library has
become out-dated because it is too small and too old, Chen noted.

<HEADLINE> Issue Of Labor Standards Included In WTO Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization
(WTO) has included the issue of labor standards in its Ministerial
Declaration released today at the end of its first Ministerial
Conference here.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of the issue into the Declaration is seen as a
compromise between developing and developed nations as there are
great changes in the wording of the declaration.
</P>
<P>
"We reject the use of labor standards for protectionist
purposes, and agree that the comparative advantage of countries,
in particular low-wage developing countries, must in no way be put
into question," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
While renewing commitment to the observance of internationally
recognized core labor standards, the declaration admitted that the
International Labor Organization (ILO) is the only competent body
to set and deal with these standards.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that economic growth and development fostered by
increased trade and further trade liberalization contribute to the
promotion of these standards," said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The issue of labor standards was most controversial at the
five-day WTO conference, which has seen fierce exchanges of words
over the issue between developed countries led by the United
States and developing countries including Malaysia, India,
Pakistan and some African countries over the past four days.
</P>
<P>
Developing nations argue that labor standards have nothing to
do with trade and the ILO is the only right forum to deal with the
issue.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the West is attempting to weaken the
competitive advantages of low-pay countries by trying to link
trade with labor standards.

OTTAWA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government said
today that it has raised enough money to maintain its overseas
radio service, the Radio Canada International (RCI), for another
full year.
</P>
<P>
The one-year funding will be covered by the four government
departments. Without it, RCI would have ceased operation on March

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) announced the end
of RCI last Friday following the failure of the government to
raise 11.8 million U.S. dollars in funding, the money needed to
keep the radio going.
</P>
<P>
For years, CBC has been splitting RCI's costs. Facing with
massive cuts itself, CBC had said that it was withdrawing from
paying its half.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Authorizes New Force in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council today authorized the deployment of a NATO-led
multinational stabilization force (SFOR) in Bosnia for 18 months
in an attempt to maintain peace in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
SFOR will take over from the multinational implementation force
(IFOR) whose mandate in Bosnia under the Dayton peace accord which
ended ethnic warfare in the former Yugoslav republic expires on
December 20.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the follow-on peacekeeping force, the U.N. also
authorized U.N. civilian operations in Bosnia for 12 months,
including an international police force.
</P>
<P>
The 52,000-strong IFOR peacekeeping force, which includes
15,000 U.S. troops, was originally sent to Bosnia at the end of
1995 to implement the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
But many countries feared that when IFOR pulled out in
December, the lack of any follow-up military presence could lead
to renewed fighting between the ethnic factions.
</P>
<P>
The Council's resolution also permits the use of force and says
the peacekeepers can take "all necessary measures to ensure
compliance with the rules and procedures to be established by the
commander of SFOR."
</P>
<P>
It also authorized member states to take all necessary
measures, at the request of SFOR, either in defense of SFOR or to
assist the force in carrying out its mission.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Qin Huasun said that realizing and
consolidating peace in former Yugoslavia, including Bosnia, not
only conformed to the fundamental interests of the area, but would
also benefit peace and stability in Europe and the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
He said China has always supported the peace process in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese delegation had reservations about
authorizing SFOR to use force. SFOR must adopt neutral and just
position, avoid abuse of force and promote peace and stability in
Bosnia, Qin said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Unveils Rosy Economic Projections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congressional
Budget Office (CBO) today unveiled rosy economic projections for
the next three years, which could make it easier for the Congress
and the White House to strike a balanced-budget deal.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary CBO figures, the U.S. economy is
expected to grow by a moderate 2.3 percent in 1997, 2 percent in
1998 and 2.2 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In its last economic forecast in May, the CBO projected growth
for the next three years at 1.9 percent, 2 percent and 2.1 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The nonpartisan budget office, Congress' official arbiter of
fiscal and economic matters, released its projections a month
earlier than usual at the request of Republican congressional
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans did so in an effort to build an atmosphere of
cooperation with the White House in anticipation of budget talks
next year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, CBO's economic estimates were slightly more
pessimistic than those of the White House. But those tiny
variations produced rival deficit projections that differed by
tens of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
This year, Republican leaders and Democratic administration
officials have already talked about trying to quickly solve
differences over economic projections so that they can move faster
to negotiations over how to balance the budget by 2002.
</P>
<P>
CBO also projected that U.S. economic growth would stay at 2.1
percent from 2000 through 2002, at 2 percent from 2003 through
2005, and 1.9 percent in 2006 and 2007.
</P>
<P>
It forecast that inflation would be 2.9 percent in 1997 and
1998 and stay at 3 percent through 2004.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is forecast at 5.3 percent next year, growing
gradually to 6 percent in 2001.

BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand Thursday lashed the
European Union's recent move toward an anti-dumping probe into
Thai fax machines, saying it ran counter to the EU's push for a
global liberalization of information technology products.
</P>
<P>
A senior Thai Foreign Ministry official Thursday handed a
written complaint from Sharp Appliance (Thailand), a Thai-Japanese
joint venture, to Roberick Abbott, EU ambassador to the World
Trade Organization (WTO), at the WTO ministerial meeting in
Singapore, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
The EU's anti-dumping duties build a non-tariff barrier, said
Kobsak Chutikul, director-general of the economic affairs
department of the Thai Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed hopes that EU Vice-President Leon
Brittan and his delegates would block the would-be investigation.
</P>
<P>
The EU reportedly is considering anti-dumping measures against
facsimile machines from Thailand and other Asian nations and it
has received a request for such an investigation.
</P>
<P>
Sharp Appliance (Thailand), whose fax machines are at the
center of the EU investigation, claimed that the probe was
engineered by EU manufacturer Philips.

BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Poland is seeking
consultations with Thailand over its alleged dumping of structural
steel in Thailand, saying that Bangkok's probe procedure is

today.
</P>
<P>
Thai and Polish ambassadors to the World Trade Organization
(WTO) Thursday met at the WTO ministerial meeting in Singapore and
discussed arrangements for the consultations.
</P>
<P>
Thailand started an anti-dumping investigation on August 30
this year following a complaint by Siam Yamato Steel, a
Thai-Japanese joint venture, that cheap imports were damaging its
business.
</P>
<P>
Poland protested that Thailand did not give any advance notice,
as required by the WTO rules concerned, when it started the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The East European country also argued that Thailand did not
give Polish companies enough time to answer detailed
questionnaires on their cost and marketing.
</P>
<P>
However, Thai Ambassador to the WTO Krirk-Krai Jirapaet said
that Thailand conformed to the WTO rules by informing Poland's
counselor beforehand.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Exports of Gifts, Souvenirs Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports of gifts
and souvenirs in the first nine months of this year dropped by 12
percent from the same period last year, according to the
Department of Export Promotion.
</P>
<P>
The country exported 20.43 billion baht (817 million U.S.
dollars) of gifts and souvenirs between January and September this
year.
</P>
<P>
The department attributed the decline to shortages of raw
materials and skilled labor as well as higher production and labor
costs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier projections had called for a 10-percent increase in the
sector for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
However, the department predicted that exports of gifts and
souvenirs would go up next year with economic recovery in many
markets and lower tariffs on imported raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's major export markets include Japan, Germany,
Britain, the United States, France, Singapore, South Korea and the
Netherlands.

HOHHOT, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Large-scale planting of rice on
sandy land has been successful in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the Regional Agricultural Department
show that the planting acreage of rice on sandy land reached more
than 300 ha this year, with total output expected to reach 2.3
million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The rice can grow well on sandy land which is lined with
plastic sheeting to prevent water and fertilizer from leaking,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
The use of this technology began in the region in 1993, and
was spread on a large scale this year.
</P>
<P>
Experiments show that the technology, along with the
conservation of water and fertilizer, can help raise economic
returns.
</P>
<P>
It will also play an important role in the improvement of
ecological environment in the desert, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Regain Traditional Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian Ministry of
Industry will do its utmost to regain the traditional markets and
explore new ones for its industrial products.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, Industry Minister
Liubomir Dachev said the move is necessary because the market of
Bulgarian industrial products has been shrinking.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that out of 1,300 enterprises affiliated with the
ministry, 300 have been operating on a money-losing basis.
</P>
<P>
Dachev said that in the last two years, 38 enterprises have
been closed down, 43 been suspended for upgrading, and 136 been
wholly or partly privatized.
</P>
<P>
He promised that in 1997 his ministry will speed up the
structural reforms of the enterprises by setting up joint venture
companies, closing down money-losing enterprises, developing
energy-saving products, expanding the proportion of small and
medium-sized enterprises, and changing the enterprises' ownership
structure through privatization.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts noted that falling industrial production and
disappointing product quality were due to the total negligence in
industrial research. Since 1990, research funds have been
drastically cut and research institutions been reduced from 620 to
less than 200.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistics Bureau data indicated that in the first
nine months of this year, 45 percent of the state-owned
enterprises are operating on a money-losing basis, and their
combined debt reached 387.6 billion Lev (92.3 million
U.S. dollars), more than doubling their total assets.
</P>
<P>
These money-losing enterprises, with a workforce of 500,000
people, account for 45 percent of the country's total.

<P>
BUCHAREST, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Foreign Minister
Adrian Severin said today that if his country was not among the
first batch of countries to join NATO in its eastward expansion,
it would seek safety guarantees from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
But he did not specify where the new guarantees would come from.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Hungarian Magyar Nemzet newspaper,
Severin said that if Hungary joined NATO before Romania, it would
only help nationalists in Romania and would cause fear among the
Romanian people, the press here reported today.
</P>
<P>
Both Romania and Hungary are among the likely candidates to
join NATO in the first round of eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
The historical row between the two neighbors over Transylvania
in Romania has escalated since 1991 when the 1.5 million Hungarian
minorities living there started actively seeking autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed two agreements in September this year,
by which both agreed to honor the current border and respect each
other's territorial sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
But the agreements were opposed by Hungarian nationalists who
wanted autonomy and finally reunification with Hungary.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Oil Output Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' crude oil
production from the Palawan oil wells were down to only 274,329
barrels for the first 11 months this year, 70 percent lower than
last year's output for the same period, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the decrease was attributed mainly to the
suspension of production at the West Linapacan field in northwest
Palawan since January.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the Department of Energy as saying the West
Linapacan oil field produced a total of 703,011 barrels of crude
oil last year. This year, the last 5,312 barrels were squeezed out
of the field in January.
</P>
<P>
Other discovery wells have been yielding crude oil, but only in
small quantities and definitely not enough to make up for the
losses of the West Linapacan wells.
</P>
<P>
Alcorn (Production) Philippines Inc. shut down the West
Linapacan field early this year due to escalating production
costs.

BUDAPEST, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Hungary will stick to its
"one China" policy in foreign affairs and looks forward to better
relations with China, Foreign Minister Kovacs Laszlo said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua on the eve of his China visit,
Kovacs said that Hungary, either from its consideration of
economic development or from the angle of world politics, regards
China as an economic and political partner of great importance.
</P>
<P>
Kovacs, who will visit China on December 14-18, said that
Hungary and China have great potential for forging stronger
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He noted that economic cooperation between the two countries in
recent years have not been very satisfactory despite frequent
high-level political contacts.

In 1995, Sino-Hungarian trade stood at 150 million
U.S. dollars, much lower than the 400 million dollars in the late

<HEADLINE> Chirac Vows to Privatize all Competitive State Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today vowed to privatize all state enterprises suitable for market
competition, while keeping those "big public services," such as
energy and the postal service, under state control.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement during a two-hour televised interview
with a team of French journalists in his Elysee presidential
palace this evening.
</P>
<P>
Chirac defended the social and economic policies adopted by him
and his prime minister Alain Juppe over the past year.
</P>
<P>
France, as the world's fourth largest exporting economy, must
maintain its economic dynamism by all means necessary, including
privatization, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would sell part of the state's stake in
telecommunications giant France-Telecom early next year.
</P>
<P>
Chirac criticized what he called the "forces of conservatism"
in France, such as trade unions and professional corporatism which
are strongly opposed to the reforms he is trying to push forward.
</P>
<P>
He implicitly expressed his regret over the suspension by the
Privatization Commission of the sell-off of the state electronics
giant Thomson SA.
</P>
<P>
The Privatization Commission suspended the privatization of the
debt-burdened Thomson, because the Lagardere group, which was
chosen by the government to take over the company, wanted to sell
its civilian part, Thomson Multimedia, to Daewoo Electronics of
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
But strong opposition from the unions, the media and left-wing
parties is believed to be the main reason for the suspension.
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, no one could say anything about it (the suspension),
since the procedure (of privatization) has been resumed. But this
is not the problem," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is to know how France, the fourth largest exporter
in the world, can keep its dynamism," he said.
</P>
<P>
The French government has decided to divide Thomson SA into two
parts -- the military arm Thomson CSF and civilian division
Thomson Multimedia -- and sell them in two phases.

<HEADLINE> Ruins Found Near Ancient Northwestern Chinese Buddhist City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-Japanese archaeology
team stumbled onto some distant cultural relics, dating back some
2,500 years, north of the mysterious Niya Ruins in the southern
part of Taklimakan Desert in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say that the ruins are about 40 kilometers north
of the 2,000-year-old Buddhist city of Niya, in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region. No ruins north of the Niya Ruins have been
found for a hundred years, Yu Zhiyong, deputy director of the
Xinjiang Relics and Archaeologist Institute, says.
</P>
<P>
Yu, who was a member of the expedition, described the ruins as
a 3.3-meter wall and some remains of nine stone pillars, the
tallest being 1.43 meters. But the team decided against excavating
the ruins because of time limitations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The ruins at Niya, which was the seat of government for the
Jingjue State during the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- A.D. 220), was
previously believed to have existed inside a 25 kilometer by 5
kilometer rectangle, centering on a Buddhist pagoda.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists found other cultural relics such as bronze
crucibles, stone sickles, pottery, bronze knives, and spindles
with 457 bone beads, which are believed to be about 2,500 years
old. To their delight, the archaeologists say, the finds differ
greatly from the Niya relics.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists also unearthed four intact earthenware pots,
which, judging by the design, decorative patterns, and distinct
style, are similar to some found at an ancient site in southern
Siberia, Yu said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- In spite of discouraging
factors, Cuba's economy is estimated to grow by seven to eight
percent this year, Granma newspaper quoted a high-ranking
government official as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Despite oil price hikes, tightening U.S. economic sanction and
Hurricane Lili, Cuba ends this year with a stronger economy, said
Carlos Lage, executive secretary of the Council of Ministers, or
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt the recovery of the Cuban economy will
continue into 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Lage, who is in charge of Cuba's economic affairs, stressed
that the problem of trade deficit must be addressed.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade deficit is the most difficult problem for the
economy, he said. It will have to be reduced in a progressive way,
through austerity, among other measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, exports increased by 32 percent, but imports grew 54
percent.
</P>
<P>
The United States tightened its decades-old trade embargo
against the island nation with the implementation of the
Helms-Burton law after Cuba shot down two small aircraft piloted
by a U.S.-based anti-Havana group in February.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Lili, which swept the Central American isthmus and
the Caribbean in October, caused heavy damage to houses and crops

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Denies Sale of Missiles to Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine today denied that it had
sold military equipment and technology to Libya.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's Security and Defense chief Vladimir Gorbulin ruled
out any possibility of the country selling ballistic missiles to
Libya.
</P>
<P>
Gorbulin was responding to a story carried Tuesday in the
U.S. newspaper The Washington Times claiming that Ukraine had
repaired submarines for and sold ballistic missiles and
polyurethane (used to make missile fuel) to the north African
country.
</P>
<P>
"It is not possible at all for us to secretly transport
missiles out of our country," said Gorbulin, who said he feared
the story could damage foreign aid to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted Ukraine's intelligence authorities are
investigating a smuggling case, which is allegedly related to
polyurethane.

<HEADLINE> 300,000 Berliners to Migrate to Rural Areas in Brandenburg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Approximately 300,000 Berliners
will have migrated from the city to rural areas in the Brandenburg
District west of Berlin by the year 2010, to realize their dream
of living in the countryside, a survey indicated.
</P>
<P>
Although considerable numbers of Germans and foreigners are
expected to move in Berlin during this period, the immigration
will not likely compensate for the emigration of 300,000 people,
according to the survey, conducted by the East German Rural
Architecture Deposits Bank.
</P>
<P>
A Hanover-based research institute has estimated that some
145,000 people will have immigrated into Berlin by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that by the year 2010, there will have been 6
million people living in the Berlin-Brandenburg areas, including a
total of 3.16 million people living in Berlin, less than the
present number of 3.48 million.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there will have been 2.9 million people living in
the Brandenburg District, more than the present number of 2.54
million.

<HEADLINE> Chile to Increase Rural Power Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Three quarters of rural
houses in Chile will have access to power supply by the year 2000,
an energy official said here today.
</P>
<P>
At present, 190,000 families, or 37 percent of the rural
population, are still living without electric power, said
Alejandro Jadresic, chief of National Energy Commission.
</P>
<P>
The government will put in 150 million U.S. dollars for the
1996-2000 rural power supply program, he said.
</P>
<P>
This year, nearly 10 million dollars were allocated to the
program through the National Fund for Regional Development, a 43
percent increase over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The government will also use 12 million dollars next year to
subsidize the development of rural telephone network so that 1.1
million rural residents will have telephone service two years
later, Transport and Telecommunications Minister Claudio Hohmann
said.
</P>
<P>
The rural people will have to contribute about 10 percent of
the cost of each project, officials say.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Low-income residents in the
Chinese capital are living a better and more stable life thanks to
a series of policies adopted by the local government to guarantee
their basic living expenses.
</P>

The new measures include a minimum wage system, which sets 270
yuan per month as the standard. Basic living expenses for
employees who have been laid off from enterprises stands at 180
yuan, while the expenses for retired workers ranges from 170 to
263 yuan. The minimum living expenses for urban residents is 170
yuan.
</P>
<P>

The minimum wages, basic living expenses and relief fund will
be adjusted to a higher level every year on July 1.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 80 percent of the state and collective
enterprises have adopted an old-age pension system and established
a social insurance fund for treating serious diseases.
</P>
<P>
Starting from December 1, the local government has granted
preferential grain and oil supply "credit" cards to residents
whose monthly income is less than 170 yuan. Each month, card
carriers can get 20 yuan worth of grain and oil free of charge.

speed up the old-age pension system reform and the re-employment
of laid-off personnel, and to take more effective steps to help
the poor.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Faces Economic Downtrend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Projected zero growth and
growing foreign debt cast shadows over Costa Rica's economic
prospects for the next year, government officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Francisco de Paula Gutierrez said the nation's
economy will not grow this year, while unemployment, now slightly
under 6 percent, is expected to increase in the next year.
</P>
<P>
With interest payment of foreign debt eating up one third of
the budget, the nation's targeted budget deficit would grow from
0.5 percent to nearly 5 percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP) in the next year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Mounting budget deficit could greatly undermine the nation's
ability to honored an agreement with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and force it to open renegotiation with IMF.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica is expected to unveil Monday a plan to battle the
problems resulted from the growing foreign debt. The government
will seek to prevent the debt from increasing and reduce the
interest rates while trying to reactivate the economy.
</P>
<P>
Private economic consulting firms estimate the Costa Rican
economy could diminish next year by 1 percent. But a more
optimistic overview foresees a growth of up to 1.5 percent, if
measures to control the debt are adopted.

secure at least 2.8 billion U.S. dollars in fresh annual soft loan
packages from foreign donors in the next two years to partially
finance huge requirements for infrastructure investment. Out of
these total loan commitments, annual disbursements are expected to
average about 2.3 billion dollars a year. In a macroeconomics
report on the Philippines, the bank said that 60 percent of the
financing requirements for public investment from 1997 to 1998 are
expected to be covered from domestic sources such public revenues
and domestic borrowing, while the remaining 40 percent, from
external sources.

<HEADLINE> AEC Ministerial Meeting Starts in Havana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers and
representatives of 25 member countries of the Caribbean States
Association (AEC) gathered here today for talks on stepping up
regional integration.
</P>
<P>
Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria, also president of
the AEC Council of Ministers, said the AEC must become a useful
instrument in efforts to improve the living standards of Caribbean
people.
</P>
<P>
He called on delegates to complete the juridical "scaffolding"
of the organization, set up in 1994, and to look to the future in
setting priorities for the AEC's special committees.
</P>
<P>
Gurria said economic integration of the Caribbean basin could
be boosted through tourism, commerce, and transport.
</P>
<P>
The Caribbean Sea should be preserved as a common heritage and
a unifying element of the collective effort, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina stressed that the
participating states have arrived by different roads at the same
conclusion - that only by uniting can they be actors and not
bystanders in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We are a small country, harassed and blockaded by the biggest
power in the world, where the landslides that made the planet
tremble damaged our house, but did not affect its foundations,"
said Robaina.
</P>
<P>
Among the representatives attending the meeting are the foreign
ministers of Mexico, Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Panama,
Dominica, Barbados, Guyana, and Grenada.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Top Business Groups Oppose Charter Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' top
businessmen have warned that moves to amend the constitution will
dampen the country's bright prospects of economic growth next
year, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to executives of the Makati Business Club and the
Management Association of the Philippines, the projected
7.5-percent economic growth for 1997 will "crumble into pieces" if
various groups pursue their "divisive" and "distracting"
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
"The continued moves to amend the Charter will cause
distraction. This will take away the attention from the economy
and will cause divisiveness which is something we can not afford
right now," said Guillermo Luz, Executive Director of the Makati
Business Club.
</P>
<P>
The two leading business groups run the country's biggest
corporations, including subsidiaries of large foreign
conglomerates. They foresaw that the growth of the country's gross
national product (GNP) would reach up to 7.5 percent from the
expected seven percent this year, fuelled by the growth of the
industrial, manufacturing and the agricultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
The two groups reiterated in a joint statement that they oppose
to changing the constitution to lift the term limits on Philippine
President Fidel Ramos and other elective officials as their terms
end in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rodolfo Biazon, a former senator and military chief,
said that ultra-rightist elements in the military may attempt to
grab political power from the Ramos administration should the
campaign to amend the constitution succeed.

<HEADLINE> Seles Has Broken Ring Finger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Monica Seles of the United
States has a broken right ring finger that which have to be in
plaster for at least two weeks, her agent the International
Management Group said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Seles suffered the injury while practicing in Europe two weeks
ago, but didn't have it examined right away.
</P>
<P>
The injury is only the latest to hinder Seles, who was forced
to withdraw from the WTA Tour Championships last month after
aggravating an injury to her left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
Seles, a left-hander, injured the shoulder en route to victory
in the 1996 Australian Open. The injury forced her out of several
tournaments, and also hampered her serve for much of the year.
</P>
<P>
Seles, who was stabbed in the back during a tournament in
Hamburg in April, 1993, returned to pro tennis last summer after a
two-year absence.

AL AIN, United Arab Emirates, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A defeat
of Uzbekistan drived China into the quarter-finals of the Asian
Cup soccer tournament here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China, who lost to Japan 0-1 as Japanese defender Naoki Soma
scored one minute before the whistle, had been lucky enough when

match.

China had better goal difference than both Syria and
Uzbekistan and qualified as Group C's runner-up behind Japan.

That result also ensured that South Korea earned a berth in the
last eight from group A as one of the two best teams in third
position in the three groups.
</P>

Syria opened the scoring in the third minute through Nader
Jokhadar but Uzbekistan levelled it on a 53rd minute penalty
converted by Sergey.
</P>
<P>
Dib restored Syria's lead in the 72nd minute and Uzbekistan
could not amass enough power for a comeback when Sergey was sent
off two minutes later.
</P>

In the quarter-final stage to start on Sunday, the United Arab
Emirates will play Iraq in Abu Dhabi and Kuwait face Japan in Al
Ain.

<HEADLINE> Domestically-Built Electric Locomotive Sets Speed Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A new type of
domestically-made electric locomotive has set a record by
travelling at 185 kph.
</P>
<P>
The Shaoshan-8 quasi-express electric locomotive was put into
trial use on the Zhengzhou-Luohe section, in central China, of the
Beijing-Guangzhou railway line in November this year.
</P>
<P>
The locomotive set the record at a test track in Beijing. The
speed is more than double that of express trains which now run on
the Beijing-Guangzhou line.
</P>
<P>
This has given a boost to efforts to increase the train speed
to 120 to 140 kph on the Beijing-Guangzhou line, a trunk line in
the country, next year, officials at the Ministry of Railways
noted.
</P>
<P>
The development of the Shaoshan-8 locomotive was a key
scientific and technological program during the country's Eighth
Five-Year Plan (1991-1995). It was developed by the Hunan
Province's Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Plant in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Major technological renovations were conducted on the
locomotive early this year, adding a 900-kw pulsating-current
motor, the most powerful for domestic motors.
</P>
<P>
Sources say tests aimed at raising the speed of trains pulled
by the locomotive to 210 kph will start later this month in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Shaoshan-8 locomotives will become the main locomotives for
China's electrified railways, and go into batch production early
next year, the Ministry of Railways officials said.

<P>
ROME, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian striker Nwankwo Kanu was
released from hospital in the United States after heart surgery,
his Italian club Internazionale said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The club issued a statement saying that the Cleveland Clinic
in Ohio, where Kanu had a plastic aortic valve inserted in a
four-hour operation last month, had allowed the 20-year-old
player to leave and said he was in "good" condition.
</P>
<P>
The hospital said Kanu was pursuing a daily rehabilitation
programme following the surgery.
</P>
<P>
"Kanu is making good progress and is regaining his strength.
The next step will be for him to undergo a long-term
rehabilitation programme which could last several months."
</P>
<P>
Kanu's playing career came to an abrupt end after his heart
problem was detected by Inter shortly after they had signed him
from Ajax Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
Kanu stood out when he captained Nigeria's gold medal winning
team at the Atlanta Olympics last summer.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Iran Against Foreign Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Iran are against
foreign intervention in efforts to settle the conflict in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We both agree in rejecting foreign intervention," Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Velayati said here Thursday after meeting
with President Soeharto at the Merdaka palace, official sources
said today.
</P>
<P>
Velayati is here to attend the 24th ministerial meeting of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) which began on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He further said the conflict should be settled by the afghan
people themselves.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his views that military moves will not end
the conflict because peace efforts are still the best solution.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan Taliban Islamic militia, during the ongoing OIC,
described as "unjust" a decision by the organization's ministers
to leave the Afghan OIC seat temporarily vacant.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministers said they decided to leave the seat
empty "in order to preserve a climate conducive to productive
discussions at this meeting."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's first secretary in its consulate in Pakistan,
Abdul Hamik Mujaid, claimed that his faction controls 75 percent
of the country, including the capital, Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the former Afghan government, led by
Burhanuddin Rabbani, and the Taliban are present at the venue of
the OIC meeting, but since they do not have an official status,
they cannot attend the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The OIC ministerial meeting being attended by its 54 member
states is scheduled to wind up Friday.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Expands Posts, Telecom With Foreign Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Gansu, an underdeveloped
province in northwest China, has brought in 90 million US dollars
in foreign government and World Bank loans, to develop the local
posts and telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, a number of projects have been completed in this
regard, including a 200,000-line automatic telephone project with
loans from the Australian government, a digital microwave trunk
line linking six cities with loans from the Spanish government, an
optic-fiber telecom trunk line between Gansu and Beijing with
loans from the World Bank, a satellite ground station and an
automatic mail sorting system.
</P>
<P>
The province has also used Australian government loans to build
the Gansu section of an optic-fiber trunk line connecting Xining,
capital of Qinghai Province, Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, and Lanzhou, capital of Gansu.
</P>
<P>
The foreign loans have helped accelerate the development of the
province's posts and telecommunications. In the past five years
the sector has increased its assets to 3.2 billion yuan from the
previous 500 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that the province plans to set up a
provincial automatic telephone network with 12 cities as the core,
with 640 million yuan from local allocations and Japanese
government loans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gansu also plans to introduce a digital microwave
system for its Hexi Corridor, which will cost 65.95 million
yuan and will be funded by French government loans.

</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Strong jobs growth cut the national unemployment rate from
8.8 to 8.5 percent in November, delivering a psychological boost
which was needed for economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Australia is to be part of a historic international
agreement, hailed as a huge advance for the world economy, to
abolish worldwide tariffs in the booming information technology
industry. The agreement, thrashed out between the United States
and the European Union may come to fruition by next July.
</P>
<P>
The Age

Federal Government with its second piece of good economic news in
as many days.
</P>

<HEADLINE> FBI Has Flood of Calls on Olympic Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The FBI has got more than
1,000 phone calls and several photographs after pleading with the
public for information on the bombing at the Olympic Centennial
Park.
</P>
<P>
The bombing, coming the midst of the Olympic festivities,
caused two deaths and injured 112 on July 27.
</P>
<P>
An FBI spokesman in Washington said there had been more than
1,000 phone calls since Monday, when the FBI reactivated a
toll-free hotline.
</P>
<P>
But an FBI official in Atlanta, speaking on background, said
the agency had also received "several" photographs of men wearing
a green military-style backpack taken on the night of the
bombing. But the official added that more than one person in the
park that night was carrying such a backpack.
</P>
<P>
On Monday the FBI also announced it was establishing a 500,000
dollar reward to anyone whose information resulted in the arrest
of the park bomber.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the FBI cleared Richard Jewell, a security guard who
was a suspect.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Raps Eurosceptics, Rules Out Change of PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today rapped Eurosceptics who have expressed doubts over the
building of a European single currency in 1999, and ruled out any
possibility of changing his prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In a two-hour television interview at the Elysee presidential
palace this evening, Chirac said, "Those who pretend that one
should devalue the franc in its exchange rate with the mark are
wrong."
</P>
<P>
"It will be unacceptable to the Germans. It will destroy the
European construction, and it will be useless," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said the French franc is strong enough to maintain its
parity with the German mark, because for the first time in the
history of bilateral trade between France and Germany, France is
enjoying a surplus this year.
</P>
<P>
Former President Giscard d'Estaing, former Interior Minister
Charles Pasqua and President of the French Senate Philippe Seguin
have called for the devaluation of the franc to stimulate
investment, trade and employment.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said his ambition is to make the future European single
currency, euro, confirm to the interests of France. A strong euro
will make Europe "internally stable and externally strong," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the only way to match a strong dollar, whose interest
rates are manipulated by the U.S. central bank to dominate the
world financial market, is to build a strong euro.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also ruled out the possibility of changing his prime
minister, and he again praised Alain Juppe for carrying out
"difficult and courageous policies which are (however) rarely
popular."

<HEADLINE> Dow Down Loses Nearly 100 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks dropped
sharply late today, with the Dow Jones industrials average
plunging nearly 100 points as nervous investors sold to lock in
profits from the market's remarkable rally last month.
</P>
<P>
The Dow, up in early trading, wound up down 98.81 points at
6,303.71. That represents a slide of 244 points, or 3.7 percent
from the record 6,547.79 reached on November 25. But it still is
more than 23 percent higher than when the year began.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues led advancers by 4 to 3 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Volume was heavy at 492.76 million shares as against
Wednesday's 494.19 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes ended lower, too. The Nasdaq composite put
up a good fight, but the last hour of trading sent the index down
10.80 at 1,298.32.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.42 to 729.31, the
NYSE's composite index fell 5.25 to 384.29, and the American Stock
Exchange's market value index fell 4.81 to 579.11.
</P>
<P>
Stocks have been especially volatile since remarks last week by
the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who said the market
was "irrationally exuberant." The comments sparked fears that if
the market didn't cool off on its own, the Fed would push up
interest rates to slow its pace.

<HEADLINE> Krajisnik Satisfied With Bosnian Presidency Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, Serb
member of the Bosnian collective presidency, said he was satisfied
with a presidency session held today in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The three-member presidency of Bosnia today appointed the two
co-chairmen of the Council of Ministers -- Boro Bosic of Republika
Srpska and Haris Silajdzic of the Muslim-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik expressed the hope in the Serb administrative center
of Pale that Bosic would contribute to the quality and activities
of the Council of Ministers and that he would protect the
interests of Republika Srpska, according to a Tanjug news agency
report.
</P>
<P>
Bosic is the director of the thermo-electric power plant
Ugljevik, and Silajdzic is the president of the party for
Bosnia-herzegovina and former prime minister of the Muslim
government.
</P>
<P>
As agreed earlier by the presidency, the two co-chairmen will
be prime minister on a weekly rotation, and Bosic got the first
mandate.
</P>
<P>
According to the presidency decision adopted at the session,
the two co-chairmen should name the other members of the Council
of Ministers, or the Bosnian government, by December 17.
</P>
<P>
After this, the assembly's house of representatives will meet
in session and verify the mandates.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the two co-chairmen and their deputies, the
Council of Ministers will have three ministers: for foreign
affairs, for foreign trade, and for civilian affairs and
communications. The three ministers will have one deputy each so
that all the three nations are represented for each department.
</P>
<P>
The council is comprised of 12 members -- four Serbs, four
Croats and four Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Avis Wants Franchise Owner Accused of Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Avis Rent-A-Car wants to
take away the franchise of an owner accused of refusing to rent
cars to blacks.
</P>
<P>
The company asked a federal judge Wednesday to stop John Dalton
from running his New Hanover franchise until a racial bias lawsuit
against him is decided, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Last month, three black women sued Dalton and Avis, the
nation's second-largest rental car company, saying Dalton told
employees at franchises in North and South Carolina to avoid
renting cars to black customers.
</P>
<P>
Avis, based in Garden City, New York, said an internal
investigation found an additional 26 complaints of racial
discrimination at Dalton's franchise over eight years.
</P>
<P>
"We will not tolerate unlawful discrimination by anyone
licensed to use the Avis name," said Joseph Vittoria, Avis
chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Avis' parent company HFS told Avis to sever all
ties with the franchise.
</P>
<P>
Dalton's attorney, Frank Ward, said his client has never
refused to rent to anyone because of their race and will
"vigorously oppose" Avis' motion.

<HEADLINE> Dublin Summit to Kick-Start EU Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUBLIN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the 15 European
Union (EU) countries will meet here in the next two days to
discuss urgent issues relating to EU reforms at the on-going
Inter-Governmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton, whose country is holding the
rotating EU presidency, said Wednesday that the Dublin summit
"will demonstrate that the EU is on the right track for achieving
the objectives it has set."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the EU leaders would make progress
on the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and the fight against
unemployment, drugs and organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
"The summit must give a strong and clear message that we're
proceeding forward on all the major agenda items that we have
before us as a union," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the leaders of the 15 member states on the eve
of the summit, EU Commission President Jacques Santer said that
the meeting "will also be the opportunity for a decisive advance
in the preparations for the EMU and it will ensure that the stage
is set for the introduction of the single currency, as planned, on
January 1, 1999."
</P>
<P>
However, the Franco-German tensions over the single currency
cast a long shadow over the summit after French President Jacques
Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl failed to iron out their
differences on a "stability pact" at their talks last Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that President Chirac refused to entirely
endorse the German government's demands for hefty fines on those
EU countries that breach the specified deficit limits.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the so-called slowest ship in the EU fleet, is likely
to pose some stumbling blocks to the summit meeting, most probably
opposing any extension of EU control over immigration, borders and
employment policy.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland's 241-Year-Old Watchmaker Sold Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- All of the share capital of
Vacheron Constantin, a Swiss watchmaker with a history of more
than two centuries, was sold out here today.
</P>
<P>
Vacheron Constantin, created by Jean-Marc Vacheron in Geneva in
1755, is said to be the oldest watch company in Switzerland. The
previous majority shareholder of Vacheron Constantin since 1987 is
66-year-old Ahmed Zaki Yamani, former oil minister of Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Its new owner is Vendome Luxury Group, one of the world's
largest luxury goods companies. Joseph Kanoui, chairman of Vendome
Luxury Group, told reporters that he was delighted the group would
be able to strengthen its presence at the top end of the luxury
watch market and to continue the growth of one of the most famous
Swiss watch brands at a high point in its history.
</P>
<P>
The group made a profit of 350 million U.S. dollars out of a
turnover of 2 billion U.S. dollars in the last financial year.
Various companies in the group design, manufacture, market and
distribute a range of luxury products, primarily jewelry and
watches.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Government Protests Continue in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of
protesters, organized by the opposition coalition Zajedno
(Together), continued their demonstrations in Belgrade today.
</P>
<P>
They marched through the streets of central Belgrade and then
held a rally on Republic Square in the center of the city.
</P>
<P>
The protest rallies have been staged in the capital city since
November 19 to protest a court ruling to annul the result of the
second round of elections for local authorities. Some of the
rallies were attended by more than 100,000 people, including
university students.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous days, the protesters today had a longer "walk"
and passed the Yugoslav Army General Staff, the constitutional
court, the Serbian government and the Yugoslav Assembly, causing
even bigger traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Youth Association of Serbia today called on
young people to return to schools and universities and prove their
maturity in the best way.
</P>
<P>
"Blocking work in certain schools and faculties will affect the
proper completion of education programs to the detriment of pupils
and students," the association said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of university and high school students, supported by
professors and teachers, have held demonstrations against
the government in the past weeks. Some students even boycotted
classes, making the situation in Belgrade even worse.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini arrived here today on a
one-day visit to discuss the crisis in Serbia. He held talks with
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and opposition leaders but no
major results came out of his trip.

have begun to review the nation's major defense policy and
strategy as well as the structure of U.S. forces to prepare for a
defense blueprint for President Bill Clinton's next term.
</P>
<P>
The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), which was begun last
month, will examine every aspect of how the department operates
and how an estimated 250 billion U.S. dollars in military funding
will be spent.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Perry said that in the QDR, the
senior defense officials will assess the threats, the response to
the threats and the strategy.
</P>
<P>
The defense leaders will also examine the long-held two-war
scenario which has served as the Pentagon's key measure for how
best to size and shape U.S. forces since the Soviet Union
dissolved.
</P>
<P>
The scenario assumes that the U.S. military might have to fight
middle-sized wars against two opponents nearly simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Because of the military spending cut in recent years and the
actual situation that the U.S. forces are becoming increasingly
involved in peacekeeping operations, some generals hold that
preparations for two regional wars are no longer feasible, The
Washington Post said today.
</P>
<P>
But the majority of the defense officials believe that the
United States has little alternatives other than to reaffirm the
two-war plan, given the real prospect still of simultaneous
conflicts breaking out in some regions, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the discussion, however, will be crucial for
military plans and for Clinton to make decisions on military
spending.
</P>
<P>
The review is the third of its kind since the Cold War ended.
The last two reduced troop strength by about one-third and shifted
focus from global to regional threats.
</P>
<P>
But both plans resulted in only limited adjustments to Cold War
thinking about types of forces, ways of fighting and budget shares
among military services, according to the Post.

<HEADLINE> Dini: Little Chance for Restoring Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said here today that the demands of the Serbian
opposition were not realistic and that there was no possibility
now to restore the canceled results of the November 17 local
polls.
</P>
<P>
As the entire electoral process had been completed, including
repeated elections, there could be little chance for more
elections, Dini told a news conference in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Dini arrived here today for a one-day visit to discuss with
Serbian leaders the solution of the current crisis in Serbia.
He also met with the Serbian opposition coalition leaders.
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition Zajedno (Together) has been staging
protest rallies in Belgrade in the past four weeks against the
annulment of the result of the second round of elections for local
authorities which Zajedno claimed victory in most cities.
</P>
<P>
Dini, after holding talks with Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic and Zajedno leaders separately, said he was optimistic
with regard to finding a solution to the situation that arose
following the November 17 local elections.
</P>
<P>
He conveyed the concern of the international community over the
deteriorating situation in Serbia. But he said there was little
chance of reintroducing economic sanctions against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia and such a possibility was not even
mentioned in European Union statements and documents.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that during his meeting with Serbian President
Milosevic, he was convinced there was a possibility of overcoming
the difficulties that had arisen in a peaceful manner and in
keeping with democratic principles.
</P>
<P>
He also said he came to Belgrade first and foremost as a
representative of Italy instead of a EU mediator.
</P>
<P>
Referring to opposition rallies, Dini said he had called on
Zajedno leaders to make sure that protests were conducted
peacefully, without violence and vandalism.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interest of all to avoid conflict and clashes,"
he said, adding he had received assurances to that effect from the
Zajedno leaders.

<HEADLINE> More Budget Cut Planned for US Foreign Policy Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government is
planning more budget cut from funding for the U.S. foreign policy,
most of which is overseas assistance, AP reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a discussion on a budget plan for fiscal 1998, which
President Bill Clinton will send to the U.S. Congress next
February, the Office of Management and Budget of the White House
planned to slash 2 billion dollars from the requests of the State
Department and related agencies.
</P>
<P>
The report said the 20.8 billion dollar spending requested for
foreign affairs spending had been cut "substantially" to 18.3
billion by the Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
The biggest single part of the foreign affairs budget is
overseas assistance and the U.S. government and the Congress have
been cutting the aid continuously in the past years.
</P>
<P>
In the current fiscal year, the U.S. Congress approved 12.1
billion dollars in foreign aid, a cut of more than 700 million
from what the administration requested.
</P>
<P>
Israel receives about 3 billion dollars in economic and
military aid, and another 2.1 billion goes to Egypt. The two
countries account for about 40 percent of the U.S. foreign aid
budget.
</P>
<P>
In a direct appeal to President Clinton last week, some U.S.
congressmen urged him to "reverse the decade-long erosion in
international affairs spending."
</P>
<P>
Besides foreign aid, the U.S. foreign affairs budget also
includes funding for the State Department, the Peace Corps, the
Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corp.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year of 1997, which began on October 1 this year,
the Clinton administration requested 19.2 billion dollars for
foreign policy funding and the U.S. Congress ended up
appropriating 18.3 billion.

LONDON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Total commercial vehicle sales
in Britain stood at 20,432 last month, 1.7 percent lower than
November last year, taking the number for the first 11 months as a
whole to 243,886, a rise of 3.3 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures released by the Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders, imports continued to gain ground,
with a 48.8 percent share last month compared with 48.1 percent in

</P>
<P>
For the first 11 months as a whole, imports took 49.2 percent
of the total sale, up from 45.4 percent in the same period last

Trunk sales fell sharply for the second month running in
November by 35 percent to 3,155 units from 4,853 in the same month
a year ago, after a bigger drop of nearly 40 percent in October.

<P>
In the first 11 months of the year, the over 3.5 ton sales fell
2.9 percent to 47,652 units compared with 49,065 at the same time
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Most truck makers believed that 1997 would also be a poor year,
with forecasts of a market ranging between 45,000 and 50,000
units.
</P>
<P>
However, statistics show that sales of light vans rose to 5,720
in November from 5,661, 2 percent up on last November, and those
of panel vans rose from 8,853 to 10,072, an increase of 13.8

JOHANNESBURG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The ruling ANC will
present 60 amnesty applications, including three government
ministers and and a deputy minister, to the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission today.
</P>
<P>
The senior officials of the African National Congress (ANC)
are seeking amnesty for their violent activities during the
anti-apartheid struggle.
</P>
<P>
Among those applying are Defense Minister Joe Modise and his
deputy Ronnie Kasrils, Safety and Security Minister Sydney
Mufamadi and Post and Telecommunications Minister Jay Naidoo.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, the ANC said the 60
applications to be handed in today are from members of the
organization's former armed forces and of its security and
intelligence department.
</P>
<P>
The ANC would not disclose the names of other applicants,
saying it is the prerogative of the commission's Amnesty
Committee to release the information.
</P>
<P>
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was formed by the
government to charge with human rights violation cases left over
by history.
</P>
<P>
The commission announced yesterday that it had granted amnesty
to four right-wing bombers and three ANC self-defense unit
members who had murdered political opponents.
</P>
<P>
Commission's Deputy Chairman Alex Boraine is meeting President
Nelson Mandela today in a final bid to have the deadline extended
by three months. Mandela is known to be opposed to that.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss an extension to the cut-off date for
acts which qualify for amnesty, currently December 6, 1993.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, lawyers for two ministers said they would
apply for amnesty for the kidnaping of an alleged police spy in
1990.
</P>
<P>
The policy officer was taken to a basement cell at office of
the Congress of South African Trade Unions in Johannesburg, where
he was allegedly assaulted and kidnaping.
</P>

The assault conviction had been set aside by the Supreme
Court, and an appeal on the kidnaping conviction was pending.

<HEADLINE> Metered Charges on Trial for Hong Kong Public Payphones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Users of Hong Kong's public
pay phones will soon be charged one HK dollar for every five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
The current practice is that they need only pay one HK for a
conversation without time limit.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Telecom will start a three-month trial for such
charges at 400 out of the 10,000 public pay phones here.
</P>
<P>
But both the company and the government watchdog, the Office of
 the Telecommunications Authority (Ofta) said that it is not the
first step in introducing metered charges for all local calls.
</P>
<P>
Although a Ofta public consultation exercise showed a strong
opposition to the scrapping of free local calls, both Ofta and
Hong Kong Telecom decided that the company's international service
cannot be allowed to subsides local calls forever.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Wong, assistant director general of Ofta, denied the
decision to go ahead with the trial has anything to do with its
concern that rebalancing was needed between international and
local calls.
</P>
<P>
New pay phones has been introduced with liquid crystal displays
that can record call details.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Telecom has originally applied to raise the charges
since it has received complains that some pay phone users were
spending too much time on the phones.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Telecom will interview telephone users for their
ideas on the charges and Ofta will decide whether to officially
enforce the new charges.

<HEADLINE> Philatelic Collection To Mark The Year of Ox In HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will issue a
philatelic collection late this month to celebrate the "Year of
the Ox", which falls on the coming 1997.
</P>
<P>
The set comprises one Normal Cover, two editions of Special
Covers, one set of Postcards and one set of Souvenir Pack for
limited distribution, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature
Hong Kong (WWF HK) who produced the collection.
</P>
<P>
The special first day covers and postcards feature four
different oxen with illustration of each ox. Water Buffalo,
African Buffalo, Yak and Banteng were chosen for the design,
according to David Melville, the WWF HK's Executive Director
</P>
<P>
"Ox is a symbol of spring and agriculture. Buffalo, which has
long been used to trample or plough paddy fields, plays an
important role in rice cultivation," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, uncontrolled hunting has had a major impact on Yaks
and Banteng and some other species. Melville pointed out that
there are 12 species of wild cattle, of which nine are currently
endangered or threatened. African Buffalo has become extinct in
southern Africa due to loss of habitat and spread of disease.
</P>
<P>
It is essential to protect the environment for all species of
wildlife, said Frank Lau, assistant director of the Agriculture
and Fisheries Department. The official encouraged citizens to buy
these philatelic products as a way to support the WWF HK's
conservation and education work.

<HEADLINE> OAPEC Ministers to Meet in Cairo Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Oil Ministers of the
Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) will
hold a meeting here Saturday three days after Iraq resumed its
limited oil export to the world market.
</P>
<P>
Nine Arab ministers representing Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Libya, Algeria and
Bahrain will attend the annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from Iraq, which suffered six years of
U.N. sanctions, will also participate in the meeting, the local
daily Al-Akhbar reported today.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's representative to the Arab League Nabil Nejm will head
the delegation from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Iraq reopened its pipeline in the north Tuesday to pump oil
through Turkey to the world market for the first time in six years.
</P>
<P>
The resumed outflow of Iraqi oil was based on an oil-for-food
deal with the United Nations which allows Baghdad to sell 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months to pay for
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its
sanctions-hit people.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed the sanctions on Iraq in 1991
following its invasion of neighboring Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar said that joint Arab projects in the petroleum field,
which are being implemented in member states, will be discussed at
the session.
</P>
<P>
The oil ministers of Syria and Algeria have arrived in Cairo, and
the rest are due to reach here today.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Promises to Reduce Jobless Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard promised a renewed push to reduce unemployment next
year while speaking at a media conference here today.
</P>
<P>
"The best thing I can do is to see that all of the arms of
government policy and decision-making are directed toward trying
to reduce unemployment, commit my government to work very hard to
do that, push as hard as I can to get policies which are going to
have a beneficial effect on unemployment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics yesterday showed that unemployment fell to
a seasonally adjusted 8.5 percent in November from 8.8 percent in
October. The result came a day after the Reserve Bank cut official
cash rates by half a percentage point to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
"It was the best figure since July and I was pleased that you
had had two months of employment growth, and psychologically
coming the day after the interest rate cut it certainly injected a
note of confidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard also revealed that the government would move ahead with
further microeconomic reform and measures to boost national
savings.

NANJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Sirens wailed and people
were plunged into sorrowful memories of the past.
</P>
<P>
A large gathering was held this morning in this capital of east
China's Jiangsu Province to commemorate the Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
On this day 59 years ago, Japanese intruding troops captured
the city and carried out a six-week massacre, in which 300,000
Chinese civilians and disarmed soldiers were slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
"We must hold high the banner of patriotism and peace, educate
our people and descendants never to forget the tragic history of
being invaded, slaughtered and enslaved, oppose all aggression,
together with other peoples of the world and contribute to world
peace and development," Hu Tingjian, deputy secretary of the city
committee of the Communist Party of China, said at the gathering,
attended by people from all walks of the life and locally
stationed troops.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some Japanese rightists are hurting the feelings
of the Chinese people and running counter to the will of the
majority of the Japanese people by denying the Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
"We must face history and never let a similar tragedy happen
again so that Sino-Japanese relations can develop healthily
and the earnest wishes for friendship between the people of both
countries can be realized generation after generation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Air-raid warnings will be sounded in the city every December
13, from now on, to remind people of the atrocity.

<HEADLINE> China to Advance System Reform of Research Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- China's scientific research
institutions will step up efforts next year in system reform, Zhu
Lilan, vice-minister of the State Science and Technology
Commission, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing session of a national conference on
science and technology work, Zhu said the country's scientific
research institutions will adjust their personnel arrangements
to cater to the needs of building a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
She said the country is to build a scientific research system
manned with capable scientists from major state research
institutions and universities.
</P>
<P>
The country is also expected to build a science and
technological service system and a technology development system,
in an effort to reduce the number of research institutions that
have overlapping research programs.
</P>
<P>
She recommended the introduction of a competitive mechanism to
research institutions, by means of allowing some researchers or
scientists to be permanent employees, while allowing others to be
floating ones, in a bid to encourage institutions and their
researchers to find themselves more suitable posts in economic,
social and science sectors.
</P>
<P>
She noted that her commission will map out with departments
concerned regulations on guaranteeing the implementation of the
system reform, including the relevant regulations for modern
scientific research institutions, and building of a social
insurance system and personnel management.
</P>
<P>
Preferential support will be given to those research
institutions that take the lead in the system reform, and the
commission will collect more funds for further promoting the
reform, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> UK Labor's Victory Ends Tory Majority In Commons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Prime Minister John
Major's majority in the House of Commons was wiped out Thursday
night as Labor swept to victory in the Barnsley East by-election.
</P>
<P>
Labor local council leader Jeff Ennis won l3,683 votes (76.44
percent) against l,299 (seven percent) for Conservative Jane
Ellison, who finished third behind Liberal Democrat David Willis.
</P>
<P>
The result leaves the Prime Minister effectively leading a
minority government because one of the Tories, John Gorst,
withdrew his co-operation from the Government over the threat to
axe a full-time casualty unit at Edgware General Hospital in his
constituency last week.
</P>
<P>
The Labor victory was expected because Barnsley East is one of
the Party's traditional safe seats in the country. But the loss
of the Tory majority carries a symbolic significance and is likely
to increase pressure on Major to call a general election before
next May.
</P>
<P>
The Tories now have 323 seats in Parliament, the same number as
the opposition parties combined. Observers here believe that the
party is facing its worst crisis this century.
</P>
<P>
Comparisons were being made with the internal disputes over the
corn laws l50 years ago, which kept the Conservatives out of power
for a generation.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the by-election result was announced, Labor council
leader Ennis said: "Tonight's result in Barnsley East should be
seen as a springboard to Labor victory in general election."
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Tony Blair also stated: "The government's majority
has gone and we will continue to pile on the pressure until the
government has gone too."
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed that the Tories now have to retain the
support of the nine Ulster Unionist legislators to stay in power,
not the least since the government's decision to carry out a
selective cattle cull over BSE raises hopes of a possible lifting
of the beef export ban in Northern Ireland.

</P>
<P>
Referring to employment as a central issue in the EU debate,
Spring said Ireland had proposed a special employment
chapter be included in a revised EU treaty.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The human rights of these people are guaranteed, since the
Chinese government has adopted a law to protect the rights and
interests of the disabled.
</P>
<P>
The country has also pursued five-year plans to improve the
treatment of the disabled, focusing the efforts on providing more
opportunities for them to earn their livings, Deng noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the whole of society has also shown great concern,
and understanding for the disabled, and the handicapped are enjoying
more meaningful lives than ever before, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years about two million disabled people have
become better off, and some 559 special schools have been built
for the disabled, bringing the total number of such schools to
1,379.
</P>
<P>
The employment rate for the disabled who have the capacity to
work has been raised to 70 percent, and the number of enterprises
set up for the social welfare of the disabled has reached 60,000.
</P>
<P>
The China Central TV Station and another 15 provincial TV
stations have started broadcasting special programs for the
disabled, including news programs with sign language assistance.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has some 60 million handicapped people, who
account for about five percent of the country's total population.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to solve the food and clothing problems of the
disabled by the end of this century, and in the meantime make
great efforts to wipe out the diseases which lead to deformity.

<HEADLINE> Ramos to Receive Letters Against Charter Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos is expected to receive 5,000 letters this Christmas, which
will not greet the president but ask him to oppose moves to change
the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency reported today that the flood of
letters will come from 5,000 people who oppose constitutional
amendments in Cebu, the second biggest city in the country.
</P>
<P>
Alvin Dizon of the Forge, a non-governmental organization, said
the letters are intended to compel Ramos to finally put the issue
to rest this Christmas, instead of just assuring Filipinos that he
will not extend his term in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The group reportedly started mailing their Christmas letters to
the president today so that he will be able to read them before
January comes, Dizon added.
</P>
<P>
The move, dubbed "Send a Christmas Message to President Ramos
and Say No to Charter Amendments," aims to gather about 5,000
letters to counter the pro-charter change campaign launched by the
People's Initiative for Reform, Modernization and Action (PIRMA).
</P>
<P>
The PIRMA has been pushing for changes in the constitution to
allow presidents to serve more than one six-year term of office.
</P>
<P>
The Forge believes that the PIRMA's efforts to amend the
charter is "not productive" and is "dividing our nation and our
people," Dizon said.

<HEADLINE> China Outlines Development for Technology Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- China today published the
outline of a development plan for its technology markets during
the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
According to the outline, China will accelerate the commercial,
production and internationalized process of technological
progress, expand its technology trade and strive to obtain 800
million yuan (about 96 million US dollars)-worth of domestic
technology contracts by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The outline also stipulates that by the year 2010 China will
achieve 160 billion yuan-worth of technology contracts, further
promote technological exports and expand the international
technology trade.
</P>
<P>
During this period the country will further cultivate and
develop technology markets in rural areas, enhance agriculture and
the rural economy, and give an impetus to the technological
progress of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Advanced technology, skilled personnel and capital will be
encouraged to shift to the relatively underdeveloped central and
western parts of China. The development of individually-owned
technology firms will also be enhanced and new high-tech firms
will be encouraged to enter technology markets.
</P>
<P>
To achieve these goals, China will set up nationwide technology
market networks that involve the state input and market mechanism,
boast advanced facilities, focus on the state technology market
information bank and connect up with various local technology
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country will further mobilize and encourage more
social forces to enter technology markets, and support all
technology deals that involve academic institutions, universities,
companies and other economic units or individuals.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has set up some 50,000 institutions concerned
with technology trading, consultancy and mediation, involving
nearly one million staff members.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1990-1995), more than
1.13 million domestic technology contracts were signed, with a
contracted value reaching 95 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Development Rating to Be Reinstated to Settlers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government today
decided to reinstate special benefits for Jewish settlers in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to an Israel Radio report
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a weekly cabinet meeting held
here. A special committee will be appointed to look into the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Under the decision, the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip will be granted the "A+" designation, on a par with
those living in developing towns, Galilee, the Golan Heights and
the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish communities in these areas will enjoy this
development rating which brings about additional funding and
affords the allocation of mortgages on better terms as well as
deductions in income tax and other payments.
</P>
<P>
Those subsidies were nullified by the Labor government shortly
after it came into office in 1992, in an effort to improve the
atmosphere for peace negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Today's decision came in the wake of a drive-by shooting attack
Wednesday in the West Bank, which killed a mother and her
12-year-old son and wounded five other family members.
</P>
<P>
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which
opposes the Oslo peace accords between Israel and the
Palestinians, took responsibility for the attack, saying it was
launched because of Israel's settlement policies.
</P>
<P>
Following the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
pledged that his government would increase its efforts and
resources to ensure the existence of the Jewish settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Engineers Shortage Hurts Australian Industry: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A shortage of quality
engineers is hurting Australia's ability to remain globally
competitive, warned a report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The joint report of the federal government and various
engineering institutions said Australia is too dependent on
migrants for engineering positions and would have to graduate more
engineers in the next century to maintain its competitiveness in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The report warned that worldwide demand for engineering skills
in the coming decade would dry up the migrant pool and exacerbate
the shortage.
</P>
<P>
A fundamental cultural change in engineering education is
required to attract students as "our undergraduate system of
engineering education is somewhat stagnant and has become
inflexible," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It also found a decline in the quality of students being
attracted to engineering courses and blamed the narrow nature of
the courses for the drop.
</P>
<P>
A broadening of engineering courses is needed to make them more
relevant to industry by including economics, finance, accounting
and competition, the report recommended.

<HEADLINE> China's Oil, Gas Producing High Profits, Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The China National
Petrochemical Corporation (CNPC) is expected to produce 31.5
billion yuan in profits and taxes this year despite many
unfavorable factors.
</P>
<P>
Taxes will account for 24.5 billion yuan, a rise of 7.5 percent
compared with the figure for last year, and profits will come to
seven billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to Sheng Huaren, general manager of the CNPC, the
corporation has managed to cut down production costs and save
China from losing more than 10 billion yuan despite the fact that
prices for crude oil have been skyrocketing and prices for
chemical and chemical fiber products have kept falling this year.
</P>
<P>
Many enterprises under the corporation have reported higher
profits than last year, by relying on technical progress and
scientific management.
</P>
<P>
For 1996 the corporation is expected to process 4.2 percent
more crude oil than last year, and produce 9.5 percent more
petrol, kerosene, diesel oil and lubricants.
</P>
<P>
Vice-premiers Wu Bangguo and Jiang Chunyun recently sent
messages of congratulations to the CNPC on its achievements
despite the difficult situation this year.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Wu Bangguo, also a member of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), said that the CNPC's experiences this year prove that
state-owned enterprises can survive the market competition and
strive to become profitable entities though it is not an easy job.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the CNPC could carefully implement the
guidelines of the CPC Central Committee's fifth and sixth plenary
sessions and the recent central work meeting on economic issues
for 1997, be confident about making a success of state-owned
enterprises, and continue to promote the shift of economic
mechanism and economic growth mode.
</P>
<P>
Wu also urged the corporation to intensify its structural
adjustment and technical upgrading, and strengthen scientific
progress and scientific management in the coming year. The
company, he said, must overcome difficulties brought about by
unfavorable factors, including price hikes in the international
oil market, and probe effective ways to run state-owned
enterprises better, thereby making a great contribution to the
sustained, rapid and healthy development of China's economy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Chunyun, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC
Central Committee, said in his letter that the fact that the CNPC
has fulfilled this year's production plan of 5.4 million tons of
urea ahead of time -- and is expected to produce 5.75 million tons
of urea for the whole of 1996 -- has contributed a great deal to
the success of the country's agriculture this year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Ruling Party to Decide on Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 13 (xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe today
asked the ruling ZANU (PF) national conference to decide the fate
of primary elections which have spawned factionalism within the
party.
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging Central Committee report to over 5,000
delegates attending the conference in Bulawayo, Mugabe said last
year when local government and parliamentary elections were held,
had witnessed the resurgence of factionalism, leading to defeats
of official party candidates by independents from the party.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas the generality of the party may have thought that the
problem was a passing one linked to the primary electoral
process, it became increasingly clear that the problem had taken
root," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe singled out Manicaland and Masvingo provinces as the
most faction-ridden where several efforts to heal rifts among
party members had come to naught.
</P>
<P>
"To our utter dismay, these efforts have not produced the
desired results as factionalism continues to rear its ugly head,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the conference would have to decide whether the
concept should be discontinued, though the party's Central
Committee felt that it was a democratic process.
</P>
<P>
"We resolutely condemn this cancerous tendency which, if
unchecked, threatens the unity and cohesiveness of the problem
and the conference should forthrightly address this incipient
problem," he said.

<HEADLINE> Song Jian Urges Further Opening of Science Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- State Councilor and Minister
in Charge of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian
today called for setting up a more open and active system for the
country's science and technology sector.
</P>
<P>
Song made the call at the close of a national conference
attended by officials in charge of science and technology
departments in provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities,
as well as officials from other ministries.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the achievements made by the science and
technology departments since the country introduced the reform and
opening policies in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
During this period, the science and technology sector of the
country has been notably reinforced, the restructuring of the
science and technology system has been proceeding actively and
stably, new- and high-technology industries have been set up and
developed, the academic level in basic studies has been enhanced
steadily, and the "China 21th Century Program" has been
formulated, Song noted.
</P>
<P>
The state councilor attributed these achievements to the fact
that China has toed the line of correct principles, seized
opportunities promptly, tackled key problems and handled all
related matters in a proper manner.
</P>
<P>
If China wants to develop the science and technology sector
rapidly it must be opened wider to the world, Song noted, saying
that this is a must for the sustained development of the country's
science and technology and to make it reach the world level.
</P>
<P>
He noted the importance of giving full scope to the role of
talented persons and building a new science and technology system
in conformance with the socialist market economy.

<HEADLINE> OIC Members Urged to Strengthen Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The 24th ministerial meeting
of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) urged member
states to strengthen their economic cooperation so as to maximize
the complementarity of their economies and avoid further
marginalization.
</P>
<P>
In a final communique issued at the end of their meeting here,
the OIC foreign ministers reiterated the need to take serious
steps to ensure economic integration among OIC member states with
the ultimate objective of establishing an Islamic common market or
any other form of economic integration.
</P>
<P>
The economic integration, it said, could help OIC members
overcome difficulties arising from the formation of global
economic groupings.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day conference, the ministers, who discussed
wide-raging regional and international issues of common concern,
put economic cooperation at the top of their agenda, the first
time since the formation of the grouping in 1969, officials at the
meeting said.
</P>
<P>
Participants held that the level of economic progress attained
by the Islamic world is still much lower than that enjoyed by
Western nations.
</P>
<P>
The world's Muslim countries with a population of over 1
billion or almost a quarter of the world's total are host to 50
percent of the world oil resources, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, these countries account for only 5 percent of
the world's total gross national product.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the OIC foreign ministers' meeting focused attention on
economic cooperation, "but this does not mean that we are ignoring
politics," said Ali Alatas, the meeting's chairman and Indonesian
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"In coming weeks or months, economic cooperation among the OIC
members will make progress," Alatas said at a news conference
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Indonesia to host an OIC ministerial
meeting since the establishment of the organization in 1969 and 49
of the 54 member states attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ministers decided to hold their 25th meeting in Qatar in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Democratic National Construction Association Picks New Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Cheng Siwei, vice-minister of
the chemical industry, was elected the new chairman of the Sixth
Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction
Association here today at the fifth plenary session of the
association's Sixth Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Cheng, also a well-known expert in the chemical industry and
management, said that he will stick to and carry forward the
glorious tradition of his association and try to make new
achievements in fulfilling the party's role of participating in
political and governmental affairs under the system of multi-party
cooperation and consultation led by the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Son of a newspaper tycoon, Cheng returned from Hong Kong alone
in 1951, when he was only 16 years old.
</P>
<P>
After graduating from the East China Institute of Chemical
Engineering in 1956, Cheng began to engage in scientific
studies. Some of his achievements are the most advanced in
the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1981 he went on to study at UCLA in the US and got an MBA
degree. After graduation, he refused offers of employment by some
prestigious US companies and scientific institutions. Instead,
he returned home.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 Cheng was appointed vice-minister of the chemical
industry. Meanwhile, he was also a postgraduate tutor.
</P>
<P>
As a Standing Committee member of the Eighth National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and
vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic
National Construction Association, Cheng took an active part in
political and governmental affairs.
</P>
<P>
His proposal to make science and technology the real primary
productive force was well received and drew attention from related
departments.
</P>
<P>
The China Democratic National Construction Association, which is
one of eight leading non-communist parties in China, was founded
in December 1945. At present, it has nearly 70,000 members,
mainly in the fields of commerce and industry.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Security Foirces on High Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli security forces
have been put on alert for possible attack by Palestinian
militants to mark the anniversary of the death of their chief bomb
maker, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Security officials have beefed up security nationwide to
coincide with the anniversary of the assassination of Yehye Ayyash,
knwon as "the Engineer," who was accused by the Israelis for
planning attacks and building many of the suicide bombs used
against Israelis over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Ayyash, a member of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas),
was assassinated in the Gaza Strip last January, when a mobile
phone he was using exploded.
</P>
<P>
Hamas blamed the Israeli General Security Services were
behind the assassination. Its military wing, Izzedine al Qassam
has vowed to launch attack to mark the anniversary of Ayyash's
death.
</P>
<P>
Among other precautious measures against possible attack, the
Shalom Tower office and shopping center in downtown Tel-Aviv is
being declared a restricted area for drivers wish to pass nearby.
</P>
<P>
Similar measures were taken a few months ago, after
intelligent information received indication that militants were
planning a big spectacular attack in the building.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
told Israel Radio that this time there were no specific
warnings.
</P>
<P>
The precautious measures were taken also in the wake of a
drive-by shooting attack Wednesday in the West Bank, which left a
mother and her son dead, and five other members of the family
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which
opposes the Oslo peace accords between Israel and the
Palestinians, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying the
attack was launched because of Israel's settlement
policies.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM: Israeli Commitment Key to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that future Palestinian-Israeli talks will hinge
on real progress made on the Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron
and Israel's commitment to the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the statement while summing up his meeting with
Dore Gold, advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"All the Israeli proposals presented so far are only designed
to manoeuver the just demands of the Palestinians," the foreign
minister was quoted by the Egyptian Middle East News Agency
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gold, who arrived here Wednesday on a 24-hour visit to Egypt,
held talks with senior Foreign Ministry officials on the latest
developments of Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The visit came at a time of deepening distrust between the two
countries, which have recently engaged in a verbal warfare on the
Hebron issue as well as on the Egyptian role in the regional peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank town of Hebron was
delayed due to Netanyahu's insistence for better safety of the 500
Jewish settlers who live amid 120,000 Arabs in Hebron. Two months
of talks have failed to clinch a deal.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that the recent negative statements from the
Israeli side have dimmed the hopeful signs that talks on Hebron
may be moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moussa emphasized that Israel cannot exclude Egypt
from the Middle East peace process, which was launched in October
1991 in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
In a recent publicity campaign to exclude Egypt from the peace
process in the region, the Israeli newspaper Hatsofeh has accused
Egypt of lining up with the Palestinians and encouraging a
hardline Palestinian stand towards Israel and rejected its active
involvement in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister reiterated his country will
further reactivate its peace role to find a just formula balanced
between the Palestinian and Israeli interests.
</P>
<P>
Moussa planned to make a shuttle tour between the Israelis and
Palestinians to reach an agreement on the issue. But Israel
postponed the visit on the ground of inadequate preparation time.
